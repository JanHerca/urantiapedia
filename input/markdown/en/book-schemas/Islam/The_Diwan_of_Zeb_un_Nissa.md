Zeb-un-Nissa (b. 1637, d. 1702) was the oldest daughter of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir. Her name means 'most beautiful of all women.' A Sufi, she was well educated in both the Quran and the sciences, and was fluent in Arabic, Persian and Urdu. She started to write Persian poetry secretly at the age of 14. She never married, preferring her literary work. Her works included the Diwan, a collection of her poetry, excerpts from which are included in this _Wisdom of the East volume_.
