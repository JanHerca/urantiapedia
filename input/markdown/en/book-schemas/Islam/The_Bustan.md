Be generous to the extent of thy power. If thou hast not dug a well in the desert, at least place a lamp in a shrine.—p. 48

This is a prose translation of the _Bustan_ of Sadi, originally published as part of the _Wisdom of the East_ series in the early 20th century, and long out of print. This little book is full of practical spiritual wisdom. Sadi doesn't lean on allegory as much as other Sufi writers of the period; most of the stories in this collection have a pretty obvious moral lesson.

Born in Shiraz, Iran, in 1184, Sādi (pseudonym of Muslih-ud-Din Mushrif ibn Abdullah) is considered one of the major medieval Persian poets. He traveled widely, through regions of what is today Syria, Turkey, Egypt and Iraq. Vignettes of gritty caravan and street scenes give life to his tales. In old age he returned to Shiraz, and composed his two best-known works, the poetic _Bustan_, or _Orchard_ (in 1257), and the prose [_Gulistan_](/en/book/Islam/The_Gulistan), the _Rose Garden_ (in 1258). He died in 1283 or possibly 1291.
