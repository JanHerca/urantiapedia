The Persian poet Sadi, best known for his poetic collections the [Bustan](/en/book/Islam/The_Bustan) and [Gulistan](/en/book/Islam/The_Gulistan), also wrote this work, the _Pand Namah_, or _Scroll of Wisdom_. This is a small collection of poems on moral themes. Translated by Arthur N. Wollaston, this entry in the _Wisdom of the East_ series is one of the best.
