_Hebraic Literature_ is a very readable collection of Jewish literature, including extracts from the Talmud, Midrash and Kabbalah. The Talmud, the primary source for Jewish religious traditions and laws, could be considered the first hypertext. However, this has prevented its conversion to electronic form, due to its complexity and size. This large compilation of Talmudic extracts will serve to illustrate this rich tradition. The Talmud extracts are sorted by numerical references (with some intervening themes). I have added the chapter breakdown of the Talmud section, without any other alterations.This text is in the public domain (_jbh_).
