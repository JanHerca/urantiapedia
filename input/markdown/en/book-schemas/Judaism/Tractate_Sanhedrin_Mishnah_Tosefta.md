This is a translation of the Talmud tractate Sanhedrin, which deals with judicial procedure, particularly relating to capital punishment. The author is a Christian academic, and the translation includes the primary text (Mishna) and the second-level commentary (Tosefta). This book is a good supplement to the [Rodkinson translation](https://sacred-texts.com/jud/t08/index.htm) of the same tractate, particularly because this version has extensive scholarly apparatus lacking in the Rodkinson translation.
