EXTRACT | Extract
PREFACE | Preface
LECTURE I. DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPTION OF HUMAN PERSONALITY | 1
	1. The sense of personality a gradual growth | 1#p6
	2. Its pre-Christian recognition imperfect | 1#p7
	3. Its final definition due to Christianity | 1#p8
	4. Epochs in its evolution marked by Augustine, Luther, Kant | 1#p14
	5. Personality the gateway of all Euowiedee | 1#p25
LECTURE: II. ANALYSIS OF THE CONCEPTION OF HUMAN PERSONALITY | 2
	1. Characteristics of personality, (1) reason, (2) will, (3) love | 2#p29 
	2. Its unity | 2#p30 
	3. Its identity | 2#p40 
	4. Its reality | 2#p43 
	5. Its spirituality | 2#p45 
	6. Its mystery | 2#p52 
LECTURE III. DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPTION OF DIVINE PERSONALITY | 3
	1. The sense of Divine Personality (1) vague, but (2) universal | 3#p54
	2. It is progressively refined by | #
		(I) Greek Philosophers | 3#p59 
		(2) Hebrew Prophets | 3#p65 
		(3) Christian Fathers | 3#p66 
	3. It culminates in the doctrine of the Trinity | 3#p67 
	4. Belief in a personal God is therefore an instinctive judgement progressively justified by reason | 3#p76 
LECTURE IV. ANALYSIS OF THE CONCEPTION OF DIVINE PERSONALITY | 4
	1. Belief in a Personal God | #
		(1) Primarily instinctive | 4#p81
		(2) Secondarily rational | 4#p82 
	2. Thus the so-called ‘proofs’ are analyses of 	a fundamental instinct | 4#p83 
	3. They are | #
		(1) Cosmological, i.e. argument from a First Cause | 4#p84 
		(2) Teleological, i.e. argument from design in nature | 4#p93 
		(3) Ontological, i.e. argument from the reality of thought | 4#p100 
		(4) Moral, i.e. argument from the sense of freedom, combined with that of obligation | 4#p103 
LECTURE. V. MORAL AFFINITY NEEDFUL FOR THE KNOWLEDGE OF A PERSON | 5
	1. Moral disposition necessary | #
		(1) For pursuit of science | 5#p114
		(2) For knowledge of a friend | 5#p116
	2. Knowledge of God must follow the same analogy, involving | #
		(1) Sincerity | 5#p120 
		(2) Purification | 5#p121
		(3) Penitence | 5#p122 
	3. Conversely, God’s self-revelation must be conditioned by man’s moral and spiritual capacity | 5#p124
	4. This analogy confirmed by ‘personal experience’ of holy men in every age | 5#p132
LECTURE VI. RELIGION IN THE PREHISTORIC PERIOD | 6
	1. Personality implies desire of self-communication | 6#p138
	2. Hence a revelation is antecedently probable | 6#p139 
	3. Analogy points to its being gradual | 6#p140
	4. The ‘antiquity of man’ no obstacle to this belief | 6#p143
	5. The strength of ‘customary’ religion a confirmation of it | 6#p148
	6. Myth a possible vehicle of primitive revelation | 6#p154
	7. Polemical and philosophical views of pagan religion contrasted | 6#p161
LECTURE VII. RELIGION IN PRE-CHRISTIAN HISTORY | 7
	1. The ethnic religions possess ‘notes’ of revelation, e.g | 7#p168
		(1) Their hold upon mankind | 7#p169 
		(2) Their religious books | 7#p170 
		(3) Their belief in inspiration | 7#p171
	2. The Hebrew religion claims a pre-eminent degree of inspiration, and justifies its claim | 7#p173 
		(1) By its contemporary character | 7#p174 
		(2) By its teleological character in relation to Christianity | 7#p175
		(3) By the present influence of its Scriptures | 7#p181
	3. Historical criticism cannot affect inspiration as a fact of experience | 7#p183 
LECTURE VIII. JESUS CHRIST THE DIVINE AND HUMAN PERSON | 8
	1. The Incarnation the crowning proof of Divine Personality | 8#p192
	2. The reasons for Its rejection really a priori | 8#p192 
	3. These rest upon a materialistic conception of human personality which is untenable | 8#p193
	4. The a posterior’ evidences in Its favour invincibly strong | 8#p196 
	5. It involves the doctrine of the Trinity in which our incomplete personality recognizes its archetype | 8#p212
