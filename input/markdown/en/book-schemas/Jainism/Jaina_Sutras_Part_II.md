This is volume 45 of the Sacred Books of the East, Part Two of the Hermann Jacobi translation of the Jaina Sutras.

As is the practice at this site, the typography of the original has been preserved as far as possible. This means that italics are used to indicate distinctions between consonants in transliterated Sanskrit and Prakrit. The system used is documented on the [charts attached to the Sacred Books of the East page](https://archive.sacred-texts.com/sbe/index.htm#conventions). Most notably in this system, ‘j’ (roughly, the initial sound of the English word ‘jam’) is written _g_, hence the spelling _G_ain throughout, which is pronounced ‘Jain.’ This book is normally cited as ‘Jaina Sutras’ in modern publications and bibliographies.
