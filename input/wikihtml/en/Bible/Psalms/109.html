<h1>Psalms - 109</h1>
<p> For the Chief Musicion. A Psalm of David. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise; </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit have they opened against me: They have spoken unto me with a lying tongue. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  They have compassed me about also with words of hatred, And fought against me without a cause. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  For my love they are my adversaries: But I [give myself unto] prayer. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And they have rewarded me evil for good, And hatred for my love. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Set thou a wicked man over him; And let an adversary stand at his right hand. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  When he is judged, let him come forth guilty; And let his prayer be turned into sin. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Let his days be few; [And] let another take his office. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Let his children be fatherless, And his wife a widow. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Let his children be vagabonds, and beg; And let them seek [their bread] out of their desolate places. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; And let strangers make spoil of his labor. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Let there be none to extend kindness unto him; Neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless children. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Let his posterity be cut off; In the generation following let their name be blotted out. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with Jehovah; And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Let them be before Jehovah continually, That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth; </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Because he remembered not to show kindness, But persecuted the poor and needy man, And the broken in heart, to slay [them]. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him; And he delighted not in blessing, and it was far from him. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment, And it came into his inward parts like water, And like oil into his bones. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Let it be unto him as the raiment wherewith he covereth himself, And for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  This is the reward of mine adversaries from Jehovah, And of them that speak evil against my soul. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  But deal thou with me, O Jehovah the Lord, for thy name's sake: Because thy lovingkindness is good, deliver thou me; </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  For I am poor and needy, And my heart is wounded within me. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  My knees are weak through fasting; And my flesh faileth of fatness. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  I am become also a reproach unto them: When they see me, they shake their head. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  Help me, O Jehovah my God; Oh save me according to thy lovingkindness: </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  That they may know that this is thy hand; [That] thou, Jehovah, hast done it. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Let them curse, but bless thou: When they arise, they shall be put to shame, But thy servant shall rejoice. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Let mine adversaries be clothed with dishonor, And let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  I will give great thanks unto Jehovah with my mouth; Yea, I will praise him among the multitude. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  For he will stand at the right hand of the needy, To save him from them that judge his soul. </p>
