<h1>Psalms - 39</h1>
<p> For the Chief Musician, Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I said, I will take heed to my ways, That I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, While the wicked is before me. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; And my sorrow was stirred. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  My heart was hot within me; While I was musing the fire burned: [Then] spake I with my tongue: </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Jehovah, make me to know mine end, And the measure of my days, what it is; Let me know how frail I am. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Behold, thou hast made my days [as] handbreadths; And my life-time is as nothing before thee: Surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity. Selah </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Surely every man walketh in a vain show; Surely they are disquieted in vain: He heapeth up [riches], and knoweth not who shall gather them. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope is in thee. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Deliver me from all my transgressions: Make me not the reproach of the foolish. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; Because thou didst it. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thy hand. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, Thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: Surely every man is vanity. Selah </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, and give ear unto my cry; Hold not thy peace at my tears: For I am a stranger with thee, A sojourner, as all my fathers were. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Oh spare me, that I may recover strength, Before I go hence, and be no more. </p>
