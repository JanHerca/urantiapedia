<h1>Psalms - 104</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Bless Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God, thou art very great; Thou art clothed with honor and majesty: <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain; <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; Who maketh the clouds his chariot; Who walketh upon the wings of the wind; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Who maketh winds his messengers; Flames of fire his ministers; <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Who laid the foundations of the earth, That it should not be moved for ever. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a vesture; The waters stood above the mountains. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  At thy rebuke they fled; At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  (The mountains rose, the valleys sank down) Unto the place which thou hadst founded for them. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; That they turn not again to cover the earth. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  He sendeth forth springs into the valleys; They run among the mountains; </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  They give drink to every beast of the field; The wild asses quench their thirst. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  By them the birds of the heavens have their habitation; They sing among the branches. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  He watereth the mountains from his chambers: The earth is filled with the fruit of thy works. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, And herb for the service of man; That he may bring forth food out of the earth, </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, [And] oil to make his face to shine, And bread that strengtheneth man's heart. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  The trees of Jehovah are filled [with moisture], The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted; </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Where the birds make their nests: As for the stork, the fir-trees are her house. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  The high mountains are for the wild goats; The rocks are a refuge for the conies. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  He appointed the moon for seasons: The sun knoweth his going down. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Thou makest darkness, and it is night, Wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  The young lions roar after their prey, And seek their food from God. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  The sun ariseth, they get them away, And lay them down in their dens. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Man goeth forth unto his work And to his labor until the evening. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  O Jehovah, how manifold are thy works! In wisdom hast thou made them all: The earth is full of thy riches. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Yonder is the sea, great and wide, Wherein are things creeping innumerable, Both small and great beasts. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  There go the ships; There is leviathan, whom thou hast formed to play therein. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  These wait all for thee, That thou mayest give them their food in due season. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  Thou givest unto them, they gather; Thou openest thy hand, they are satisfied with good. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; Thou takest away their breath, they die, And return to their dust. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created; And thou renewest the face of the ground. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Let the glory of Jehovah endure for ever; Let Jehovah rejoice in his works: </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  I will sing unto Jehovah as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have any being. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  Let thy meditation be sweet unto him: I will rejoice in Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  Let sinners be consumed out of the earth. And let the wicked be no more. Bless Jehovah, O my soul. Praise ye Jehovah. </p>
