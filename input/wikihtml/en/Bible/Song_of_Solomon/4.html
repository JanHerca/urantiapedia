<h1>Song of Solomon - 4</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; Thine eyes are [as] doves behind thy veil. Thy hair is as a flock of goats, That lie along the side of mount Gilead. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Thy teeth are like a flock [of ewes] that are [newly] shorn, Which are come up from the washing, Whereof every one hath twins, And none is bereaved among them. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, And thy mouth is comely. Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate Behind thy veil. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armory, Whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, All the shields of the mighty men. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Thy two breasts are like two fawns That are twins of a roe, Which feed among the lilies. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, And to the hill of frankincense. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Thou art all fair, my love; And there is no spot in thee. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Come with me from Lebanon, [my] bride, With me from Lebanon: Look from the top of Amana, From the top of Senir and Hermon, From the lions' dens, From the mountains of the leopards. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, [my] bride; Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, With one chain of thy neck. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  How fair is thy love, my sister, [my] bride! How much better is thy love than wine! And the fragrance of thine oils than all manner of spices! </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Thy lips, O [my] bride, drop [as] the honeycomb: Honey and milk are under thy tongue; And the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  A garden shut up is my sister, [my] bride; A spring shut up, a fountain sealed. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Thy shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits; Henna with spikenard plants, </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Spikenard and saffron, Calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; Myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  [Thou art] a fountain of gardens, A well of living waters, And flowing streams from Lebanon. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; Blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, And eat his precious fruits. </p>
