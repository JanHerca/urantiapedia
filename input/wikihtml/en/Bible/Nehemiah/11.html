<h1>Nehemiah - 11</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the princes of the people dwelt in Jerusalem: the rest of the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts in the [other] cities. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And the people blessed all the men that willingly offered themselves to dwell in Jerusalem. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Now these are the chiefs of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem: but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his possession in their cities, [to wit], Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon's servants. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And in Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin. Of the children of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the children of Perez; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  and Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Colhozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of the Shilonite. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  All the sons of Perez that dwelt in Jerusalem were four hundred threescore and eight valiant men. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And these are the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And after him Gabbai, Sallai, nine hundred twenty and eight. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer; and Judah the son of Hassenuah was second over the city. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Of the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house of God, </p>
