<h1>Acts of the Apostles - 4</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And as they spake unto the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them, </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  being sore troubled because they taught the people, and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And they laid hands on them, and put them in ward unto the morrow: for it was now eventide. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  But many of them that heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  and Annas the high priest [was there], and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, By what power, or in what name, have ye done this? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders, </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  if we this day are examined concerning a good deed done to an impotent man, by what means this man is made whole; </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, [even] in him doth this man stand here before you whole. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  He is the stone which was set at nought of you the builders, which was made the head of the corner. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And in none other is there salvation: for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, wherein we must be saved. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Now when they beheld the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And seeing the man that was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been wrought through them, is manifest to all that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  But that it spread no further among the people, let us threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And they called them, and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken unto you rather than unto God, judge ye: </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  for we cannot but speak the things which we saw and heard. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And they, when they had further threatened them, let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people; for all men glorified God for that which was done. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  For the man was more than forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was wrought. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said unto them. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And they, when they heard it, lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, O Lord, thou that didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is: <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  who by the Holy Spirit, [by] the mouth of our father David thy servant, didst say, Why did the Gentiles rage, And the peoples imagine vain things? <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup> <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  The kings of the earth set themselves in array, And the rulers were gathered together, Against the Lord, and against his Anointed: </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  for of a truth in this city against thy holy Servant Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together, </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  to do whatsoever thy hand and thy council foreordained to come to pass. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness, </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  while thy stretchest forth thy hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy Servant Jesus. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And when they had prayed, the place was shaken wherein they were gathered together; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spake the word of God with boldness. <sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and soul: and not one [of them] said that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common. <sup id="cite9"><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  And with great power gave the apostles their witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all. <sup id="cite10"><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  For neither was there among them any that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  and laid them at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto each, according as any one had need. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  And Joseph, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of exhortation), a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race, </p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  having a field, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet. </p>
