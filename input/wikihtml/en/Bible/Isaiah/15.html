<h1>Isaiah - 15</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  The burden of Moab. For in a night Ar of Moab is laid waste, [and] brought to nought; for in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste, [and] brought to nought. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  They are gone up to Bayith, and to Dibon, to the high places, to weep: Moab waileth over Nebo, and over Medeba; on all their heads is baldness, every beard is cut off. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  In their streets they gird themselves with sackcloth; on their housetops, and in their broad places, every one waileth, weeping abundantly. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And Heshbon crieth out, and Elealeh; their voice is heard even unto Jahaz: therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud; his soul trembleth within him. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  My heart crieth out for Moab; her nobles [flee] unto Zoar, to Eglath-shelishi-yah: for by the ascent of Luhith with weeping they go up; for in the way of Horonaim they raise up a cry of destruction. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate; for the grass is withered away, the tender grass faileth, there is no green thing. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away over the brook of the willows. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the wailing thereof unto Eglaim, and the wailing thereof unto Beer-elim. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; for I will bring yet more upon Dimon, a lion upon them of Moab that escape, and upon the remnant of the land. </p>
