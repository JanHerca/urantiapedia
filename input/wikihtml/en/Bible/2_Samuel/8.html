<h1>2 Samuel - 8</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took the bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the Philistines. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And he smote Moab, and measured them with the line, making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive. And the Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  David smote also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his dominion at the River. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And David took from him a thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David hocked all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadadezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And [Joram] brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  These also did king David dedicate unto Jehovah, with the silver and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued; <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting the Syrians in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand men. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed justice and righteousness unto all his people. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Seraiah was scribe; </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada [was over] the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief ministers. </p>
