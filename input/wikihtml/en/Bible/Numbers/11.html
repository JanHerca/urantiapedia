<h1>Numbers - 11</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the people were as murmurers, [speaking] evil in the ears of Jehovah: and when Jehovah heard it, his anger was kindled; and the fire of Jehovah burnt among them, and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And the people cried unto Moses; and Moses prayed unto Jehovah, and the fire abated. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of Jehovah burnt among them. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And the mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat? </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt for nought; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic: </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all save this manna to look upon. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And the manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  And Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And Moses said unto Jehovah, Wherefore hast thou dealt ill with thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me? </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Have I conceived all this people? have I brought them forth, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father carrieth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers? </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And Jehovah said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with thee. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore Jehovah will give you flesh, and ye shall eat. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days, </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you; because that ye have rejected Jehovah who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt? </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them? </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  And Jehovah said unto Moses, Is Jehovah's hand waxed short? now shalt thou see whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And Moses went out, and told the people the words of Jehovah: and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the Tent. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  And Jehovah came down in the cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did so no more. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but had not gone out unto the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And Moses said unto him, Art thou jealous for my sake? would that all Jehovah's people were prophets, that Jehovah would put his Spirit upon them! </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And there went forth a wind from Jehovah, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day's journey on this side, and a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  And the name of that place was called Kibrothhattaavah, because there they buried the people that lusted. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  From Kibrothhattaavah the people journeyed unto Hazeroth; and they abode at Hazeroth. </p>
