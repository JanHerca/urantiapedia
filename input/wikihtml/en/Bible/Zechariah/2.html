<h1>Zechariah - 2</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, by reason of the multitude of men and cattle therein. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For I, saith Jehovah, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Ho, ho, flee from the land of the north, saith Jehovah; for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, saith Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Ho Zion, escape, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: After glory hath he sent me unto the nations which plundered you; for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those that served them; and ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And many nations shall join themselves to Jehovah in that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts has sent me unto thee. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And Jehovah shall inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and shall yet choose Jerusalem. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Be silent, all flesh, before Jehovah; for he is waked up out of his holy habitation. </p>
