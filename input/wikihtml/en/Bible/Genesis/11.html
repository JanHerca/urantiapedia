<h1>Genesis - 11</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And they said one to another, Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  And they said, Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top [may reach] unto heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And Jehovah said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do: and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  So Jehovah scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off building the city. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because Jehovah did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did Jehovah scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begat Arpachshad two years after the flood. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  and Shem lived after he begat Arpachshad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begat Shelah. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  and Arpachshad lived after he begat Shelah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And Shelah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  and Shelah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  and Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  and Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  and Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  and Nahor lived after he begat Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran begat Lot. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  And Abram and Nahor took them wives: The name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  And Sarai was barren; She had no child. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
