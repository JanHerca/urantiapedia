<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace-offerings; if he offer of the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his oblation, and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting: and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And he shall offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt-offering, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  And if his oblation for a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  If he offer a lamb for his oblation, then shall he offer it before Jehovah; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his oblation, and kill it before the tent of meeting: and Aaron's sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And he shall offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; the fat thereof, the fat tail entire, he shall take away hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire unto Jehovah. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  And if his oblation be a goat, then he shall offer it before Jehovah: </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  and he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tent of meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  And he shall offer thereof his oblation, [even] an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire, for a sweet savor; all the fat is Jehovah's. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that ye shall eat neither fat nor blood. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
