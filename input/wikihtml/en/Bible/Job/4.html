<h1>Job - 4</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  If one assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? But who can withhold himself from speaking? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Behold, thou hast instructed many, And thou hast strengthened the weak hands. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Thy words have upholden him that was falling, And thou hast made firm the feeble knees. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But now it is come unto thee, and thou faintest; It toucheth thee, and thou art troubled. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Is not thy fear [of God] thy confidence, [And] the integrity of thy ways thy hope? </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Remember, I pray thee, who [ever] perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, And sow trouble, reap the same. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  By the breath of God they perish, And by the blast of his anger are they consumed. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, And the teeth of the young lions, are broken. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, And the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Now a thing was secretly brought to me, And mine ear received a whisper thereof. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  In thoughts from the visions of the night, When deep sleep falleth on men, </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Fear came upon me, and trembling, Which made all my bones to shake. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  Then a spirit passed before my face; The hair of my flesh stood up. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance thereof; A form was before mine eyes: [There was] silence, and I heard a voice, [saying], </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his Maker? <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Behold, he putteth no trust in his servants; And his angels he chargeth with folly: </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  How much more them that dwell in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, Who are crushed before the moth! </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Betwixt morning and evening they are destroyed: They perish for ever without any regarding it. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them? They die, and that without wisdom. </p>
