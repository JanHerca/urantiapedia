<h1>Job - 10</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  My soul is weary of my life; I will give free course to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; Show me wherefore thou contendest with me. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, That thou shouldest despise the work of thy hands, And shine upon the counsel of the wicked? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Hast thou eyes of flesh? Or seest thou as man seeth? </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  Are thy days as the days of man, Or thy years as man's days, </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  That thou inquirest after mine iniquity, And searchest after my sin, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Although thou knowest that I am not wicked, And there is none that can deliver out of thy hand? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Thy hands have framed me and fashioned me Together round about; yet thou dost destroy me. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast fashioned me as clay; And wilt thou bring me into dust again? </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Hast thou not poured me out as milk, And curdled me like cheese? </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, And knit me together with bones and sinews. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Thou hast granted me life and lovingkindness; And thy visitation hath preserved my spirit. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Yet these things thou didst hide in thy heart; I know that this is with thee: </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  If I sin, then thou markest me, And thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  If I be wicked, woe unto me; And if I be righteous, yet shall I not lift up my head; Being filled with ignominy, And looking upon mine affliction. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  And if [my head] exalt itself, thou huntest me as a lion; And again thou showest thyself marvellous upon me. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, And increasest thine indignation upon me: Changes and warfare are with me. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Are not my days few? cease then, And let me alone, that I may take comfort a little, </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Before I go whence I shall not return, [Even] to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death; </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  The land dark as midnight, [The land] of the shadow of death, without any order, And where the light is as midnight. </p>
