<h1>Job - 8</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  How long wilt thou speak these things? And [how long] shall the words of thy mouth be [like] a mighty wind? </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Doth God pervert justice? Or doth the Almighty pervert righteousness? </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  If thy children have sinned against him, And he hath delivered them into the hand of their transgression; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  If thou wouldest seek diligently unto God, And make thy supplication to the Almighty; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  If thou wert pure and upright: Surely now he would awake for thee, And make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And though thy beginning was small, Yet thy latter end would greatly increase. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, And apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out: </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, Because our days upon earth are a shadow); </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, And utter words out of their heart? </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Can the rush grow up without mire? Can the flag grow without water? </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Whilst it is yet in its greenness, [and] not cut down, It withereth before any [other] herb. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  So are the paths of all that forget God; And the hope of the godless man shall perish: </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Whose confidence shall break in sunder, And whose trust is a spider's web. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: He shall hold fast thereby, but it shall not endure. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  He is green before the sun, And his shoots go forth over his garden. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  His roots are wrapped about the [stone] -heap, He beholdeth the place of stones. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  If he be destroyed from his place, Then it shall deny him, [saying], I have not seen thee. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Behold, this is the joy of his way; And out of the earth shall others spring. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, Neither will he uphold the evil-doers. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  He will yet fill thy mouth with laughter, And thy lips with shouting. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; And the tent of the wicked shall be no more. </p>
