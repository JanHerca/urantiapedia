<h1>Job - 20</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me, Even by reason of my haste that is in me. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  I have heard the reproof which putteth me to shame; And the spirit of my understanding answereth me. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Knowest thou [not] this of old time, Since man was placed upon earth, </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the godless but for a moment? </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Though his height mount up to the heavens, And his head reach unto the clouds; </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: They that have seen him shall say, Where is he? </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The eye which saw him shall see him no more; Neither shall his place any more behold him. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  His children shall seek the favor of the poor, And his hands shall give back his wealth. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  His bones are full of his youth, But it shall lie down with him in the dust. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, Though he hide it under his tongue, </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Though he spare it, and will not let it go, But keep it still within his mouth; </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Yet his food in his bowels is turned, It is the gall of asps within him. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again; God will cast them out of his belly. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  He shall suck the poison of asps: The viper's tongue shall slay him. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  He shall not look upon the rivers, The flowing streams of honey and butter. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  That which he labored for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down; According to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  For he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor; He hath violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up. </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Because he knew no quietness within him, He shall not save aught of that wherein he delighteth. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  There was nothing left that he devoured not; Therefore his prosperity shall not endure. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: The hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  When he is about to fill his belly, [God] will cast the fierceness of his wrath upon him, And will rain it upon him while he is eating. </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  He shall flee from the iron weapon, And the bow of brass shall strike him through. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  He draweth it forth, and it cometh out of his body; Yea, the glittering point cometh out of his gall: Terrors are upon him. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  All darkness is laid up for his treasures: A fire not blown [by man] shall devour him; It shall consume that which is left in his tent. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, And the earth shall rise up against him. </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  The increase of his house shall depart; [His goods] shall flow away in the day of his wrath. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  This is the portion of a wicked man from God, And the heritage appointed unto him by God. </p>
