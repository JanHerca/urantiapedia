<h1>Job - 33</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear my speech, And hearken to all my words. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Behold now, I have opened my mouth; My tongue hath spoken in my mouth. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  My words [shall utter] the uprightness of my heart; And that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  The Spirit of God hath made me, And the breath of the Almighty giveth me life. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  If thou canst, answer thou me; Set [thy words] in order before me, stand forth. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Behold, I am toward God even as thou art: I also am formed out of the clay. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, Neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, And I have heard the voice of [thy] words, [saying], </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  I am clean, without transgression; I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Behold, he findeth occasions against me, He counteth me for his enemy: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  He putteth my feet in the stocks, He marketh all my paths. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Behold, I will answer thee, in this thou art not just; For God is greater than man. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  Why dost thou strive against him, For that he giveth not account of any of his matters? </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  For God speaketh once, Yea twice, [though man] regardeth it not. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  In a dream, in a vision of the night, When deep sleep falleth upon men, In slumberings upon the bed; </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Then he openeth the ears of men, And sealeth their instruction, </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  That he may withdraw man [from his] purpose, And hide pride from man; </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  He keepeth back his soul from the pit, And his life from perishing by the sword. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, And with continual strife in his bones; </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  So that his life abhorreth bread, And his soul dainty food. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; And his bones that were not seen stick out. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit, And his life to the destroyers. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  If there be with him an angel, An interpreter, one among a thousand, To show unto man what is right for him; </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  Then [God] is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  His flesh shall be fresher than a child's; He returneth to the days of his youth. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  He prayeth unto God, and he is favorable unto him, So that he seeth his face with joy: And he restoreth unto man his righteousness. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  He singeth before men, and saith, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, And it profited me not: <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  He hath redeemed my soul from going into the pit, And my life shall behold the light. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  Lo, all these things doth God work, Twice, [yea] thrice, with a man, </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  To bring back his soul from the pit, That he may be enlightened with the light of the living. </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: Hold thy peace, and I will speak. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  If thou hast anything to say, answer me: Speak, for I desire to justify thee. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  If not, hearken thou unto me: Hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom. </p>
