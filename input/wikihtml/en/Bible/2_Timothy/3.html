<h1>2 Timothy - 3</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  But know this, that in the last days grievous times shall come. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, railers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good, </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  traitors, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power therefore. From these also turn away. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For of these are they that creep into houses, and take captive silly women laden with sins, led away by divers lusts, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And even as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth. Men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  But they shall proceed no further. For their folly shall be evident unto all men, as theirs also came to be. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  But thou didst follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience, </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  persecutions, sufferings. What things befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Yea, and all that would live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  But evil men and impostors shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  But abide thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  And that from a babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  Every scripture inspired of God [is] also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  That the man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every good work. </p>
