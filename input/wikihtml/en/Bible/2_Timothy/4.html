<h1>2 Timothy - 4</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  I charge [thee] in the sight of God, and of Christ Jesus, who shall judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  preach the word; be urgent in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine; but, having itching ears, will heap to themselves teachers after their own lusts; </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside unto fables. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  But be thou sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure is come. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith: <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give to me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all them that have loved his appearing. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Give diligence to come shortly unto me: </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  for Demas forsook me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee; for he is useful to me for ministering. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, bring when thou comest, and the books, especially the parchments. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord will render to him according to his works: </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  of whom do thou also beware; for he greatly withstood our words. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  At my first defence no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the message might me fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. </p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom [be] the glory forever and ever. Amen. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Erastus remained at Corinth: but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick. </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Give diligence to come before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren. </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  The Lord be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. </p>
