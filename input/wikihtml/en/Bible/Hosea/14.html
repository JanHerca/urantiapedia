<h1>Hosea - 14</h1>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  O Israel, return unto Jehovah thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Take with you words, and return unto Jehovah: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and accept that which is good: so will we render [as] bullocks [the offering of] our lips. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Assyria shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses; neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, [Ye are] our gods; for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely; for mine anger is turned away from him. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  I will be as the dew unto Israel; he shall blossom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive-tree, and his smell as Lebanon. </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive [as] the grain, and blossom as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon. </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Ephraim [shall say], What have I to do any more with idols? I have answered, and will regard him: I am like a green fir-tree; from me is thy fruit found. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  Who is wise, that he may understand these things? prudent, that he may know them? for the ways of Jehovah are right, and the just shall walk in them; but transgressors shall fall therein. </p>
