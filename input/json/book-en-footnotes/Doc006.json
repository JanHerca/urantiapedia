In the sequential sense the Universal Father never could have had a first thought, nor could the Eternal Son ever have had a beginning.

We believe the Son sprang from the Father; we are taught that both are unqualifiedly eternal. It is apparent, therefore, that no time creature can ever fully comprehend this mystery of a Son who is derived from the Father, and yet who is co-ordinately eternal with the Father himself."
