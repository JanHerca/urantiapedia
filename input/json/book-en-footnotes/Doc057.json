Water-vapor condensation on the cooling surface of the earth, once begun, continued until it was virtually complete. By the end of this period the ocean was world-wide, covering the entire planet to an average depth of over one mile. The tides were then in play much as they are now observed, but this primitive ocean was not salty; it was practically a fresh-water covering for the world. In those days, most of the chlorine was combined with various metals, but there was enough, in union with hydrogen, to render this water faintly acid."

There was established a better balance between the land extrusion and the heavier ocean bed.

Those falling on the land were largely oxidized, subsequently worn down by erosion, and washed into the ocean basins.
