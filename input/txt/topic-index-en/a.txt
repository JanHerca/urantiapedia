ancestor worship; veneration of ancestry; ancestors | (87:3) | religion | | OK
The advancing ghost cult made ancestor worship inevitable (87:3.1)
The great weakness of ancestor veneration is that it promotes a backward-looking philosophy. (79:8.8)
ancestor worship is based on the belief that the dead punished those who did not follow the rules that they had followed when they they were in the flesh (68:4.3)
Ancestor worshipers view the failure to have sons as the supreme calamity for all time and eternity. (84:7.19)
The great strength in a veneration of ancestry is the value that such an attitude places upon the family. (79:8.9-10)
Later this ritual developed into a pseudo seance at which ghosts were reputed to have appeared. (70:7.15)
During a certain period, solar veneration became a species of ancestor worship. (95:2.7)
in Israel
	Jews tended to overhonor ancestors (140:8.14)
in Europe
	both the Greeks and the Romans favored monogamous marriage. (83:6.3)

	the Ancients of Days are the most powerful and mighty of any of the direct rulers of the time-space creations. (18:3.7)

	They possess individuality and are in personality diverse, but they do not differ from each other as do the Seven Master Spirits. (18:3.2)
	To deduce the will of one of the Gods from a knowledge of the other two, the three Ancients of Days must act together; two would not be able to achieve the answer. (28:4.10)
	The Ancients of Days perfectly deduce the Father’s will by equating the Spirit voice-flash from above and the Michael voice-flashes from below, by reflectivity (28:4.10)
	From their vantage point midway between Paradise and the evolving worlds, these Trinity-origin sovereigns, by reflectivity, see both ways, know both ways, and co-ordinate both ways. (28:4.2) (43:0.1) (116:4.6)

Abodes
	The personal abodes of each trio of the Ancients of Days are located at the point of spiritual polarity on their headquarters sphere. (18:3.6)
	They never personally leave their residential worlds, but then they do not have to, for these worlds are the superuniverse focal points of the far-flung reflectivity system. (18:3.5)
Relationship with mortals
	When mortals of time graduate from the training worlds of a local universe and are advanced to the educational spheres of their superuniverse, they are able to recognize and communicate with the high spiritual rulers, including the Ancients of Days. (18:3.1)
supreme judges
	they are who accredit mortals for Son-fusion when Father-fusion has failed (40:8.3)
	Celestial Guardians are the apprehending agents of the Ancients of Days; they go forth from Uversa to bring back beings whose presence is required before the superuniverse judges; they execute the mandates for the detention of any personality in the superuniverse. (22:9.4)
	in some cases, Ancients of Days flash forth the mandate of advanced standing over the communication circuits to Salvington, and, thus released, the tribunals of the Sovereign of Nebadon will decree the immediate passage of the surviving soul to the resurrection (112:4.12)
	they have never reversed the verdict of a tribunal of Trinity divinity, that is constitutes by a Perfector of Wisdom, seven Divine Counselors, and one Universal Censor (19:3.4)

	Judgment belongs to the Ancients of Days, the rulers of the superuniverse. (53:1.2)
	they do not sit in judgment except in association with the Universal Censors. (19:4.1)
	There is no appeal from the rulings and decisions of the superuniverse authorities since they represent the concurred opinions of the Ancients of Days and that Master Spirit who, from Paradise, presides over the destiny of the superuniverse concerned. (15:12.4)
	they are personifications of Trinity justice-judgment in time and space (19:3.5) (116:4.6)
	the Ancients of Days refuse to annihilate any being until all moral values and all spiritual realities are extinct, both in the evildoer and in all related supporters and possible sympathizers. (54:3.3)
	they seldom execute wrongdoers without a full hearing. (54:5.7)
	Trinitized Custodians, Trinity-embraced seraphim and midwayers, are the officers of the courts of all three divisions, functioning in the tribunals of the Ancients of Days (18:4.5)

Andites; Andite | (78) (80) | Aryans; races | RACE | OK
The Andites were the best all-round human stock to appear on Urantia since the days of Adamites; most skillful and sagacious militarists ever to live on Urantia (78:4.3-6) (80:4.3)
The Andites were a great people, but the crucial factor in determining the course of their civilization was the increasing aridity of Iran, Turkestan, and Sinkiang, which forced them to invent and adopt new and advanced methods of wresting a livelihood from their decreasingly fertile lands. (81:6.4)
they drove Andonites out of Europe (80:9.6-7)
It was the violet race and their Andite successors who first attempted to divorce the mathematical from the volitional. (103:6.10)
These early Andites were not Aryan; they were pre-Aryan. They were not white; they were pre-white. They were neither an Occidental nor an Oriental people. But it is Andite inheritance that gives to the polyglot mixture of the so-called white races that generalized homogeneity which has been called Caucasoid. (78:4.4)
migrations of Andites (79) (80) (78:5-6)
	Mesopotamia and Egipt
		Andites migrated from Mesopotamia to Egipt and settled along the Nile (80:6)
		Five per cent of the Andites, the very superior culture of the coastal district about the mouths of the Tigris and Euphrates who had kept themselves free from intermarriage with the inferior neighboring tribesmen, refused to leave their homes. (78:6.6) (78:8.1)
		The Andites had almost entirely evacuated this region by 6000 B.C. (78:6.7) (80:1.1)
		These early migrations extended over a period of ten thousand years, from 25,000 to 15,000 B.C. (78:3.9)
		Sumerians were the last Andites of Mesopotamia (78:8.1)
	Europe
		they migrated to the Occident (80)
		also they do it in the Orient (79)
		Turkestan was the first destiny before turning around to Europe and the east (79:1)
		Andites poured into Europe and Mediterranean region in a steady stream; there were seven major invasions, the last arrivals coming on horseback in three great waves (80:4,5,7,9) (80:9.9)
		For three thousand years the military headquarters of the northern Andites was in Denmark. (80:5.2)
		Andites were the ancestors of the so-called Nordic races, the forefathers of the Scandinavian, German, and Anglo-Saxon peoples. (80:4.5) (80:9.2)
		The Andites not only migrated to Europe but to northern China and India, while many groups penetrated to the ends of the earth as missionaries, teachers, and traders. (78:5.5)
		they mingled with the remnants of the commingled Saharans and the southern blue men of Europe (80:8.1) (80:9.8)
	India
		some Andites were the so-called Dravidian and later Aryan conquerors of India; and their presence in central Asia greatly upstepped the ancestors of the Turanians. (78:5.6) (79:5.1) (94:1.1)
		Andites were racially obliterated in India (79:2.5-6) (79:3.5)
	Japan and South America
		One hundred and thirty-two of Andites, embarking in a fleet of small boats from Japan, eventually reached South America and by intermarriage with the natives of the Andes established the ancestry of the later rulers of the Incas. (78:5.7) (79:5.9)
	Other
		The North American Indians never came in contact with even the Andite offspring of Adam and Eve (79:5.7)
		Siberian Andonites were assimilated by northen Andites (80:4.2)
influence in the races
	And to every nation to which they journeyed, they contributed humor, art, adventure, music, and manufacture; proclivities toward adventure and exploration;  love, romance, and personal selection in premarital courtship (78:4.5-6) (78:5.8) (80:5.7) (81:3.8) (83:2.5)
	There is real danger in the combination of restlessness, curiosity, adventure, and pleasure-abandon characteristic of the post-Andite races. (84:8.4)
	in races containing Andite inheritance, children are not so placid; these more imaginative and adventurous youths require more training and discipline. (84:7.21)
	the unifying factor in white race is Andite inheritance (81:4.11)
origin
	this race began with the 1570 sons and daughters that Adam impregnated in a group of Nodite women coordinated by Eve (76:4.8)
	the term Andite is used to designate those peoples whose racial inheritance was from one-eighth to one-sixth violet. (78:4.1)
	As they moved westward across the Russian plains, absorbing the best of the blue man and exterminating the worst, they became blended into one people. (80:4.5) (80:5.5-6) (80:8.1) (80:9.11)
	They embraced most of the highest types of the surviving remnants of the Adamite and Nodite races and, later, some of the best strains of the yellow, blue, and green men. (77:3.9) (78:0.1-2) (78:4.1-4)
	the union of Nodites and Adamites caused the renaissance of the Garden and formed the Andites (78:5.1)
traditions
	they had red or blond hair (79:1.8)
	originally they were not cannibalistic, but they were after become grossly admixed with the evolutionary races (89:5.3) (89:6.1)
	The early Andites thought their ghosts returned to the ancestral homelands. (86:4.8)
	they practiced in-marriage a lot (82:5.4)
	they domesticated many animals that were domesticated twice in the past and then were not anymore (81:2.11-12)
	But the horse was the evolutionary factor which determined the dominance of the Andites in the Occident. (80:4.4) (81:2.12)
	they worked metals: bronze, iron, gold, copper (81:3.4)
	Human society would be greatly improved if the civilized races would more generally return to the family-council practices of the Andites. (84:7.29)

	their further migration was blocked by the ice (64:1.1-2)
	During the periods of farthest glacial advance the westernmost of the Andon tribes came very near being driven into the sea. (64:7.17)
	they were driven from the plains of Europe by the blue man and from the river valleys of farther Asia by the expanding yellow race. (78:1.5) (79:6.1)
	By 3000 B.C. increasing aridity drove Andonites into Turkestan, and then to Europe (80:9.6)

The final nuclear remnant of this magnificent nebula still burns with a reddish glow and continues to give forth moderate light and heat to its remnant planetary family of one hundred and sixty-five worlds, which now revolve about this venerable mother of two mighty generations of the monarchs of light. (57:4.9)
875,000,000,000 years ago the enormous Andronover nebula number 876,926 was duly initiated. (57:1.6)

alternate flow of space levels exerts antigravity influence (11:7.9)
Antigravity can annul gravity within a local frame; it does so by the exercise of equal force presence. (9:3.3)
Antigravity is also employed in Havona in the organization of the material functions and the spiritual activities of these enormous worlds. (14:3.6)
It operates only with reference to material gravity, and it is not the action of mind. (9:3.3)
Pervaded space also exerts an antigravity influence upon physical or linear gravity; space can actually neutralize such gravity action even though it cannot delay it. (11:8.3)
prevents gravity from converting all energy into matter. Given a sufficient duration of retarding influence, gravity would eventually convert all energy into matter were it not for two factors: First, because of the antigravity influences of the energy controllers, and second, because organized matter tends to disintegrate under certain conditions. (15:8.5-6,10)
ultimatonic energies sometimes exhibit antigravity behaviour (42:4.10) (42:6.3)

anxiety; anxious; anxieties | | conflict; confusion; doubt | | OK
During the psychologically unsettled times of the twentieth century, amid the economic upheavals, the moral crosscurrents, and the sociologic rip tides of the cyclonic transitions of a scientific era, thousands upon thousands of men and women have become humanly dislocated; they are anxious, restless, fearful, uncertain, and unsettled; as never before in the world’s history they need the consolation and stabilization of sound religion. (99:4.6)
anxiety can induce mystic state confused with Thought Adjuster communion, but it is not the case (100:5.10)
many times we are demoralized by thoughtless panic of dread and anxiety (113:2.5)
Too often, all too often, we mar our minds by insincerity and sear them with unrighteousness; we subject them to animal fear and distort them by useless anxiety. (9:5.7)
Our anxieties and sorrows, our trials and disappointments, are just as much a part of the divine plan on our sphere as are the exquisite perfection and infinite adaptation of all things to their supreme purpose on the worlds of the central and perfect universe. (23:2.12)
much that causes us serious concern often are senselessness (48:4.6)
many of man’s foolish animal fears and childish anxieties thwarts work of Adjuster (108:6.2)

	Jesus said: “Be not constantly overanxious about your common needs. Be not apprehensive concerning the problems of your earthly existence, but in all these things by prayer and supplication, with the spirit of sincere thanksgiving, let your needs be spread out before your Father who is in heaven.” (146:2.16)
	Be not unduly anxious for the morrow. Sufficient for the day is the trouble thereof.” (140:6.13)
	Anxiety must be abandoned. We must be not mindful of those things which foster our anxiety but rather at all times concern ourselves only with doing the will of the Father who is in heaven. (48:7.21) (137:1.6)
	“Be not anxious or worried about the things of the temporal life, what you shall eat, nor yet for your body, what you shall wear.” (165:5.2)
	Jesus did not preach against forethought but anxiety, worry. (140:8.3)
	The gospel of the kingdom provides a such vantage points of high living, that man is able to transcend the material irritations of the lower levels of thinking—worry, jealousy, envy, revenge, and the pride of immature personality. (160:1.6) (160:3.5)
	For Jesus prayer and worship are a way to avoid emotional tension (143:7.3) (196:0.10)
Humor, the cure for anxiety
	thanks to humor we are best able to discount the anxieties of the present in favor of the certainties of the future. (48:4.6)
	While the humor of Urantia is exceedingly crude and most inartistic, it does serve a valuable purpose both as a health insurance and as a liberator of emotional pressure, thus preventing injurious nervous tension and overserious self-contemplation. (48:4.16-19)
	Anxiety was a natural state of the savage mind. (86:2.1)
	When men and women fall victims to excessive anxiety, they are simply reverting to the natural estate of their far-distant ancestors; and when anxiety becomes actually painful, it inhibits activity and unfailingly institutes evolutionary changes and biologic adaptations. (86:2.1)

art; fine arts; arts; Art | | beauty; sculpture | | OK
Art proves that man is not mechanistic, but it does not prove that he is spiritually immortal. Art is mortal morontia, the intervening field between man, the material, and man, the spiritual. Art results from man’s attempt to escape from the lack of beauty in his material environment; it is a gesture toward the morontia level. (195:7.15) (196:3.30)
angels enjoy our efforts in art (38:2.1)
the charm of human art consists in the harmony of its unity (2:7.8)
Civilization is in danger when youth neglect to interest themselves in ethics, sociology, eugenics, philosophy, the fine arts, religion, and cosmology. (111:4.4)
fine arts thrive best in cities supported by an agricultural and industrial population slightly under the land-man ratio (68:6.5)
vanity, pride, ambition and honor gave birth to the first manifestations of all the arts, since these emotions need a social arena where they can be exhibited (68:2.10)
Beauty, art, is largely a matter of the unification of contrasts. (56:10.3-4)

	Andites contributed art to every nation to which they journeyed (78:5.8)
	Evolutionary religion is the mother of the science, art, and philosophy (5:5.5)
	sculpture originated in idol making (92:3.6)
	The making of burial statues led to great improvement in Egyptian art. (95:2.4-5)
	Jews’ had a deep-seated prejudice against images as symbols of idol worship (96:5.5) (142:3.12) (185:1.3)

	On Jerusem is the gigantic art gallery of Satania, one of three enormous structures that adorn the seven circles of courtesy colonies (46:5.30)
value
	art by itself cannot elevate soul or nourish spirit (84:8.4)
	The art of time is dangerous only when it becomes blind to the spirit standards of the divine patterns which eternity reflects as the reality shadows of time. (195:7.16)
	The high mission of any art is, by its illusions, to foreshadow a higher universe reality, to crystallize the emotions of time into the thought of eternity. (48:7.23)
	Through art and philosophy the material-minded man is inveigled into the contemplation of the spiritual realities (5:4.4)
	Art is only religious when it becomes diffused with purpose which has been derived from high spiritual motivation. (101:9.4)

Aryans also were the Hellenic invaders of Greece, and brought along with them anthropomorphic God concepts similar to those which their Aryan fellows had carried to India. The early influence of the Salem teachers was nearly destroyed by this so-called Aryan invasion from southern Europe and the East. (98:1.2)
early Andites were not Aryan; they were pre-Aryan. (78:4.4)
they came to have thirty-three deities (94:1.2-3)
language of Aryans is what gave similarity to Occidental tongues (78:5.3)
Sumerian language was not Semitic; had much in common with Aryan (77:4.7)
Andite migration to the Levant and India from Turkestan occurred due to aridity that forced the Andonites to invade south into Andite territory (78:6.3) (79:1.6)
In India
	The Aryans made very little racial impression on India except in the northern provinces. (79:2.2) (79:4.3)
	These invaders never completed the conquest of the country and subsequently met their undoing in this neglect since their lesser numbers made them vulnerable to absorption by the Dravidians of the south, who subsequently overran the entire peninsula except the Himalayan provinces. (79:4.2)
	they used caste system to save racial identity in the face of a rising tide of the secondary Sangik peoples. (79:4.5,6,9) (94:2.1-2)

the process of ascension
	in the local universe
		The mortal mind initiates its career as a material mechanism and is eventually mustered into the Corps of the Finality as a well-nigh perfected spirit existence, becoming progressively less subject to material gravity and more responsive to spirit gravity. (7:3.2)
		as we ascend inward in the scale of life, will we retain the ability to recognize and fraternize with the fellow beings of our previous and lower levels of experience. (44:0.18-19)
		At each new translation or resurrection we add one more group of spiritual beings to our vision range, which is made possible by the Adjusters. (44:0.18-19)
		As ascendant mortals we are in possession of personal memories of all former and lower existences. (47:4.4-5) (48:4.20)
		On the Salvington spheres we will be evolving from a morontia being to the status of a true spirit; we will be more spiritual than material. (43:9.2)
		The mother influence dominates the human personality throughout the local universe childhood of the growing soul. (117:6.5)
		the new being resulted from Adjuster fusion is of the eternal past as well as for the eternal future. (110:7.4)
		Before departing from their native local universes for the superuniverse receiving worlds, the mortals of time are recipients of spirit confirmation from the Creator Son and the local universe Mother Spirit. (30:4.21)

Ascendington | (13:1.21-23) | sacred spheres of Paradise | PLACE | OK
Ascendington is the seventh world of the seven that make up the Father's circuit immediately surrounding Paradise (13:1.1)
Ascendington is the “bosom of the Father, Son, and Spirit”, the rendezvous of the ascendant creatures of space, the receiving sphere of the pilgrims of time who are passing through the Havona universe on their way to Paradise (13:1.21) (13:2.4)
As finaliters we will be domiciled on Paradise, but Ascendington will be our home address at all times, even when we enter service in outer space. (13:0.6) (13:1.21) (13:2.1-2)
When mortals attain Havona, they are granted clearance for Ascendington, where they are most welcome, but are not permitted to visit the other six sacred worlds. (13:2.6)
Ascendington is projected as the Paradise home world of time creatures of asecension potentital from outer space universes that are in the making (13:2.2)
We mortals will spend most of our Havona “vacations” on Ascendington. (13:1.21)
Fusion is the secret of the sacred sphere of Ascendington, and no creature, save those who have experienced fusion with the spirit of Deity, can comprehend the true meaning of the actual values which are conjoined when the identity of a creature of time becomes eternally one with the spirit of Paradise Deity. (13:1.22) (112:7.2)

ascension plan | | divine plan; education; perfection | | OK
After the life in the flesh, time is no longer available as a technique of dodging situations or of circumventing disagreeable obligations. (48:5.8)
all spirits are devoted to ascension plan (77:9.12)
ascesion plan has been described as:
* bringing God down to man and then, by a sublime sort of partnership, carrying man up to God and on to eternity of service and divinity of attainment (77:9.12)
* elevation and perfection of mortals (7:4.1) (113:0.1)
* graduated opportunity to master universe administration (48:8.2)
* work the way through the long school of Paradise attainment by serving as teachers to those pupils just behind you in the scale of progression (35:4.1) (37:10.5) (55:2.11) (30:3.9)
* the privilege of participating in creating own destiny (54:2.4)
The divine plan of perfection attainment embraces three unique, though marvelously correlated, enterprises of universal adventure: (7:4)
* The Plan of Progressive Attainment (7:4.4)
* The Bestowal Plan (7:4.5)
* The Plan of Mercy Ministry (7:4.6)
The Eternal Son is the personal trustee, the divine custodian, of the Father’s universal plan of creature ascension. (7:4.7)
The spiritual-gravity pull of the Eternal Son constitutes the inherent secret of the Paradise ascension of surviving human souls. (7:3.2)
Father bestowed Adjusters, personality; Son bestowed Creator Sons; Spirit gave mercy ministry of angels (7:4.4-6)
harmony of Uversa testifies to wisdom of ascension plan (15:11.3)
Infinite Spirit has devoted all to the stupendous plan of exalting surviving will creatures to the divine heights of Paradise perfection (8:3.5)
no ascender is deprived of aught essential to his ascension experience (55:2.12)
There are no royal roads, short cuts, or easy paths to Paradise. Irrespective of the individual variations of the route, we master the lessons of one sphere before we proceed to another; at least this is true after we once leave the world of your nativity. (48:5.7)
mortal progression seems to be one of the chief businesses of the present organized universe (4:0.3) (48:8.3)
that some mortals cannot fuse is not a flaw in ascension plan (40:10.3-4)
wisdom of ascension plan is revealed in:
* the perfection of the worlds in light and life (55:6.9)
* by performance of Amadon (67:8.5)
* in that no fused mortals fell in Lucifer rebellion (53:7.10,12)

Asceticism in Buddhism
	Gautama detracted from the practice of seeking individual salvation through physical affliction and personal pain. (94:7.2)

it is only fair to record that many an ancient rich man distributed much of his fortune because of the fear of being killed by those who coveted his treasures. (69:5.14)

assurance; surety; certain; security | | certainty | | OK
Jesus portrayed the profound surety of the God-knowing mortal when he said: “To a God-knowing kingdom believer, what does it matter if all things earthly crash? (100:2.7)
Of God, the most inescapable of all presences, the most real of all facts, the most living of all truths, the most loving of all friends, and the most divine of all values, we have the right to be the most certain of all universe experiences. (102:7)
Jesus gave a great speech about security in the Jerusalem temple during Passover week of the year 27 (142:5)
mortal man assurance of Deity kinship must be faith realized (117:6.8)
The reason of science is based on the observable facts of time; the faith of religion argues from the spirit program of eternity. The more of science we know, the less sure we can be; the more of religion we have, the more certain we are. (102:1)
the assurance of spirit communion develops gradually (34:6.12)
Spiritual assurance is the equivalent of your personal religious experience in the eternal realities of divine truth and is otherwise equal to your intelligent understanding of truth realities plus your spiritual faith and minus your honest doubts. (146:3.4)
Uncertainty with security is the essence of the Paradise adventure—uncertainty in time and in mind, uncertainty as to the events of the unfolding Paradise ascent; security in spirit and in eternity, security in the unqualified trust of the creature son in the divine compassion and infinite love of the Universal Father; uncertainty as an inexperienced citizen of the universe; security as an ascending son in the universe mansions of an all-powerful, all-wise, and all-loving Father. (111:7.1)
security in experience of cosmic citizenship (118:6.8)
To recognize Deity omnipotence is to enjoy security in your experience of cosmic citizenship, to possess assurance of safety in the long journey to Paradise. (194:0.1)
temporal securities are vulnerable; spiritual securities are impregnable (100:2.7)
temporal security is society’s prime gift to man (70:9.1)
One of the characteristic peculiarities of genuine religious assurance is that, notwithstanding the absoluteness of its affirmations and the stanchness of its attitude, the spirit of its expression is so poised and tempered that it never conveys the slightest impression of self-assertion or egoistic exaltation.

terrestrial atmospehere
	the primitive atmosphere which appeared as a result of the internal elemental contest between the heated interior and the cooling crust. (57:7.2)
	terrestrial atmosphere slowly evolving between one billion to one and a half billion years ago (57:7)
	the high degree of carbon in the atmosphere afforded the new land varieties of life opportunity for speedy and luxuriant growth. (58:1.8)
	The elevation of the continents proceeded, and the atmosphere was becoming enriched with oxygen. (59:4.17)
	160 millions years ago the land was largely covered with vegetation adapted to support land-animal life, and the atmosphere had become ideal for animal respiration. (59:6.10)
	Were it not for the “blanketing” effect of the atmosphere at night, heat would be lost by radiation so rapidly that life would be impossible of maintenance except by artificial provision. (58:2.5)
	The height of the earth’s atmosphere is indicated by the highest auroral streamers—about 400 miles. (58:2.6)
	the atmosphere of Urantia thins out increasingly until at about 3,000 miles it begins to shade off into the average space matter in this section of the universe. (42:4.6)

atoms; atomic; atom | | electrons; elements (chemical); mesotrons; neutrons; protons; ultimatons | | OK
the formation of all matter is on the same order: atoms with a nuclear portion and electrons (42:7)
Each atom is a trifle over 1/100,000,000th of an inch in diameter (42:6.7)
the atom is formed like solar system. Surrounding this energy center there whirl, in endless profusion but in fluctuating circuits, the energy units which are faintly comparable to the planets encircling a sun. (42:7.1-2)
When electrons pass from higher to lower energy levels of orbital revolution, quanta are always given off. (42:5.6)
Calcium easily loses its outermost electron and moves the previous one thousands of times between its orbit and that of the lost electron. With these juggling with electrons the atom is able to partially defy gravity and get fired with the emanations of sunlight (41:6.3-4)
Space is not empty; the spheres of all space whirl and plunge on through a vast ocean of outspread force-energy; neither is the space content of an atom empty. (42:5.16) (42:8.1-2)
one drop of ordinary water contains over one billion trillions of atoms. This is the energy of more than one hundred horsepower exerted continuously for two years. (41:7.13)
atomic cohesion
	Atoms and electrons are subject to gravity. (41:9.2)
	gravity is one of several factors concerned in holding together an atom (42:8.1)
	While gravity is one of several factors concerned in holding together a tiny atomic energy system, there is also present in and among these basic physical units a powerful and unknown energy, the secret of their basic constitution and ultimate behavior, a force which remains to be discovered on Urantia. (42:8)
	The charged protons and the uncharged neutrons of the nucleus of the atom are held together by the reciprocating function of the mesotron, a particle of matter 180 times as heavy as the electron. (42:8.3-7)
	atom stability depends on number of inactive neutrons (42:7.6)
	In Orvonton it has never been possible naturally to assemble over one hundred orbital electrons in an atom. With more than 100 electrons instantaneously disrupt occurs (42:7.7)
atom construction and destruction
	annihilation of atoms is principle source of solar energy (41:7.4)
	atoms broken up at 35,000,000°F, the electronic boiling point (41:7.12)
	all of the phenomena of atom building and atom dissolution are attended by the emergence of flood tides of short space rays of radiant energy. (42:5.5) (58:3.1)
	gamma rays characterize spontaneous dissociation of atoms (42:5.1,7)
indeterminacy
	Atoms are similar to persons as to predictability. Statisticians may announce laws governing a large number of either atoms or persons but not for a single individual atom or person. (42:7.10)
	The first twenty-seven atoms, those containing from one to twenty-seven orbital electrons, are more easy of comprehension than the rest. From twenty-eight upward we encounter more and more of the unpredictability of the supposed presence of the Unqualified Absolute. (42:7.10) (42:8.2)
science limits
	Subsequent to greater progress and further discoveries, after we have advanced immeasurably in comparison with present knowledge, though we should gain control of the energy revolutions of the electrical units of matter to the extent of modifying their physical manifestations—even after all such possible progress, forever will scientists be powerless to create one atom of matter or to originate one flash of energy or ever to add to matter that which we call life.

Jesus did not bestow himself to reconcile an angry God (2:5.2) (4:5.6) (98:7.1) (188:4.7)
God certainly would never be satisfied with the childish scheme of substituting an innocent sufferer for a guilty offender (188:4.11)
Father had nothing to do with Jesus’ torture (183:1.1-2) (186:5.2)
Father’s justice not influenced by acts of his creatures (2:3.1)
Father’s love not dependent on bestowals of Avonal and Michael Sons (20:5.2)(186:5.5-9)
The heavenly Father is never torn by conflicting attitudes towards his universe children; God is never a victim of attitudinal antagonisms. (2:4.3)
never necessary to influence Father to be merciful (2:4.2) (6:3.4)
All this concept of atonement and sacrificial salvation is rooted and grounded in selfishness. The believer’s chief concern should not be the selfish desire for personal salvation but rather the unselfish urge to love and, therefore, serve one’s fellows (188:4.9)
The erroneous supposition that the righteousness of God was irreconcilable with the selfless love of the heavenly Father, presupposed absence of unity in the nature of Deity and led directly to the elaboration of the atonement doctrine, which is a philosophic assault upon both the unity and the free-willness of God. (2:6.5-6)
In the more advanced epochs of planetary evolution the seraphim are instrumental in supplanting the atonement idea by the concept of divine attunement as a philosophy of mortal survival. (39:5.6)
history
	the origin of sacrifices as part of worship was the ceremonies of veneration of tribe's animal of Andonics. This idea was elaborated by Moses in the Hebrew ritual (63:6.4)
	When primitive man felt that his communion with God had been interrupted, he resorted to sacrifice of some kind in an effort to make atonement, to restore friendly relationship. (103:4.2)
	The evolution of religious observances progressed from placation, avoidance, exorcism, coercion, conciliation, and propitiation to sacrifice, atonement, and redemption. (90:0.1)
	According to Paul, Christ became the last and all-sufficient human sacrifice; the divine Judge is now fully and forever satisfied. (89:9.3-4)
	These teachings originated in a praiseworthy effort to make the gospel of the kingdom more acceptable to disbelieving Jews. (149:2.3)
	these ideas of atonement introduced by Paul have a Mithraic origin (121:7.10)
	Paul’s theory of original sin, the doctrines of hereditary guilt and innate evil and redemption therefrom, was partially Mithraic in origin, having little in common with Hebrew theology, Philo’s philosophy, or Jesus’ teachings. Some phases of Paul’s teachings regarding original sin and the atonement were original with himself. (121:6.5)
	In this Paul fail to keep pace with Philo. Philo taught deliverance from the doctrine of forgiveness only by the shedding of blood. (121:6.5)
	the life of Jesus, and his death and resurrection, became a new gospel of the ransom paid to purchase man from the clutch of the devil, from the condemnation of an offended God (194:2.8)
	there was an effort to connect the gospel teaching directly onto the Jewish theology, the teaching that Jesus was the sacrificed Son who would satisfy the Father’s stern justice and appease the divine wrath. (149:2.3) (188:5.9,11)
affront to God
	atonement doctrine is incompatible with teachings of Jesus (188:4.8)
	The barbarous idea of appeasing an angry God, of propitiating an offended Lord, of winning the favor of Deity through sacrifices and penance and even by the shedding of blood, represents a religion wholly puerile and primitive, a philosophy unworthy of an enlightened age of science and truth. Such beliefs are utterly repulsive to the celestial beings and the divine rulers who serve and reign in the universes. It is an affront to God to believe, hold, or teach that innocent blood must be shed in order to win his favor or to divert the fictitious divine wrath. (4:5.4-6) (6:3.4)

geology
	Australia rose out of Pacific depths and drifted south (57:8.21) (58:4.3)
	370,000,000 years ago, the great almost total submergence of North and South America occurred, followed by the sinking of Africa and Australia. (59:1.15)
	360,000,000 years ago the land was still rising. The supposed glacial deposits appearing in connection with these strata in Europe, Africa, China, and Australia are due to isolated mountain glaciers or to the displacement of glacial debris of later origin. (59:1.17)
	340,000,000 years ago there occurred another extensive land sinking except in Asia and Australia. (59:2.3)
	280,000,000 years ago the continents had largely emerged. Several layers extend over Canada, portions of South America, Australia (59:3.9)
	the land areas of North and South America, Europe, Africa, northern Asia, and Australia were briefly inundated. Following these submergences, many of the shore lines were considerably elevated (59:4.5,7)
	210,000,000 years ago the warm-water arctic seas covered most of North America and Europe. The south polar waters inundated South America and Australia, (59:5.4)
	A limestone layer was deposited in Australia (60:1.4)
	65,000,000 years ago there occurred one of the greatest lava flows of all time and can be found in Australia (60:3.16)
fauna
	At the time of the Andonic migrations there was a continuous land path from England in the west on through Europe and Asia to Java in the east; but Australia was again isolated, which further accentuated the development of its own peculiar fauna. The ancestors of the later kangaroos roamed Australia. (61:1.9) (64:1.5)
	there were no dinosaurs, elephants, mastodons, or rhinoceroses in Australia (60:2.2) (61:3.6) (61:4.3,4)
aborigin customs
	It was once a general practice for primitive mothers to kill and eat their own children in order to renew the strength lost in childbearing, and in Queensland the first child is still frequently thus killed and devoured. (89:5.4)

There is no division of authority; never is there a cross working of divine power and purpose. (32:4.3)
We must not forget, to understand many events of Jesus life, that authority was the watchword of all Jewry. (173:2.3)

The first created group of Nebadon seraphim were trained by a corps of one thousand seraphim from Avalon; subsequently our angels have been taught by their own seniors. (38:1.2) (38:5.1)
it was Avalon surgeons who transferred life plasma from the body of the Andonite cooperators to that of the members of the corporeal staff of the Planetary Prince (66:2.7) (77:2.6)
