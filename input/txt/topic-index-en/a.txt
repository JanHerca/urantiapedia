The advancing ghost cult made ancestor worship inevitable (87:3.1)
The great weakness of ancestor veneration is that it promotes a backward-looking philosophy. (79:8.8)
ancestor worship is based on the belief that the dead punished those who did not follow the rules that they had followed when they they were in the flesh (68:4.3)
Ancestor worshipers view the failure to have sons as the supreme calamity for all time and eternity. (84:7.19)
The great strength in a veneration of ancestry is the value that such an attitude places upon the family. (79:8.9-10)
Later this ritual developed into a pseudo seance at which ghosts were reputed to have appeared. (70:7.15)
During a certain period, solar veneration became a species of ancestor worship. (95:2.7)

Andes mountains; Andes; Andes Mountains | | | PLACE | OK
During the Mesozoic era, the Andes Mountains began to rise, marking their emergence while most of South America was submerged under the polar sea. This uplift shaped the continent's geology and prevented complete inundation. (59:5.18) (60:2.6) (60:3.4)

Andites; Andite; post-Andite | (78) (80) | Aryans; races | RACE | OK
The Andites were the best all-round human stock to appear on Urantia since the days of Adamites; most skillful and sagacious militarists ever to live on Urantia (78:4.3-6) (80:4.3)
The Andites were a great people, but the crucial factor in determining the course of their civilization was the increasing aridity of Iran, Turkestan, and Sinkiang, which forced them to invent and adopt new and advanced methods of wresting a livelihood from their decreasingly fertile lands. (81:6.4)
they drove Andonites out of Europe (80:9.6-7)
It was the violet race and their Andite successors who first attempted to divorce the mathematical from the volitional. (103:6.10)
These early Andites were not Aryan; they were pre-Aryan. They were not white; they were pre-white. They were neither an Occidental nor an Oriental people. But it is Andite inheritance that gives to the polyglot mixture of the so-called white races that generalized homogeneity which has been called Caucasoid. (78:4.4)
migrations of Andites (79) (80) (78:5-6)
	Mesopotamia and Egipt
		Andites migrated from Mesopotamia to Egipt and settled along the Nile (80:6)
		Five per cent of the Andites, the very superior culture of the coastal district about the mouths of the Tigris and Euphrates who had kept themselves free from intermarriage with the inferior neighboring tribesmen, refused to leave their homes. (78:6.6) (78:8.1)
		The Andites had almost entirely evacuated this region by 6000 B.C. (78:6.7) (80:1.1)
		These early migrations extended over a period of ten thousand years, from 25,000 to 15,000 B.C. (78:3.9)
		Sumerians were the last Andites of Mesopotamia (78:8.1)
	Europe
		they migrated to the Occident (80)
		also they do it in the Orient (79)
		Turkestan was the first destiny before turning around to Europe and the east (79:1)
		Andites poured into Europe and Mediterranean region in a steady stream; there were seven major invasions, the last arrivals coming on horseback in three great waves (80:4) (80:5) (80:7) (80:9.9)
		For three thousand years the military headquarters of the northern Andites was in Denmark. (80:5.2)
		Andites were the ancestors of the so-called Nordic races, the forefathers of the Scandinavian, German, and Anglo-Saxon peoples. (80:4.5) (80:9.2)
		The Andites not only migrated to Europe but to northern China and India, while many groups penetrated to the ends of the earth as missionaries, teachers, and traders. (78:5.5)
		they mingled with the remnants of the commingled Saharans and the southern blue men of Europe (80:8.1) (80:9.8)
	India
		some Andites were the so-called Dravidian and later Aryan conquerors of India; and their presence in central Asia greatly upstepped the ancestors of the Turanians. (78:5.6) (79:5.1) (94:1.1)
		Andites were racially obliterated in India (79:2.5-6) (79:3.5)
	Japan and South America
		One hundred and thirty-two of Andites, embarking in a fleet of small boats from Japan, eventually reached South America and by intermarriage with the natives of the Andes established the ancestry of the later rulers of the Incas. (78:5.7) (79:5.9)
	Other
		The North American Indians never came in contact with even the Andite offspring of Adam and Eve (79:5.7)
		Siberian Andonites were assimilated by northen Andites (80:4.2)
influence in the races
	And to every nation to which they journeyed, they contributed humor, art, adventure, music, and manufacture; proclivities toward adventure and exploration;  love, romance, and personal selection in premarital courtship (78:4.5-6) (78:5.8) (80:5.7) (81:3.8) (83:2.5)
	There is real danger in the combination of restlessness, curiosity, adventure, and pleasure-abandon characteristic of the post-Andite races. (84:8.4)
	in races containing Andite inheritance, children are not so placid; these more imaginative and adventurous youths require more training and discipline. (84:7.21)
	the unifying factor in white race is Andite inheritance (81:4.11)
origin
	this race began with the 1570 sons and daughters that Adam impregnated in a group of Nodite women coordinated by Eve (76:4.8)
	the term Andite is used to designate those peoples whose racial inheritance was from one-eighth to one-sixth violet. (78:4.1)
	As they moved westward across the Russian plains, absorbing the best of the blue man and exterminating the worst, they became blended into one people. (80:4.5) (80:5.5-6) (80:8.1) (80:9.11)
	They embraced most of the highest types of the surviving remnants of the Adamite and Nodite races and, later, some of the best strains of the yellow, blue, and green men. (77:3.9) (78:0.1-2) (78:4.1-4)
	the union of Nodites and Adamites caused the renaissance of the Garden and formed the Andites (78:5.1)
traditions
	they had red or blond hair (79:1.8)
	originally they were not cannibalistic, but they were after become grossly admixed with the evolutionary races (89:5.3) (89:6.1)
	The early Andites thought their ghosts returned to the ancestral homelands. (86:4.8)
	they practiced in-marriage a lot (82:5.4)
	they domesticated many animals that were domesticated twice in the past and then were not anymore (81:2.11-12)
	But the horse was the evolutionary factor which determined the dominance of the Andites in the Occident. (80:4.4) (81:2.12)
	they worked metals: bronze, iron, gold, copper (81:3.4)
	Human society would be greatly improved if the civilized races would more generally return to the family-council practices of the Andites. (84:7.29)

Andonites are the descendants of Andon and Fonta, the parents of humankind, and therefore the first race on Earth
The appearance of the earlier Andonites on Urantia was also something new in Satania. On no other world in the local system has such a race of will creatures evolved in advance of the evolutionary races of color. (64:6.2)
migrations
	the family of Andon and Fonta held together until the twentieth generation, when combined food competition and social friction brought about the beginning of dispersion. (63:3.6) (63:5)
	the better Primate strains were assimilated by Andonites (65:3.4)
	the race retrogressed for 500,000 years after Andon (63:5.7) (63:6.1)
	their further migration was blocked by the ice (64:1.1-2)
	During the periods of farthest glacial advance the westernmost of the Andon tribes came very near being driven into the sea. (64:7.17)
	they were driven from the plains of Europe by the blue man and from the river valleys of farther Asia by the expanding yellow race. (78:1.5) (79:6.1)
	By 3000 B.C. increasing aridity drove Andonites into Turkestan, and then to Europe (80:9.6)
	it was this extensive southward movement of Andonites that diluted the Andites in central Asia nearly to the vanishing point. (79:1.7)
	The earliest race mixtures in India were a blending of the migrating red and yellow races with the aboriginal Andonites. (79:2.2)
	Andonites held northern Pacific islands (79:6.3)
	Andites and Andonites, in considerable numbers, were traversing the pass of Ti Tao and spreading out over the upper valley of the Yellow River (79:7.1)
	The purer Andonites lived in the extreme northern regions of Europe and in Iceland, Greenland, and northeastern North America. (64:7.16)
	a horde of Andonites entered Europe from the north, having come from Siberia by way of the Russian rivers and the Baltic, and they were immediately assimilated by the northern Andite tribes. (80:4.2)
	The Danubians were Andonites, farmers and herders who had entered Europe through the Balkan peninsula and were moving slowly northward by way of the Danube valley. (80:8)
	These descendants of Andon were dispersed through most of the mountainous regions of central and southeastern Europe. (80:8.2)
	The Andonites maintained five or six fairly representative settlements to the north and east of the Adamson headquarters, after Adam (78:1.5)
	they were scattered over Arctic and central Asia in 15,000 B.C. (78:3.7)
	migrated to Iceland, and Greenland (64:7.18)
	Hittites stemmed directly from the Andonite stock (80:8.2)
	Andonites were absorbed in blue and white races (80:0.2) (80:3.2) (80:9.2)
physical characteristics (63:4.1)
	the Andonites had black eyes and a swarthy complexion, something of a cross between yellow and red.
	The Danubians were Andonites, farmers and herders who had entered Europe through the Balkan peninsula and were moving slowly northward by way of the Danube valley. (80:8.4-5)
	they had 36 teeth (65:6.5)
	Lapps and Eskimos are the nearest today's peoples to aboriginal Andonic type (61:6.3) (63:4.1) (65:2.7) (70:1.2) (81:4.9)
	they were not so sensitive to pain nor so reactive to unpleasant situations as were many of the later evolving mortals. (63:4.2)
	they had pale skins and broad-heads (80:8.2) (81:4.2-4)
	reached full maturity at twelve years of age and possessed a potential life span of about seventy-five years. (62:5.3)
practices
	possessed a touching affection for their comrades and certainly had a real, although crude, idea of friendship (63:4.4)
	They were very loyal to their families; they would die without question in defense of their children, but they were not able to grasp the idea of trying to make the world a better place for their grandchildren. (63:4.3)
	all except Badonans practiced human sacrifice (64:3.1)
	they were cliff and grotto dwellers (63:5.4)
	showed great skill in constructing stone sleeping chambers, dome-shaped stone huts, into which they crawled at night (63:5.5)
	they evolved a form of animal worship (63:6.3)
	They were exceedingly imitative, but the play instinct was only slightly developed, and the sense of humor was almost entirely absent. (63:4.2)
	they became highly skillful in the fashioning of flint tools (63:5.6) (64:2.5)
	The Andonites early developed a fear of the elements—thunder, lightning, rain, snow, hail, and ice. (63:6.3)
	The Andonites were fearless and successful hunters and, with the exception of wild berries and certain fruits of the trees, lived exclusively on flesh. (63:5.6)
	They were the first marine adventurers. (64:7.17)
	with the exception of wild berries and certain fruits of the trees, lived exclusively on flesh. (63:5.6)
	The Sangiks were all cannibalistic, but originally the Andonites were not (89:5.3-5) (89:6.1)
	While taboos on twins were once well-nigh universal, they were never a part of the Andonite mores; these peoples always regarded twins as omens of good luck. (68:6.8)
	warfare
		they had constant battles with inferior tribes (63:4.4)
		A thoughtful Andonite who had severely bruised his fist in a serious combat rediscovered the idea of using a long stick for his arm and a piece of hard flint, bound on the end with sinews, for his fist. (68:5.4)
		This early race and its primitive civilization were threatened with extinction by this incessant warfare of the clans. (63:4.7-9)
		Only two things came to occupy the minds of these peoples: hunting to obtain food and fighting to avenge of the neighboring tribes. (63:4.7)
	sexual practices
		some mated with simians (63:1.4)
		the more intelligent groups never entertained the idea of going southward to live among their hairy tree-dwelling cousins of inferior intellect. (64:1.1-2)
		The groups going west became less contaminated with the backward stocks of mutual ancestral origin than those going east, who mingled so freely with their retarded animal cousins. (64:1.7) (85:3.1)
		they mixed with blue races (81:4.2-9)
Religion
	Onagar was truth teacher to Andonites (63:6)
	they taught golden rule (70:1.2)

The final nuclear remnant of this magnificent nebula still burns with a reddish glow and continues to give forth moderate light and heat to its remnant planetary family of one hundred and sixty-five worlds, which now revolve about this venerable mother of two mighty generations of the monarchs of light. (57:4.9)
875,000,000,000 years ago the enormous Andronover nebula number 876,926 was duly initiated. (57:1.6)
It was scarcely a million years subsequent to this epoch that Michael of Nebadon, a Creator Son of Paradise, selected this disintegrating nebula as the site of his adventure in universe building. (57:3.8-9)

alternate flow of space levels exerts antigravity influence (11:7.9)
Antigravity can annul gravity within a local frame; it does so by the exercise of equal force presence. (9:3.3)
Antigravity is also employed in Havona in the organization of the material functions and the spiritual activities of these enormous worlds. (14:3.6)
It operates only with reference to material gravity, and it is not the action of mind. (9:3.3)
Pervaded space also exerts an antigravity influence upon physical or linear gravity; space can actually neutralize such gravity action even though it cannot delay it. (11:8.3)
prevents gravity from converting all energy into matter. Given a sufficient duration of retarding influence, gravity would eventually convert all energy into matter were it not for two factors: First, because of the antigravity influences of the energy controllers, and second, because organized matter tends to disintegrate under certain conditions. (15:8.5-6,10)

anxiety; anxious; anxieties; Anxiety | | conflict; confusion; doubt | | OK
During the psychologically unsettled times of the twentieth century, amid the economic upheavals, the moral crosscurrents, and the sociologic rip tides of the cyclonic transitions of a scientific era, thousands upon thousands of men and women have become humanly dislocated; they are anxious, restless, fearful, uncertain, and unsettled; as never before in the world’s history they need the consolation and stabilization of sound religion. (99:4.6)
anxiety can induce mystic state confused with Thought Adjuster communion, but it is not the case (100:5.10)
many times we are demoralized by thoughtless panic of dread and anxiety (113:2.5)
Too often, all too often, we mar our minds by insincerity and sear them with unrighteousness; we subject them to animal fear and distort them by useless anxiety. (9:5.7)
Our anxieties and sorrows, our trials and disappointments, are just as much a part of the divine plan on our sphere as are the exquisite perfection and infinite adaptation of all things to their supreme purpose on the worlds of the central and perfect universe. (23:2.12)
much that causes us serious concern often are senselessness (48:4.6)
many of man’s foolish animal fears and childish anxieties thwarts work of Adjuster (108:6.2)
Jesus
	Jesus said: “Be not constantly overanxious about your common needs. Be not apprehensive concerning the problems of your earthly existence, but in all these things by prayer and supplication, with the spirit of sincere thanksgiving, let your needs be spread out before your Father who is in heaven.” (146:2.16)
	Be not unduly anxious for the morrow. Sufficient for the day is the trouble thereof.” (140:6.13)
	Anxiety must be abandoned. We must be not mindful of those things which foster our anxiety but rather at all times concern ourselves only with doing the will of the Father who is in heaven. (48:7.21) (137:1.6)
	Be not anxious or worried about the things of the temporal life, what you shall eat, nor yet for your body, what you shall wear. (165:5.2)
	Jesus did not preach against forethought but anxiety, worry. (140:8.3)
	The gospel of the kingdom provides a such vantage points of high living, that man is able to transcend the material irritations of the lower levels of thinking—worry, jealousy, envy, revenge, and the pride of immature personality. (160:1.6) (160:3.5)
	For Jesus prayer and worship are a way to avoid emotional tension (143:7.3) (196:0.10)
Humor, the cure for anxiety
	thanks to humor we are best able to discount the anxieties of the present in favor of the certainties of the future. (48:4.6)
	While the humor of Urantia is exceedingly crude and most inartistic, it does serve a valuable purpose both as a health insurance and as a liberator of emotional pressure, thus preventing injurious nervous tension and overserious self-contemplation. (48:4.16-19)
	Anxiety was a natural state of the savage mind. (86:2.1)
	When men and women fall victims to excessive anxiety, they are simply reverting to the natural estate of their far-distant ancestors; and when anxiety becomes actually painful, it inhibits activity and unfailingly institutes evolutionary changes and biologic adaptations. (86:2.1)

Art proves that man is not mechanistic, but it does not prove that he is spiritually immortal. Art is mortal morontia, the intervening field between man, the material, and man, the spiritual. Art results from man’s attempt to escape from the lack of beauty in his material environment; it is a gesture toward the morontia level. (195:7.15) (196:3.30)

the charm of human art consists in the harmony of its unity (2:7.8)
Civilization is in danger when youth neglect to interest themselves in ethics, sociology, eugenics, philosophy, the fine arts, religion, and cosmology. (111:4.4)
fine arts thrive best in cities supported by an agricultural and industrial population slightly under the land-man ratio (68:6.5)
vanity, pride, ambition and honor gave birth to the first manifestations of all the arts, since these emotions need a social arena where they can be exhibited (68:2.10)

	art by itself cannot elevate soul or nourish spirit (84:8.4)
	The art of time is dangerous only when it becomes blind to the spirit standards of the divine patterns which eternity reflects as the reality shadows of time. (195:7.16)
	The high mission of any art is, by its illusions, to foreshadow a higher universe reality, to crystallize the emotions of time into the thought of eternity. (48:7.23)
	Through art and philosophy the material-minded man is inveigled into the contemplation of the spiritual realities (5:4.4)
	Art is only religious when it becomes diffused with purpose which has been derived from high spiritual motivation. (101:9.4)

the process of ascension

		The mortal mind initiates its career as a material mechanism and is eventually mustered into the Corps of the Finality as a well-nigh perfected spirit existence, becoming progressively less subject to material gravity and more responsive to spirit gravity. (7:3.2)

Ascendington | (13:1.21-23) | sacred spheres of Paradise | PLACE | OK
Ascendington is the seventh world of the seven that make up the Father's circuit immediately surrounding Paradise (13:1.1)
Ascendington is the “bosom of the Father, Son, and Spirit”, the rendezvous of the ascendant creatures of space, the receiving sphere of the pilgrims of time who are passing through the Havona universe on their way to Paradise (13:1.21) (13:2.4)
As finaliters we will be domiciled on Paradise, but Ascendington will be our home address at all times, even when we enter service in outer space. (13:0.6) (13:1.21) (13:2.1-2)
When mortals attain Havona, they are granted clearance for Ascendington, where they are most welcome, but are not permitted to visit the other six sacred worlds. (13:2.6)
Ascendington is projected as the Paradise home world of time creatures of asecension potentital from outer space universes that are in the making (13:2.2)
We mortals will spend most of our Havona “vacations” on Ascendington. (13:1.21)
Fusion is the secret of the sacred sphere of Ascendington, and no creature, save those who have experienced fusion with the spirit of Deity, can comprehend the true meaning of the actual values which are conjoined when the identity of a creature of time becomes eternally one with the spirit of Paradise Deity.

After the life in the flesh, time is no longer available as a technique of dodging situations or of circumventing disagreeable obligations. (48:5.8)
all spirits are devoted to ascension plan (77:9.12)
ascesion plan has been described as:
* bringing God down to man and then, by a sublime sort of partnership, carrying man up to God and on to eternity of service and divinity of attainment (77:9.12)
* elevation and perfection of mortals (7:4.1) (113:0.1)
* graduated opportunity to master universe administration (48:8.2)
* work the way through the long school of Paradise attainment by serving as teachers to those pupils just behind you in the scale of progression (35:4.1) (37:10.5) (55:2.11) (30:3.9)
* the privilege of participating in creating own destiny (54:2.4)
The divine plan of perfection attainment embraces three unique, though marvelously correlated, enterprises of universal adventure: (7:4)
* The Plan of Progressive Attainment (7:4.4)
* The Bestowal Plan (7:4.5)
* The Plan of Mercy Ministry (7:4.6)
The Eternal Son is the personal trustee, the divine custodian, of the Father’s universal plan of creature ascension. (7:4.7)
The spiritual-gravity pull of the Eternal Son constitutes the inherent secret of the Paradise ascension of surviving human souls. (7:3.2)
Father bestowed Adjusters, personality; Son bestowed Creator Sons; Spirit gave mercy ministry of angels (7:4.4-6)
harmony of Uversa testifies to wisdom of ascension plan (15:11.3)
Infinite Spirit has devoted all to the stupendous plan of exalting surviving will creatures to the divine heights of Paradise perfection (8:3.5)
no ascender is deprived of aught essential to his ascension experience (55:2.12)

mortal progression seems to be one of the chief businesses of the present organized universe (4:0.3) (48:8.3)
that some mortals cannot fuse is not a flaw in ascension plan (40:10.3-4)
wisdom of ascension plan is revealed in:
* the perfection of the worlds in light and life (55:6.9)
* by performance of Amadon (67:8.5)
* in that no fused mortals fell in Lucifer rebellion (53:7.10,12)

Jesus gave a great speech about security in the Jerusalem temple during Passover week of the year 27 (142:5)
mortal man assurance of Deity kinship must be faith realized (117:6.8)
The reason of science is based on the observable facts of time; the faith of religion argues from the spirit program of eternity. The more of science we know, the less sure we can be; the more of religion we have, the more certain we are. (102:1)

Spiritual assurance is the equivalent of your personal religious experience in the eternal realities of divine truth and is otherwise equal to your intelligent understanding of truth realities plus your spiritual faith and minus your honest doubts. (146:3.4)
Uncertainty with security is the essence of the Paradise adventure—uncertainty in time and in mind, uncertainty as to the events of the unfolding Paradise ascent; security in spirit and in eternity, security in the unqualified trust of the creature son in the divine compassion and infinite love of the Universal Father; uncertainty as an inexperienced citizen of the universe; security as an ascending son in the universe mansions of an all-powerful, all-wise, and all-loving Father.

temporal security is society’s prime gift to man (70:9.1)
One of the characteristic peculiarities of genuine religious assurance is that, notwithstanding the absoluteness of its affirmations and the stanchness of its attitude, the spirit of its expression is so poised and tempered that it never conveys the slightest impression of self-assertion or egoistic exaltation.

Each atom is a trifle over 1/100,000,000th of an inch in diameter (42:6.7)
the atom is formed like solar system. Surrounding this energy center there whirl, in endless profusion but in fluctuating circuits, the energy units which are faintly comparable to the planets encircling a sun. (42:7.1-2)
When electrons pass from higher to lower energy levels of orbital revolution, quanta are always given off. (42:5.6)
Calcium easily loses its outermost electron and moves the previous one thousands of times between its orbit and that of the lost electron. With these juggling with electrons the atom is able to partially defy gravity and get fired with the emanations of sunlight (41:6.3-4)
Space is not empty; the spheres of all space whirl and plunge on through a vast ocean of outspread force-energy; neither is the space content of an atom empty. (42:5.16) (42:8.1-2)
one drop of ordinary water contains over one billion trillions of atoms. This is the energy of more than one hundred horsepower exerted continuously for two years. (41:7.13)
atomic cohesion
	Atoms and electrons are subject to gravity. (41:9.2)
	gravity is one of several factors concerned in holding together an atom (42:8.1)
	While gravity is one of several factors concerned in holding together a tiny atomic energy system, there is also present in and among these basic physical units a powerful and unknown energy, the secret of their basic constitution and ultimate behavior, a force which remains to be discovered on Urantia. (42:8)
	The charged protons and the uncharged neutrons of the nucleus of the atom are held together by the reciprocating function of the mesotron, a particle of matter 180 times as heavy as the electron. (42:8.3-7)
	atom stability depends on number of inactive neutrons (42:7.6)
	In Orvonton it has never been possible naturally to assemble over one hundred orbital electrons in an atom. With more than 100 electrons instantaneously disrupt occurs (42:7.7)
atom construction and destruction
	annihilation of atoms is principle source of solar energy (41:7.4)
	atoms broken up at 35,000,000°F, the electronic boiling point (41:7.12)
	all of the phenomena of atom building and atom dissolution are attended by the emergence of flood tides of short space rays of radiant energy. (42:5.5) (58:3.1)
	gamma rays characterize spontaneous dissociation of atoms (42:5.1,7)
indeterminacy
	Atoms are similar to persons as to predictability. Statisticians may announce laws governing a large number of either atoms or persons but not for a single individual atom or person. (42:7.10)
	The first twenty-seven atoms, those containing from one to twenty-seven orbital electrons, are more easy of comprehension than the rest. From twenty-eight upward we encounter more and more of the unpredictability of the supposed presence of the Unqualified Absolute. (42:7.10) (42:8.2)
science limits
	Subsequent to greater progress and further discoveries, after we have advanced immeasurably in comparison with present knowledge, though we should gain control of the energy revolutions of the electrical units of matter to the extent of modifying their physical manifestations—even after all such possible progress, forever will scientists be powerless to create one atom of matter or to originate one flash of energy or ever to add to matter that which we call life.

atonement doctrine; atonement; doctrine of atonement; doctrines of redemption | (186:5) | crucifixion; devil; forgiveness; Jesus:death; redemption | | OK
all atonement doctrine is an erroneous teaching (20:6.6-7) (148:4.7-10) (188:4-5)
Jesus did not bestow himself to reconcile an angry God (2:5.2) (4:5.6) (98:7.1) (188:4.7)
God certainly would never be satisfied with the childish scheme of substituting an innocent sufferer for a guilty offender (188:4.11)
Father had nothing to do with Jesus’ torture (183:1.1-2) (186:5.2)
Father’s justice not influenced by acts of his creatures (2:3.1)
Father’s love not dependent on bestowals of Avonal and Michael Sons (20:5.2) (186:5.5-9)
The heavenly Father is never torn by conflicting attitudes towards his universe children; God is never a victim of attitudinal antagonisms. (2:4.3)
never necessary to influence Father to be merciful (2:4.2) (6:3.4)
All this concept of atonement and sacrificial salvation is rooted and grounded in selfishness. The believer’s chief concern should not be the selfish desire for personal salvation but rather the unselfish urge to love and, therefore, serve one’s fellows (188:4.9)
The erroneous supposition that the righteousness of God was irreconcilable with the selfless love of the heavenly Father, presupposed absence of unity in the nature of Deity and led directly to the elaboration of the atonement doctrine, which is a philosophic assault upon both the unity and the free-willness of God. (2:6.5-6)
In the more advanced epochs of planetary evolution the seraphim are instrumental in supplanting the atonement idea by the concept of divine attunement as a philosophy of mortal survival. (39:5.6)
history
	the origin of sacrifices as part of worship was the ceremonies of veneration of tribe's animal of Andonics. This idea was elaborated by Moses in the Hebrew ritual (63:6.4)
	When primitive man felt that his communion with God had been interrupted, he resorted to sacrifice of some kind in an effort to make atonement, to restore friendly relationship. (103:4.2)
	The evolution of religious observances progressed from placation, avoidance, exorcism, coercion, conciliation, and propitiation to sacrifice, atonement, and redemption. (90:0.1)
	According to Paul, Christ became the last and all-sufficient human sacrifice; the divine Judge is now fully and forever satisfied. (89:9.3-4)
	These teachings originated in a praiseworthy effort to make the gospel of the kingdom more acceptable to disbelieving Jews. (149:2.3)
	these ideas of atonement introduced by Paul have a Mithraic origin (121:7.10)
	Paul’s theory of original sin, the doctrines of hereditary guilt and innate evil and redemption therefrom, was partially Mithraic in origin, having little in common with Hebrew theology, Philo’s philosophy, or Jesus’ teachings. Some phases of Paul’s teachings regarding original sin and the atonement were original with himself. (121:6.5)
	In this Paul fail to keep pace with Philo. Philo taught deliverance from the doctrine of forgiveness only by the shedding of blood. (121:6.5)
	the life of Jesus, and his death and resurrection, became a new gospel of the ransom paid to purchase man from the clutch of the devil, from the condemnation of an offended God (194:2.8)
	there was an effort to connect the gospel teaching directly onto the Jewish theology, the teaching that Jesus was the sacrificed Son who would satisfy the Father’s stern justice and appease the divine wrath. (149:2.3) (188:5.9,11)
affront to God
	atonement doctrine is incompatible with teachings of Jesus (188:4.8)
	The barbarous idea of appeasing an angry God, of propitiating an offended Lord, of winning the favor of Deity through sacrifices and penance and even by the shedding of blood, represents a religion wholly puerile and primitive, a philosophy unworthy of an enlightened age of science and truth. Such beliefs are utterly repulsive to the celestial beings and the divine rulers who serve and reign in the universes. It is an affront to God to believe, hold, or teach that innocent blood must be shed in order to win his favor or to divert the fictitious divine wrath. (4:5.4-6) (6:3.4)

geology
	Australia rose out of Pacific depths and drifted south (57:8.21) (58:4.3)
	370,000,000 years ago, the great almost total submergence of North and South America occurred, followed by the sinking of Africa and Australia. (59:1.15)
	360,000,000 years ago the land was still rising. The supposed glacial deposits appearing in connection with these strata in Europe, Africa, China, and Australia are due to isolated mountain glaciers or to the displacement of glacial debris of later origin. (59:1.17)
	340,000,000 years ago there occurred another extensive land sinking except in Asia and Australia. (59:2.3)
	280,000,000 years ago the continents had largely emerged. Several layers extend over Canada, portions of South America, Australia (59:3.9)
	the land areas of North and South America, Europe, Africa, northern Asia, and Australia were briefly inundated. Following these submergences, many of the shore lines were considerably elevated (59:4.5,7)
	210,000,000 years ago the warm-water arctic seas covered most of North America and Europe. The south polar waters inundated South America and Australia, (59:5.4)
	A limestone layer was deposited in Australia (60:1.4)
	65,000,000 years ago there occurred one of the greatest lava flows of all time and can be found in Australia (60:3.16)
fauna
	At the time of the Andonic migrations there was a continuous land path from England in the west on through Europe and Asia to Java in the east; but Australia was again isolated, which further accentuated the development of its own peculiar fauna. The ancestors of the later kangaroos roamed Australia. (61:1.9) (64:1.5)
	there were no dinosaurs, elephants, mastodons, or rhinoceroses in Australia (60:2.2) (61:3.6) (61:4.3,4)
aborigin customs
	It was once a general practice for primitive mothers to kill and eat their own children in order to renew the strength lost in childbearing, and in Queensland the first child is still frequently thus killed and devoured. (89:5.4)

Caligastia had tendency to be restless under authority, to mildly resent all forms of supervision (66:8.1)
A Divine Counselor speaks with unchallengeable authority. He has enjoyed many times the supreme pleasure of a sojourn in the immediate personal presence of the Universal Father, and he knows whereof he speaks (1:7.9) (6:8.8)
Jesus spoke with undoubted confidence and taught with absolute authority. (100:7.5)
There is no division of authority; never is there a cross working of divine power and purpose. (32:4.3)
We must not forget, to understand many events of Jesus life, that authority was the watchword of all Jewry. (173:2.3)

Avalon | | | PLACE | OK
Avalon is one of Nebadon's neighboring local universes, along with Henselon, Sanselon, Portalon, Wolvering, Fanoving, and Alvoring. (32:2.12)
Following the Lucifer rebellion the affairs of Urantia have long been administered by a council of planetary receivers and an advisory council which included a Brilliant Evening Star from Avalon who came periodically (67:6.5)
The first created group of Nebadon seraphim were trained by a corps of one thousand seraphim from Avalon; subsequently our angels have been taught by their own seniors. (38:1.2) (38:5.1)
it was Avalon surgeons who transferred life plasma from the body of the Andonite cooperators to that of the members of the corporeal staff of the Planetary Prince (66:2.7) (77:2.6)
In Urantia popular culture Avalon is the name of a legendary mythological island
