Galilee | | Palestine; Sea of Galilee | PLACE | OK
The Galileans were not regarded with full favor by the Jerusalem religious leaders and rabbinical teachers. Galilee was more gentile than Jewish when Jesus was born. (121:2.12)

Modern survivals of this proclivity for casting lots are illustrated, not only in the many games of chance, but also in the well-known “counting-out” rhymes. Once, the person counted out must die; now, he is only it in some childish game. (90:2.4)

The Dravidian centers of culture were located in the river valleys, principally of the Indus and Ganges, and in the Deccan along the three great rivers flowing through the Eastern Ghats to the sea. (79:3.6)
On the Gangetic plain Aryan and Dravidian eventually mingled to produce a high culture, and this center was later reinforced by contributions from the northeast, coming from China. (79:4.4)

Garden of Eden; garden; Garden | | Adam; Gardens of Eden; second garden | PLACE | OK
The Garden of Eden is the second world center of civilization to project onto a normal planet, after the headquarters city of the Planetary Prince. A great planetary university of culture destined to endure forever (51:6.1-3)
When an Adam and Eve begin their sojourn on an evolutionary world, their place of abode is often called the Garden of Eden because it is characterized by the floral beauty and the botanic grandeur of Edentia, the constellation capital. (39:5.3) (51:3.2) (73:4.1)
preparation
	After three years the site commission selected three candidates: an island in the Persian Gulf, the river site on the Euphrates that later became the Second Garden, and a long, narrow peninsula, almost an island, projecting westward from the shores of the eastern Mediterranean Sea. The third was chosen. (73:2.3) (73:3.1) (76:1.3)
	The Garden was prepared by 3000 volunteers recruited by Van and Amadon (73:2.3)
	it was built 37,000 years ago (51:6.3)
	to establish the garden the existing residents were evicted (73:3.2) (73:4)
	The architectural plans for Eden provided homes and abundant land for one million human beings. (73:5.1)
physical description (73:5)
	The coast line of this land mass was considerably elevated, and the neck connecting with the mainland was only twenty-seven miles wide at the narrowest point.  (73:3.4)
	At the time of Adam’s arrival, though the Garden was only one-fourth finished, it had thousands of miles of irrigation ditches and more than twelve thousand miles of paved paths and roads. (73:5.2)
	A zoological garden was created by building a smaller wall just outside the main wall; the intervening space, occupied by all manner of wild beasts, served as an additional defense against hostile attacks. (73:4.3)
	a brick wall across the neck of the peninsula was built (73:4.2-3)
	This Mediterranean peninsula had a salubrious climate and an equable temperature; this stabilized weather was due to the encircling mountains and to the fact that this area was virtually an island in an inland sea. (73:3.3-6)
	The mountains surrounding the Garden abounded in precious stones and metals, though these received very little attention. (73:3.5)
	there was a mount, inaugural mount, from which Adam spoke (74:2.5) (74:3.5) (74:4.4)
	The site chosen for the Garden was probably the most beautiful spot of its kind in all the world, and the climate was then ideal. (73:3.6) (73:5.8) (73:7.1) (74:3.4)
	The sanitary arrangements of the Garden were far in advance of anything that had been attempted theretofore on Urantia. The drinking water of Eden was kept wholesome (73:5.3-4)
life in the Garden
	Adam discouraged animal sacrifice in the Garden (76:2.3)
	no animals ever slaughtered in Garden of Eden (73:4.1) (76:2.3)
	In the early days, the violet race remains relatively segregated but they receive suitable candidates from the races of the world. (51:6.1)
	life in the Garden of Eden was far from utopian (68:1.7)
Edenites
	There were 1200 loyal Edenites at time of Adan and Eve default (75:6.2)
	The Garden dwellers had been in contact with the Nodites since the early days of Eden. From these mixed descendants of the defaulting members of Caligastia’s staff they had received much valuable help and co-operation (75:2.5) (75:3.5) (77:4.1)
	The children of Adam, except for four years’ attendance at the western schools, lived and worked in the “east of Eden.” They were trained intellectually until they were sixteen in accordance with the methods of the Jerusem schools. From sixteen to twenty they were taught in the Urantia schools at the other end of the Garden, serving there also as teachers in the lower grades. (74:7)
	When word had reached the dwellers in the land of the second garden that the king and high priest of the Garden of Eden was marching on them, they had fled in haste to the eastern mountains and left the territory vacated for Edenites (76:1)
	When Adam elected to leave the first garden to the Nodites unopposed, he and his followers could not go west, for the Edenites had no boats suitable for such a marine adventure. (76:0.1)
	The Edenic ideal of family was the whole family as gardeners (84:7.8)
	the tongue of Garden of Eden was Andonic dialect as spoken by Amadon (74:2.2)
	Edenites massacred nearby Nodites upon learning of Eve’s folly with Cano (75:5.3)
	they practiced scrupulous burial of all waste (73:5.4)
	When Eden was disrupted, there were over one hundred primitive manufacturing plants in operation, and extensive trade relations with the near-by tribes had been established. (74:5.3)
destiny
	after default of Adam and Eve, Adam abandoned the Garden to Nodites and caravanned to the second garden (75:6) (76:0.1)
	After the first garden was vacated by Adam, it was occupied variously by the Nodites, Cutites, and the Suntites. It later became the dwelling place of the northern Nodites (73:7.1)
	4,000 years after the departure of Adam and eve, due to the violent activity of the surrounding volcanoes and the submergence of the Sicilian land bridge to Africa, the eastern floor of the Mediterranean Sea sank, carrying down beneath the waters the whole of the Garden of Eden (73:7.1-2) (78:7.7)
teachings
	The teachings of Adam and Eve constituted the second epochal revelation (92:4.6)
	7 commandments of Eden were definite taboos, expressed in the same negative form as were the most ancient prohibitions (89:1.4)
	the aborted teachings of Adam were carried on by the Sethite priests, and some of these truths have never been entirely lost to the world. (92:4.6)
	The laws of the Garden were based on the older codes of Dalamatia and were promulgated under seven heads: (74:7.12-20)
	# The laws of health and sanitation.
	# The social regulations of the Garden.
	# The code of trade and commerce.
	# The laws of fair play and competition.
	# The laws of home life.
	# The civil codes of the golden rule.
	# The seven commands of supreme moral rule.

(74:8.3)

genetics; genetic; Genetic | | eugenics; handicaps; hybridization; races | | OK
Hybridization makes for species improvement because of the role of the dominant genes. Racial intermixture increases the likelihood of a larger number of the desirable dominants being present in the hybrid. (82:6.7)
importance of genetic inheritance
	genetics underlies all ability and all character (44:8.2) (76:2.6)
	certain gland's chemistry influences inherent imagination and spiritual receptivity (49:5.19)
	mortals differ in innate endowments and acquired qualities (69:3.8) (70:8.1) (100:7.8)
	While inherited urges cannot be fundamentally modified, emotional responses to such urges can be changed; therefore the moral nature can be modified, character can be improved. (140:4.8)
	The play and humor of the present-day races are largely derived from the Adamic stock. (74:6.7)
	Religious experience is markedly influenced by physical health, inherited temperament, and social environment. (100:1.6)
	Religion is the mighty lever that lifts civilization from chaos, but it is powerless apart from the fulcrum of sound and normal mind resting securely on sound and normal heredity. (70:8.18)
	While a good environment cannot contribute much toward really overcoming the character handicaps of a base heredity, a bad environment can very effectively spoil an excellent inheritance, at least during the younger years of life. (76:2.6)
	It often requires ages upon ages to recoup the damage occasioned by the loss of a single superior strain of human heredity. (49:1.7)
genetics at heavens
	morontia life removes all genetic handicaps (44:8.3) (109:5.5)
	Limitations of intellect, curtailment of education, deprivation of culture, impoverishment of social status, even inferiority of the human standards of morality resulting from the unfortunate lack of educational, cultural, and social advantages, cannot invalidate the presence of the divine spirit in such unfortunate and humanly handicapped but believing individuals. (5:1.4-7) (5:5.13-14)
genetic evolution
	On Urantia the endeavors of the Life Carriers to improve the Satania life patterns necessarily resulted in the production of many apparently useless forms of transition life. (65:4.10-12)
	The process of planetary evolution is orderly and controlled. The selected and superior strains of living protoplasm are jealously and intelligently guarded when once they make their appearance. (49:1.7)
	The sudden appearance of new species and diversified orders of living organisms is wholly biologic, strictly natural. There is nothing supernatural connected with these genetic mutations (58:6.4)
	each generation now tends to eliminate from the reproductive stream of the race those individuals in whom parental instinct is insufficiently strong to insure the procreation of children, the prospective parents of the next generation. (84:7.7)
historically
	there was exactly 70 generations between dawn mammals and mid-mammals (61:6.1) (62:2.6)
	Between primitive tribes, family feuds increased, tribal wars broke out, and serious losses were sustained among the very best elements of the more able and advanced groups. Some of these losses were irreparable; some of the most valuable strains of ability and intelligence were forever lost to the world. This early race and its primitive civilization were threatened with extinction by this incessant warfare of the clans. (63:4.8)
	chromosomes on Prince’s staff are reorganized more after the patterns of the standardized Satania specialization by powerful life-maintenance circuits of the Satania system (77:2.2,5)
	The one hundred asistants of Caligastia taught selective animal breeding to mankind (66:5.4)
	tremendous gains resulted from the small amount of the blood of the violet race which the evolutionary peoples incidentally secured. (48:4.13,17) (52:3.6) (74:7.23) | Andites
	The northern Chinese received just enough of the Andite strain to mildly stimulate their innately able minds but not enough to fire them with the restless, exploratory curiosity so characteristic of the northern white races. (79:6.7) (79:7.3)
	Abraham arrived in an expected generation by the Melchizedek receivers (93:5.3)
	Moses’ unusual versatility and adaptability was derived from mixed ancestry. His mother was egyptian and his father was semitic. (96:3.1)

Primitive man could not distinguish between genius and insanity; idiots were either beaten to death or revered as fetish personalities. (88:1.9)
Many people looked upon geniuses as fetish personalities possessed by a wise spirit. (88:1.10)
every civilization is limited by available natural resources, inherent genius, and sufficient leisure to insure inventive fruition (78:2.4)
In a religious genius, strong spiritual faith so many times leads directly to disastrous fanaticism, to exaggeration of the religious ego, but it was not so with Jesus. (196:0.6)
Jesus’ advice regarding disposition of wealth was: “If you chance to secure wealth by flights of genius, if your riches are derived from the rewards of inventive endowment, do not lay claim to an unfair portion of such rewards. The genius owes something to both his ancestors and his progeny; likewise is he under obligation to the race, nation, and circumstances of his inventive discoveries” (132:5.8,20)
the flight of genius is neutralized by the gravity of mediocrity (111:7.5)
The normal man should be fostered; he is the backbone of civilization and the source of the mutant geniuses of the race. (68:6.11)
genius and creative originality are very much fostered in the main continental nation of a closer inhabited planet (72:6.7) (72:7.1)

	 In Galilee the Jews mingled more freely with the gentiles than was their practice in Judea. (123:5.7)
	The gentiles were, from a moral standpoint, somewhat inferior to the Jews, but there was present in the hearts of the nobler gentiles abundant soil of natural goodness and potential human affection (121:4.1) 
	Morality among the gentiles was not necessarily related to either philosophy or religion. Outside of Palestine it not always occurred to people that a priest of religion was supposed to lead a moral life. (121:5.17)

geology | | fossils; geologic ages; rocks and minerals | | OK
The alternate periods of land and sea dominance have occurred in million-year cycles. There has been an agelong rhythm associated with this rise and fall of ocean floor and continental land levels. And these same rhythmical crustal movements will continue from this time on throughout the earth’s history but with diminishing frequency and extent. (60:4.1)
The early crust of the earth was in a state of continual flux. Surface cooling alternated with immense lava flows. Nowhere can there be found on the surface of the world anything of this original planetary crust. It has all been mixed up too many times with extruding lavas of deep origins and admixed with subsequent deposits of the early world-wide ocean. (57:8.11) (58:7.1,6)

ghosts; ghost; Ghost; Ghosts; superghost | (87) | | | OK
The ghost cult evolved as an offset to the hazards of bad luck; its primitive religious observances were the outgrowth of anxiety about bad luck and of the inordinate fear of the dead. (87:0.1)
Many early peoples associated ghosts with the sea; hence virgins were greatly restricted in their bathing practices; young women were far more afraid of bathing in the sea at high tide than of having sex relations. (84:1.4)
Man inherited a natural environment, acquired a social environment, and imagined a ghost environment. The state is man’s reaction to his natural environment, the home to his social environment, the church to his illusory ghost environment. (86:6)
The most primitive idea of the human soul, the ghost, was derived from the breath-dream idea-system. (86:4.3)
Moses persistently sought to uproot the remnants of the ghost cult among his people, even prescribing the death penalty for its practitioners. (92:5.11)
fear of ghosts
	The dread of the ghosts of the dead brought to light a new and amazing form of fear, an appalling and powerful terror, which contributed to whipping the loose social orders of early ages into the more thoroughly disciplined and better controlled primitive groups of ancient times. (68:3.3)
	Primitive desires produced the original society, but ghost fear held it together and imparted an extrahuman aspect to its existence. (68:2.4,6) (68:3.1,4) (68:4.3)
	Ghost fear drove primitive man to envision the supernatural and thus securely laid the foundations for those powerful social influences of ethics and religion which in turn preserved inviolate the mores and customs of society from generation to generation. Ghost fear was the fountainhead of all world religion; and for ages many tribes clung to the old belief in one class of ghosts. (68:4.3) (87:1) (87:4.1)
	prepared the minds of men, through superstitious fear of the unreal and the supernatural, for the later discovery of “the fear of the Lord which is the beginning of wisdom. ” (68:3.3)
	produced dread of being alone (84:7.17)
	The savage lived in fear of the ghosts of his fellows and spent his spare time planning for the safe conduct of his own ghost after death. (87:3.3)
	it was a senseless superstition (68:3.3)
nature and activities of ghosts
	It was very early believed that ghosts administered justice through the medicine men and priests; this constituted these orders the first crime detectors and officers of the law. (70:10.5)
	It was once thought that the great desire of a ghost was to be quickly “laid” so that it might proceed undisturbed to deadland. Any error was believed to be displeasing to the ghost, and an angered ghost was supposed to be a source of calamity, misfortune, and unhappiness. (87:2.2)
	The earliest hypothesis advanced in explanation of disease and death was that spirits caused disease by enticing the soul out of the body; if it failed to return, death ensued. (90:3.4)
	Though the savage credited ghosts with supernatural powers, he hardly conceived of them as having supernatural intelligence. (87:1.2-5)
	Primitive man viewed the spirits and ghosts as having almost unlimited rights but no duties; the spirits were thought to regard man as having manifold duties but no rights. (87:5.1)
	Ghosts wanted wives and servants; a well-to-do savage expected that at least one slave wife would be buried alive at his death. (87:2.7)
	And this belief in the existence of disembodied spirits or ghosts seemed to explain the occurrence of the unusual, the extraordinary, the infrequent, and the inexplicable. (86:4.4)
	Ghosts were supposed to be disturbed and frightened by noise; shouting, bells, and drums drove them away from the living; and these ancient methods are still in vogue at “wakes” for the dead. (87:6.11)
	Still later the imagination of man envisioned the concept of both good and bad supernatural agencies; some ghosts never evolved to the level of good spirits. When the doctrine of good and bad spirits finally matured, it became the most widespread and persistent of all religious beliefs. Man’s early philosophy was able to reconcile spirit constancy with the vicissitudes of temporal fortune only by postulating two kinds of spirits, one good and the other bad. (87:4)
	It was the general belief of mankind that ghosts levied a continuous tribute of service as the price of noninterference in human affairs, and the least mischance was laid to ghost activities. (87:5.1)
	It was a supposed preference of ghosts to indwell some object which had belonged to them when alive in the flesh. (88:2.1)
	The one thing which early established and crystallized the mores was the belief that the dead were jealous of the ways by which they had lived and died; therefore would they visit dire punishment upon those living mortals who dared to treat with careless disdain the rules of living which they had honored when in the flesh.  (68:4.3)
	Fasting and other forms of self-denial were thought to be pleasing to the ghosts, who took pleasure in the discomfort of the living during the transition period of lurking about before their actual departure for deadland. (87:2.4) (89:0.2)
influence in religion
	In religion the negative program of ghost placation long preceded the positive program of spirit coercion and supplication. (87:2.1)
	None of early religions had much to do with the recognition of Deity or with reverence for the superhuman; their rites were mostly negative, designed to avoid, expel, or coerce ghosts. (87:0.1)
	Eventually the savage conceived of himself as a double—body and breath. The breath minus the body equaled a spirit, a ghost. (86:4.4)
	shamans howled away ghosts responsible for disease (90:4.3)
	All primitive tribes, except those little above animals, have developed some concept of the soul. (86:5)
	Jesus further explained to his apostles that the spirits of departed human beings do not come back to the world of their origin to communicate with their living fellows. (112:3.7) (146:7.2) (150:3.5)
	Man’s first efforts at defense were directed against the ghosts. As the ages passed, the living began to devise methods of resisting the dead. Many techniques were developed for frightening ghosts and driving them away (87:1.2,5) (87:6.3-10)
	From age to age and from generation to generation, race after race has sought to improve this superghost doctrine, but no generation has ever yet dared to wholly reject it. (87:5.8)
	superstition of ghosts in the dream still persists today (68:3.3)
	The ghost gods, who are of supposed human origin, should be distinguished from the nature gods, for nature worship did evolve a pantheon—nature spirits elevated to the position of gods. (85:6.4)

Accumulations of wealth early became the badge of social distinction. Even modern peoples revel in the lavish distribution of Christmas gifts, while rich men endow great institutions of philanthropy and learning. (69:5.13)
Salvation is the gift of God, and righteousness is the natural fruit of the spirit-born life of sonship in the kingdom.

	What we begin in time we will assuredly finish in eternity—if it is worth finishing. (111:3.7)
	the ideal human estate is that in which philosophy, religion, and science are welded into a meaningful unity by the conjoined action of wisdom, faith, and experience. (98:2.12)
	If we yield to the leadings of the spiritual forces in us and around us, you cannot fail to attain the high destiny established by a loving God as the universe goal of his ascendant creatures from the evolutionary worlds of space. (5:1.12)
	Man’s true destiny consists in the creation of new and spirit goals and then in responding to the cosmic allurements of such supernal goals of nonmaterial value. (12:9.1)
	Urantia mortals can hardly hope to be perfect in the infinite sense, but it is entirely possible for human beings, starting out as they do on this planet, to attain the supernal and divine goal which the infinite God has set for mortal man; and when they do achieve this destiny, they will, in all that pertains to self-realization and mind attainment, be just as replete in their sphere of divine perfection as God himself is in his sphere of infinity and eternity. (1:0.5)
	Goals, that which the enlightened and reflective human imagination of spiritual teaching and leading wholeheartedly and unselfishly wants to do and be, becomes measurably creative in accordance with the degree of mortal dedication to the divine doing of the Father’s will. (132:7.9)
	the highest happiness is linked with the intelligent and enthusiastic pursuit of worthy goals, and that such achievements constitute true progress in cosmic self-realization. (94:8.17)
	the life purpose must be jealously guarded from the temptation to seek for easy and transient attainment; likewise must it be so fostered as to become immune to the disastrous threats of fanaticism. (160:3.5)
	Religion pays any price essential to the attainment of the supreme goal, the eternal prize. (100:3.1)
	In Havona the ascending pilgrims discover what true study and real mental effort mean as they begin to discern the nature of the still-more-taxing and far-more-arduous spiritual exertion that will be required to meet the demands of the high goal set for their achievement on the worlds of this circuit. (26:7.1)
	“With God all things are possible; the eternal Creator is the cause of causes.” (2:1.2) (3:2.2) (26:5.3) (107:4.7) (131:10.2) (163:3.2) (182:3.2)
	work is important, the self is not (48:6.37)
value of goals
	God the Father deals with man his child on the basis, not of actual virtue or worthiness, but in recognition of the child’s motivation—the creature purpose and intent. (103:4.5)
	Without a worthy goal, life becomes aimless and unprofitable, and much unhappiness results. (140:4.9)
	While the attainment of each ascendant goal is a factual achievement, in the larger sense such goals are simply milestones on the long ascending path to Paradise. (39:4.7)
	divinely watered souls are all but independent of material environment as regards the joys of living and the satisfactions of earthly existence. They are spiritually illuminated and refreshed, morally strengthened and endowed. (34:6.8)
	The only goals worth striving for are divine, spiritual, and eternal. (100:2.6) (170:2.6)
	an animal becomes able to examine the different ways of attaining a goal and to select an approach based on accumulated experience. But a personality can also examine the goal itself and pass judgment on its worth-whileness, its value. (16:7.2-4)
	Goals rather than creeds should unify religionists. (99:5.7)
	Our spiritual destiny is conditioned only by our spiritual longings and purposes. (156:5.9)
supreme goals
	This is a list of the supreme goals that are before human beings:
	* achieving perfection | perfection
	* arrive to Ascendington, the ultimate status sphere (13:0.6)
	* attainment of Supreme Being, and then God the Ultimate (0:7.10) (0:9.1)
	* The great goal of human existence is to attune to the divinity of the indwelling Adjuster; the great achievement of mortal life is the attainment of a true and understanding consecration to the eternal aims of the divine spirit who waits and works within your mind. (110:3.4)
	* becoming a finaliter (14:6.39)
	* the social achievement of the brotherhood of man and the personal status of God-consciousness (71:4.15) (143:1.4)
	* consecration to Father’s will and loyalty to Creator Son (20:1.14)
	* ever-ascending mobilization and perfecting unification of reality in association with Paradise reality (0:7.10)
	* exploring infinity of Universal Father (14:6.40)
	* fighting battle of reality’s triumph over partial shadows (101:10.9)
	* finding God and becoming like him (1:0.3) (132:3.7)
	* finding God on Paradise (5:1.2,12) (11:9.8) (14:2.8) (48:8.1)
	* the goal of the ages: God, rest, and then eternity of perfected service (24:6.1)
	* the final attainment of the perfection of faith and service, that experience wherein we shall be “filled with all the fullness of God” (34:6.10)
	* Service—more service, increased service, difficult service, adventurous service, and at last divine and perfect service—is the goal of time and the destination of space. (28:6.17)
	* The goal of existence of all personalities is spirit; material manifestations are relative, and the cosmic mind intervenes between these universal opposites. (12:8.13) (16:4.6)
	* trinitization, for some (13:1.13)
	* The eternal quest is for unification, for divine coherence. (2:7.7)
	* Wisdom is the goal of a purely mental and moral existence. (36:5.12)
	In a continually changing world, in the midst of an evolving social order, it is impossible to maintain settled and established goals of destiny. Stability of personality can be experienced only by those who have discovered and embraced the living God as the eternal goal of infinite attainment. And thus to transfer one’s goal from time to eternity, from earth to Paradise, from the human to the divine, requires that man shall become regenerated, converted, be born again; that he shall become the re-created child of the divine spirit; that he shall gain entrance into the brotherhood of the kingdom of heaven. (160:1.14)

in God's relationship with the local universes it seems that he withdraws from the activity in favor of the created beings and Creators of him, but there is also a real, literal and personal participation on God's part (32:4)
God functions not only in parental capacities, but also in non-Father capacities such as God's relationships of force, energy, power, causality, reaction, potentiality, actuality, gravity, tension, the archetype, the principle and the unit (104:2.6)

consciousness of God (0:2.2) (5:2) (8:5) | spiritual communion
	God consciousness is best discovered in communion with the Adjuster (5:2.3)
	for Amenemope it was the determining factor in all conduct (95:4.2)
	The experience of God consciousness remains the same from generation to generation (5:5.12)
	God-consciousness must consist of mind-consciousness — understanding of the idea of God, soul-consciousness — understanding of the ideal of God, and spirit-consciousness — understanding of the spiritual reality of God. The unification of these understandings gives an understanding of the personality of God (5:5.11)
	God consciousness is indispensable for true progress (94:6.12) (100:3.6)
	it is the inevitable result of consecration to the will of the Father (5:1.6)
	God consciousness is equivalent to the integration of the self in the universe and in its highest levels of spiritual reality (196:3.35)
	The secret of the incomparable religious life of Jesus was the awareness of the presence of God (196:0.10)

	No human language possesses a word that can be used to designate that “sensation,” “feeling,” “intuition,” or “experience” that we have chosen to call God-consciousness (103:1.6)
	God consciousness is the ultimate achievement of the human mind (71:7.13)
	we can attain the perfection of God consciousness (1:0.5)
	presence of God
		the presence of God is most discerned when fraternizing with the Adjuster, and an example of this attunement is the fruits of the spirit and the desire to do the will of the Father (5:2.4-6) (71:4.15)
		the degree of God's presence in a part of the universe is determined by mass loyalty to God (3:1.10-11) (13:4.3-5)
		The mind presence of Deity is determined by the depth of individual intellectual experience and by the evolutionary level of the personality, by the spiritual capacity of receptivity and by the degree of consecration to doing the divine will (5:2.1)
		the Master Spirits act so that the spiritual presence of the Deities is differential (13:4.3)
		The factor that determines the differential of the spiritual presence exists in our own heart and in our own mind. The spirit of divinity thus becomes humbly obedient to our choices (13:4.5)
		Social consciousness is not inalienable like God consciousness (16:9.4)
		It is not so important to know the fact of God, as to develop more and more the ability to feel the presence of God (155:6.12)
		living as if in the presence of God favors spiritual growth (100:1.8)
		man is seldom aware of God's presence (5:2.4,5)
		the consciousness of God is more real than the consciousness that the neighbor exists (16:9.4)

gold; Gold; gold-bearing | | | | OK
Gold was the first metal to be sought by man; it was easy to work and, at first, was used only as an ornament. (81:3.4-5)
They traveled far and wide in search of flint, much as present-day humans journey to the ends of the earth in quest of gold, platinum, and diamonds. (63:5.6)
gold was the product of lava flows in Sierras (60:3.3)
Every creature child may truly say: “He knows the way I take, and when he has tried me, I shall come forth as gold.” (3:3.2)

golden age | | | | OK
The modern phrase, “back to nature,” is a delusion of ignorance, a belief in the reality of the onetime fictitious “golden age.” The only basis for the legend of the golden age is the historic fact of Dalamatia and Eden. But these improved societies were far from the realization of utopian dreams. But this ideas were discouraging since they were predicated upon a belief in retrogression rather than progression, as well as implying a vengeful Deity (68:1.7) (74:8.13-14)
The tradition of Adam and the Garden of Eden also lent substance to the dream of a onetime “golden age” of the dawn of the races. (89:2.3)
the truth is that the early experiences of the human race were characterized by terrible antisocial conditions (81:5.4)
times of Onagar were, indeed, the golden age for primitive man (63:6.9)
ages of light and life that will come to Urantia in a distant future will be truly golden ages (50:5.10) | light and life

golden calves; golden calf | | | RELIGION | OK
Moses always was he plagued by the awkward predicament of trying to present his new and higher idea of Deity to these ignorant slaves under the guise of the ancient term Yahweh, which had always been symbolized by the golden calf of the Bedouin tribes. (96:4.3)
the silver and golden calves symbolized the Bedouin herders’ concept of the spirit of the Sinai volcano (96:1.12) (96:5.8)

golden rule | (52:5.8) (101:8.4) | commandments | | OK
The “golden rulers” may establish a progressive society in which they live according to their ideals while maintaining an adequate defense against their benighted fellows who might seek either to exploit their pacific predilections or to destroy their advancing civilization. (71:4.16-17)
The Andonites were early taught the golden rule, and, even today, their Eskimo descendants live very much by that code; custom is strong among them, and they are fairly free from violent antagonisms. (70:1.2)
the golden rule was taught in Garden of Eden (74:7.5,18)
Jesus golden rule was based on infinite worth of finite (196:2.10)
The golden rule of human fairness cries out against all such fraud, unfairness, selfishness, and unrighteousness. (54:1.8)
there are two levels of the golden rule: the brotherly love and fatherly love (140:5.1) (147:4)
The golden rule, when literally interpreted, may become the instrument of great offense to one’s fellows. (180:5.5)
The worship of insects and other animals was promoted by a later misinterpretation of the golden rule—doing to others (every form of life) as you would be done by. (85:3.4)
Evolutionary religion drives home to the individual the idea of personal duty; revealed religion lays increasing emphasis on loving, the golden rule. (101:5.11)
living the golden rule
	ethical and moral beings can learn to live the golden rule (50:5.8)
	The golden rule as restated by Jesus demands active social contact; the older negative rule could be obeyed in isolation. (140:10.5) (159:5.16) (178:1.12)
	Only moral beings will ever seek for that spiritual insight which is essential to living the golden rule. (52:6.5)
	the golden rule can only be comprehended by living them, by realizing their meanings in the living interpretation of the Spirit of Truth, who directs the loving contact of one human being with another. (180:5.11)
statements of the golden rule
	* man achieves the beginnings of spiritual brotherhood when he elects to mete out to them that treatment which he himself would be accorded, even that treatment which he conceives that God would accord them (118:8.10)
	* do unto others as you would have them do unto you (131:2.11) (131:3.6) (131:4.6) (131:9.4) (131:10.7)
	* the first commandment is: have love for the father, the head of the family, and the second commandment is: have a mutual love between the children, love your brother as yourself (142:7.4) (163:4.8)
	* love fellows as Jesus loved us (147:4.9) (180:5.5-11)

goodness; good; Good; Goodness | | truth, beauty, and goodness | | OK
Divinity is creature comprehensible as truth, beauty, and goodness; correlated in personality as love, mercy, and ministry; disclosed on impersonal levels as justice, power, and sovereignty. (0:1.17)
“We know that all things work together for good to those who love God,” “for the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers. (4:1.4,11) (10:7.5-6) (48:4.7) (54:4.7) (67:7.8) (67:8.4) (94:6.4) (118:10.18) (182:2.1) | providence
our Father in heaven permits the good and the evil to go along together until the end of life, just as nature allows the wheat and the tares to grow side by side until the harvest. (4:2.6) (130:1.5-6) (132:2) (159:5.10)
The idealization and attempted service of truth, beauty, and goodness is not a substitute for genuine religious experience—spiritual reality. (196:3.23)
we must base life on highest consciousness of truth, beauty, and goodness (110:3.7)
While it is all too true that good cannot come of evil to the one who contemplates and performs evil, it is equally true that all things (including evil, potential and manifest) work together for good to all beings who know God, love to do his will, and are ascending Paradiseward according to his eternal plan and divine purpose. (54:4.7)
The concepts of truth, beauty, and goodness are not inherent in either physics or chemistry. (195:6.11)
The understandings of truth, beauty, and goodness, morality, ethics, duty, love, divinity, origin, existence, purpose, destiny, time, space, even Deity, are only relatively true. (115:1.2)
Until we attain Paradise levels, goodness will always be more of a quest than a possession, more of a goal than an experience of attainment. (132:2.8)
defined as
	Good is the carrying out of the divine plans (75:4.3)
	truth, beauty, and goodness represent finite maximums of ideational experience. (102:3.15) (117:1.7)
	goodness is one of the fruits of the spirit (34:6.13) (193:2.2)
	Socrates and his successors, Plato and Aristotle, taught that virtue is knowledge; goodness, health of the soul (98:2.6)
	Goodness, like truth, is always relative and unfailingly evil-contrasted. It is always growing toward new levels. Goodness is living, relative, always progressing, invariably a personal experience, and everlastingly correlated with the discernment of truth and beauty. (132:2.3-7)
	it is man’s effort to discern God in spirit (56:10.2)
	it is the nearness to divinity. Goodness is the mental recognition of the relative values of the diverse levels of divine perfection (3:6.2) (56:10.12)
	truth, beauty, and goodness embrace the revelation of Deity to the realms of time and space. Goodness embraces the sense of ethics, morality, and religion—experiential perfection-hunger. (56:10.9-10)
	Divine goodness is more fully shown forth in the loving ministry of the manifold personalities of the Infinite Spirit. (56:10.17-18)
	Truth is coherent, beauty attractive, goodness stabilizing. (2:7.12)
	The concept of truth might possibly be entertained apart from personality, the concept of beauty may exist without personality, but the concept of divine goodness is understandable only in relation to personality. (1:7.3)
	In so far as man’s evolving morontia soul becomes permeated by truth, beauty, and goodness as the value-realization of God-consciousness, such a resultant being becomes indestructible. (111:3.7)
goodness of God (2:6)
	God stretches out his beneficent hand to both the righteous and the wicked. (131:5.2)
	The infinite goodness of the Father is beyond the comprehension of the finite mind of time; hence must there always be afforded a contrast with comparative evil (not sin) for the effective exhibition of all phases of relative goodness. (4:3.6)
	In the physical universe we may see the divine beauty, in the intellectual world we may discern eternal truth, but the goodness of God is found only in the spiritual world of personal religious experience. (2:6.1)
	After all, the greatest evidence of the goodness of God and the supreme reason for loving him is the indwelling gift of the Father—the Adjuster who so patiently awaits the hour when you both shall be eternally made one. (2:5.5)
	The “richness of the goodness of God leads erring man to repentance.” (2:6.3) (48:6.8) (131:10.4) (143:2.7) (149:6.4)
	none is good but God (196:0.9) (196:2.2)
	The sincere pursuit of goodness, beauty, and truth leads to God. (195:6.17)
Jesus and goodness
	Warned about dangers of uncontrolled goodness: indiscriminate kindness may be blamed for many social evils.  (140:8.13)
	Jesus refrained from placing emphasis on evil by forbidding it, while he exalted the good by commanding its performance. (127:4.2)
	Jesus went about doing good (100:7.8) (159:5.10) (171:7.9)
	asked Nathaniel: “Master, shall we give no place to justice? The law of Moses says, ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. ’ What shall we say? ” And Jesus answered: “You shall return good for evil.” (140:6.9)
nature of goodness
	On the mansion worlds they proclaim the great law of the conservation and dominance of goodness: No act of good is ever wholly lost; it may be long thwarted but never wholly annulled, and it is eternally potent in proportion to the divinity of its motivation. (48:6.7)
	all goodness takes origin in Father (8:2.7)
	since the quality of greatness is wholly determined by the content of goodness, it follows that, even in your present human estate, if you can through grace become good, you are thereby becoming great. (28:6.22)
	True goodness is like water in that it blesses everything and harms nothing. And like water, true goodness seeks the lowest places, even those levels which others avoid (131:8.3)
	Greatness and goodness simply cannot be divorced. (28:6.21) (56:10.12) (100:7.17)
	goodness effectually destroys evil. (188:5.2)
	goodness may be derived from time-limited evil (54:6.6-10)
	The righteousness of any act must be measured by the motive; the highest forms of good are therefore unconscious. (140:8.26) (170:3.9)
	Human likes and dislikes do not determine good and evil; moral values do not grow out of wish fulfillment or emotional frustration. (100:3.2)
	no good act ever wholly lost (48:6.7)
	it is understandable by contrast with evil (4:3.6)
	Goodness, righteousness, and justice are philosophically interrelated and spiritually bound up together with living truth and divine beauty. (44:7.2-4)
	Goodness always compels respect, but when it is devoid of grace, it often repels affection. (171:7.2)

Those who know the gospel only in the mind, and who have not experienced it in the heart, cannot be depended upon for support when real trouble comes. (177:5.2)
the gospel of the kingdom belongs to all who believe it; it shall not be committed to the custody of mere priests. (191:6.3)
common people hear gladly teh gospel (173:3.2) (174:4.7) (196:1.4)
we should not try to fit Jesus’ new gospel into old forms of religious belief (138:5.2) (140:6.2) (147:7.2-3)
The old religion was motivated by fear-consciousness; the new gospel of the kingdom is dominated by truth-conviction, the spirit of eternal and universal truth. (180:5.12)
evidence of belief in gospel is the love shown to one another (182:1.6)
the gospel sets men free from the burdensome traditions of a formal religion of ceremonies which old teachers are determined to uphold at any cost. (162:2.2) (170:2.1-2)

the gospel, explained | religion:explained
	Jesus made it clear that his teachings applied to the individual, not the state. All of them realized more fully that the gospel of the kingdom is a message directed to the individual, not to the nation. (140:8.5) (145:2.10)
	the good news of the gospel are that that by faith every mortal may have all the essentials of salvation. (140:10.9)
	The gospel of the good news that mortal man may, by faith, become spirit-conscious that he is a son of God, is not dependent on the death of Jesus. (140:10.4,7) (141:4.2) (142:3.8) (181:2.12,18) (186:5.4)
	The Master placed emphasis on the following five points as representing the cardinal features of the gospel of the kingdom: (170:4.8-13)
		# sacredness of the individual. Jesus never failed to exalt the sacredness of the individual as contrasted with the community. (138:8.9) (140:8.11) (140:10.5) (144:6.3) (170:3.10-11) (170:4.9) (171:7.4) (194:3.7) (195:1.1)

		# The supreme satisfactions of the loving service of man. (170:4.12) | service
		# The transcendency of the spiritual over the material in human personality. (170:4.13)
	the higher and more spiritual phases of the new gospel of the kingdom are divine sonship, spiritual liberty, and eternal salvation. (152:5.6)
	To pray is natural for the children of light, but fasting is not a part of the gospel of the kingdom of heaven. (147:7.2)
	the Jesusonian gospel consists of the Fatherhood of God and the sonship and consequent brotherhood of all men, which is personally realized in loving ministry and social service.  (92:5.16) (94:4.10) (132:4.2) (142:7.4) (143:1.7) (143:6.6) (149:2.4) (191:4.4) (192:4.7) (193:0.4) (194:0.3-4) (195:10.21)
	gospel is founded on fact of Jesus’ God-revealing life (191:5.3)
	In preaching the gospel of the kingdom, we are simply teaching friendship with God. (159:3.9)

	Jesus’ gospel must reflect, not so much Jesus’ personality, as his teachings. (166:0.2) (170:5.19)

	The gospel of the kingdom is concerned with the love of the Father and the service of his children on earth. (142:4.2) (178:1.4) (193:0.4)
	The gospel of the good news that mortal man may, by faith, become spirit-conscious that he is a son of God, is not dependent on the death or resurrection of Jesus. (138:6.3) (186:5.4) (193:2.2) (194:0.3,7) (194:4.4-5)
	the gospel is a revelation of goodness of God (150:5.5)
	Jesus laid great emphasis upon what he called the two truths of first import in the teachings of the kingdom, and they are: the attainment of salvation by faith, and faith alone, associated with the revolutionary teaching of the attainment of human liberty through the sincere recognition of truth (140:10.1) (141:7.6) (150:5.2) (157:2.2) (163:2.4) (170:2.20-22)
	The gospel should be: “Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and in finding these, all other things essential to eternal survival shall be secured therewith.” (140:1.5)
	The so-called “Sermon on the Mount” is not the gospel of Jesus. It was the Master’s personal commission to those who were to go on preaching the gospel and aspiring to represent him in the world (140:4.1)
	Jesus’ gospel, as he preached it and lived it in his day, was an effective solvent for man’s spiritual difficulties in that day of its statement. (194:2.1)
	truth, beauty, goodness, love, and worship becomes meaningful as fellowship with man and sonship with God. (99:4.4)
	Intellectual strivings may reveal the facts of life, but the gospel of the kingdom unfolds the truths of being. (146:3.1)
spread of the gospel
	Jesus maintained various groups of gospel messengers: his apostles, his disciples, the seventy evangelists, and David Zebedee's body of messengers | apostles of Jesus; disciples; evangelists; messenger corps (David Zebedee’s)
	if Jesus’ gospel been left as he presented it, the only commentary being the inspired interpretation afforded by his earth life, all nations and all religions of the world would speedily have embraced this gospel of the kingdom. (149:2.1)
	now that we enjoy today the advantages of the art of printing little understand how difficult it was to perpetuate truth during these earlier times; how easy it was to lose sight of a new doctrine from one generation to another. (93:7.4)
	As the gospel of this kingdom shall spread over the world with its message of good cheer and good will to all men, there will grow up improved and better relations among the families of all nations. (142:2.2) (143:1.4) (176:1.1)
Other gospels
	Melchizedek receivers proclaimed a gospel of resurrection and rehabilitation to Adam and Eve, and they fully believed (76:5.1)
proclaiming the gospel | government:believers’ relation to; kingdom of heaven:establishment
	when proclaiming the gospel we should not make the mistake of only condemning the wrongs in the lives of our pupils; also to accord generous recognition for the most praiseworthy things in their lives. (159:3.3)
	All Urantia is waiting for the proclamation of the ennobling message of Michael, unencumbered by the accumulated doctrines and dogmas of nineteen centuries of contact with the religions of evolutionary origin. The hour is striking for presenting to Buddhism, to Christianity, to Hinduism, even to the peoples of all faiths, not the gospel about Jesus, but the living, spiritual reality of the gospel of Jesus. (94:12.7)
	we must allow apostolic teachers to teach own views of the gospel (148:1.2)
	we must always respect personality of man. Overpowering arguments and mental superiority are not to be employed to coerce men and women into the kingdom. (159:3.2)
	The teachers of the gospel of Jesus should approach other religions with the recognition of the truths which are held in common, many of which come directly or indirectly from Jesus’ message, while they refrain from placing so much emphasis on the differences. (149:2.5)
	things to avoid
		we should not appeal to fear, mind, religious hysteria, emotion, pity, or sentiment (152:6.2-4) (159:3.2,5)
		it is a folly creating artificial situations for the purpose of exhibiting arbitrary authority or of indulging exceptional power for the purpose of enhancing moral values or accelerating spiritual progress (136:8.8) (137:6.5) (140:1.5)
		old ways should not be attacked, and more should not be reformed; rather we should add a new truth (95:1.6-9) (132:0.4) (141:6.2) (178:1.16)
		Jesus forbade apostles becoming embroiled in politics (120:3.4) (137:7.5,12) (139:11.9) (140:8.9) (167:5.6)
		Jesus never did he resort to ignoble tactics in meeting the false and unfair attacks of his enemies. We must avoid in the same way dishonesty and unfairness in all our efforts to preach truth and proclaim the gospel. (125:5.8) (128:4.7) (149:4.5) (156:5.19) (166:4.12)
		we must avoid distracting details, flowery language and the mere poetic imagery of a play upon words (159:5.17)
		we must not allow diverting devotion from one duty to proclaim gospel (141:7.4) (163:4.5) (178:1.11) (192:2.12)
		we must avoid false sympathy; self-pity; mere fellowship in misery; withhold pity from cowards and quitters (159:3.11)
		we must never make the mistake of identifying the gospel with a particular race, a culture, or a political system (140:8.9-31) (140:10.6) (142:7.17) (194:3.9)
		we must not indulge in sarcasm or cynicism at the expense of simple-minded brethren (159:3.4)
		we do not have to use overpowering arguments, appeals, or miracles (129:3.5) (136:6.6) (136:8.2) (159:3.2)
		Never should a righteous cause be promoted by force; spiritual victories can be won only by spiritual power. (152:6.2-4) (159:3.2,5) (178:1.2-3,6)
		Christians make a big mistake when, in presenting Christ as the supreme ideal of spiritual leadership, they dare to require God-conscious men and women to reject the historic leadership of the God-knowing men who have contributed to their particular national or racial illumination during past ages. (99:5.11)
		we must strive to live peaceably with all men (141:6.4) (178:1.16) (181:2.5)
		never gospel should be subordinated to physical ministry of sick and afflicted (145:5.1-7)
		we should not substitute the working of wonders and the healing of the sick for the proclamation of the gospel of eternal truth (147:3.2)
		we should not employ the physical forces of earthly governments, whose rulers may become believers, in the work of furthering the mission of the spiritual kingdom. (16:7.9) (178:1.3,6,12)
	things to do
		We are to be gentle in our dealings with erring mortals, patient in our intercourse with ignorant men, and forbearing under provocation; but we are also to be valiant in defense of righteousness, mighty in the promulgation of truth, and aggressive in the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom, even to the ends of the earth. (143:1.9) (178:1.14,16) (192:2.11-12) (195:10.1)
		we must be bold and emphatic (141:7.8) (155:1.3)
		we must be more gracious and less stringent in collateral social requirements (95:7.3)
		Jesus was equally adept in teaching by either asking or answering questions. As a rule, to those he taught the most, he said the least. (132:4.2)
		You cannot reveal God to those who do not seek for him; you cannot lead unwilling souls into the joys of salvation. (132:7.1,2) (153:3.5)
		The certainty of the God-knowing religionist should not be disturbed by the uncertainty of the doubting materialist; rather should the uncertainty of the unbeliever be mightily challenged by the profound faith and unshakable certainty of the experiential believer. (103:8.5)
		we must clash with the established leaders only when they threw themselves directly in the way of the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom to the sons of men. (138:5.4) (178:1.16)
		there are deferred rewards inherent in service for truth (28:5.17)
		It becomes the duty of those who know about the realities of the spirit to reveal these things to those who discern only the manifestations of the material world. (142:6.6)
		our teaching of the gospel of the kingdom, no matter how faithfully and efficiently we execute our divine commissions, is going to be attended by varying degrees of success (151:2.6)
		we must employ analogies, true stories to illustrate one central truth, not fables or allegories (151:2.5) (151:3.3)
		extent necessity to go to the people reveals lack of righteous life (163:7.2)
		we must not be afraid of those who can kill the body, but who are not able to destroy the soul; (150:4.2)
		First preach the gospel, and when you get a man safely into the kingdom, then if he asks, give him the advanced teaching. (141:6.2-4)
		Freely have we received; therefore freely should we give of the truth of heaven (159:1.5) (176:3.10) (193:0.5)
		we must go into all the world, to every man, woman, and child (93:4.4) (94:7.2) (95:7.3) (100:7.6) (140:9.2) (163:4.2) (165:6.3) (182:1.5) (190:3.1) (190:4.1) (191:1.2) (191:4.4) (191:5.3) (191:6.3) (192:2.11-12) (193:0.5) (193:1.2) (193:2.2) (193:3.2) (193:5.2)
		At Edrei, Jesus gave an instruction of the principles which should guide teachers and believers of the gospel of the kingdom (159:3) (178:1)
		we have to live our life so as to lead others to inquire about the gospel (130:2.4) (132:7.2) (140:1.7) (141:7.3) (155:1.5) (182:1.6) (191:6.2)
		When we go out into the world to proclaim the gospel, we must make such provision for our support as seems best. (180:0.2)
		Morality can never be advanced by law or by force. It is a personal and freewill matter and must be disseminated by the contagion of the contact of morally fragrant persons (16:7.9)
		We no longer have to worry about orders to refrain from this or be careful about that, but rather we will all attend to a single supreme duty. (142:4.2)
		The Father does not require of us as the price of entering the kingdom of heaven that we should force ourselves to subscribe to a belief in things which are spiritually repugnant, unholy, and untruthful. (155:6.5)
		only law to obey is command to preach gospel (192:2.11)
		The persistent preaching of the gospel of the kingdom will some day bring to all nations a new and unbelievable liberation, intellectual freedom, and religious liberty. (178:1.9)
		Those who know God have experienced the fact of his presence; such God-knowing mortals hold in their personal experience the only positive proof of the existence of the living God which one human being can offer to another. (1:2.8)
		we must preach the gospel without fear or favor; we must remember always that God is no respecter of persons. (102:7.6) (143:1.5) (192:2.2)
		we have to proclaim kingdom not just with words but in our own life (140:1.7)
		we must proclaim the whole truth of the good news, not just a part of the saving gospel. (193:0.4)
		the appeal to human feelings is transitory and utterly disappointing; the exclusive appeal to the intellect of man is likewise empty and barren; it is only by making our appeal to the spirit which lives within the human mind that we can hope to achieve lasting success and accomplish those marvelous transformations of human character that are presently shown in the abundant yielding of the genuine fruits of the spirit. The kingdom of heaven, being a spiritual brotherhood of the spirit-born sons of God, may be promulgated only by the power of the spirit. (152:6.2-4) (159:3.2,5) (178:1.2)
		As Jesus comforted hungry minds and ministered to thirsty souls, the recipients of his mercy did not so much feel that they were confessing to him as that they were conferring with him. (171:7.5)
		One hour of teaching will not wholly change the beliefs of a lifetime, and so it is necessary to reiterate the message (166:4.12) (178:1.9)
		The spirit of religion is eternal, but the form of its expression must be restated every time the dictionary of human language is revised. (99:1.6)
		In winning souls for the Master, it is not the first mile of compulsion, duty, or convention that will transform man and his world, but rather the second mile of free service and liberty-loving devotion that betokens the Jesusonian reaching forth to grasp his brother in love and sweep him on under spiritual guidance toward the higher and divine goal of mortal existence. Christianity even now willingly goes the first mile (195:10.5)
		we must show the same diligence in gaining souls that what we employ in gaining for ourselves (169:2.2)
		Spirit of Truth gives a strong urge to go out and proclaim the gospel of the kingdom (194:0.1)
		do not describe our spiritual experiences to convince unbelievers, but for the edification and mutual satisfaction of believers. (1:6.6)
		we must not prohibit foreign preachers from teaching the gospel. We cannot expect all who believe in the gospel to submit to our direction (159:2.1)
		we must always make a difference in teaching so as to suit our presentation of truth to the minds and hearts before us (133:4.2) (151:3.1) (191:4.4)
		those who give lives to proclaiming gospel shall live by gospel (140:6.13) (165:5.2-3)
		proclaiming gospel can bring an uncertain troublous future (155:5.13)
		we must whet the appetites of our associates for truth and give advice only when it is asked for. (48:7.16)

believers’ relation to government
	it behooves us to afford no stumbling block for the authorities (157:1.2,4)
	In everything related with peace plans, we must submit to the government. In these matters we must do what they bid us and observe the essentials of the law (140:8.9) (175:1.8) (177:3.7)
	we just have to conflict when rulers require worship which belongs only to God (133:4.3) (178:1.3) (181:2.10)
	The last great speech of Jesus in our world was a long speech of almost two hours that he gave before fifty followers about sonship with God and citizenship in earthly governments. (178:1)
	Jesus forbade apostles to become embroiled in politics (120:3.4) (137:7.5,12) (139:11.9) (140:8.9) (167:5.6)
	Jesus did not teach rules of government (140:6.6)
	he urged them to make no denunciations of government (138:5.4) (178:1.16)
	we should never make the mistake of identifying Jesus’ teachings with any political or economic theory, with any social or industrial system. (140:8.9-31) (140:10.6) (142:7.17) (194:3.9)
	So long as the rulers of earthly governments seek to exercise the authority of religious dictators, who believe the gospel can expect only trouble, persecution, and even death. (178:1.9)
	It is the believer’s duty to render to Caesar the things which are Caesar’s and to God the things which are God’s. (140:8.9) (156:5.16) (174:2.2) (178:1.3) (181:2.10)
	cosmic citizenship is a matter of responsibility and morality and so it is therefore taught in heaven (39:4.9)
	with respect to the various religious groups and the political parties of Palestine, Jesus’ words always were, “We are seeking to win all of them, but we are not of any of them.” (137:7.5,12)
	Jesus said: “When you are brought up before governors and rulers, it shall be for a testimony of your faith and to show your steadfastness in the gospel of the kingdom. And when you stand before judges, be not anxious beforehand as to what you should say, for the spirit will teach you in that very hour what you should answer your adversaries.” (176:1.1)
	The Urantia Book contains excerpts from lectures delivered by Jesus at Urmia on political sovereignty, though adapted to be applicable to twentieth-century political conditions. (134:5-6)
celestial government | Urantia:celestial government
	affairs of all worlds are divinely supervised (3:1.1)
	In his contact with the post-Havona creations, the Universal Father does not exercise his infinite power and final authority by direct transmittal but rather through his Sons and their subordinate personalities. The Father rules through his Sons; on down through the universe organization there is an unbroken chain of rulers ending with the Planetary Princes, who direct the destinies of the evolutionary spheres of the Father’s vast domains. (3:5.1-2)
	The various subadministrations of the universe have assigned to them certain special domains of responsibility. For example, a system government looks after biologic problems. (33:6.3)
	Concerning the government of the central universe, Havona, there is none.  In every requirement of Havona there is disclosed the reason of righteousness and the rule of justice. (14:3.1-2) (14:5.3)
	As persons you may conceive of the Universal Father and the Eternal Son as separate individuals, for they indeed are; but in the administration of the universes they are so intertwined and interrelated that it is not always possible to distinguish between them. (6:8.3)
	The administration of the Eternal Son in the superuniverses, being exclusively spiritual and superpersonal, is not discernible by creature personalities. (7:2.4)
	Most Highs rule in kingdoms of men. This rule of the Most Highs in the kingdoms of men is not for the especial benefit of any especially favored group of mortals. There is no such thing as a “chosen people. ” (3:5.2) (43:3.4) (43:9.4) (50:2.6) (52:3.11) (97:8.5) (134:5.4) (136:9.6) (175:1.8) (175:3.2)
democracy
	Democracy is an ideal form of government, but it is a product of civilization, not evolution, and it is not without its dangers. The dangers of democracy are: (71:2.1-6)
	# Glorification of mediocrity.
	# Choice of base and ignorant rulers.
	# Failure to recognize the basic facts of social evolution.
	# Danger of universal suffrage in the hands of uneducated and indolent majorities.
	# Slavery to public opinion; the majority is not always right.
	Popular elections may not always decide things rightly, but they represent the right way even to do a wrong thing. (71:2.8)
	In ancient times, priestly positions and kings were considered fetishes. Today men have also made a fetish of democracy, the exaltation and adoration of the common man’s ideas when collectively called “public opinion.” (88:3.4)
history of government (70) (71) | civilization
	Onagar, almost a million years ago, instituted an efficient tribal government, the like of which was not attained by succeeding generations in many millenniums. Never again, until the arrival of the Planetary Prince, was there such a high spiritual civilization on earth. (63:6.8)
	at some point every evolution of government brings with it the abolition of slavery (71:8.5)
	The first party government was “the strong” vs. “the weak. ” In ancient times a change of administration only followed civil war, abundant proof that the weak had become strong. (70:7.17)
	Every human institution had a beginning, and civil government is a product of progressive evolution just as much as are marriage, industry, and religion. From the early clans and primitive tribes there gradually developed the successive orders of human government which have come and gone right on down to those forms of social and civil regulation that characterize the second third of the twentieth century. (70:5)
	the red man never managed to create a state. The closest thing was the Iroquois, who created a federation, but which lacked the essentials of modern government. (71:1.3-11)
	The intellectual keenness, economic wisdom, social cleverness, and moral stamina of a people are all faithfully reflected in statehood. (71:8.1)
	Early communism was one more evolutionary step in government | communism
	The first real governmental body was the council of the elders of the clan. (70:5.2)
	ever-present danger of suffering an external aggression stimulates development of state (79:8.1)
	Government is an unconscious development; it evolves by trial and error. (70:0.2-3) (71)
	The development of industry demands law, order, and social adjustment; private property necessitates government. (69:9.17) (70:0.1)
	in the primitive government the dictators were the ones who prevailed (70:12.2)
	The early states were small and were all the result of conquest. (71:1.2)
	Effective state rule only came with the arrival of a chief with full executive authority, the monarchal government (70:6)
	the executive power arose from the need to organize the war or from the healers and priests (70:5.5-9)
	The weak and the inferior have always contended for equal rights; they have always insisted that the state compel the strong and superior to supply their wants and otherwise make good those deficiencies which all too often are the natural result of their own indifference and indolence. (70:9.16)
	In the past, institutional religion could remain passive while the upper strata of society turned a deaf ear to the sufferings and oppression of the helpless lower strata, but in modern times these lower social orders are no longer so abjectly ignorant nor so politically helpless. (99:1.5)
other worlds
	The Urantia Book describes how the most prominent country on a neighboring planet, which currently enjoys a representative republic, is governed. (72)
	In this nation on the neighboring planet, governmental servants supported by tax funds are, for the periods of such services, disenfranchised. (72:9.4)
	in the worlds that are in the stages of light and life the government gradually disappears (52:7.5) (55:3.2) (55:5.4)
	in the epochs of light and life there are mortal chief executives who serve as joint administrators associated with the Planetary Sovereign, thus freeing the Adam and Eve of the planet from their positions of government (55:4.15)
principles of government (70) (71) (72) | competition; courts; human rights; industry; justice; law; military; profit; taxation
	These are the principles that should govern all forms of human government:
	* Slavery, serfdom, and all forms of human bondage must disappear. (71:2.10)
	* Adjudication is the highest function of any government, and those who are intrusted with verdict rendering should be chosen from the highest and most noble types of the most experienced and understanding individuals. (22:4.3)
	* best government is balance of power between executive, legislative, and judicial branches (70:12.1) (71:8.1)
	* the ideal state should bestow its highest honors, in recognition of services rendered, on its civil and social officials (71:3.12)
	* must take care of the unfortunate (71:4.10)
	* That state is best which co-ordinates most while governing least. (71:3.9) (71:5.2)
	* education must be compulsory (71:4.7) (71:8.7) (72:4.1)
	* employment must be compulsory (71:3.7) (71:4.8) (72:6.4,6)
	* The conquest of dialects must be sought—the triumph of a universal language. (71:8.12)
	* it is necessary to establish a control mechanism for public servants (71:2.18)
	* citizens must have the ability to control the tx levying. (71:8.6)
	* divine ideal for government must be slowly discovered (70:12.20)
	* a free people must be educated—taught to think intelligently and plan wisely—or else freedom usually does more harm than good. (71:2.11)
	* effective government can be had only by conferring power on a personality, not by endowing an idea. (70:6.1)
	* The prime mission of government is the definition of the right, the just and fair regulation of class differences, and the enforcement of equality of opportunity under the rules of law. (81:5.6)
	* essentials are liberty, security, education, social co-ordination (71:1.3-11) (71:3.1)
	* ethics is seed and secret of continued and purposeful growth of society and government (39:3.7)
	* federalism. If there is a union of states, they must be free. (71:8.8) (72:2.1)
	* Civil government must be founded on justice (132:4.8)
	* there must be freedom of speech. Representative government is unthinkable without freedom of all forms of expression for human aspirations and opinions. (71:2.13)
	* organized society had every right to employ force in the execution of its just mandates. The state has the right to defend itself as it sees fit, including the death penalty (133:1.5) (133:4.12) (140:8.4) (178:1.2)
	* The ideal state is organic, and every free and intelligent group of citizens represents a vital and functioning organ within the larger governmental organism. (72:9.7)
	* ideal state has few laws; has passed into the era of the positive progress of individual liberty consequent upon enhanced self-control (71:3.7)
	* The ideals of statehood must be attained by evolution, by the slow growth of civic consciousness, the recognition of the obligation and privilege of social service. (70:9.17) (71:3)
	* goverment must preserve individual liberties (70:12.5) (71:4.3) (71:8.4)
	* The survival of democracy is dependent on successful representative government; and that is conditioned upon the practice of electing to public offices only those individuals who are technically trained, intellectually competent, socially loyal, and morally fit. (71:2.19)
	* men and women must hold posts jointly. In all worlds in light and life always happens this way (55:3.9)
	* when fifty per cent of a nation is inferior or defective and possesses the ballot, such a nation is doomed. Dominance of mediocrity spells the downfall of any nation. (72:9.8)
	* national survival requires military preparation, but also a religious idealism that prevents the preparation from being prostituted and turning into offensive operations against other peoples (71:4.17)
	* It is not what a state is but what it does that determines the course of social evolution. (71:3.1)
	* goverment must be of the people, by the people, and for the people (71:2.19)
	* The only sacred feature of any human government is the division of statehood into the three domains of executive, legislative, and judicial functions. (71:8.1,3)
	* the great problem of statehood that must guarantee peace and quiet in industry, pay the taxes to support state power, and at the same time prevent taxation from handicapping industry and keep the state from becoming parasitical or tyrannical (71:5.2)
	* the good government must promote science and art (71:4.12)
	* achieve the protection of the home (71:4.4)
	* must care of race improvement (71:4.11)
	* The reign of law. The will and whims of human rulers must be replaced by legislative enactments in accordance with accepted fundamental law. (71:2.12)
	* Representative government is the divine ideal of self-government among nonperfect beings. (45:7.3) (52:4.6) (70:12.1-2)
	* The right of petition. Representative government assumes the right of citizens to be heard. The privilege of petition is inherent in free citizenship. (71:2.15)
	* The right to rule. It is not enough to be heard; the power of petition must progress to the actual management of the government. (71:2.16)
	* Security of property. No government can long endure if it fails to provide for the right to enjoy personal property in some form. (71:2.14)
	* The due recognition of sex equality and the co-ordinated functioning of men and women in the home, school, and church, with specialized service of women in industry and government. (71:8.10)
	* government should foster science and vanquish disease (71:8.9,11)
	* should provide fair, peaceful opportunities to all (70:9.17)
	* must provide social welfare programs | charity:by government
	Universal suffrage. Representative government presupposes an intelligent, efficient, and universal electorate.  (71:2.17)
	* the final consummation of political growth is the government of all mankind, by all mankind, and for all mankind. (134:5)
stages to evolution of government
	There are ten steps, or stages, to the evolution of a practical and efficient form of representative government, and these are: (71:2.9-19) (71:8.2-15)
	# Freedom of the person.
	# Freedom of the mind.
	# The reign of law
	# Freedom of speech
	# Security of property
	# The right of petition
	# The right to rule
	# Universal suffrage
	# Control of public servants
	# Intelligent and trained representation
quality of the state
	strongest state has common language, mores, and institutions (71:1.1)
	system is of value only if it enhances welfare of individual and mankind (134:5.2)
	a sovereignty that transcends all minor struggles and group differences is the characteristic of the true state (71:1.23)
	The state is a territorial social regulative organization, and the strongest, most efficient, and enduring state is composed of a single nation whose people have a common language, mores, and institutions. (71:1.1)
	The status of any level of civilization is faithfully portrayed by the caliber of its citizens who volunteer to accept the responsibilities of statehood. (71:3.10-12)
warnings
	these are the dangers to be avoided: (70:12.6-12)
	* we have to avoid control by ambitious and clever dictators (70:12.12)
	* we have avoid domination by vicious minorities (70:12.11)
	* we must not seek to promulgate truth nor to establish righteousness by the power of civil governments or by the enaction of secular laws. (152:6.2-4) (159:3.2) (178:1.12)
	* Citizens are not born for the benefit of governments; governments are organizations created and devised for the benefit of men. (71:0.2) (134:5.16)
	* government cannot be run by a debating society (70:5.5)
	* idleness and poverty should not be tolerated (71:3.8)
	* Ignorance and selfishness will insure the downfall of even the highest type of government. (71:3.1)
	* No government can long endure if it fails to provide for the right to enjoy personal property in some form. (71:2.14)
	* no great social or economic change should be effected suddenly (81:6.40)
	* oppressive taxation and regulation interferes with individual liberties (70:12.15) (134:6.10)
	* secularism sells man into bondage into slavish bondage to the totalitarian state (195:8.4)
	* the union of church and state must be avoided. One of the great peace moves of the ages has been the attempt to separate church and state. (70:1.14) (70:12.17) (71:8.4) (72:3.6) (178:1.9)
	* The subnormal man should be kept under society’s control; no more should be produced than are required to administer the lower levels of industry (68:6.11) | eugenics; inferiors
	* The great weakness of the Roman Empire and the cause of its end was the provision to emancipate boys at twenty-one, and to free young women to marry a man of their own choosing or wander the country indulging in immorality. (71:1.22) (195:3.8-9)
	* With planetary fertility, the serious problem of overpopulation soon arises. The wise nation knows when to stop growing (81:6.12)
self-government
	heavenly orders in which their own members participated in their own creation are candidates for a heavenly type of self-government (35:1.3)
	self-government is the highest type of representative government (52:4.6)
world government
	Adam made a heroic and determined effort to establish a world government, but he met with stubborn resistance at every turn. Adam abandoned all effort to establish representative government, and before the collapse of the Edenic regime he succeeded in establishing almost one hundred outlying trade and social centers where strong individuals ruled in his name. (74:5.5-7)
	The individual will enjoy far more liberty under world government. Today, the citizens of the great powers are taxed, regulated, and controlled almost oppressively, and much of this present interference with individual liberties will vanish when the national governments are willing to trustee their sovereignty as regards international affairs into the hands of global government. (134:5.13-15) (134:6.8-11) (134:6.10)
	world-wide peace cannot prevail until creation of a planetary government (72:12.5) (134:5.12)
	War on Urantia will never end so long as nations cling to the illusive notions of unlimited national sovereignty. There are only two levels of relative sovereignty on an inhabited world: the spiritual free will of the individual mortal and the collective sovereignty of mankind as a whole. (134:5.2,5)
	Under global government the national groups will be afforded a real opportunity to realize and enjoy the personal liberties of genuine democracy. The fallacy of self-determination will be ended. (134:6.11)

grace (God’s mercy) | | mercy | | OK
Time is an invariable element in the attainment of knowledge; religion makes its endowments immediately available, albeit there is the important factor of growth in grace, definite advancement in all phases of religious experience. (102:2.4)
While the elements of grace are freely admixed, nevertheless, the creature attainments are the result of individual effort and actual living, personality reaction to the existing environment. (32:3.9)
sonship is a gift. No child has aught to do with earning the status of son or daughter. The earth child comes into being by the will of its parents. Even so, the child of God comes into grace and the new life of the spirit by the will of the Father in heaven. (144:4.3) (144:5.13)
The creature’s need is wholly sufficient to insure the full flow of the Father’s tender mercies and his saving grace. (2:4.2,4)
Few mortals ever dare to draw anything like the sum of personality credits established by the combined ministries of nature and grace.grow in grace by living faith (48:7.6)
words of Jesus were: “Grow in grace by means of that living faith which grasps the fact that you are the sons of God while at the same time it recognizes every man as a brother.” (147:8.5)
a mercy credit is established for the survival of each rational creature, a credit of lavish proportions and one of sufficient grace to insure the survival of every soul who really desires divine citizenship. (28:6.5)
survivors enjoy extended opportunity for spiritual attainment interrupted by death (45:7.1)
there is a time lag between sin and penalty. A period of time of sufficient length to allow for such an adjudication of such an individual’s universe status as will prove entirely satisfactory (54:3.2) (54:4)

grace (prayer before eating); give thanks | | | | OK
Jesus seldom neglected to give thanks—verbally—when he broke bread for their noontide lunch (143:3.4)
The primitive method of saying grace was, before eating, to throw a bit of food into the fire for the purpose of appeasing the spirits, while mumbling a magic formula. (87:2.9)

graciousness | | | | OK
We can cultivate gracefulness, but graciousness is the aroma of friendliness which emanates from a love-saturated soul. (171:7.1)

gradant | | | | OK
The standard weight of Jerusem, the “gradant,” is built up through the decimal system from the mature ultimaton and represents almost exactly ten ounces of our weight. (46:1.2)

Graduate Guides | (24:6-7) | | ORDER | OK
Graduate Guides are counted among Higher Personalities of Infinite Spirit (26:6.1)
The Graduate Guides, as a group, sponsor and conduct the high university of technical instruction and spiritual training which is so essential for our goal. They are engaged in piloting the pilgrims of time through the seven circuits of Havona worlds.; stay with same pilgrim throughout (24:6.1,3) (26:10.7)
The number of Graduate Guides is beyond the power of human minds to grasp. They have not existed from eternity; they mysteriously appear as they are needed.Malvorian was the first, the Guide of the graduated called Grandfanda, and now is the chief of their supreme council (24:6.4-6)
Graduate Guides never leave the Havona worlds; they are dedicated to the service of the graduate pilgrims of time and space. (24:0.10) (24:6.9)
Though evolution is not the order of the central universe, it is believed that the Graduate Guides are the perfected or more experienced members of another order of central universe creatures, the Havona Servitals. (24:7.1-7) (25:1.7)
A servital is long absent from Havona performing superuniverse assignments and may later be privileged to receive a divine embrace on Paradise that may transform him or her into a Graduate Guide. (24:7.2-3)
For example, Sudna is a servital returned from superuniverse service, was received on Paradise, met the Father, entered the divine embrace and is no more, and three days later a newborn Graduate Guide appeared “spontaneously” in Havona. (24:7.5)
The newly created servitals, together with newly appearing Graduate Guides, all pass through the courses of training which the senior guides continuously conduct on each of the seven Havona circuits. They then go to great lengths to serve on the study worlds surrounding the headquarters spheres of the seven superuniverses. (25:1.5-6) (26:7.4)
in personality records they appear as single-origin beings in the family of the Infinite Spirit (30:1.77) (30:2.73)
Graduate Guides, with their servital associates, minister on all circuits of Havona to both ascending and descending pilgrims (26:6.1)

graft | | | | OK
The graft determines the nature of the fruit, notwithstanding that the living sustenance is drawn from the roots of original divine endowment of both mind and spirit. (102:7.4)

grain | | | | OK
the apostles gathered and rubbed grain in their hands on a Sabbath day, which provoked the indignation of a group of spies of the Sanhedrin (147:6.4)
It was the custom of many Near Eastern peoples to throw grain upon the newlyweds; this was a magical rite which was supposed to insure fecundity. (83:4.5)

The seven evolving superuniverses in association with the central and divine universe of Havona are commonly refered as the grand universe; these are the now organized and inhabited creations. They are all a part of the master universe, which also embraces the uninhabited but mobilizing universes of outer space. The grand universe has an evolutionary potential of around seven trillion inhabited planets, not including the billion eternal spheres of the central creation and the architectural administrative spheres. (0:0.6) (12:1.13) (15:2.9)
Ancients of Days and Seven Master Spirits are eternally fixed as administrators of the grand universe (0:8.11)
The seven Supreme Spirit groups are the universal co-ordinating directors of the seven-segmented administration of the grand universe. (17:0.1)
The Supreme Center Supervisors, the seven co-ordinates and associates of the Supreme Power Directors, are the regulators of the master energy circuits of the grand universe. (29:2.10)
Havona and the seven superuniverses need each other to reach the maximum of finite attainment; and someday future universes in outer space will also depend on the grand universe to transcend the finite. (117:6.20)
Much as mortals look to solar energy for life maintenance, so does the grand universe depend upon the unfailing energies emanating from nether Paradise to sustain the material activities and cosmic motions of space. (116:7.2)
The grand universe contains the possibility of, and ever seeks for, complete unification, and this grows out of the fact that this cosmic existence is a consequence of the creative acts and the power mandates of the Paradise Trinity, which is unqualified unity. (117:1.3)
Its current edge is ragged, its periphery uneven and unfinished, and the entire astronomical terrain highly unstable. The seven superuniverses are yet to be completed. (12:1.13)
The grand universe is not only a material creation of physical grandeur, spirit sublimity, and intellectual magnitude, it is also a magnificent and responsive living organism. Just as we are traversed by a network of nerves, the physical universe is permeated with energy lanes that activate it. The grand universe responds to the far-flung spirit-gravity grasp of the Eternal Son (116:7)
The grand universe number of our world, Urantia, is 5,342,482,337,666. That is the registry number on Uversa and on Paradise, our number in the catalogue of the inhabited worlds. (15:14.8)
the current grand universe uses only 5% of Paradise gravity capability (12:3.8)

characteristics
	All forms of force-energy—material, mindal, or spiritual—are alike subject to those grasps, those universal presences, called gravity. Personality also is responsive to gravity—to the Father’s exclusive circuit; but though this circuit is exclusive to the Father, he is not excluded from the other circuits; the Universal Father is infinite and acts over all four absolute-gravity circuits in the master universe: (12:3.1) (15:9.1-2)
	# The Personality Gravity of the Universal Father. (12:3.2)
	# The Spirit Gravity of the Eternal Son. (12:3.3)
	# The Mind Gravity of the Conjoint Actor. (12:3.4)
	# The Cosmic Gravity of the Isle of Paradise. (12:3.5)
	These four circuits are not related to the nether Paradise force center; they are neither force, energy, nor power circuits. They are absolute presence circuits and like God are independent of time and space. (12:3.6) (12:8.2) (42:11.4)
	These primal forces, inhering in the Absolutes, are personally controlled by the Universal Father; hence does all gravity center in the personal presence of the Paradise Father of pure energy and pure spirit and in his supermaterial abode. (11:1.4) (56:1.3)
	The Universal Controller is potentially present in the gravity circuits of the Isle of Paradise in all parts of the universe at all times and in the same degree. All creation inherently coheres and consists in God (3:1.7)
	While creation and universe organization remain forever under the control of the infinite Creators and their associates, the whole phenomenon proceeds in accordance with an ordained technique and in conformity to the gravity laws of force, energy, and matter. (15:4.1)
	Pattern may configure energy, but it does not control it. Gravity is the sole control of energy-matter. Neither space nor pattern are gravity responsive. Neither does life. (0:6.10-13) (36:6.6)
	The Paradise Deities act directly in their gravity circuits throughout the grand universe (116:3.1)
	Gravity unification is universal and unvarying; pure-energy response is likewise universal and inescapable. (56:1.3)
types of gravity
	material gravity
		the central universe and the surrounding seven superuniverses are at the present time making use of only about five per cent of the active functioning of the Paradise absolute-gravity grasp (12:3.8)
		gravity always acts preferentially in the plane perpendicular to the mass, a phenomenon indicative of the differential dimensions of Paradise and the surrounding creations. (11:8.9)
		Antigravity can annul gravity within a local frame; it does so by the exercise of equal force presence. (9:3.3)
		As the mind of any personality in the universe becomes more spiritual—Godlike—it becomes less responsive to material gravity. (7:3.2) (12:8.5)
		By tossing the 19th electron back and forth between its own orbit and that of its lost companion more than 25.000 times a second, a mutilated calcium atom is able partially to defy gravity and thus successfully to ride the emerging streams of light and energy, the sunbeams, to liberty and adventure. (41:6.4-5)
		The gravity forces of the material universes are convergent in the gravity center of nether Paradise. (0:3.13) (3:2.4) (5:6.11) (11:1.4) (11:8.2)
		The creation of every new universe calls for a new adjustment of gravity (3:4.2)
		the very instant that one billion worlds of Havona materialized, there was in evidence gravity (8:1.4)
		space energies inherent in Paradise existed and were potentially operative, but did not manifest until the creation of Havona (8:1.4)
		The center and focal point of absolute material gravity is the Isle of Paradise, and it is complemented by the dark gravity bodies encircling Havona and equilibrated by the upper and nether space reservoirs. (11:8.2)
		the alternate directions of successive space processions of the universes have something to do with the intramaster universe gravity technique of the Universal Absolute, which consists of a co-ordination of forces and an equalization of space tensions. Motion as well as space is a complement or equilibrant of gravity. (12:4.16)
		factors preventing gravity from converting all energy to matter are the antigravity influences of the energy controllers, and ability of organized matter to disintegrate under certain conditions (15:8.5-6)
		The universe is highly predictable only in the quantitative or gravity-measurement sense; even the primal physical forces are not responsive to linear gravity, nor are the higher mind meanings and true spirit values of ultimate universe realities. (12:6.5)
		The levels of gravity response for spirit, mind, and matter are quite independent of time (42:11.4)
		Jerusem, the system capital, is almost one hundred times the size of Urantia, although its gravity is a trifle less. (45:0.1)
		Lucifer charged that the Universal Father did not really exist, that physical gravity and space-energy were inherent in the universe, and that the Father was a myth invented by the Paradise Sons (53:3.2)
		In the suns destined to burn out, the height of luminosity is attained at the point of hydrogen exhaustion. Subsequent to this point, brilliance is maintained by the resultant process of gravity contraction. (41:8.2)
		Mass in matter tends to retard velocity in energy (15:8.3)
		Gravity and absence of heat (cold) organize and hold matter together; heat and antigravity disrupt matter and dissipate energy. (15:8.10)
		Heat can thus largely overcome gravity stability. (42:4.8)
		Gravity action at high temperatures transforms certain circuitized power into radiative energies. (41:7.9)
		Paradise gravity is form of gravity (11:8.7)
		Space is nonresponsive to gravity, but it acts as an equilibrant on gravity. Without the space cushion, explosive action would jerk surrounding space bodies. Pervaded space also exerts an antigravity influence upon physical or linear gravity; space can actually neutralize such gravity action even though it cannot delay it. (11:8.3)
		physical presence of Paradise is source and substance of gravity (9:1.7) (9:3.1) (11:8.1)
		Gravity presence and action is what prevents the appearance of the theoretical absolute zero, for interstellar space does not have the temperature of absolute zero. (42:4.6)
		Physical-gravity action is a quantitative determiner of nonspirit energy; spiritual-gravity action is the qualitative measure of the living energy of divinity. (12:8.5)
		gravity is one of the most real and eternally dependable things in the whole physical universe of universes (9:3.1)
		Although such gravity response is directly proportional to mass, it is so modified by intervening space that the final result is no more than roughly approximated when expressed as inversely according to the square of the distance. (42:11.5)
		science will never be able to know what gravity actually is, even if they can measure its manifestations (133:5.4)
		Pattern may configure energy, but it does not control it. Gravity is the sole control of energy-matter. (0:6.11)
		many nonpersonal beings utilize gravity for transit, and can go anywhere any time—instanter—, as do Gravity Messengers and Transcendental Recorders (23:3.2)
		Solitary Messengers, as a class, are highly sensitive to gravity (23:2.20)
		Atoms and electrons are subject to gravity. The ultimatons are not subject to local gravity, the interplay of material attraction, but they are fully obedient to absolute or Paradise gravity (41:9.2)
		linear or local gravity
			linear gravity is an interactive phenomenon which can be computed only by knowing the actual Paradise gravity. (12:3.8)
			Force Organizers retire in favor of Power Directors upon appearance of linear gravity (42:2.12)
			linear gravity is not fully operative below level of atomic matter electrons, in the primitive ultimaton state (42:4.3)
			Local or linear gravity pertains to the electrical stage of energy or matter; it operates within the central, super-, and outer universes, wherever suitable materialization has taken place. (11:8.3)
		Paradise gravity (3:1.6) (11:8)
			Adjusters traverse space over instantaneous and universal circuits of Paradise gravity (107:6.4-5)
			all forms of basic energy ever swing around the curved path of the space levels of the master universe in obedience to the incessant and absolute pull of Paradise gravity. (12:1.1)
			Paradise Gravity is also known as absolute gravity (11:8.3) (41:9.2) (42:2.12)
			Paradise gravity is the best illustration of unity of material universes (56:1.2)
			this gravity is one form of two physical gravity (11:8.7)
			grand universe absorbs only 5% of Paradise gravity (12:3.8)
			Paradise gravity grasps the basic units of material existence (21:2.12) (115:6.1)
			this gravity holds physical universes together (8:4.1)
			Matter may appear to manifest inherent energy and to exhibit self-contained powers, but the lines of gravity involved in the energies concerned in all these physical phenomena are derived from, and are dependent on, Paradise. (42:1.2)
			Master Force Organizers modify segregata to be responsive to Paradise gravity (11:8.6) (42:2.11)
			there are three stages of reaction to Paradise gravity: (11:8.4-7)
			# pregravity stages or force
			# gravity stages or energy
			# postgravity stages or universe power
			Superuniverse Centers begin function when ultimata discloses unmistakable response to Paradise gravity (42:2.23)
			The ultimatons are not subject to local gravity, the interplay of material attraction, but they are fully obedient to absolute or Paradise gravity, to the trend, the swing, of the universal and eternal circle of the universe of universes. (41:9.2)
			ultimata, the force-charge of space, is not responsive to Paradise gravity (15:4.1)
			Ultimatons function by mutual attraction, responding only to the circular Paradise-gravity pull. (41:9.2) (42:6.3)
	mind gravity (3:1.6) (9:6) (12:3.10)
		85% of the mind-gravity response to the intellectual drawing of the Conjoint Actor takes origin in existing grand universe (12:3.10)
		mind gravity centers in Infinite Spirit (5:6.11) (11:1.4) (56:3.1)
		In the local universe of Nebadon there are three distinct spirit circuits: that of the Spirit of Truth, that of the Holy Spirit, and that of the mind helpers. (34:4.1)
		All true and genuine intellectual values, all divine thoughts and perfect ideas, are unerringly drawn into this absolute circuit of mind. (9:6.2)
		mind gravity is independent of time (42:11.4)
		Material Sons maintain immortal status through circuit of mind-gravity circuit of the Spirit (75:7.5)
		mind-energy manipulators are celestial artisans used in intercommunication (44:5.3)
		activities of mind are grasped in the absolute mind-gravity circuit which focalizes in the Third Source and Center and is a part of the personal consciousness of the Infinite Spirit. (9:6.1)
		the mind gravity of the Conjoint Actor unerringly clutches all vital meanings of intellectual existence. (115:6.1)
	spirit gravity (3:1.6) (7:1) (12:3.9)
		if the eternal future should witness the appearance of an unlimited universe, the spirit gravity and the spirit power of the Original Son will be found wholly adequate for the spiritual control and effective administration of such a boundless creation. (6:4.1)
		this spirit gravity of the Son, ever drawing all spiritual realities to himself, is just as real and absolute as is the all-powerful material grasp of the Isle of Paradise. (7:1.3) (12:8.4)
		Spirit realities respond to the drawing power of the center of spiritual gravity in accordance with their qualitative value, their actual degree of spirit nature. (7:1.3-4,8)
		The discriminative operation of the spirit-gravity circuit might possibly be compared to the functions of the neural circuits in the material human body (7:3.4)
		The great circuits of energy, mind, and spirit are never the permanent possessions of ascending personality; these ministries remain forever a part of Supremacy. (117:5.7-8)
		circuits in Nebadon are Holy Spirit and Spirit of Truth (34:4.3-4)
		The Son’s spiritual drawing power is inherent to a lesser degree in many Paradise orders of sonship. (7:1.5)
		The evolving immortal soul of man, the joint creation of the material mind and the Adjuster, ascends as such to Paradise and subsequently, when mustered into the Corps of the Finality, becomes allied in some new way with the spirit-gravity circuit of the Eternal Son by a technique of experience known as finaliter transcendation. (117:5.3)
		The spiritual-gravity pull of the Eternal Son constitutes the inherent secret of the Paradise ascension of surviving human souls. All genuine spirit values and all bona fide spiritualized individuals are held within the unfailing grasp of the spiritual gravity of the Eternal Son. (7:3.2)
		This gravity control of spiritual things operates independently of time and space; therefore is spirit energy undiminished in transmission. (7:1.2) (34:3.5) (42:11.4)
		spirit gravity drives directly back to, and centers on, the Eternal Son (5:6.11) (6:3.2) (6:4.1) (6:5.2) (7:1.1) (7:5.6) (7:6.7) (11:1.4) (12:8.4) (34:3.5) (44:5.4) (56:3.1)
		literally pulls mortal souls Paradiseward (7:3.2)
		Our Creator Son exerts the same spiritual drawing power, spirit gravity, from the headquarters of the local universe that the Eternal Son of Paradise would exert if he were personally present on Salvington, and more (33:1.3)
		spiritual gravity is not operative on outer space levels (12:3.9)
		operates directly upon fundamental values of spirit existence (115:6.1)
		spiritual-gravity action is the qualitative measure of the living energy of divinity (12:8.5)
		reactions of the omnipresent spirit of the Eternal are dependable and measurable (7:1.8)
		Sin and rebellion may interfere with the operation of local universe circuits, but nothing can suspend the spirit gravity of the Eternal Son. (7:1.7)
		spirit presence of Eternal Son is channel of all spirit communion (194:2.12)
		The spirit-gravity circuit is the basic channel for transmitting the genuine prayers of the believing human heart from the level of human consciousness to the actual consciousness of Deity. (7:3.3)
	personality gravity | personality circuit
		Personality Gravity is noncomputable. The circuit can be recognized, but cannot be measured either qualitative or quantitative realities responsive thereto. (12:3.12)

gravity energy; Gravity energy; gravity energies | | energy; ultimata | | OK
gravity energy is the second phase of transmutation of segregata or primordial force into universe power (42:2.12)
This secondary or gravity energy is the product of the energy elaboration resulting from the pressure-presence and the tension-trends set up by the Associate Transcendental Master Force Organizers. (42:2.12)
it is Paradise gravity-responding energy that carries the potential of universe power and becomes the active ancestor of all universe matter. It is one of the two forms of ultimata. (42:2.12-13)

Gravity Messengers | (31:2) | | ORDER | OK
The Gravity Messengers are nearly infinite spiritual personalities that can defy time and space. They are highly personal beings, divine, intelligent, and touchingly understanding. Much of the inscrutable work of the far-flung universe is wrought by them (31:2.2) (108:4.5)
they are under the exclusive jurisdiction of Grandfanda and finaliter corps (31:2.1)
Gravity Messengers hail from Divinington, and they are modified and personalized Adjusters, but few in Uversa will undertake to explain the nature of one of these messengers. (31:2.2)
Divinington is their home (13:1.6) (31:2.2)
they appear in Paradise classification as single-origin beings and Supreme Spirits (30:1.57)
There exists a liaison of tremendous power and import between the Evening Stars and the Gravity Messengers attached to the finaliter working groups. (37:2.11)
Certain gravity traversers are personal beings, such as Gravity Messengers and Transcendental Recorders, but they are not available to the super- and the local universe administrators. (23:3.2)
they become finaliters when they become chiefs with a permanent staff of 999 companions; they can even make use of unlimited reserves available (31:2.3)
Gravity Messengers are able to move in very short order independently of time and space (23:2.23) (31:2.1)
they are in charge of certain space messages (44:5.7)
they are without a discoverable physical form (42:12.10)

During the retreat of a glacier the North American system of Great Lakes was produced. Our geologists have very accurately deduced the various stages of this development and have correctly surmised that these bodies of water did, at different times, empty first into the Mississippi valley, then eastward into the Hudson valley, and finally by a northern route into the St. Lawrence. It is thirty-seven thousand years since the connected Great Lakes system began to empty out over the present Niagara route. (61:7.10)

Gradually the concept of God, as contrasted with the Absolute, began to appear in Buddhism. Its sources are back in the early days of this differentiation of the followers of the Lesser Road and the Greater Road. It was among the latter division of Buddhism that the dual conception of God and the Absolute finally matured. (94:12.2)
before the collapse in India, the Chinese and north Indian groups of Gautama’s followers had begun the development of the Mahayana teaching of the “Great Road” to salvation in contrast with the purists of the south who held to the Hinayana, or “Lesser Road.” (94:9.4-5)

greatness; Greatness | | | | OK
The more steadfastly we behold, and the more persistently we pursue, the concepts of divine goodness, the more certainly will we grow in greatness, in true magnitude of genuine survival character. (28:6.21-22) (56:10.12) (100:7.17)
nobility itself is always an unconscious growth. (100:1.7)
The highest moral choice is the choice of the highest possible value, and always—in any sphere, in all of them—this is to choose to do the will of God. If man thus chooses, he is great, though he be the humblest citizen (39:4.14)
Greatness lies not so much in possessing strength as in making a wise and divine use of such strength. (48:7.27)
Said Jesus: “Whosoever would become great in my Father’s kingdom shall become a minister to all; and whosoever would be first among you, let him become the server of his brethren” (56:10.14) (140:1.6) (171:0.6) (175:1.10)
the manifestation of greatness on a world like Urantia is the exhibition of self-control. The great man is not he who “takes a city” or “overthrows a nation,” but rather “he who subdues his own tongue.” (28:6.20)
When the spiritual tests of greatness are applied, the moral elements are not disregarded, but the quality of unselfishness revealed in disinterested labor for the welfare of one’s earthly fellows, particularly worthy beings in need and in distress, that is the real measure of planetary greatness. (28:6.20) (140:4.6)
Spiritual greatness consists in an understanding love that is Godlike and not in an enjoyment of the exercise of material power for the exaltation of self. (158:6.3)
Greatness is synonymous with divinity. (28:6.21)

Greek history
	some Andites entered Europe by way of the islands of the Aegean and up the Danube valley, but the majority of the earlier and purer strains migrated to northwestern Europe by the northern route across the grazing lands of the Volga and the Don. (80:4.1)
	No wonder the Greeks had mythological traditions that they were directly descended from gods and superhuman beings. Thery were descendants of Adamson, superior son of Adam and Eve, and Ratta, Nodite descendant of Caligastia's staff (80:7.5)
	circa 10,000 B.C. a group of 375 superior tall descendants of Adamson made their way over the northern islands to Greece, coming almost directly from their highland home north of Mesopotamia. These progenitors of the Greeks were led westward by Sato, a direct descendant of Adamson and Ratta. (80:7.3-4)
	All the art and genius of Greeks is a direct legacy of the posterity of Adamson, the first son of Adam and Eve, and his extraordinary second wife, Ratta, a daughter descended in an unbroken line from the pure Nodite staff of Prince Caligastia. (77:5.10) (80:7.5)
	as it was in Egypt, practically all of the art and science of the Aegean world was derived from Mesopotamia except for the culture of the Adamsonite forerunners of the Greeks. (80:7.5)
	By 5000 B. C. the three purest strains of Adam’s descendants were in Sumeria, northern Europe, and Greece.  (80:7.9)
	The Aegean region passed through five distinct cultural stages, each less spiritual than the preceding, and erelong the last glorious era of art perished beneath the weight of the rapidly multiplying mediocre descendants of the Danubian slaves who had been imported by the later generations of Greeks. (80:7.6,13) (98:1.1)
	Egypt suffered a Greek naval invasion from the north and a Libyan attack from the south that were used by Moses for his exodus (96:3.5)

	Athens was the center of Greek science and learning (133:5.1-2)
	Corinth was the capital of the Roman province of Achaia. (133:2.5)
	Andrew the apostle was crucified in Achaia (139:1.12)
Greek language
	Jesus spoke, read and wrote in Greek (123:2.14) (123:5.1,6)
	New Testament was recorded in Greek (195:2.7)
	Greek was spoken by the educated classes and the better strata of Jews in times of Jesus (121:6.2)
	the Hebrew scriptures were fully translated into Greek at the time of Jesus, and Jesus himself possessed one of these valuable copies, a gift from his friends in Alexandria (123:0.3) (123:3.1) (126:5.6) (150:8.1)
	In the centuries just prior to Jesus times Greek culture and the Greek language had spread over Occident and near Orient (121:1.1,5)

	the Greek religion promised salvation from disharmony, ugliness, by the realization of beauty (5:4.5-8)
	they practiced an annual ritual bathing (85:4.1)
	they had philosophy and science, but hardly a religion with a personal God (130:3.5) (155:1.4)
	intelligent Greeks never regarded Greek gods seriously (98:1.4) (98:2.4) (195:1.6-7)
	the Greek mythology was more aesthetic than ethic. (98:1.6)
	In Greece, the almost complete absence of priests and “sacred scriptures” left the human mind free and unfettered, resulting in a startling development in depth of thought. The Hellenic Greeks never evolved a centralized worship system; the ritual was local; they had no priesthood and no “sacred book.” (98:1.5) (98:2.7) (98:6.1)
	No nation ever attained such heights of artistic philosophy in so short a time; none ever created such an advanced system of ethics practically without Deity and entirely devoid of the promise of human salvation (98:2.11)
	In Palestine, human thought was so priest-controlled and scripture-directed that philosophy and aesthetics were entirely submerged in religion and morality. In Greece, the almost complete absence of priests and “sacred scriptures” left the human mind free and unfettered, resulting in a startling development in depth of thought. But religion as a personal experience failed to keep pace with the intellectual probings into the nature and reality of the cosmos. In Greece, believing was subordinated to thinking; in Palestine, thinking was held subject to believing. In Palestine, religious dogma became so crystallized as to jeopardize further growth; in Greece, human thought became so abstract that the concept of God resolved itself into a misty vapor of pantheistic speculation (98:2.7-9)
	but they made a terrible orgiastic plunge into the follies of the mystery cults which were then overspreading the Mediterranean lands (98:2.10-11)
	The Olympian religion did not promise salvation, nor did it quench the spiritual thirst of its believers; therefore was it doomed to perish. (98:2.1)
	beliefs
		a gropu of 30 stones were reverenced in Greece (85:1.3)
		all peoples treated menstruating women with contempt. Even the Greeks held the menstruating woman as one of the three great causes of defilement, the other two being pork and garlic. (84:4.8)
		The Greeks themselves believed in three souls; the vegetative resided in the stomach, the animal in the heart, the intellectual in the head. (86:5.17)
		The Greeks, in contrast with the Jews and many other peoples, had long provisionally believed in immortality, some sort of survival after death (195:2.8)
		The Greeks believed in the efficacy of oracular advice (90:2.8)
		The Greeks and others taught you that man is descending from godly perfection steadily down toward oblivion or destruction (148:4.9)
		Greeks distinguised between animate and inanimate, the spirit and the energy (103:6.10)
		they considered the material as the shadow of the more real spirit substance (12:8.16)
		Like other peoples, the Greeks also had gods that formed triads. (104:0.3)
		The Greeks believed that weak men must have weak souls; so they invented Hades as a fit place for the reception of such anemic souls; these unrobust specimens were also supposed to have shorter shadows. (86:4.8)
	influences on greek religion
		The early influence of the Salem teachers was nearly destroyed by the so-called Aryan invasion from southern Europe and the East. These Hellenic invaders brought along with them anthropomorphic God concepts similar to those which their Aryan fellows had carried to India. This importation inaugurated the evolution of the Greek family of gods and goddesses. This new religion was partly based on the cults of the incoming Hellenic barbarians, but it also shared in the myths of the older inhabitants of Greece. (98:1.2)
		Amenemope transmitted the ethics of evolution and the morals of revelation to the Greeks (95:4.4)
		Although the effort of Ikhnaton to impose the worship of one God upon his people appeared to fail, the repercussions of his work persisted for centuries both in Palestine and Greece (95:5.14)
	influences of greek religion
		Roman religion was greatly influenced by extensive cultural importations from Greece. Eventually most of the Olympian gods were transplanted and incorporated into the Latin pantheon. The Greeks long worshiped the fire of the family hearth—Hestia was the virgin goddess of the hearth; Vesta was the Roman goddess of the home. Zeus became Jupiter; Aphrodite, Venus; and so on down through the many Olympian deities. (98:3.3)
		Greek philosophy greatly influenced Christianity. Greek philosophy, united with Paul's theology, still forms the basis of European ethics. The ideals of Jesus were reinterpreted by Greek philosophy and socialized in Christianity. (98:7.10) (195:0-1)
		there was something strangely alike in Greek philosophy and many of the teachings of Jesus. They had a common goal—both aimed at the emergence of the individual. (195:1.1)
		The Hellenistic Empire, as such, could not endure. Its cultural sway continued on, but it endured only after securing from the West the Roman political genius for empire administration and after obtaining from the East a religion whose one God possessed empire dignity. (195:1.8)

intellectual progress and stagnation
	The ancient Greeks, having preserved the traditions of Adamson’s teachings, were among the first to recognize that all disease is the result of natural causes. (90:3.9) (90:4.9)
	The early Chinese and the Greeks treated women better than did most surrounding peoples. (84:5.6)
	both the Greeks and the Romans favored monogamous marriage. (83:6.3)
	The fact of evolution is not a modern discovery; the ancients understood the slow and evolutionary character of human progress. The early Greeks had clear ideas of this despite their proximity to Mesopotamia. (74:8.5)
	The Greek mind was willing to borrow new and good ideas even from the Jews. (195:1.3)
	In Palestine, human thought was so priest-controlled and scripture-directed that philosophy and aesthetics were entirely submerged in religion and morality. In Greece, the almost complete absence of priests and “sacred scriptures” left the human mind free and unfettered, resulting in a startling development in depth of thought. But religion as a personal experience failed to keep pace with the intellectual probings into the nature and reality of the cosmos.

In Palestine, religious dogma became so crystallized as to jeopardize further growth; in Greece, human thought became so abstract that the concept of God resolved itself into a misty vapor of pantheistic speculation (98:2.7-9)
	Since the Greeks were not much interested in the philosophy of self-realization and an abstract Deity, they turned to mystery cults, such as the Eleusinian mysteries, the Dionysian nature worship, and the Orphic brotherhood (98:2.10)
	No nation ever attained such heights of artistic philosophy in so short a time; none ever created such an advanced system of ethics practically without Deity and entirely devoid of the promise of human salvation; no nation ever plunged so quickly, deeply, and violently into such depths of intellectual stagnation, moral depravity, and spiritual poverty as these same Greek peoples when they flung themselves into the mad whirl of the mystery cults.

Growth is not truly indicated by mere products but rather by progress. (100:1.3)
The progression of eternity does not consist solely in spiritual development. Intellectual acquisition is also a part of universal education. (37:6.6)
finite and absonite growth
	The finite of time contains within itself the seeds of eternity; when the fullness of evolution witnesses the exhaustion of the capacity for cosmic growth, the total finite will embark upon the absonite phases of the eternal career in quest of the Father as Ultimate. (117:5.14)
	the present growth which characterizes creature existence in the present universe age is a function of the Supreme. This kind of growth is peculiar to the age of the growth of the Supreme, and it will terminate with the completion of the growth of the Supreme. (117:2.2)
nature of growth
	Man cannot cause growth, but he can supply favorable conditions. Growth is always unconscious, be it physical, intellectual, or spiritual. (100:3.7)
	To mortal man, existence is equivalent to growth. And so indeed it would seem to be, even in the larger universe sense, for spirit-led existence does seem to result in experiential growth—augmentation of status. (117:2.2)

	the great problem of religious living consists in the task of unifying the soul powers of the personality by the dominance of love. (100:4)
	Creative growth is unending but ever satisfying, endless in extent but always punctuated by those personality-satisfying moments of transient goal attainment which serve so effectively as the mobilization preludes to new adventures in cosmic growth, universe exploration, and Deity attainment. (118:0.10,12)
	Some persons are too busy to grow and are therefore in grave danger of spiritual fixation. Provision must be made for growth (100:1.2)
	The Supreme is God-in-time; his is the secret of creature growth in time; his also is the conquest of the incomplete present and the consummation of the perfecting future. (117:2)

	With the appearance of relative and qualified reality there comes into being a new cycle of reality—the growth cycle—a majestic downsweep from the heights of infinity to the domain of the finite, forever swinging inward to Paradise and Deity, always seeking those high destinies commensurate with an infinity source. (105:5.5)
	The interassociation of the Original, the Actual, and the Potential yields the tensions within infinity which result in the possibility for all universe growth; and growth is the nature of the Sevenfold, the Supreme, and the Ultimate. (115:3.9)
	In attaining capacity for experience, the finite God also becomes subject to the necessity therefor; in achieving liberation from eternity, the Almighty encounters the barriers of time; and the Supreme could only know growth and development as a consequence of partiality of existence and incompleteness of nature, nonabsoluteness of being. (115:7.1)
	This superuniverse time lag, this obstacle to perfection attainment, provides for creature participation in evolutionary growth. (106:1.1-2)

The teaching about guardian angels is not a myth; certain groups of human beings do actually have personal angels. (113:1.1)
after subjects’ death
	The guardian seraphim attend youths in the probationary nursery on the finaliter world just as they spiritually minister to mortals on the evolutionary planets, while the faithful spornagia minister to their physical necessities. (47:2.6)
	when a planetary age ends, when those in the lower circles of mortal achievement are forgathered, it is their group guardians who reassemble them in the resurrection halls of the mansion spheres, even as record tells: “And he shall send his angels with a great voice and shall gather together his elect from one end of the realm to another. (113:6.7) (189:3.2)
	Throughout the life-lapse period of the sleeping survivors the spiritual values and eternal realities of their newly evolved and immortal souls are held as a sacred trust by the personal or by the group guardian seraphim. (30:4.15) (47:3.3) (49:6.4) (113:3.4) (113:6)
	A majority, but not all, of the seraphim of planetary and local universe service who have been accredited for the Paradise ascent will part with their mortal associates before the long flight to Havona and will at once begin a long and intense training for supernal assignment, expecting to achieve, as seraphim, perfection of existence and supremacy of service. (26:4.11)
	The technique of justice demands that personal or group guardians shall respond to the dispensational roll call in behalf of all nonsurviving personalities. (113:6.8)
	The seraphim of assignment sponsors the new body, the morontia form, as the new life vehicle for the immortal soul and for the indwelling of the returned Adjuster. (30:4.15)
	survivors first see guardian angels on mansion worlds (113:7.1)
	cherubim and sanobim always associated with guardian angels on earth, but not on mansion worlds (38:7.3) (38:8.5)
	On the morontia spheres the two attending seraphim are our open companions. These angels not only consort with us as we progress through the career of the transition worlds, in every way possible assisting us in the acquirement of morontia and spirit status, but they also avail themselves of the opportunity to advance by study in the extension schools for evolutionary seraphim maintained on the mansion worlds. (113:7.2)
	If an ascending pilgrim met defeat in the Deity adventure while traversing Havona in the company of an ascending seraphim, the guardian angel of the mortal career, she would elect to accompany her mortal associate. (25:8.10)
assignment
	All angelic assignments are made from a group of volunteering seraphim, and these appointments are always in accordance with human needs and with regard to the status of the angelic pair (113:2.3,7)
	With the arrival of the first Adjuster on an inhabited world the guardian seraphim also make their appearance; they are indispensable to terrestrial escape. (40:5.9) (49:6.4)
	since the bestowal of Michael, they are assigned in accordance with human intelligence, spirituality, and destiny. (113:1.2)
	Although both Andon and Fonta had received Thought Adjusters, as had many of their descendants, it was not until the days of Onagar that the Adjusters and guardian seraphim came in great numbers to Urantia. (63:6.9)
	Group guardians may serve on a planet age after age and eventually become custodians of the slumbering souls of thousands upon thousands of sleeping survivors. (113:2.4) (113:6.9)
	Midwayers are not men, neither are they angels, but secondary midwayers are, in nature, nearer man than angel; they are, in a way, of our races and are, therefore, very understanding and sympathetic in their contact with us; they are invaluable to the seraphim in their work for and with our races, and both orders are indispensable to the seraphim who serve as our personal guardians. (77:8.4)
	When we attain the sixth circle of spirituality, a seraphic pair with one company of cherubim is assigned to guide us in groups of five hundred. (113:0-1)
guardians of destiny
	Seraphim are not known as guardians of destiny until such time as they are assigned to the association of a human soul who has realized one or more of three achievements: has made a supreme decision to become Godlike, has entered the third circle, or has been mustered into one of the reserve corps of destiny. (113:2.1)
Lucifer's rebellion
	All personal and group guardians in the system of Satania who went astray in the Lucifer rebellion, notwithstanding that many sincerely repented of their folly, are to be detained on Jerusem until the final adjudication of the rebellion. (113:6.10)
technique of service
	The seraphim guard us; they do not seek directly to influence us; we must chart our own course, but these angels then act to make the best possible use of the course we have chosen. (113:5.4)
	To the seraphic guardians the very hairs of our head are numbered. (165:3.4-5)
	The guarding seraphim is constantly manipulating our environment for the purpose of augmenting our cosmic insight to the end that we may acquire enhanced realization of the presence of the indwelling Adjuster and thus be enabled to yield increased co-operation with the spiritual mission of the divine presence. (113:3.5) (113:4.4)
	Angels do not invade the sanctity of the human mind; they do not manipulate our will; neither do they directly contact with the indwelling Adjusters. (113:5.1)
	The seraphim act in our behalf quite independent of our direct appeals; they are executing the mandates of their superiors, and thus they function regardless of our passing whims or changing moods. This does not imply that we may not make their tasks either easier or more difficult, but rather that angels are not directly concerned with our appeals or with our prayers. (113:5.3)
	They do not, therefore, intrude into the picture of human drama except in emergencies and then usually on the direct orders of their superiors. (113:5.4)
	The guardians are most active at those times when the Adjusters are least active, but their ministry is in some manner strangely correlated. (113:4.5)
	While there is apparently no communication between the indwelling Adjusters and the encompassing seraphim, they always seem to work in perfect harmony and exquisite accord. (113:4.5) (113:5.1)
	They are able, with the assistance of the midway creatures and the physical controllers, to function in a wide range of activities in behalf of us, even to make actual contact with us, but such occurrences are very unusual. (113:5.5)

	Throughout the life-lapse period of the sleeping survivors the spiritual values and eternal realities of their newly evolved and immortal souls are held as a sacred trust by the personal or by the group guardian seraphim. (30:4.15) (49:6.4) (113:3.4) (113:6)
	If, when death overtakes us, we have attained the third circle or a higher realm and therefore have had assigned to us a personal guardian of destiny there is a chance for an immediate resurrection in the mansion worlds (112:4.12) (112:5.10)

	On Urantia the first mortal to secure a personal guardian was Rantowoc, a wise man of the red race of long ago. (113:2.2)
technique of service
	One of the most important things a destiny guardian does for her mortal subject is to effect a personal co-ordination of the numerous impersonal spirit influences which indwell, surround, and impinge upon the mind and soul of the evolving material creature. (113:3.1-5)
	Many guardians have gained much valuable experience on those worlds which are of the non-Adjuster fusion series. (113:2.3)
	The guardian of destiny influences you in every possible manner consistent with the dignity of your personality; under no circumstances do these angels interfere with the free action of the human will. (113:5.1)
	midwayers are indispensable to the seraphim who serve as personal guardians to mortals. (77:8.4)
	the seraphic guardians of destiny continue their personal ministry to the progressing mortals in light; indeed such angels come in ever-increasing numbers throughout the settled ages since larger and larger groups of human beings reach the third cosmic circle of co-ordinate mortal attainment during the planetary life span. The Holy Spirit and the ministry of angels are even more effective as the successive epochs of settled life are experienced. (55:4.2) (55:6.4)
	Human races of Urantia are very hard to work with. It is not uncommon to hear a guardian of destiny make a formal statement excusing the hardships he had encountered while serving his mortal subject. (111:7.4-5)

dealing with guilt
	Be not downcast by our failure wholly to forget some of our regrettable experiences. (156:5.8)
	Jesus destroyed the basis of all this fictitious guilt and sense of isolation in the universe by declaring that man is a child of God; the creature-Creator relationship was placed on a child-parent basis. (103:4.4)
