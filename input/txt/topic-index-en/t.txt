nature of Adjusters
	The Thought Adjusters are absolute foundations upon which finaliter nature can be evolved and unify evolving creatures with God on Paradise. (116:3.4)
	The presence of Thought Adjusters in mortal man reveals the essential unity of the universe, as each normal-minded and morally conscious Urantia mortal contains an actual fragment of the highest and eternal reality, the original Father. (5:0.1) (5:6.7) (8:5.2) (42:11.1) (117:3.9)
	The actuality of Father’s love incarnate in souls of men is the ultimate manifestation of the divine affection in all creation. (2:5.10) (107:0.2) (107:6.2) (108:6.3) (110:0.2) (120:3.9) (136:2.5) (194:2.12) (196:3.21)
	The Adjusters are one with us as finaliters, sharing our destiny and experience throughout our eternal adventure. (40:7.3) (110:7.4)
	Thought Adjusters are always subservient to human will, respecting sovereignty and never forcing spiritual transformation. (110:2.1-3)
	Adjusters are of God, from God, and are God present within mortal will creatures as a fragment of the Father's prepersonal spirit, a divine essence guiding them towards divine ideals and actualizing a new order of being for universe service. (32:4.5) (48:1.6) (107:0.6) (107:1.2,5) (108:4.2) (111:1.4)
	Thought Adjusters are to humans what the Trinity is to the Supreme Being. (116:3.4)
	Thought Adjusters, uniform in divinity and nature, function interchangeably in their unique spiritual endowment bestowed by the Father, regardless of the diverse opportunities and endowments of Urantia mortals. (5:1.5) (16:8.3) (107:2.2) (108:1.1) (108:3.1)
	Adjusters, possessing powers of selfhood, can plan, work, and love, demonstrating abilities commesurate with mind and unlimited communication between themselves. (107:5.2)
	The indwelling divine spirit within the human mind carries valid proof of the existence of God. (1:2.3) (1:6.4)
	The Thought Adjusters constitute a reservation by Father for direct and unlimited communication with all material creatures throughout his virtually infinite realms. (3:1.6,9) (10:3.15) (107:7.6) (108:4.1)
	Man's religious reactions are sponsored by the adjutant of worship and censored by the adjutant of wisdom; Thought Adjusters are cosmic windows through which we faith-glimpse Father. (103:0.1)
	The Thought Adjuster is the divine pledge for the future and full spiritual stabilization of the ascending mortal, eternally fused with man's free will. (112:7.10)

	Thought Adjusters possess a form of premind and enjoy the equivalent of human thinking, showcasing volitional powers that are commensurate with mind, despite being subservient to the mortal will due to their prepersonal manifestation. (6:6.3) (107:5.2) (107:7.3-4)
	The premind of a Thought Adjuster, entirely outside mind circuits of Infinite Spirit, is ancestral to the diverse and far-flung minds of the Conjoint Creator. (6:6.3)
	Subject to Adjuster leading and seraphic guidance, mortal man evolves from mortal mind to morontia soul, embodying the essence of his eternal nature. (113:4.2)

	Man is the Adjuster's hope for divinity; the Adjuster is man's hope for eternity. (107:6.2) (110:2.5)
	More experienced Adjusters indwell higher minds due to their previous contact with evolutionary creatures and adaptation to indwelt personalities. (108:1.1)
	The mortal's path to Paradise is through the indwelling of prepersonal Adjusters, ensuring survival beyond death and the potential for ultimate spirit attainment. (5:6.5-7) (40:10.2) (56:4.1) (108:5.1) (112:5.3)
	Your Thought Adjuster is the source of your spiritual growth, the key to survival, and the unique privilege that differentiates you from mere animals. (108:6.4)
	There is no limit to the extent or number of Thought Adjusters that God can send out to indwell mortal minds, creating endless possibilities for their progressive spiritual growth. (2:1.7) (3:4.4)

	When a Thought Adjuster is fused with the evolving immortal morontia soul of the surviving human, it is not identifiable apart from mortal after spirit level attainment. (107:5.5)
	After fusion, the number of the Thought Adjuster is stricken from the records, only known on Divinington. (108:3.2) (112:7.13)
	With a perfect guide, your divine Thought Adjuster, traverse the evolutionary planets to reach the final goal of eternal unity. (112:0.1)
	The essence of Thought Adjusters embodies the sacred pledge of eternal life for those sincerely seeking spiritual growth. (132:3.9)
	On the upper limits of the finite, where time conjoins transcended time, there is a blurring and blending of sequence, allowing the Supreme to anticipate future evolution through the Immanence of the Projected Incomplete, observed in human beings indwelt by Thought Adjusters as predictions of man's future universe attainments. (117:7.6)
	The religious urge to believe in God is so powerful that humans are compelled to conclude they have no right not to believe, as doubting God would be untrue to the divine Adjuster - the realest and deepest thing in human minds. (101:1.7)
	Jesus taught that the mind, when aroused by emotions, serves as the gateway to the soul, enabling Man's spiritual nature to recognize truth and respond to the gospel's spiritual appeal for lasting character transformations. (152:6.4)

function of time
	Time is the criterion by which self evaluates life, reflecting the direct relationship between maturity and unit of time consciousness within any given intellect. (118:1.3)
	Time cushions premature escape from barriers to human action, slowing down cultural progress and distributing the potentially lethal results of overfast advancement. (118:8.6)
	Time enables finite to coexist with Infinite, allowing for creature participation in divine creation and compensation for imperfection in the evolutionary process. (105:6.5) (118:9.1)
	Time is both the greatest aid and most formidable obstacle to reality perception for finite creatures. (106:9.2-3)
	Time permits growth for that which grows, bridging the gap between the constitutively perfect and the evolutionally perfected in eternity relationships. (105:5.9) (106:1.2)
	The time lag of mercy before fruition of evil and judgment ultimately allows for the triumph of higher level personality over lower level personality in any universe contest of reality. (2:3.5) (54:4,5) (131:3.5)
nature of time
	As man ascends, the enlarging view of time transitions from a linear sequence to a perfectly related cycle, where circular simultaneity displaces consciousness of events. (130:7.5)
	Personality's unique time sense transcends both mind-perceived time and spirit-perceived time, combining insight into Reality with a consciousness of presence and an awareness of duration. (12:5.6-9) (112:0.16)
	The coming into existence of time marks the genesis of reality for all creatures, with no actuality conceivable prior to the finite. (105:5.6)
	Time exists as a bestowal of Paradise, dependent on motion and the inherent awareness of sequentiality by the mind. (12:5.1,5)
	Deity's relation to the cosmos is experienced as an eternal now. (118:1.1)
	The nonbeginning, nonending continuum of time reveals the co-ordinate relationship of past-present-future, allowing the self to gain insight into the wholeness of events. (118:1.8)
	Time, like space, is an indirect bestowal of Paradise, rooted in motion and the mind's understanding of sequentiality. (12:5.1)
	In the grand scheme of the universe, time is relative: Though it may seem swift, the process of adjudicating Lucifer's crime spans an incomprehensible length compared to mortal actions on Urantia. (54:5.13)
	The struggle in this universe age is between potential and actualization, as mortal man chooses to follow or reject the motions of time within the stream of eternity. (117:4.11)
