I AM | (105:1) | God; Infinite; Universal Father | PERSON | OK
the concept of the I AM
	the I AM is the hypothesis of all that is unknowable of God the Father, the Prime Source-Center; even this hypothesis surely falls far short of his unfathomable infinity (105:1.6)
	it is the original infinity that can be hypothesized at the time of eternity, when as yet there was no differentiation in all infinity (104:4.44-47) (105:1.3-5)
	the I AM is a theoretical and philosophical concession made by the celestial creatures to finite-minded men, who need time to understand relationships and causes (0:3.23-24) (105:1)
	The I AM may be conceptually viewed as a unity, the solitary I AM; as a duality, the Infinite One differentiated from Infinity; as a triunity; and as a being of a sevenfold nature (105:2) (105:4)
	it is regarded as a philosophical postulate that the I AM pervades all infinity but no creature has been able to verify this by experience (106:3.5) (106:9.10) (115:2.1,3)
	the concept of the I AM implies complete self-realization, it embraces all the personalities who will have participated in the self-revelation of the I AM, his ultimate children (106:8.23)
	the I AM contains both the past and the future, and therefore I AM also means I WAS and I WILL BE (118:1.9)
	The Father revealed himself to Moses as I AM and as I AM that I AM; Jesus made an expanded revelation of the Father (182:1.9)
	In Buddhism the belief in many Buddhas led to the concept of the Eternal Buddha, a concept that can be identified with the Absolute and sometimes even with the infinite I AM (94:11.11-12)
In the distant past
	with his first action the I AM became the Eternal Father of the Original Son, and at the same time the Eternal Source of the Isle of Paradise (0:3.22)
	The I AM exists before the existentials and after all the experientials (106:9.10)
	The three spiritual expressions were perfectly unified in the I AM before he became the Universal Father of the Eternal Son and the Infinite Spirit (56:3.5)
	In the Deity of the Supreme the Father-I AM has achieved a relatively complete liberation from the limitations inherent in the infinite state, eternal existence, and absolute nature (115:7.1)
the distant future
	the final unification of the divergence between the interpretations of science, which is centered on energy, and those of religion, which is centered on spirit, occurs in the I AM (103:7.12)
	the personality of the I AM is partially experiential on spiritual levels even by mortals since it is in the Universal Father and in his revelation, the Eternal Son (105:2.5)
	the realization of the Trinity of Trinities is thought to cause the I AM to become experientially attainable (106:8.22)
	the integration of total reality would occur in the union of the three Absolutes, the Unqualified, the Universal, and the Deity, which form the latent state of the I AM (106:7.9)
the primary cause
	the absolute original causality in infinity is attributed to the Universal Father, acting as the infinite, eternal, and absolute I AM (10:3.5) (105:1.1)
	all reality has its origin in the I AM (19:1.12) (56:10.11) (105:1.3) (105:4.1)
	he is the only self-caused fact in the universe; only the I AM is uncaused (102:7.1-3)
	the I AM is also the Father of Michael of Nebadon and the God of human salvation (2:1.5) (56:1.6) (102:3.10) (105:1.2)
	the I AM is the primal cause and source of both the Trinity and the Absolute (56:9.5)
	the I AM is Infinity, the eternal continuum (105:2.2)
	The Original is the original manifestation of the I AM from which all reality springs (115:3.6,8,10)
	The Unqualified Absolute is the unrevealed cosmic infinity of the I AM (105:3.7)

According to The Urantia Book the northern regions have seen six distinct ice invasions, each with numerous advances and recessions, covering North America, Greenland, Iceland, the British Isles, and western Europe. (61:5.4)
* The first ice age was a period of extensive land elevation and constant ice precipitation over the northern regions. (61:5-7)
* One and a half million years ago the second invasion of the ice took place. Icebergs sliding off into the ocean changed the coastwise climate drastically. (61:5.8)
* Primitive man evolved during the 3rd ice age 1,000,000 years ago, originating from the dawn mammals in a challenging environment of climate change. (61:6) (64:1.4)
* 750,000 years ago, the fourth ice age saw the ice sheet reaching as far south as central Pennsylvania and southern Illinois while early humans adapted to the changing climate. (61:7.2) (64:4.4-9)
* During the 5th ice age, a new development catalyzed the evolution of human races and marked the arrival of the Planetary Prince. (61:7.4) (64:7.1) (64:7.8)
** The red man's tribal organization in eastern Asia predated and outlasted the debased animal strains pushed south by the fifth glacier. (79:5.2)
* The 6th ice age drove the westernmost Andon tribes to become the first marine adventurers in search of new lands free from terrifying ice invasions. (64:7.17)
** The sixth and last glacier invasion, largest in North America, reached its farthest points of southern extension 150,000 years ago, creating the Great Lakes system. (61:7.6-12)
** The retreat of ice in Europe shifted winds and transformed the Sahara into a barren desert, dispersing the smaller-statured brunets. (80:2.1)
Ice ages occur on a 200,000-year cycle, with glaciers taking roughly 100,000 years to advance and retreat before temperate regions experience around 50,000 years of ice-free conditions. (61:7.12)
During the last ice age retreat 100,000 years ago, polar ice sheets expanded and moved northward, making another ice age unlikely as long as the poles stay icy. (61:7.11)
Hardy humans, fostered by the rigors of the ice age, evolved on Urantia to survive and thrive in challenging environments. (61:6.3) (65:2.16)
