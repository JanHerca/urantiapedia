the Jewish religion
	The Jews had God but lacked a saving philosophy. (132:7.5)
	The Jews loved justice, wisdom, truth, and righteousness uniquely, yet had minimal influence on the intellectual and spiritual understanding of these qualities compared to other peoples. (97:10.6)
	The Jews, who took their religion too seriously, failed to evolve a nontheologic philosophy of life, leading to a struggle with their original concept of divine rewards and punishments, as seen in the drama of Job and the pessimism of Ecclesiastes. (97:8.2) (195:1.6)
	Freed by the Persians but enslaved by their own priestly laws, rituals, and sacrifices, the Jews forsook spiritual truth for religious bondage and tyranny. (97:10.2-3)
	The contrast between the religious philosophy of Jews, Greeks, and Romans illustrates the impact of institutional church on cultural progress. (98:2.7-9) (191:5.3)
	The theology of faith may define and dogmatize, but Jesus' personal, living, and original faith was unshakable and deeply spiritual. (196:0.5)
the Messiah
	The misconception of the promised Messiah led to vibrant expectation among the Jews, despite their spiritual retrogression and increasing bondage. (97:10.3) (121:2.7) (135:5) (136:1) (136:2.1)
	The Jews held a rigid belief in the promised Messiah based on false pride and worshiped the letter of the law, leading to spiritual retrogression and separation from the gentile world. (97:10.3) (121:7.1)
	Jesus was not the Messiah anticipated by the Jews. (122:4.2-4)
	The Jews, nurtured on miracles, longed for a Messiah who would perform even greater wonders, but Jesus, understanding their expectations, chose not to succumb to the allure of spectacular displays of power and glory. (136:6.6-8) (136:8.1) (137:6.5)
	Throughout his public ministry, Jesus was faced with the constant demands for food, miracles, and the desire for him to become king from his followers, but he remained steadfast in his decisions made during his time of isolation. (136:9.13)
Jesus and the Jews
	Why Jesus was incarnated as a Jew
		Creator Sons always incarnate in a group with the greatest Adamic inheritance, embodying mortal-bestowal adventures in various sectors and universes, culminating in a final bestowal as a member of a higher mortal race. (21:4.3)
		Gabriel chose Jews as the bestowal race for Michael's incarnation on Urantia after careful study and consultation. (122:0.2)
	rejection of Jesus
		Jesus explained to the twelve why Judeans were less willing to believe the gospel, contrasting them with the more receptive gentiles and less orthodox Jews. (166:2.2)
		The majority of Jews refused to receive Jesus, leading to the spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire. (173:4.4) (174:5.3-9) (175:1.1,7) (175:2) (195:0.2,5)
		The Jews, as a nation left in accordance with purely human status, no longer bore the torch of divine truth to mankind after rejecting Jesus. (175:2.1) (175:3.2)
		The rejection of Jesus by the Jewish nation does not affect the status of any individual Jew before God; followers of Christ should not be prejudiced against Jews as fellow mortals. (175:2)
	the conflict
		The apostles discovered that stagnant Jews had turned truth into a creed, limiting its power to guide spiritual progress. (155:3.3)

		Jews generally advocated impartiality in trials, but in the case of the trial of Jesus, Caiaphas acted as prosecutor rather than impartial judge. (184:3.4,6) (184:4.1)
		Jesus, the last to afford real national leadership, was passive to Pilate's appeals and bore himself with simple dignity throughout the ordeal. (186:2.8)
chosen people, but spiritually
	Jews were famed for military valor and theologic peculiarities, spreading the Salem doctrine in Europe through their service as mercenary soldiers in Occidental military conflicts. (98:0.3)
	The children of Abraham found God as no other whole race of men, and despite their struggles, they progressively revealed a clearer and more truthful picture of the eternal God to the whole world. (155:6.10)
	Secular history has been disastrously exploited by Jewish and Christian writers, leading to the distortion of Hebrew history and the conversion of fiction into sacred history. (97:8.5-6) (97:9)
	The early Hebrew prophets saw God in almost everything that happened, but now we know better. (148:5.4) (156:5.4)
	At the time of Jesus' birth, the Jews were eminently fitted to spread a new religion due to favorable cultural and linguistic settings in the Greek-influenced world under Roman rule. (121:1.1)
	The truth about the Jewish people reveals that much sacred history is merely ordinary profane history, as Judaism served as the soil for Christianity to grow, but the Jews themselves were not a miraculous people. (97:9.29)
	The Jews did not fulfill their destiny as people with a spiritual mission due to their inability to break the fetters of tradition and their rejection of the new gospel of religious freedom and spiritual liberty. (121:2.8) (121:7.5) (175:1.5-6) (176:1.2) (182:3.9)
	The kingdom of heaven taken from the Jews is now given to those who will receive it with joy and gladness. (175:1.6) (175:2.1)
	The revelation of God's love and mercy brings about improved relations among all nations, as individuals are seen as children of God. (142:2.2,3) (145:2.4)
	Through national egotism, false faith in a misconceived promised Messiah, and the tyranny of the priesthood, the voices of spiritual leaders were silenced, yet the Jews never lost the concept of the Universal Father. (97:10.3)
daily life
	The father's custom of his son's ring symbolized forgiveness and restoration of his lost son. (169:1.9)
	Jewish children in the times of Jesus had a circumscribed play life, often mimicking the serious activities they witnessed their elders partaking in, such as weddings and funerals. (123:4.2)
	Jews had just inaugurated a compulsory education law, with pupils choosing a «birthday text» to guide them through studies, as exemplified by Jesus with Isaiah's words. (123:5.11)
	In Judaism, inheritance laws govern the distribution of possessions between siblings, highlighting the importance of responsibility and harmony within the family. (169:1.6)

	The Jews owned slaves and profaned the temple with an extensive system of banking and commercial exchange. (173:1.3) (186:1.2)
	The Jews objected to public nakedness, so the Romans provided a loin cloth for all crucified individuals at Jerusalem, including Jesus. (187:2.2)
political matters

	The Jews, descendants of the southern kingdom of Judah, sought to tarnish the reputation of their northern Israelite counterparts from Ephraim. (97:9.2)
	The Jewish people, under Roman suzerainty, enjoyed considerable self-government and eagerly awaited the arrival of the Messiah. (121:2.7)
	During the fore part of the first century after Christ, the Jews were the most influential Semitic people due to their strategic geographic position. (121:2.1)
	The survival of the kingdom of the Jews in Palestine was intricately tied to Roman foreign policy, aimed at maintaining control over crucial trade routes and preventing the rise of any power that could challenge their expansion in the region. (121:2.8) (128:5.3)
Jews, opposed to Gentiles
	The Jews had a settled concept of their history and destiny, creating a rigid separation from the gentile world and developing preconceived notions about the Messiah. (121:7.1)
	The great cultural stability of Jewish society lies in the strength of their family groups, where family devotion and natural affection far transcended that of gentiles. (84:7.1) (95:5.8) (121:3.10)
	Jesus greatly regretted that the Jews lacked humor, unlike the gentiles he encountered. (156:2.8)
	The history of ill-feeling with Samaritans shaped the relationship between Jews and Samaritans for centuries. (124:6.1) (137:7.11) (143:4) (164:1.4)
	The Jews, looked upon all others as Gentile dogs, due to their attitude of racial superiority and rigid wall of separation from the gentile world, struggled to accept Jesus' teachings about spiritual brotherhood. (121:2.8) (121:7.1-2) (164:1.2)
	Despite being rooted in Palestine, Jews were dispersed across the Roman world, with over 200 synagogues serving as cultural hubs for the early spread of Christianity. (121:2.3-4)

	conflict with the Romans
		Jews opposed taking a census, viewing it as unlucky and taboo, in line with their belief in avoiding superstitious practices. (88:1.6)
		Pilate's disfavor with the Jews stemmed from his failure to respect their deep-seated prejudice against all images, leading to a loss of prestige and submission to the whims of Jewish leaders. (185:1.3-4)
		Pilate's failure to understand the depth of the Jews' willingness to die for their religion led to his surrender to their demands. (185:1.1,3)
		The apocalyptists of Judaism taught that the sufferings of the Jews were a result of the nation's sins, predicting the end of Roman rule as the end of the world. (135:5.2)
persecutions against the Jews
	The Jews and early Christians resented emperor worship, leading to bitter persecutions by the Roman government. (121:5.4)
	Christian prejudice against Jews is inexcusable, as the rejection of Jesus by some long ago does not justify mistreating individual Jews today. (175:2)
	The Jews have endured the sorrows of a misunderstood and despised people, yet their persistent search for God has revealed an ever clearer picture of the eternal truth. (121:6.7) (155:6.10)

Judas Iscariot; Judas | (183) (139:12) (143:3.5) (144:1.7) (147:2.1) (151:2.8) (177:4) (178:2.6) (193:4) | apostles of Jesus | PERSON | OK
Judas Iscariot was the twelfth apostle. He was chosen by Nathaniel, and later confirmed in this election by Jesus. He was born in Kerioth, a small town in southern Judea. When he was a lad, his parents moved to Jericho, where he lived and had been employed in his father’s various business enterprises until he became interested in the preaching and work of John the Baptist. (139:6.2) (139:12.1-2)
Judas’s parents were Sadducees, and when their son joined John’s disciples, they disowned him. (138:2.9) (139:12.1)
When Nathaniel met Judas at Tarichea, he was seeking employment with a fish-drying enterprise at the lower end of the Sea of Galilee. He was thirty years of age in A.D. 26 and unmarried when he joined the apostles. He was probably the best-educated man among the twelve and the only Judean in the Master’s apostolic family. He was cultured, educated, and a good thinker, but he was not truly honest. (138:2.9) (139:12.1-2)
Judas was accepted by Jesus in the group of apostles along with Thomas, in Tarichea. When Jesus accepted Judas, he told him: “Judas, we are all of one flesh, and as I receive you into our midst, I pray that you will always be loyal to your Galilean brethren. Follow me.”. Judas was the only Judean. All the rest were from Galilee. (138:5)
His work as treasurer
	Andrew appointed Judas treasurer of the twelve, a position which he was eminently fitted to hold, and up to the time of the betrayal of his Master he discharged the responsibilities of his office honestly, faithfully, and most efficiently. He carried the bag. He paid all expenses and kept the books. He made budget estimates for Matthew from week to week and also made weekly reports to Andrew. Judas paid out funds on Andrew’s authorization. (138:8.1) (138:10.10) (139:12.3)
	Judas really was a great executive, a farseeing and able financier. And he was a stickler for organization. None of the twelve ever criticized Judas. As far as they could see, Judas Iscariot was a matchless treasurer, a learned man, a loyal, though sometimes critical, apostle, and in every sense of the word a great success. (139:12.5)
	Judas carried in a bag with the apostolic funds, and used to keep that bag in a deep pocket (186:1.3)
	Judas wisely made a deposit of the surplus of funds in a Jericho bank run by a friend. This deposit was there until the last year of Jesus' life. (147:2.1) (163:2.11) (172:2.3)
	David Zebedee turned over to Judas the funds realized from the sale of the equipment of the Pella encampment, and Judas placed the greater part of this money in Simon of Bethany's care. (172:2.3)
	Judas willingly gave all apostolic funds to David Zebedee before Jesus' death (178:2.10)
His criticism
	Judas did not get along with Nathanael. He once took his criticism of Nathanael to Jesus because he thought he didn't take his apostleship seriously, which earned him a rebuke from Jesus. (139:6.5)
	all the apostles, with the exception of Judas, succeeded in overcoming much of their prejudice against the Samaritans. (143:0.2)
	Judas, along with Peter, John, and Simon Zelotes, was in favor of proclaiming Jesus king. When Jesus did not live up to these expectations, he thought that he would be oppressed with regrets that he did not have the courage to be made king. (152:2.5) (153:0.2)
	Judas, with Simon Zelotes, attempted to heal James of Safed’s son, unsuccessfully (158:4.6)
	Judas Iscariot thought that Jesus had fled in haste into Phoenicia because he feared the Jewish leaders and Herod Antipas. (162:1.3)
	Of all the apostles, Judas Iscariot was the most adversely affected by the processional entry of Jesus into Jerusalem. (172:5.12-13)
	Judas did not realize it, but he had been a subconscious critic of Jesus ever since John the Baptist was beheaded by Herod. (138:5.4) (177:4.11)
	While his companions hesitated, Judas took a seat of honor at the Last Supper. (179:1.4)
	the washing of the feet during the last supper was further proof to Judas that Jesus was not Israel's deliverer and would never qualify to be. (179:3.1,4)
his relationship with Jesus
	Jesus advised Andrew to continue to place the utmost confidence in Judas despite his last acts. (157:7.1)
	Jesus did everything possible to save Judas (179:4.7)
	Judas was faith adventure to Jesus. From the beginning the Master fully understood the weakness of this apostle and well knew the dangers of admitting him to fellowship. (139:12.7) (177:4.10)
	At the last supper Jesus addressed his last words to Judas. He first warned him in a veiled way: “Although it is necessary that I return to the Father, it was not necessary for one of you to become a traitor to fulfill the will of the Father.” In view of the fact that Judas was determined in his purpose, he simply told him: “What you have decided to do, do it immediately.” (179:4)
	The words of encouragement in Bethany for Judas were: “Judas, I have loved you and have prayed that you would love your brethren. Be not weary in well doing; and I would warn you to beware the slippery paths of flattery and the poison darts of ridicule.” (174:0.2)
	Jesus warned the apostles of an impending betrayal, without indicating that it was Judas (153:5.4) (177:5.2) (179:3.6) (179:4) (180:6.1)
the betrayal
	Judas was always financially loyal to his Master and his fellow apostles. Money could never have been the motive for his betrayal of the Master. It was not for money that Judas went to the home of Caiaphas to arrange for the betrayal of Jesus. (139:12.5) (172:5.12) (177:4.4)
	The day that Mary, Lazarus' sister, broke an expensive jar of incense at the feet of Jesus seemed to Judas such a waste that when Jesus so sweepingly disallowed his public protest, it was too much for him, and this event determined the mobilization of all the accumulated hate, hurt, malice, prejudice, jealousy, and revenge of a lifetime, and decided Judas to take revenge (139:12.10-13) (153:1.5)
	Some relatives and Sadducees led Judas to believe that he would forthwith receive high honors from the Sanhedrin if he withdrew from the movement of Jesus and his “Galilean” followers. (177:4.2)
	in various situations that bothered Judas is when he began to seriously think about how to break with Jesus the apostles (172:5.12-13) (173:0.2) (175:4.1) (177:4.2)
	David Zebedee knew about Judas's plot to kill Jesus and so he tried to let the Master know, but he asked him to keep quiet. (178:2.3)
	the apostles only began to harbor suspicions of Judas' treachery when they were returning to the camp from the upper room (181:2.6) (182:0.2)
	Judas really feared for his life when going to capture Jesus, and for this reason he dared to ask for a company of forty armed soldiers, which the Jews had to request from Pilate. (183:2.3)
	Judas betrayed Jesus with a kiss on the brow while greeting him in front of the captive guards (183:3.5)
	both the temple guards and the Roman centurion showed deep contempt for Judas as the traitor (183:5.2-3) (186:1.2)
	Judas did not dare to enter the house of Annas but he was present at the trial of Jesus before the Sanhedrin and then before Pilate (184:2.1) (184:5.1) (185:0.1)
	Throughout the trial of Jesus before Caiaphas and during his appearance before Pilate, Judas was pricked in his conscience about his traitorous conduct. (186:1.2)
	The Sanhedrin rewarded Judas with a bag containing 30 pieces of silver, the current price for a healthy slave. (186:1.2)
	Seeing Jesus raised on the crossbar where he was nailed to the cross, he felt strong repentance and ran to the temple to deliver his reward money. (186:1.4)
causes of downfall (157:7.2-4) (193:4)

	* Judas was tremendously influenced by the ridicule of his Sadducean friends. (172:5.13)

	* his love grew cold, and he refused to trust his loyal brethren (193:3.2)
	* Despite Jesus' prohibition to enter Jerusalem without him, Judas encountered Jesus' enemies, exposing himself to their clever insinuations and subtle taunts. (175:4.1) (177:4) (178:0.1) (182:2.13) (183:2.1)
	* he persistently harbored grudges and fostered such psychologic enemies as revenge and the generalized craving to “get even” with somebody for all his disappointments; sought revenge for hurt feelings (139:6.5) (172:1.7) (177:4.4) (182:1.5) (193:4.2)
	* Judas was an only son of unwise parents. When very young, he was pampered and petted; he was a spoiled child. (139:12.6) (177:2.4)
	* He persistently refused to confide in, or freely fraternize with, his fellow apostles. (193:4.2-3)
	* When he was impelled, by the accumulation of his emotional conflicts, to seek relief, he sought the advice and the unwise consolation of his unspiritual relatives or those chance acquaintances who were either indifferent, or actually hostile, to the heavenly kingdom. (193:4.3)
	* Judas was self-satisfied and he dared to criticize Jesus often (139:12.4)
	* Judas was a well-intentioned but cowardly and self-centered personality (177:4.9,11) (183:2.2) (193:4.14)
his end
	After the terrible disappointment with the reward from the Sanhedrin, Judas committed suicide by attempting to hang himself from a tree in the Valley of Hinnom. The belt he used came undone and he died when he hit the rocks of the precipice. (139:12.13) (186:1)
