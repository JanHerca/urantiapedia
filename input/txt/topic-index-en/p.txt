Pain and suffering, essential to progressive evolution, inhibit activity and prompt biologic adaptations as anxiety reverts to the natural state of our savage ancestors. (86:2.1)

During the European “dark ages,” Christianity experienced a decline as it became more monasticized, asceticized, and legalized, while pantheism-like mysticism thrived. (195:4.1)
The corporeality error in pantheism denies the personality of God and leads to philosophical dilemmas. (1:5.11-12)
Recognizing Deity omnipotence brings security and assurance on the journey to Paradise, while accepting the fallacy of omnificence leads to the colossal error of pantheism. (118:6.8)

Of all the discourses the Master gave, the parable of the ten virgins by Selta on the Mount of Olives was the most confusing for his apostles. (176:2.8)
theory
	Jesus resorted to parables and symbols to prevent successors from crystallizing and dogmatizing his spiritual teachings. (179:5.4-5)
	The mysteries of the kingdom shall be presented in parables so that those who truly desire salvation may discern the teachings, while those seeking destruction will be confounded. (151:1.4)
	Parables appeal to vastly different levels of mind and spirit, promoting sympathy without stirring up hostility. (151:3.6-10) (165:2.2,7)
