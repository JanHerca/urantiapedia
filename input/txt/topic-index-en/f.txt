	In earliest times women were the property of the community, and the mother dominated the family. The mother-family was natural and biologic; the father-family is social, economic, and political. (69:9.7) (84:2.2)
	The red men clung to the mother-family and nephew inheritance. (71:1.7)
	Chinese tradition preserves the hazy record of the evolutionary past, the transition from mother- to father-family (79:8.15)
	The oncoming of wife stealing and later wife purchase hastened the passing of the mother-family. (84:2.6)
	Under the mother-family mores the wife’s mother enjoyed virtually supreme authority in the home; even the wife’s brothers and their sons were more active in family supervision than was the husband. (84:2) (84:2.3)
patriarchal families
	The clan peace chiefs usually ruled through the mother line; the tribal war chiefs established the father line. (70:4.10)
	The first real governmental body was the council of the elders.  This reign of the oligarchy of age gradually grew into the patriarchal idea. (70:5.2)
	Pastoral living tended to create a new system of mores, the patriarchal type of family life; and the basis of family unity under the herder and early agricultural mores was the unquestioned and arbitrary authority of the father. (84:2.4) (84:3)
nature of family
	Family life cannot be had without children; it can be lived without religion, but such a handicap enormously multiplies the difficulties of this intimate human association. (99:4.2)
	Whenever the mores fluctuate, there is fluctuation in the stability of the family. Now new mores are emerging: (84:7.1-7)
	# the new role of religion, the teaching that parental experience is essential
	# the new role of science in making procreation more voluntary and controlled
	# the new function of pleasure and the refusal to bear children
	# the improvement of parental instinct, which in each generation only leaves individuals with strong parental instinct
	The Edenic ideal, the whole family as gardeners, was a new idea on Urantia. (84:7.8)
	The advancing ideals of family life are leading to the concept that bringing a child into the world, instead of conferring certain parental rights, entails the supreme responsibility of human existence. (84:7.25)
	a true family—a good family—reveals to the parental procreators the attitude of the Creator to his children (84:7.30)
	The family was the first successful peace group, the man and woman learning how to adjust their antagonisms while at the same time teaching the pursuits of peace to their children. (68:2.8) (84:7.30)
	family members reap benefits and suffer consequences of others’ actions (12:7.11) (54:5.5) (54:6.3-4) (67:7) (145:2.8)
	Sex hunger and mother love establish the family. (70:3.2)
	the family is a temporal institution; that it does not survive death. Jesus did not hesitate to give up his family when the family ran counter to the Father’s will. (140:8.14)
family size
	The size of the family has always been influenced by the standards of living. The higher the standard the smaller the family, up to the point of established status or gradual extinction. (68:6.6)
	reasons ancients desired large families: (84:7.11-19)
	# They were valuable as labourers.
	# They were old-age insurance.
	# Daughters were saleable.
	# Family pride required extension of name.
	# Sons afforded protection and defence.
	# Ghost fear produced a dread of being alone.
	# Certain religions required offspring.
value of families
	almost everything of lasting value has roots in the family (68:2.8) (79:8.9) (140:8.14)
	Real families are built upon tolerance, patience, and forgiveness. (84:7.28) (142:7.11)
	earthly family illustrates the heavenly (142:7.4)
	The most effective of all social groups is the family, more particularly the two parents. The family is the master civilizer. (82:0.2) (160:2.4)
	a true family—a good family—reveals to the parental procreators the attitude of the Creator to his children, while at the same time such true parents portray to their children the first of a long series of ascending disclosures of the love of the Paradise parent (84:7.30)

famine; famines | | | | OK
Jesus asked his disciples not be perturbed by famines or earthquakes; neither be concerned when they were delivered up to the civil authorities and were persecuted for the sake of the gospel. (176:1.1)
hunger brought prodigal son of the parable to senses (169:1.8)
Man was taught to provide for the hazards of famine, which periodically decimated the world. (66:5.3)

fanaticism | | | | OK
the life purpose must be jealously guarded from the temptation to seek for easy and transient attainment; likewise must it be so fostered as to become immune to the disastrous threats of fanaticism. (160:3.5)
doctrinal fetish will lead mortal man to betray himself into the clutches of bigotry, fanaticism, superstition, intolerance, and the most atrocious of barbarous cruelties. (88:2.7)
overmuch sympathy and pity may degenerate into serious emotional instability; that enthusiasm may drive on into fanaticism (149:4.3)
strong spiritual faith so many times leads directly to disastrous fanaticism, to exaggeration of the religious ego (196:0.6-7)
we must prevent religious fanaticism by scientific mental attitude (99:3.14)
spiritual revelation often so blinds the creature as to precipitate a convulsion of fanaticism or to initiate some other intellectual upheaval which results disastrously. (110:4.5)

farewell salutations | | | | OK
Jesus is not given to farewell ceremonies:
* at the end of his first incarnation he took his leave suddenly and unceremoniously (119:5.3)
* leaving Rome he did not say goodbye to any of his friends (133:0.1)
* when he left Cana after the miracle of the wine he did not say goodbye to anyone (137:5.1)
Melchizedek merely bid his human companions goodnight before disappearing from his sight forever (93:8.1) (93:10.2)

Jesus wanted to have a farm but he did not achieve that dream. Even so, they had at home three cows, four sheep, many chickens, a donkey, pigeons, and a dog. (126:5.10-11)
Jesus’ mother’s brother had a farm on the Megiddo road near Sarid (123:1.7) (123:6.1) (124:1.2,11)
Jude the Jesus brother ran away to his uncle’s farm (128:7.8)

Salem missionaries penetrated all Europe, even to the British Isles. One group went by way of the Faroes to the Andonites of Iceland, (93:7.2)

fashion; dress | | | | OK
fashion is one of human institution of self-gratification, growing out of vanity proclivities and pride emotions (69:1.5)
the races never have been wholly liberated from the slavery of custom; fashion still unduly dominates Urantia. (66:6.2)

fasting | | self-denial | | OK
ancient ritual
	ancients treated disease with fasting (90:4.8)
	fasting can induce mystic state (100:5.10)
	Renunciation came as the next step in religious evolution; fasting was a common practice. (89:3.1)
	Next came the practice of ritual vows, soon to be followed by religious pledges and sacred oaths. Most of these oaths were accompanied by self-torture and self-mutilation; later on, by fasting and prayer. (87:6.16)
	Fasting and other forms of self-denial were thought to be pleasing to the ghosts, who took pleasure in the discomfort of the living (87:2.4)
	Sacrifice as a part of religious devotions, like many other worshipful rituals, did not have a simple and single origin. As civilization advanced, these crude concepts of sacrifice were elevated to the level of the rituals of self-abnegation, asceticism, fasting, deprivation, and the later Christian doctrine of sanctification through sorrow, suffering, and the mortification of the flesh. (89:4.1)
Isaiah
	For Isaiah, acceptable fasting was not afflicting the soul, bowing the head, or dressing in sackloth. What he asked was to loosen the bonds of wickedness, undo the knots of heavy burdens, let the oppressed go free, break every yoke, share bread with the hungry, bring home the homeless poor. (147:8.2-3)
Jesus
	Jesus ate frugally while on Mount Hermon; but he abstained from all food only a day or two at a time. (134:8.3)
	fasting is not part of gospel. Nazarites refused to accept Jesus as a teacher sent from heaven because he did not teach fasting and other forms of self-denial. Jesus said: “In the old order you fasted and prayed; as the new creature of the rebirth of the spirit, you are taught to believe and rejoice”. (142:8.1) (143:2.3) (147:7.2)
	it is most dangerous to knowingly engage in spiritual fasting in order to improve one’s appetite for spiritual endowments. Prolonged fasting, either physical or spiritual, tends to destroy hunger. (140:5.8)

The soul was generally thought of as being identified with the breath, but it was also located by various peoples in the head, hair, heart, liver, blood, and fat. (86:5.15)

fatalism; fatalists; fatalistic | | | | OK
The better Epicureans were not given to sensual excesses. At least this doctrine helped to deliver the Romans from a more deadly form of fatalism; it taught that men could do something to improve their terrestrial status. (121:4.2)
Unbelieving materialists and fatalists can hope to enjoy only two kinds of peace and soul comfort: Either they must be stoics, with steadfast resolution determined to face the inevitable and to endure the worst; or they must be optimists, ever indulging that hope which springs eternal in the human breast, vainly longing for a peace which never really comes. (181:1.7)
primitive religion prevented fatalism; they believed they could at least do something to influence fate. (86:7.3)
Jesus’ teaching to trust in the overcare of the heavenly Father was not a blind and passive fatalism. (140:8.2)

Fate | | | | OK
the concept of Fate prevented evolution of Zeus in Greece to true monotheism (98:1.3)

The monotheists keep their subordinate gods as spirits, demons, fates, Nereids, fairies, brownies, dwarfs, banshees, and the evil eye. (96:1.14)

he is always free to travel to other local universes in the interest of his order (35:1.4)
he created the local universe Melchizedek Sons in a creative act in union with the Creator Son and the Mother Spirit (20:1.10) (35:1.1)
he created the Spirongas in a creative act together with Gabriel (37:10.2)

fatherhood of God; Fatherhood of God; Fatherhood | | gospel:explained | | OK
The brotherhood of men is founded on the fatherhood of God. (16:9.14) (52:6.7) (134:4.1) (159:5.7) (195:8.11)
When all is said and done, the Father idea is still the highest human concept of God. (196:3.35)
The Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man present the paradox of the part and the whole on the level of personality. (12:7.8)
Fatherhood becomes, or may become, a universe reality to all moral creatures because the Father has himself bestowed personality upon all such beings and has encircuited them within the grasp of the universal personality circuit. (16:9.14)

Fatherlikeness | | divinity; spiritual growth | | OK
We will sometime realize that success in the quest of the Infinite is directly proportional to the achievement of Fatherlikeness, and that in this universe age the realities of the Father are revealed within the qualities of divinity. (106:9.11)

fathers | | child-rearing; children; family | | OK
Jesus stated that a true family is founded on the following seven facts: (142:7.5-12)
# The fact of existence. The children take origin in the parents
# Security and pleasure. True fathers take great pleasure in providing for the needs of their children.
# Education and training. Wise fathers carefully plan for the education
# Discipline and restraint. Farseeing fathers also make provision for the necessary discipline
# Companionship and loyalty. The affectionate father holds intimate and loving intercourse with his children.
# Love and mercy. A compassionate father is freely forgiving
# Provision for the future. Temporal fathers like to leave an inheritance for their sons.
we must call no man father in spiritual sense (175:1.10)
Children need fathers as well as mothers, and fathers need this parental experience as much as do mothers. (47:1.6)
The child must derive his first impressions of the universe from the mother’s care; he is wholly dependent on the earthly father for his first ideas of the heavenly Father. (177:2.5,7)
disciples must love gospel more than his father or mother (150:4.3) (171:2.2)
The earliest races gave little credit to the father, looking upon the child as coming altogether from the mother. (84:2.4)
become the head of a human family is a highly educational and disciplinary responsibility (126:2.2)
It is intended that mortals who start out from an inhabited world have the experience of recognizing seven fathers: (51:6.6-13)
# The biologic father — the father in the flesh.
# The father of the realm — the Planetary Adam.
# The father of the spheres — the System Sovereign.
# The Most High Father — the Constellation Father.
# The universe Father — the Creator Son
# The super-Fathers — the Ancients of Days
# The spirit or Havona Father — the Universal Father
Fathers are not like judges, enemies, or creditors. Real families are built upon tolerance, patience, and forgiveness. (142:7.11)

Jerusalem temple was called by Jesus “his Father’s house.” (125:1.1) (125:6.7) (171:4.7)

Jesus said that each of the many, many stations in his Father’s house, that is, the universe, is a stopping place, a life designed to prepare us for the next one ahead. (181:1.2)

Father’s prayer | | | | OK
Hap, the Planetary Prince assistant, taught Dalamatians the seven chants of worship and also gave them the daily praise-phrase and eventually taught them “the Father’s prayer,” which was: (66:5.14-15)
“Father of all, whose Son we honor, look down upon us with favor. Deliver us from the fear of all save you. Make us a pleasure to our divine teachers and forever put truth on our lips. Deliver us from violence and anger; give us respect for our elders and that which belongs to our neighbors. Give us this season green pastures and fruitful flocks to gladden our hearts. We pray for the hastening of the coming of the promised uplifter, and we would do your will on this world as others do on worlds beyond”

Father’s Way; Father’s way | | | | OK
The Father’s way is the exemplification of a farseeing ideal of creature life visualized by the high personalities of the Paradise administration of the universe of universes. (136:4.8)
Hap presented the early races with a moral law in Dalamatia. This code was known as “The Father’s Way” and consisted of the following seven commands: (66:7.8-16)
# No temerás ni servirás a ningún Dios, salvo al Padre de todos.
# No desobedecerás al Hijo del Padre, el soberano del mundo, ni mostrarás falta de respeto por sus asociados superhumanos.
# No mentirás cuando seas convocado ante los jueces del pueblo.
# No matarás a hombres, mujeres o niños.
# No robarás los bienes ni el ganado de tu prójimo.

favoritism; respecter of persons | | | | OK
Do not expect favoritism. In all our praying be fair; do not expect God to show partiality, to love you more than his other children, our friends, neighbors, even enemies. (91:4.3)
God is no respecter of persons, either spiritual or material. (1:4.6) (2:3.1) (12:7.1,8) (40:10.13) (133:0.3) (137:8.6) (138:8.2) (140:3.16) (143:1.5) (148:6.2) (155:6.2) (156:2.4) (166:4.11) (175:2.1-3) (181:2.14) (192:2.2)
Every son of God shares the fatherhood of God, and God loves each of his creature sons alike; he is no more a respecter of ascendant destinies than is he of the creatures who may attain such destinies. (40:10.5,13)
Joseph and Mary were sometimes tempted to show some kind of special favoritism for Jesus. But his parents were wise and sagacious. The few times they exhibit any preference for him in any way, even in the slightest degree, Jesus was quick to refuse all such special consideration. (124:3.2)

	the Caligastia's one hundred sought to substitute Creator fear for creature fear, or ghost worship (66:5.13)

	Fear has always been the basic religious stimulus. (86:0.2) (90:3.10) (92:1.4)
	“The ‘fear of the Lord’ has had different meanings in the successive ages, coming up from fear, through anguish and dread, to awe and reverence. Evolution of fear goes through awe, dread, dependence, and reverence, to the appreciative and affectionate regard of love. (149:6.3,6)
	Sooner or later the fear instinct fosters the establishment of these institutions of survival by means of taboo, convention, and religious sanction. (69:1.3)
	Two other emotions which drove human beings together and held them together were vanity and fear, more particularly ghost fear. (68:2.4) | ghosts

	early fear religion served a very valuable purpose in subduing the fiery tempers of the primitive creatures. (52:1.7)

fests; feasting | | banquets; Judaism:feasts | | OK

fellowship of believers | | Christianity; churches; faith sons of God; groups | | OK
The fellowship of believers is the true institution that Jesus came to establish on Urantia, also called the brotherhood of the kingdom of heaven or the spiritual fellowship in eternal realities. Jesus delivered his apostles and his successors the keys of the outward kingdom, that is, the authority over things temporal, the social and economic features of this association of men and women. But not about the whole association. (157:4.5)
Jesus declared that he who is not against us is with us. He warned against establishing unlimited administrative and jurisdictional control between groups of believers, which is just what happened with Christianity. (159:2.2)
The true church—the Jesus brotherhood—is invisible, spiritual, and is characterized by unity, not necessarily by uniformity. (195:10.11)
Jesus pledged full support for social and nonespiritual decissions of his apostles provided all agreed (144:6.3)
Jesus used the term fellowship of believers as synonim for kingdom of heaven (170:2.24)
this brotherhood of believers is destined to become a living organism in contrast to an institutionalized social organization. It may well utilize such social organizations, but it must not be supplanted by them. (195:10.11)
The kingdoms of this world, being material, may often find it necessary to employ physical force in the execution of their laws and for the maintenance of order, but this does not nullify the right of social groups of believers to maintain order in their ranks and administer discipline upon unruly and unworthy members. (159:1.3) (178:1.2)
no intellectual, social, and moral distinction should be made in the spiritual brotherhood of men when they come together to worship in the presence of God (133:0.3)
there should be no place for sectarian rivalry, assertions of moral superiority, or spiritual infallibility (182:1.8) (195:10.14)
Living associations, human families, social groups, or the Paradise Trinity are not augmented by mere arithmetical summation, is far in excess of the simple sum. (10:5.2) (68:1.4) (133:5.1)

fertility; fecundity | | barrenness | | OK
One of the most ancient forms of the wedding ceremony was to have a priest bless the wedding bed to insure the fertility of the union. It was the custom of many Near Eastern peoples to throw grain upon the newlyweds; this was a magical rite which was supposed to insure fecundity. Certain Oriental peoples used rice for this purpose. Childlessness was greatly dreaded, and since barrenness was attributed to spirit machinations, efforts to insure fecundity also led to the association of marriage with certain magical or religious ceremonials. (83:4.4-9)
primitive women desiring children embraced sturdy trees (85:2.3)

Confucius made a new fetish out of order and established a respect for ancestral conduct that is still venerated by the Chinese at present day (94:6.9)
the doctrine of spirit possession is nothing more nor less than fetishism. (88:0.1)
to protect them water holes, wells, trees, crops, and honey were considered fetishes (69:9.12)
Fetishism ran through all the primitive cults from the earliest belief in sacred stones, through idolatry, cannibalism, and nature worship, to totemism. (88:3.1)
fetishes made early market places secure against theft (69:4.3)
fetishes were many times mere symbols of the real object of worship. (85:1.3)
The technique of religious ritual passed from the forms of the primitive cult through fetishes to magic and miracles (90:0.1)
A fetish bag, a medicine bag, was a pouch containing a reputable assortment of ghost-impregnated articles, and the medicine man of old never allowed his bag, the symbol of his power, to touch the ground. (88:3.3)
When plants and fruits became fetishes, they were taboo as food. Apple was a fetish fruit. (88:1.3)
When animals became fetishes, there ensued the taboos on eating the flesh of the fetish animal. Fetish animals were dogs, apes, monkeys, snakes, birds, pigs and cows. (88:1.4-5)
examples
	The first fetishes were peculiarly marked pebbles, and “sacred stones” have ever since been sought by man. Certain days of the week were fetishes. Also the lucky numbers. (88:1.2,6)
	Saliva was a potent fetish. Parts of the human body were looked upon as potential fetishes, particularly the hair and nails. Hunchbacked and crippled children were regarded as fetishes; lunatics were believed to be moon-struck. (88:1.8-9)
	There was only one factor of a tribal, racial, or national nature about the primitive and unorganized beliefs of the desert, and that was the peculiar and general respect which almost all Arabian tribes were willing to pay to a certain black stone fetish in a certain temple at Mecca. (95:7.5)
	kings became fetish personalities and were inordinately feared, a special form of speech being adopted for court usage. (70:6.4-5)

Too often we engage in a fight merely to convince ourselves that we are not afraid. (160:3.4)
antiquity
	When the early chiefs would try to iron out misunderstandings, they often found it necessary, at least once a year, to permit the tribal stone fights. The clan would divide up into two groups and engage in an all-day battle. And this for no other reason than just the fun of it; they really enjoyed fighting. (70:1.6)
	since Eden Garden times play, humor and competitive substitutes for physical fighting were practiced (74:7.10)
Jesus
	Jesus never got into personal combat. Before any attack he first discriminated if the aggressor was a son of God, and he only applied force if that person did not possess moral judgment and spiritual reason. But if he were a son of God he would not use force or self-defense against him, and he would try to use any artifice to appease him. (124:2.4) (133:1.3-5) (140:8.4)
	When Jesus defended a slave girl in Crete from a drunken degenerate who was attacking her it is the closest Jesus ever came to a fight with a fellow, but thanks to his strong arms Jesus prevented the incident from escalating into something more. (130:5.4)

finaliters are the high spirit personalities who have actually completed the Paradise ascension, and who have returned to the very worlds where we are beginning this long journey, as the pledge of assurance that we may and can complete the stupendous undertaking
acting planetary chief of finaliters has the third seat in morontia temple, on the left of the Paradise Son seat (55:1.2)
One or more companies of the mortal finaliters are constantly in service on Urantia. There is no domain of universe service to which they are not assigned; they function universally and with alternating and equal periods of assigned duty and free service. (31:0.11)
Although the finaliters and their structures are not ordinarily perceptible to morontia vision, we will be more than thrilled when the energy transformers and the Morontia Power Supervisors enable us to glimpse them. (45:1.2) (47:1.3)
when a local universe is establish in light and life the finaliter corps, for the first time, acknowledges the jurisdiction of an extra-Paradise authority, the supreme council. Heretofore the finaliters have recognized no supervision this side of Paradise. (55:10.7)
Subsequent to our passage through the Paradise regime and after our admission to the Corps of the Finality, we are granted clearance for Sonarington since we are sons of God as well as ascenders—and we are even more. (13:2.6)
The finaliters are invisible to mortals, as also is the Prince-Sovereign except when in the morontia temple. (55:6.6) (55:7.2)

destiny
	Father-fused mortals are potential finaliters; their destination is the Universal Father, and him they do attain, but within the purview of the present universe age, finaliters, as such, are not destiny attainers. They remain unfinished creatures—sixth-stage spirits—and hence nonactive in the evolutionary domains of prelight-and-life status. When a mortal finaliter is Trinity embraced—becomes a Trinitized Son, such as a Mighty Messenger—then has that finaliter attained destiny, at least for the present universe age. (40:10.11-12)

When we become seventh-stage spirit beings, possibly we will give up our residential status on Paradise. (13:2.1)

	they may realize the supremacy and the ultimacy of God (5:5.11)
	it is speculated that finaliters, in eternity, were eventually to become the children of the Deity Absolute. And while they may be able to grasp the ultimate, absonite nature of the Father, it is believed they will never be able to attain the superultimate levels of absolute Deity. It may be possible that the finaliters will partially attain the Deity Absolute, but even if they should, still in the eternity of eternities the problem of the Universal Absolute will continue to intrigue.

Modern man no longer attempts openly to coerce the spirits, though he still evinces a disposition to bargain with Deity. And he still swears, knocks on wood, crosses his fingers, and follows expectoration with some trite phrase; once it was a magical formula. (87:6.17)

Andon, fire discoverer
	Andon’s philosophy had been most confused; he had barely escaped becoming a fire worshiper because of the great comfort derived from his accidental discovery of fire. (63:6.2)
	Andon had the idea of making fire with flint (63:2.4-7) (69:6.4) (81:2.9)
	using fire enabled Andon to defy climate and thus forever to be independent of their animal relatives of the southern lands (63:2.6)
	Though Andon, the discoverer of fire, avoided treating it as an object of worship, many of his descendants regarded the flame as a fetish or as a spirit. They failed to reap the sanitary benefits of fire because they would not burn refuse. (69:6.4)
	When asked where fire came from, the simple story of Andon and the flint was soon replaced by the legend of how some Prometheus stole it from heaven. (81:2.9)
benefits and dangers

	risen Jesus directed apostles from the shore to cast the net (192:1.3,7-8)

Adamites controlled floods in Mesopotamia for thousands of years. It was during the floodtimes that Susa so greatly prospered. Unprecedented floods on the Euphrates around 5,000 B.C. caused dozens of cities to be abandoned. (78:2.1) (78:7.2,6) (78:8.2)
floods destroyed Mediterranean civilization ca. 15,000 B.C. (78:3.7)
the greatest loss of life caused by a flood occurred with the sinking of the Sicily land bridge, which created a single Mediterranean Sea and connected it to the Atlantic Ocean (80:2.4)
as the Hebrew priests in Babylonian captivity sought to trace the Jewish people back to Adam, they found great difficulty in piecing the story together; and they let the whole world drown in its wickedness at the time of Noah’s flood, and thus to be in a better position to trace Abraham right back to one of the three surviving sons of Noah. (78:7.3-5)
floods made lowland Chinese cities untenable (79:6.4)
Mithraic legend included the story of a man escaped from a flood in a specillay built boat (98:5.3)

* 300 million years ago another great period of immersion of the land began, the Silurian floods. (59:3.1,9)
since Archeozoic ages there has never been a universal flood (78:7.4)
Noah really lived; he was a wine maker of Aram, a river settlement near Erech. He kept a written record of the days of the river’s rise from year to year. He brought much ridicule upon himself by going up and down the river valley advocating that all houses be built of wood, boat fashion, and that the family animals be put on board each night as the flood season approached. He would go to the neighbouring river settlements every year and warn them that in so many days the floods would come. Finally a year came in which the annual floods were greatly augmented by unusually heavy rainfall so that the sudden rise of the waters wiped out the entire village; only Noah and his immediate family were saved in their houseboat.

food; Food | | meat | | OK
primitive man
	Early man was a cannibal; he enjoyed human flesh, and therefore he offered it as a food gift to the spirits and his primitive gods. (87:2.9) (89:5.2)
	the combination of the wheat, rice, and vegetable diet with the flesh of the herds marked a great forward step in the health and vigor of these ancient peoples. (81:1.8)
	Food hoarding developed self-control and created the first problems of capital and labor. (69:5.1)
	Two great influences which contributed to the early association of human beings were food hunger and sex love (68:2.4) (68:3.4)
	in primitive times, sometimes a line of hunger march would be ten miles long as it passed over the land gleaning food. (68:5.3)
	Food was preserved by cooking, drying, and smoking; it thus became the earliest property. (66:5.3)
	Onagar’s missionaries were the first human beings to cook meat, the first regularly to use fire in the preparation of food.  (63:6.7)
	Prince’s staff taught food preservation (66:5.2-3)
Adamites
	Primitive man was for the most part carnivorous; Adamites do not eat meat, but their offspring within a few generations usually gravitate to the omnivorous level, although whole groups of their descendants sometimes remain nonflesh eaters. (52:3.8-9)
	The eating of meat was early introduced into the second garden, but Adam and Eve never partook of flesh as a part of their regular diet. (76:3.7)
Jesus

	Palestinians of Jesus times ate two meals per day, and sometimes in a pause a refreshment (166:4.1)

	All forms of force and all phases of energy seem to be encircuited; they circulate throughout the universes and return by definite routes. (11:5.8)
	Whatever the transformations of force in the outlying universes, having gone out from Paradise, it journeys on subject to the never-ending, ever-present, unfailing pull of the eternal Isle, obediently and inherently swinging on forever around the eternal space paths of the universes. (12:8.3)
material and spiritual force
	All physical force, energy, and matter are one. (11:5.9) (42:4.1-2)

divine forgiveness
	The Father is who blots out transgressions for his own sake (97:7.10)
	There is never a closure of the Father’s heart to the need and the petition of his children. (5:1.11)
	Divine forgiveness is inevitable; it is inherent and inalienable in God’s infinite understanding, in his perfect knowledge of all that concerns the mistaken judgment and erroneous choosing of the child. (2:5.4) (97:7.7) (131:2.11) (174:1)
	love of Jesus is what forgives sins (147:5.5) (148:9.2-3) (188:5.2)
	no forgiveness exists for deliberate blasphemy against God. When men go so far as knowingly to ascribe the doings of God to the forces of evil, such deliberate rebels will hardly seek forgiveness for their sins. (153:4.3) (165:3.6)
	our forgiveness is personally available if we forgive our fellow men (144:3.6) (146:2.4) (170:2.23) (170:3.4-5) (188:4.13)
	Said Isaiah: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow (97:5.2) (131:2.10) (156:2.7)
	Jesus taught them to preach the forgiveness of sin through faith in God without penance or sacrifice, and that the Father in heaven loves all his children with the same eternal love. He said: If you confess your sins, they are forgiven (89:10) (138:8.2) (156:2.7)
iniquiters
	persistent workers of iniquity will never seek nor receive forgiveness, they are guilty of the sin of eternally rejecting divine forgiveness. (153:4.3)
	all manner of sins may be forgiven, but it is doubt whether the established iniquiter would ever sincerely experience sorrow for his misdeeds or accept forgiveness for his sins. (67:1.6)
Michael’s attitude
	Early in the days of the Lucifer rebellion, salvation was offered all rebels by Michael. (53:9.1)
	he offered Lutentia, the first rebel System Sovereign in Nebadon, the privilege of sharing system throne if he would only apologize (119:2.5)
	repentant universe rebels will be rehabilitated, but may not serve in original positions wherein they defaulted (35:9.10) (35:10.4) (67:4.7)
	Jesus pronounced a beautiful sermon about forgiveness: “If a kindhearted man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, does he not immediately leave the ninety and nine and go out in search of the one that has gone astray?  I declare that there is more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety and nine righteous persons who need no repentance”. (159:1)
nature of forgiveness
	is Godlike. This capacity to understand man’s nature and forgive his apparent wrongdoing is Godlike. (174:1.4)
	forgiveness provides salvation (188:5.3)
	The forgiveness does not have to be sought, only received as the consciousness of re-establishment of loyalty relations between the creature and the Creator. (89:10.6)
	forgiveness takes away bonds of sin (131:5.5)
practicing forgiveness
	forgiveness of love transcends forgiveness of mercy (188:5.2)
	How many times do we have to forgive? Jesus said, "Not only seven times, but seventy times and seven." That is, the more, the better, because the more forgiveness we give, the more we will receive. (159:1.4-7)
	If someone irritates us, causes feelings of resentment, we should sympathetically seek to discern his viewpoint, his reasons for such objectionable conduct. (100:4.4)
	The triumph of the death on the cross is all summed up in the spirit of Jesus’ attitude toward those who assailed him. He made the cross an eternal symbol of the triumph of love over hate and the victory of truth over evil when he prayed, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do” (187:2.4) (188:5.6)
	Understanding relationships associated with attitudes of love effectively prevent all those estrangements which later necessitate the readjustment of repentance by the child with forgiveness by the parent. (174:1.2)
	A loving parent experiences little difficulty in forgiving his child, even many times. (140:5.17)
	If your brother sins against you, go to him and with tact and patience show him his fault. And do all this between you and him alone. If your brother will not hear you, go again with one or two friends. If he refuses to hear, then tell the story to the congregation. (159:1.3)
	we must release our friends from wrong they have done us (131:4.5-6)
	we must not resist evil treatment of one’s personality, evil injury to one’s feelings of personal dignity (141:3.8)
	Spirit of Truth endows us with power to forgive personal injuries (194:3.12)
	Jesus taught to preach the forgiveness of sin through faith in God (138:8.2) (167:5.2) (170:3.3)
	understanding neighbor makes forgiveness easier (2:4.2)
	Zebedee sons apologized to apostles and were restored to the good graces of their brethren. (171:0.6)
primitive men
	primitives would give feasts to wipe out dishonor from one's name (69:5.12)

Man cannot choose beyond the range of that which is choosable. Man does not have unfettered free will; there are limits to his range of choice, but within the radius of this choice his will is relatively sovereign. (118:6.5) (118:9.2)
Will is that manifestation of the human mind which enables the subjective consciousness to express itself objectively and to experience the phenomenon of aspiring to be Godlike (130:2.10)

The endowment of imperfect beings with freedom entails inevitable tragedy, and it is the nature of the perfect ancestral Deity to universally and affectionately share these sufferings in loving companionship. (110:0.1)
free will, joined to self-consciousness, is an exclusive endowment of personalities (16:8.5)
Father’s gift of personality makes mortals self-conscious and, relatively, self-determinative and self-creative (5:6.6)
it is a fixed policy of universe law not to infringe free will (39:3.3) (53:4.4-7)
No human being will ever be spiritualized by a divine Monitor against his will; survival is a gift of the Gods which must be desired by the creatures of time. Morontia mind is a term signifying the substance and sum total of the co-operating minds of diversely material and spiritual natures. And with mortals this is a will, human in origin, which is becoming divine through man’s identification of the human mind with the mindedness of God. (110:2) (118:6.3-7)

The relative free will is involved in moral decision, truth discernment, unselfish love, purposeful cooperation, cosmic insight, personality dedication, worship (16:8.7-14)

	Choice becomes increasingly liberated as the universes are ascended; choice eventually approximates divine freedom when the ascending personality achieves divinity of status, supremacy of consecration to the purposes of the universe (118:7.8)
	will is maximated decision. Will is the deliberate choice of a self-conscious being which leads to decision-conduct based on intelligent reflection. (107:7.3) (130:2.7,10)
	Material mind is the arena in which human personalities live, are self-conscious, make decisions, choose God or forsake him, eternalize or destroy themselves. (111:1)
	We are not given unrestricted choice as to our future course; but we may choose within some limits. The spirit world is governed on the principle of respecting our freewill choice provided the course we may choose is not detrimental to us or injurious to our fellows. (48:6.6,25)
	free will is the range of choice necessary to enjoy universe progression by making contact with reality (118:7.3)
	Our will is relatively free and hence determines our actions. (7:0.5) (118:6.4-7)
	During life our mortal will, the personality power of decision-choice, is resident in the material mind circuits; as our terrestrial mortal growth proceeds, this self, with its priceless powers of choice, becomes increasingly identified with the emerging morontia-soul entity; after death and following the mansion world resurrection, our personality is completely identified with the morontia self. (111:3.2)
ordained by Father and not imposed

	we mortals are subjects of predestination, but it is not foreordained that we must accept this divine predestination; we are at full liberty to reject any part or all of the Thought Adjusters’ program (110:2.1) (118:7)
	The very fact that an evil-doing creature can actually choose to do wrong—commit sin—establishes the fact of free-willness and fully justifies any length delay in the execution of justice provided the extended mercy might conduce to repentance and rehabilitation. (54:4.3)

The impulse of friendship transcends all convictions of duty, and the service of a friend for a friend can never be called a sacrifice. (180:1.6)

	# Friendship enhances the joys and glorifies the triumphs of life. 
	# Difficulties, sorrow, disappointment, and defeat are more painful and disheartening when borne alone.
how make friends
	If we truly desire to overcome the habit of criticizing some friend, the quickest and surest way of achieving such a change of attitude is to establish the habit of praying for that person every day of our life. (91:5.3-5)
	men enrich the soul by pooling their respective spiritual possessions (27:3.4) (160:2.7)
	he who would have friends must be friendly (193:3.2)
	what one could do to make friends? Jesus said: “Become interested in your fellows; learn how to love them and watch for the opportunity to do something for them which you are sure they want done” (130:7.2)
	Jesus always made them feel at ease in his presence. Perhaps his great secret in getting along with them consisted in the twofold fact that he was always interested in what they were doing, while he seldom offered them advice unless they asked for it. (129:1.9) (132:5.2,14)
	Some degree of moral affinity and spiritual harmony is essential to friendship between two persons; a loving personality can hardly reveal himself to a loveless person. (1:6.5)
	You cannot really know a person as the result of a single contact. (12:9.2)
	The more fully we bestow ourselves upon our fellows, the more we come to love them (129:0.2)

frogs were the ancestors of land vertebrates (60:0.2)
ancestral frog almost died. Had the ancestral frog of all humanity jumped two inches less on a certain occasion, the whole course of evolution would have been markedly changed. (62:3.9) (65:3.3)
From the briny waters of the seas there crawled out upon the land snails, scorpions, and frogs. They sprang suddenly from fish family (59:5.6,23) (65:2.6)
Among the land animals the frogs reached their climax in the preceding age and rapidly declined, but they survived because they could long live even in the drying-up pools and ponds of these far-distant and extremely trying times. They evolved into prereptiles in Permian (59:6.8)
frogs are the only remaining group representative of man’s earlier ancestors. (61:2.6) (65:2.6-7)
There is a saying about the importance of instilling loyalty in children: The quickest way for a tadpole to become a frog is to live loyally each moment as a tadpole. (100:1.4)

	fruits were abundant in Cretaceous (60:3.19)
Spiritual fruits
	Jesus used to say: the Father requires of you only that you shall bear much fruit. (180:2.1) (193:2.2)
	True, many apparently religious traits can grow out of nonreligious roots. Man may graft many purely humanistic branches onto his basic spiritual nature, a godless religion. In such a mortal experience only social fruits are forthcoming, not spiritual. The graft determines the nature of the fruit, notwithstanding that the living sustenance is drawn from the roots of original divine endowment of both mind and spirit. (102:7.4)
	we must bring forth fruit worthy. Every tree that brings not forth good fruit is destined to be cut down and cast into the fire. (135:6.7) (166:4.9)
	By their fruits we shall know people. Every good tree brings forth good fruit, but the corrupt tree bears evil fruit. (140:3.19) (140:8.22) (142:5.2) (153:4.4)

Religious experience unfailingly yields the “fruits of the spirit” in the daily life of the spirit-led mortal. (5:2.4,6) (99:5.6) (155:6.15)
The convincing evidence of this spiritual certainty consists in the social fruits of the spirit which such believers, faithers, yield as a result of this genuine spiritual experience. (102:6.7)
the Father requires of us only that we shall bear much fruit. (180:2.1) (193:2.2)
God’s will become increasingly discernible in the spirit fruits which are borne in the lives of the spirit-led children of God (12:7.7)
we must bring forth the fruits of the Father’s spirit if we would continue to ascend in the progressive life of the divine fellowship (140:1.4)
defined as
	the fruits of the spirit are the essence of the highest type of enjoyable and ennobling self-control, even the heights of terrestrial mortal attainment—true self-mastery (143:2.8)
	fruits of the spirit are life reactions of spirit-led mortal (34:6.13)
	fruits of the spirit are simply traits which Jesus manifested in his own earthly lif (194:3.1)
	The fruits of the spirit are the substance of the Supreme as he is realizable in human experience. (117:6.17)

Matthew received freely tendered offerings from believing disciples and the immediate auditors of the Master’s teachings, but he never openly solicited funds from the multitudes. (139:7.8)

funerals; funeral | | | | OK
The funeral service originated in man’s effort to induce the ghost soul to depart for its future home, and the funeral sermon was originally designed to instruct the new ghost how to get there. (87:2.3)
when a wealthy man died, fearing that their property would be confiscated, the funeral was held up until the family donated a large sum to public welfare or to the king, an inheritance tax (69:9.6)
Egyptians believed preservation of body facilitated passage through future life (95:2.4-5)
Only kings and the rich were promised a resurrection; therefore did they so carefully embalm and preserve their bodies in tombs against the day of judgment. (95:5.13)
Almost every group had a different idea regarding the destiny of the ghost soul. The Chinese and Egyptians once believed that soul and body remained together. Among the Egyptians this led to careful tomb construction and efforts at body preservation. Even modern peoples seek to arrest the decay of the dead. (86:4.8)
Ancient funeral wastes were enormous. Modern man is not supposed to fear ghosts, but custom is strong, and much terrestrial wealth is still consumed on funeral rituals and death ceremonies. (87:2.10)
religion has unduly impoverished life for the pretended enrichment of death (92:3.7)
On worlds settled in light and life, “funerals” are occasions of supreme joy, profound satisfaction, and inexpressible hope. (55:2.5-6)

Many of the fungi represent a retrograde movement in evolution, being plants which have lost their chlorophyll-making ability and have become more or less parasitic. (65:2.3)

fusion; Fusion | | | | OK
Perfected creature existence can be attained, sustained, and eternalized by the fusion of self-conscious mind with a fragment of the pre-Trinity spirit endowment of some one of the persons of the Paradise Trinity, either Father, Son, or Spirit (56:3.5)
In the fusion experience there is no overlapping; the will creature is either Spirit fused, Son fused, or Father fused. Those who are Adjuster or Father fused are never Spirit or Son fused. (37:5.1) (40:9.1)
Adjuster fusion
	Fusion with an Adjuster or other such fragment constitutes the creature a Father-fused being. (30:1.100)
	The achievement of the seven cosmic circles does not equal Adjuster fusion. (110:7.1)
	When a human being has completed the circles of cosmic achievement, and further, he has realized the final choosing of the mortal will then the fusion of the Adjuster and the morontial soul happens
	Almost 90% of the inhabited worlds of Nebadon are peopled with Adjuster-fusion mortals in contrast with a near-by universe where scarcely 50% of the worlds harbor beings who are Adjuster-indwelt candidates for eternal fusion. (49:5.31)
	where it happens
		Fusion with the Adjuster is usually effected while the ascender is resident within his local system. It may occur on the planet of nativity as a transcendence of natural death; it may take place on any one of the mansion worlds or on the headquarters of the system; it may even be delayed until the time of the constellation sojourn; or, in special instances, it may not be consummated until the ascender is on the local universe capital. (30:4.20-21) (40:8.1) (112:7.3)
		some mortals fail to fuse with Adjuster without error due to the mortal. Then the Adjuster leaves, and upon this leave-taking the morontia mortal is immediately fused with an individualized gift of the spirit of the Creator Son. (40:8.3)
		The spirits of mortal fusion always ascend to the level of origin; such spirit entities unfailingly return to the sphere of primal source. (40:10.1)
	ceremony
		the fusion ceremony is very simple. The morontia associates of the survivor say,  “This is a beloved son in whom I am well pleased,” and this marks the entry of the ascending mortal into the eternal career. (47:8.4)
	after fusion
		Adjusters are without form until after fusion (42:12.10)
		Adjusters share our destiny and experience; they are us (110:7.4-5) (112:7.10)
		Immediately upon the confirmation of Adjuster fusion the new morontia being is introduced to his fellows for the first time by his new name and is granted the forty days of spiritual retirement (47:8.5) (136:2.6)
		Such fused beings are twofold in their universe reactions: They are discrete morontia individuals not altogether unlike seraphim, and they are also beings in potential on the order of the Paradise finaliters. (112:7.7)
		With Adjuster fusion begins the human attempt to realize and to actualize the limitless possibilities that are inherent in the supernal partnership with God which has thus factualized. (112:7.14)
		After the fusion of the immortal morontia soul and the associated Adjuster, all of the experience and all of the values of the one eventually become the possession of the other, so that the two are actually one entity. The mortal gains Adjuster’s memory of all previous mortal indwellings (110:7.4,5) (112:7.1)
		When fusion with the Adjuster has been effected, there can be no future danger to the eternal career of such a personality. (40:7.5) (112:7.4)
		mortals are denominated ascending sons after fusion (40:6.1)
	defined as
		fusion is the act of breaking fetters of time (118:5.2)
		union with Adjusters is what confers oneness of soul with God and eternal life (40:6.1) (40:7.1) (107:2.7)
		fusion with the indwelling Thought Adjuster equals everlasting self-identification with total and indestructible reality (116:7.5)
		it is the personality synthesis of man and the essence of God; the factual experience of eternal union with God as a universe associate of Deity; inner union with indwelling God fragment (101:6.6) (107:0.4) (111:5.6)
		it is the irrevocable choice for eternal career (5:1.11) (110:7.1) (111:3.1) (112:7.5-6)
		fusion with the Thought Adjuster marks our mortal’s third jubilee (27:7.8)
		celestial fusion is that never-ending blending of identity, that oneness of being which is so perfect and final that even the most experienced personalities can never segregate or recognize as separate identities the fusion partners (110:1.6) (112:7.8)
		Fusion is the secret of the sacred sphere of Ascendington, and no creature, save those who have experienced fusion with the spirit of Deity, can comprehend its true meaning (112:7.2)
		fusion is the union of soul with Adjuster (47:8.4)
	fusion during mortal life | translation
		Enoch was the first person on Urantia to achieve fusion during his earthly life (45:4.13)
		Elijah the prophet fused during his life in the flesh (45:4.15)
		Jesus attained perfect synchrony with Adjuster prior to baptism (136:2.2)
		Ordinarily, when a mortal of the realm attains such high levels of personality perfection, there occur those preliminary phenomena of spiritual elevation which terminate in eventual fusion of the matured soul of the mortal with its associated divine Adjuster. (136:2.3-6)
		glorified beings of final phases on an evolving planet are exempt from passing through the portals of death; they are submitted to Son seizure; they are translated from among the living and appear immediately in the presence of the Sovereign Son on the headquarters of the local universe. (49:6.18-21) (55:2.9)
		This experience of translation from the material life to the morontia state—fusion of the immortal soul with the indwelling Adjuster—increases in frequency commensurate with the evolutionary progress of the planet. During the era of light and life translation from living happens in morontia temple (55:2.2-5)

experiential Deities are future eternals from the time when, and as, they power-personalize in the growing universes by the technique of the experiential actualization of the associative-creative potentials of the eternal Paradise Deities (0:7.1-5)
God the Supreme and God the Ultimate, now evolving in the experiential universes, are not existential—not past eternals, only future eternals, time-space-conditioned and transcendental-conditioned eternals. They will never have an end, but they do have personality beginnings. (0:9.5)
