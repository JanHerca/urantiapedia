rabbis; rabbi; Rabbi | | Judaism | | OK
These self-centered rulers, desiring to be called rabbi, crave honor from men while secretly exploiting others for gain. (175:1.9)
Jesus, the Rabbi, led these believers to be unafraid of his divinity, fostering a bond of friendship with God incarnate in human form. (137:7.2) (142:2.1,5) (142:6.3)
Only a rabbi was qualified to act as a judge in matters brought for adjudication. (173:2.3)
The rabbis, known as Pharisees, called themselves the “associates” and embraced teachings like the resurrection of the dead from the later prophet Daniel, alongside scribes. (137:7.6)

race commissioners | | | ORDER | OK
The High Commissioners begin their service as race commissioners, devoted to interpreting viewpoints and advocating for the needs of various human races on planets. (37:5.5-6)
Race commissioners function as the devoted spokesmen of mortal races, seeking mercy, justice, and fair treatment in planetary crises, while racial interpreters harmonize varied viewpoints and social tendencies among different human races. (37:5.5) (48:6.22)
The race commissioners on Urantia work closely with the Vorondadek observer, who exercises authority over planetary problems under the control of the Most Highs of Edentia since the Lucifer rebellion. (114:4.2)

races | (64) (51:4) | eugenics; genetics; tribes | RACE | OK
appearance
	The skeletal structure is more reliable for determining racial origins, with five distinct types in the early development of the Urantia races. (81:4.3-8)
	As the evolutionary races of color emerge, primitive man begins to develop language and exercise creative imagination, while also adapting to standing erect. (52:1.2)
	The human will preceded the evolutionary races of color with the appearance of the earlier Andonites on Urantia. (64:6.2)
	The human race originated almost one million years ago, with the arrival of the Planetary Prince marking the beginning of the six colored races and the Old Stone Age. (64:0.2)
	The colored descendants of the Sangik family were tested by the hardships of the glacial age as they sought opportunities for expansion into adjacent territory. (64:7.1)
	The Sangik family, ancestors of the six colored races of Urantia, emerged in the northwestern highlands of India 500,000 years ago, leading to a great racial struggle resulting in their unique skin colors and exceptional intelligence. (64:5-6)
	The superior races sought northern or temperate climes, while the orange, green, and indigo races gravitated to Africa over the newly elevated land bridge. (64:7.13)
	Those races seldom advanced in tropics, preferring instead to utilize their unearned leisure for ease rather than civilization. (81:6.7)
	Primitive men evolve successively in order of spectrum colors from red to indigo, developing language and creative imagination along the way. (52:1.1-2)
	500,000 years ago, during the fifth advance of the ice, a new development accelerated the course of human evolution as the six colored races suddenly mutated from the aboriginal human stock. (61:7.4)
	The six colored races usually appear sequentially, not in one family, but on an average evolutionary planet like Urantia they emerged simultaneously from a single human family. (64:6.1) (65:4.7)
	The intense nationalism of the great age of racial dispersion stems from color being the basis of primitive national groupings, leading to racial struggles and tribal wars persisting into the current dispensation but with decreasing frequency and severity. (52:2.5)
	Distinct racial types and very definite social tendencies characterize each race, requiring racial interpreters to harmonize varied viewpoints for human unity. (48:6.22) (155:6.8)
	The Sangik races, Adamites, and Nodites were all belligerent, but the Andonites embraced the golden rule, promoting peace and harmony. (70:1.2)
	From the diverse tribes near the Prince's headquarters, the first students of the early schools of Dalamatia were recruited, offering education to all colors and strata of human beings in that primitive age. (66:3.7)
	The dispersal of the early colored races, from the Sangik family, was shaped by the advance and retreat of glaciers, influencing their migration and blending across continents. (64:7)
interbreeding | hybridization
	Early racial development shows a slight tendency for red, yellow, and blue men to interbreed, alongside a similar tendency for orange, green, and indigo races to intermingle. (51:4.5)
	Half-breeds face chief troubles due to social prejudice amidst increasing racial hybridization on Urantia. (82:6.8)
	Homogeneity of humanity should not be pursued until individuals reach advanced spiritual enlightenment. (64:6.35)
	A balanced and sustainable civilization relies on the reproduction of superior racial stocks over inferiors, ensuring the preservation of a polyglot culture that benefits from race mixture between the highest types. (79:2.7) (82:6.4)
	Interbreeding between different races can lead to stronger and better offspring if they carry superior inheritance factors, however, on a large scale, under current circumstances, it would be most detrimental. (51:5.7) (64:6.32) (82:6.7-9)
	The composite races of mankind today have resulted from blending and reblending of the five basic human stocks of Urantia, leading to a complex and varied physical and skeletal structure across different racial groups. (81:4) (82:5.1) (82:6)
	The successful Pitcairn experiment blended white and Polynesian races, resulting in positive outcomes due to the high quality of the racial strains involved. (82:6.9)
	The Semites, well-organized and blended, united with Babylonians and Chaldeans to form a superior group of mixed, advanced horsemen. (96:2.1)
problems associated with races
	The complex admixture of higher human races on Urantia poses challenges for Adjusters in their efficient work. (111:7.4)
	The plan of promoting higher types of mortals and restricting the multiplication of mentally defective and socially unfit individuals helps in purifying the races from the curse of deteriorated, antisocial, feeble-minded, and outcast specimens. (52:2.9-12) (82:6.4-7)
	The existence of multicolored races on Urantia presents a significant obstacle to realizing the planet's high potential of light and life. (55:3.21-22)
	The natural antipathy between races hindered the achievement of racial harmony and social co-operation, despite the efforts of the spirits of brotherhood. (39:5.4) (64:7.2) (79:5.4)
	The post-Adamic epoch heralds an era of internationalism where the brotherhood of man materializes through race blending, leading to universal peace and cooperation with a common language. (52:3.10)
	The relentless warfare of primitive races sometimes leads to the obliteration of whole peoples, culminating in intense nationalism and racial dispersion. (52:1.3) (52:2.5)
	The diverse races on Urantia serve as a significant obstacle to achieving planetary unity and enlightenment. (55:3.21,22)
	Segregation, favored by many languages, perpetuates racial struggles and tribal wars as different races develop separate languages and seek isolation. (52:2.5)
	The origin of slavery among races is due to more progressive races employing backward humans as laborers, subduing and reducing them to servitude or sometimes even exterminating them. (51:4.6)
reason for creation of races
	The reason for the creation of races is to provide variety for natural selection, stronger interbreeding, stimulate competition, develop tolerance, and avoid homogeneity until spiritual development is high. (64:6.30-35)
	Race and climate were the decisive factors in the evolution of culture in southwestern Asia and the Andite era. (81:6.4)
	Competition is healthfully stimulated by diversification of races. (64:6.33)
	Interbreeding with superior inheritance factors can create stronger and better races, but attempting this on Earth would be disastrous due to current racial conditions. (64:6.32)
	Race mixture improved the quality of offspring, leading to the restriction of sex relations among near relatives and the disappearance of inbreeders as outbred individuals thrived in a hostile world. (82:5.1)
	The evolution and amalgamation of colored races offers an otherwise unattainable expression of diverse human potentials, benefiting the progress of mankind as a whole when upstepped by the imported Adamic or violet race. (51:4.4)
	The Life Carriers separate warlike man into distinct races to prevent conflict and promote peace. (63:4.9)
	Variety is indispensable for natural selection to enable the differential survival of superior strains. (64:6.31)
help with races
	Twenty-four counselors represent all eight Urantia races on the advisory council assembled nineteen hundred years ago. (45:4.2)
	Adamic blood, upstepping mortal nature, better prepares for Spirit of Truth to bring forth character fruits of the spirit. (34:7.1)
	Angels tirelessly conserve all races on Urantia, regardless of politics or religion. (114:6.9)
	The Memory of Mercy documents the divine forgiveness granted to all races, ensuring their spiritual survival and redemption. (28:6.5)
	The era post-Planetary Prince sees racial struggles diminish as races achieve physical and intellectual perfection through dispersion and nationalism, culminating in isolation based on color and language. (52:2.5,9,11)
	Representatives from each race welcomed Adam at the formal reception on the great mound. (74:2.5)
	Resurrection halls in mansonia number one have separate wings for each of the seven races of time, housing one hundred thousand personal resurrection chambers in each wing, culminating in circular class assembly halls. (47:3.5)
	Indigo peoples are spiritually equal before God with all other earthly races. (64:6.27) (134:4.7) | God:God’s nature
types | Adamites; Andonites; blue race; brown race; green race; indigo race; Nodites; orange race; red race; Sangiks; white race; yellow race
	Human races today can be divided into three main classes - Caucasoid, Mongoloid, and Negroid - representing a blend of various ancestral lineages that have evolved over the last twenty thousand years. (81:4.10-14)
	primary Sangik races
		The superior evolutionary races are red, yellow, and blue, while the secondary races are orange, green, and indigo. (49:4.2) (51:4.3) (64:7.3)
	secondary Sangik races
		On Earth, the most cosmopolitan population contains a mixture of red, yellow, and blue races, with many green, orange, and indigo races migrating to Africa. (49:4.2) (64:7.3)
		The primary Sangik races of blue, red, and yellow were superior, but the secondary races possessed desirable traits that could enhance them. (82:6.2,11)
		Secondary races are missing or exterminated on many worlds, with the superior red, yellow, and blue races prevailing on those having all six evolutionary races. (51:4.3)
present and future
	There are no pure races remaining today; all races have become admixed with extinct colored peoples, except for the yellow man and the black man, who have the most distinct lineage. (82:6.1)
	Jesus personally contacted all races on his Caspian Sea trip except the red, gaining a better understanding of Far-Eastern peoples and sharing the living truth with receptive Europeans and Asiatics. (134:2.3)
	Peter, James, and Andrew were tasked by Jesus to evaluate applicants for the school of evangelists, where students from all races learned and taught by the sea, blending theory and practice. (148:1.1)
	No more races will evolve from prehuman sources throughout all future time, but mankind can still achieve higher levels of human development through fostering evolutionary potentials. (65:3.5-6)
	In the Adamic era, races were blended to an olive shade of violet, symbolizing unity and oneness among nations. (52:3.7)
	The amalgamation and exaltation of races through Adamic uplifters after the elimination of the unfit is a divine plan for spiritual progress and race improvement. (34:7.1) (51:4.8) (51:5) (52:3.6-7)

		The physical universe is characterized by the number 10, while the spiritual domain is defined by three, seven, and twelve. (36:2.11)
		The transmutation of finite possibility to probability and inevitability is attributed to the self-existent free will of the First Source and Center, activating all triunity associations, within the cosmos. (105:5.4) (115:2.4)
		Confusion arises from incomplete understanding of the interactions between Conjoint Actor and Unqualified Absolute in the space regions of Nebadon, causing wavy phenomena and the chopping up of solar-light emanations. (41:5.8)
		The primary association of finite functions in reality leads to the ultimate unity of the functional reality in the grand universe. (106:1)
		The promulgation and repercussions of finite reality are attributed to the volitional acts of Paradise Deity and the repercussional adjustments of the functional triunities, marking the beginning of universe history with the transference from potentials to actuals within the absolute associations of functional infinity. (105:5-6)
		The Supreme Being eventually synthesizes destiny attainment as a result of the secondary supreme integration of God the Sevenfold functionally co-ordinating finite evolution within the grand universe. (106:2)
		Human thought is built upon unproven assumptions accepted by the constitutive reality sensitivity of the mind, leading science to assume matter, motion, and life, and religion to assume mind, spirit, and the universe. (103:7.11)
