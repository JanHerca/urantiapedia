The race commissioners on Urantia work closely with the Vorondadek observer, who exercises authority over planetary problems under the control of the Most Highs of Edentia since the Lucifer rebellion. (114:4.2)
On confused worlds like Urantia, the work of race commissioners is supported by racial interpreter seraphim to harmonize varied viewpoints and social tendencies of distinct racial types. (48:6.22)

Hertzian waves, found thirty octaves below visible sunlight in the superuniverse, are utilized for radio broadcasting on Urantia. (42:5.1,12)

radioactivity | | X rays | | OK
The disorganizing tendency of heavier elements in radioactive matter is heightened by moderate heat and diminished gravity pressure. (42:3.11)
Excess radiation in radioactive atoms is derived from the breaking up of the mesotron, explaining the phenomenon of emitting more energy than expected. (42:8.5)
The radioactive elements brought in by meteors reveal that Urantia is over one billion years old on its surface. (57:7.3)
The difference in lead atomic weights, from original formation to uranium disintegration, indicates the loss of energy in atomic breakup. (42:4.12)

radium | | | | OK
Radium's gamma ray emissions characterize the spontaneous dissociation of atomic matter in the superuniverse of Orvonton, thirty-two octaves above visible light. (42:5.1,7)
The positive particles of radium fly off at 10,000 miles per second, beyond human imagination and comparable to the velocity of light in atomic revolutions. (42:7.3,5)
The radium clock is the most reliable timepiece for estimating the age of the planet, even though all such estimates are too short due to the limited scope of radioactive materials available for study. (57:7.3)
The two atomic weights of lead show the existence of pre-electronic matter, with original lead formation weighing slightly more than that produced through uranium disintegration by emissions of radium. (42:4.12)

rationalism | | | | OK
Rationalism leans toward the world of matter, while idealism inclines toward the spiritual, and leaning on metaphysics leads to skepticism and confusion in philosophy's interpretations of reality. (103:6.14)

Neanderthalers hunted reindeer for food, clothing, and tools, greatly improving their work with flint. (64:4.3)

relationships | | friendship; groups | | OK
In the cosmic system, two beings are in partnership; three or more create a group, signifying the unification and coordination of relationships within a larger whole. (39:3.6) (112:1.17)
Unity begets duality, duality begets triunity, and triunity is the eternal ancestor of all things within the three great classes of primordial relationships. (105:4.3-8)
As ascending mortals, all these celestial companionships are invariably mutual and enriching, benefiting both parties in unique ways. (27:3.4)
Companionship is essential for mortals as they come from races that are very social, and the Creators provide for it at all levels, recognizing that it is “not good for man to be alone” even on Paradise. (25:8.4)
In relationships, Creator Sons govern while the Universal Father refrains from interference. (32:4.3)
Enduring relationships are never solely based on biological affection, as seen in the evolution of love from offspring to grandchildren in civilized societies. (84:7.10)
The Infinite Spirit is the apparent ancestor of motion, change, and relationship. (9:1.1)
Jesus established personal and eternal relationships with all people, prioritizing them over all other human connections. (141:7.5)
The presence embellishers dramatize the significance of relationships through the arrangement of supermaterial beings like living musical notes, odors, and sights in the anthems of glory. (44:6.7)
Social architects, seraphim work to create genuine connections and remove artificiality in relationships to foster effective working groups. (39:3.4)
All true relationships with other persons, human or divine, are ends in themselves and lead to fellowship with the personality of Deity, the eternal goal of universe ascension. (112:2.8) (112:5.22)

relativity | | | | OK
All finite knowledge and creature understanding are relative, varying in completeness and accuracy depending on personal experience and perspective, while divine truth remains uniform and universal. (2:7.1-3)
Do not let your dabblings with faintly glimpsed findings of relativity disturb your concepts of the eternity and infinity of God. (195:7.5)
Do not be misled by concept of static ideas; embrace the ever-changing truth of relativity in the universe. (130:4.15)
The formula equating energy and matter states that mass increases in proportion to energy divided by the square of the velocity of light. (42:4.11)
In the cosmic reality, matter and energy are diverse manifestations of the same phenomenon present in the Universal Father, from whom all things consist. (42:1.2)

relaxation | | ease; recreation; reversion directors | | OK
After a state of great nervous and emotional tension, Jesus led the apostles on a three-day relaxation retreat on Mount Sartaba, where they learned the value of rest and the efficacy of relaxation. (143:3)
Meditation makes the contact of mind with spirit; relaxation determines capacity for spiritual receptivity. (160:3.1)
Relaxation is found in the echoes of a backward glance, a carefree review of the past that allows for rejuvenation and merriment. (48:4.12,19)

relics | | charms; fetishes | | OK
The belief in relics as an outgrowth of fetish cult is rationalizing the ancient practice of revering bones and objects associated with great figures, transforming it into a dignified aspect of modern religions. (88:2.1-2)
Belief in charms and relics as means of influencing the spiritual world is impotent and rooted in gross superstition. (150:3.6)
The apostles doubted the resurrection until Joseph and David inspected the tomb, finding it just as the women had described, before the Sanhedrin guards threw Jesus' burial linen over a cliff. (190:1.2)
The Roman soldiers taking Jesus' clothes prevented his followers from resorting to relic worship, in line with his desire to leave behind only the memory of his spiritual ideals. (187:2.9)
