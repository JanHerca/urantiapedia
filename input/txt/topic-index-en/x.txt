X rays; X-ray; X-ray-stimulated; X ray | (41:5.1-5) | radioactivity | | OK
The suns of space are not very dense. Too great a density would hold back the light by opacity until the pressure of light energy reached the point of explosion. Five meters of surface area with the density of Urantia would effectively prevent the escape of all X-rays and all light energies until the pressure would cause an explosion (41:5.1)
X rays enable light to escape suns by penetrating all space and assisting in maintaining ultimatonic associations of energy. (41:9.1)
The sun's interior energizes electrons, creating a vast X-ray generator that propels these powerful emanations out into space. (41:5.3-5)
X rays are the great levelers of atomic existence in the intense temperatures found within suns. (41:7.1)
The mutant traits in the first Nodite generation were caused by changes in the germ plasm, similar to how scientists modify life plasm of plants and animals with X rays. (77:2.5)
X rays activate preatomic matter to become slightly gravity-responsive. (42:6.2)
The equilibrium between gravity and heat in the sun determines the stability of its outer layers, with the pressure of X rays supporting its continued existence. (41:9.4)
X rays are produced by the electromagnetic commotion upon an electron being suddenly stopped. (42:5.8)
X rays are part of the ten octaves of wave energy above visible sunlight in the superuniverse of Orvonton. (42:5.1)

Xenophanes embraced a pantheistic deity concept in his teaching of one God. (98:2.6)
