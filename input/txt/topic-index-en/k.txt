Throughout history, kings were permitted to marry close kin to maintain the purity of royal blood. (82:5.4,7)
Despite their power, kings were always restrained by the ever-present fear of assassination, as medicine men, witch doctors, priests, aristocracy, and rebellions were all checks on their authority. (70:6.6)

Human culture and civilization are built through the cumulative communication of knowledge and wisdom across generations, manifesting in activities such as art, science, religion, and philosophy. (160:2.3)

Belief outweighs pure knowledge in shaping behavior and personal achievements, as factual knowledge only holds influence when emotionally engaged, particularly through the powerful unifying force of religion. (99:4.5)
All finite knowledge and creature understanding are relative, gleaned from even high sources, only relatively complete, locally accurate, and personally true. (2:7.1)
The goal of the master philosophers of Paradise is to lead native and ascendant minds in the exhilarating pursuit of attaining truth through solving universe problems. (27:6.2)
