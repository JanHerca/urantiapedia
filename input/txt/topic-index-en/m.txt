description
	Michael of Nebadon is the head of all personality in Nebadon and the creator of Nebadon. He is at the same time a father, a creator and a sovereign for all inhabitants of Nebadon. (33:3.2) (37:0.1) (128:1.13)
	[Michael of Nebadon](/image/The_Urantia_Book/Celestials/Michael_of_Nebadon_01.jpg) {image-style-align-right}
	Michael is the very being whose creative fatherhood in this universe of tie has made possible the fact of our lives (112:7.8)
	no man goes to Father except through Michael (0:8.11) (180:3.7)
	he personally grants mortals’ credentials to proceed upon superuniverse career (112:7.8)
	He is the 611,121st bestowal of Father and Son, or 611,121st personalization of universal concept of divinity and infinity (33:1.1) (119:0.7)
	The Michael of Nebadon is the “only-begotten Son” personalizing this 611,121st universal concept of divinity and infinity. (33:1.1)
	Our Creator Son exerts the same spirit gravity that the Eternal Son of Paradise would exert if he were personally present on Salvington, and more (33:1.3)
	To our universe and all its inhabited worlds the Sovereign Son is, to all practical intents and purposes, God. (33:1.4) (183:3.4)
	Michael of Nebadon is a mercy-dominated Son; compassion is his very nature. (140:8.11)
	The Eternal Son is known by different names in various universes. On our world this Original Son has been confused with Michael of Nebadon, who bestowed himself upon our mortal races of Urantia. Our Creator Son is not the Eternal Son, the existential Paradise associate of the Universal Father and the Infinite Spirit. (6:1.3,5) (33:1.2) (161:1.6)
	He is our elder brother in fact since he became one of us (40:6.5)
	Michael is actually the Planetary Prince of Urantia since he was proclaimed like that by the Union of Days at the end of his bestowal in the flesh, but he made no gesture of personal administration of the planet aside from the establishment of the Jerusem commission of twenty-four advisers (45:4.16) (114:0.8) (114:1.1) (120:2.2) (136:3.1) (176:4.4)
	He manifests traits and attributes which more resemble the Eternal Son. (21:1.3) (33:2.1)
	Michael, as a sevenfold Master Son, is a member of one of the divine corps constituting the Trinity Ultimate (28:6.18) (119:8.6)
	Michael of Nebadon is like the Paradise Father because he shares his Paradise perfection (106:2.6)
	In Christ Michael the Son of God and The Son of Man are one (40:7.2)
	In his last bestowal in Urantia Michael of Nebadon was known as Jesus of Nazareth (7:5.4) (20:6.1) (32:0.3) (49:5.26) (76:5.7) (119:7.5)
	He is also referred to as Christ Michael | Christ
history of Nebadon creation
	399,000,000,000 years ago Michael of Nebadon selected a disintegrating nebula called Andronover as the site for building Nebadon. It required almost one million years to complete the architectural worlds of Salvington and the constellations. The local system headquarters planets were constructed over a period extending from that time to about five billion years ago (57:3.8) (119:0.7)
	300,000,000,000 years ago the staff of Michael arrived on Salvington, and the Uversa government of Orvonton extended physical recognition to the local universe of Nebadon (57:3.9)
	200,000,000,000 years ago Michael’s creation is registered on Uversa as a universe of inhabitation and progressive mortal ascension. The oldest inhabited planets of Nebadon date from these times. (57:3.10)
	And all of Michael’s plans for this local universe were fully approved by the Paradise Trinity before he ever embarked upon the supreme adventure of space. (32:0.3)

	created possibility for sovereignty of Supreme in Nebadon (119:8.5-7)
	subordination to variously constituted wills of Father, Son, and Spirit (119:8.3-4) (120:0.3-4)
	1st bestowal
		The first bestowal of Michael was as a Melchizedek, in the Melchizedek headquarters sphere. It happened one billion years ago. (119:1)
		On his Melchizedek bestowal he manifested the united will of the Father, Son, and Spirit (119:8.4)
	2nd bestowal
		The second bestowal of Michael was as a primary Lanonandek, in Palonia, system 11 of constellation 37, one hundred and fifty million years after the Melchizedek bestowal of Michael. He helped to repare the system from the rebellion of Lutentia, the system sovereign (119:2)
		in this one he manifested will of Father and Son (119:8.4)
	3rd bestowal
		The third bestowal of Michael was as a Material Son on world 217, system 87, constellation 61. He he achieved the repentance of the Planetary Prince in the midst of a system rebellion (119:3)
		in this bestowal he revealed will of Father and Spirit (119:8.4)
	4th bestowal
		the fourth bestowal of Michael was as a supreme seraphim; served as secretary to 26 teachers. His last or terminal assignment was as counselor and helper attached to a bestowal mission of a Trinity Teacher Son on world 462 in system 84 of constellation 3 in the universe of Nebadon (39:1.15) (119:4)
		in this bestowal he revealed united will of Son and Spirit (119:8.4)
	5th bestowal
		the fifth bestowal of Michael was as a ascending mortal on Uversa, a little over three hundred million years ago. His name was Eventod (119:5)
		he portrayed will of Infinite Spirit (119:8.4)
	6th bestowal
		the sixth bestowal of Michael was as a morontia mortal on Endantum, on the headquarters planet of the fifth constellation (119:6)
		in this bestowal he revealed will of Eternal Son (119:8.4)
	7th Urantia bestowal, the Urantia bestowal
		After a study of the special report on the status of segregated worlds prepared by the Melchizedeks, in counsel with Gabriel, Michael finally chose Urantia as the planet whereon to enact his final bestowal. (63:7.1) (76:5.7) (120:1.1) (122:0.2) (128:0.1)
		The public announcement that Michael had selected Urantia as the theater for his final bestowal was made shortly after the default of Adam and Eve (119:7.2)
		Michael sent a message of friendship and comfort to Adam and Eve, who at that time did not fully understand (76:5.3)
		Michael could hardly come to Urantia until there existed a people believing in the Universal Father among whom he could appear. (96:0.2)
		When Michael incarnated on Urantia, the world presented the most favorable condition for the Creator Son’s bestowal that had ever previously prevailed or has since obtained. (121:1.1)
		in this bestowal he was known as Jesus of Nazareth (32:0.3) (52:5.1-2) (119:7) (120:0.9)
		it was his last bestowal and in it he lived the will of Universal Father (119:8.4)
		preparation
			before departing he recevived a list of commissions by Immanuel, his Union of Days (120:1-3) (141:7.11)
			* he was counseled to function largely as teacher; 
			* atone for Caligastia and Adamic default; 
			* and terminate Lucifer rebellion (93:10.7) (120:2.2-5)
			* the single thought to have in his mission had to be revealing Father (120:1.5)
			Immanuel was responsible for Michael, the voucher for his personality integrity, before the arrival of his Adjuster (120:2.9)
			during the Urantia bestowal Michael voluntarily divested of all extraplanetary support and special assistance (120:1.3)
			All powers of universe administration which had not previously been conferred upon Gabriel, Michael now assigned to the custody of Immanuel. (120:0.6)
			in this time he was born of woman (20:2.7)
			he had nothing to do with selecting his parents. From the three couples nominated, Gabriel made the personal choice of Joseph and Mary (122:0.3) (128:0.1)
		after the bestowal
			After his ascension Michael became master of the experience of Supremacy, the realization of the Supreme; and as the one person in Nebadon able to experience the reality of the Supreme, he forthwith attained to the status of the sovereignty of supremacy in and to his local universe. (101:6.5)
			Fortant is director for all activities related to Michael’s bestowal on Urantia (45:3.7)
			All broadcasts to the individual worlds are relayed from the system capitals except the Michael messages, which sometimes go direct to their destinations over the archangels’ circuit. (46:3.4)
			One special Melchizedek college in Edentia is devoted to to the mastery of the new problems arising out of the fact that Michael made his final bestowal on one of the worlds of Norlatiadek (43:1.6)
			Most High mediator harmonizes bestowal adjustments with constellation administration (43:5.11)
			this bestowal permitted the Urantia bestowal of Thought Adjusters and the Spirit of Truth to all normal mortals. The Spirit of Truth is the spirit of Michael on Urantia. (120:2.6) (15:9.12)
			The Most High adviser is the personal representative of Michael in Norlatiadek since his attainment of the status of a Master Son (43:5.6)
			A memorial to Michael was dedicated on Jerusem 495 years ago, and today it is the center of all activities integrated into the leadership of the system. (46:5.19)
		purposes of 7th bestowal
			* to complete required experience; 
			* to subordinate himself to will of Father (120:0.4) (189:1.10)
			* to gain a creature experience, 
			* to gain the universe sovereignty, 
			* to settle Lucifer rebellion, 
			* to reveal God andlead men to become son-conscious (120) (120:4.4) (128:0.2-4) (128:1.1) (128:7.6) (129:3.5-8) (129:4.7) (185:3.4) (189:1.10) (193:0.3)
		how it happens
			When a Son of God becomes a Son of Man, is literally born of woman, as occurred on your world nineteen hundred years ago, it is a universal mystery. (13:1.8)
			When a personal duplication or divine extension of this Original Son starts on a bestowal mission of mortal incarnation, it becomes literally true that the divine “Word is made flesh,” and that the Word thus dwells among the lowly beings of animal origin. (20:5.1) | Jesus:personality and nature
organization of Nebadon
	The Master Son, Michael, is supremely concerned with but three things: creation, sustenance, and ministry. He does not personally participate in the judicial work of the universe. Creators never sit in judgment on their creatures (33:7.1)
	after his bestowal in Urantia, he established 24 counselors in Jerusem, who represent him concerning roll calls of Satania and in many other phases of the scheme of mortal ascension (45:4.1) (114:1.1)
	Gabriel is regent of Nebadon when Michael is absent from Salvington (33:2.5) (33:4.7) (33:6.1)
	his headquarters is threefold mansion of light on Salvington (33:1.1)
	Although Michael’s headquarters is officially located on Salvington, the capital of Nebadon, he spends much of his time visiting the constellation and system headquarters and even the individual planets. (33:2.5) (33:6.1)
sovereignty
	 At any moment throughout all past local universe time, Michael could have asserted personal sovereignty as a Creator Son and as a Creator Son could have ruled his universe after the manner of his own choosing, but he wisely chose not to. (21:3.2-3) (120:0.3-4) (120:1.6)
	Immanuel of Salvington, number 611,121 of the sixth order of Supreme Trinity Personalities, is a being of sublime dignity and of such superb condescension that he refuses the worship and adoration of all living creatures. He bears the distinction of being the only personality in all Nebadon who has never acknowledged subordination to his brother Michael. He functions as adviser to the Sovereign Son (33:5.2)
	Michael's personal power is limited by the pre-existent gravity circuits centering at Paradise and by the reservation on the part of the Ancients of Days of the superuniverse government of all final executive judgments (33:2.2)
	Michael earned authority through actual experience in the likeness of universe creatures (120:0) (120:1.4) (127:0.4) (191:3.4)
	Michael received all power and authority after bestowals (20:5.5) (21:3.8) (43:4.7) (179:2.3) (180:4.1) (182:1.3)
	After Michael’s final and successful bestowal on Urantia he was not only accepted by the Ancients of Days as sovereign ruler of Nebadon, but he was also recognized by the Universal Father as the established director of the local universe of his own creation (119:8)
	It was an afternoon at the end of the summer of the year 25, on Mount Hermon, amid the trees and the silence of nature, when Michael of Nebadon won the unquestioned sovereignty of his universe. (134:8.9) (136:3.1)
Lucifer rebellion | Lucifer rebellion
	At the time of Lucifer's rebellion and the two which preceded it there was no absolute and personal sovereign authority in the universe of Nebadon. Michael ruled by divine right, as vicegerent of the Universal Father, but not yet in his own personal right (53:5.2-3) (54:5.6)
	Michael knew of Lucifer’s disaffection 500 years before rebellion (53:2.3)
	Michael offered salvation to all rebels. To all who would show proof of sincere repentance, he offered, upon his attainment of complete universe sovereignty, forgiveness and reinstatement in some form of universe service (53:9.1) (54:4.5)
	Seventh bestowal terminated rebellions, the one due to Lucifer, except on planets with apostate Planetary Princes, and the two other ones in other systems (53:8.3-4)
	Michael, upon assuming the supreme sovereignty of Nebadon, petitioned the Ancients of Days for authority to intern all personalities concerned in the Lucifer rebellion pending the rulings of the superuniverse tribunals in the case of Gabriel vs. Lucifer (53:9.3)
	Michael restored spiritual status of realm by his bestowal (7:4.5)
	From the outbreak of rebellion to the day of his enthronement as sovereign ruler of Nebadon, Michael never interfered with the rebel forces of Lucifer; he applied a policy of noninterference and they were allowed to run a free course for almost 200,000 years (53:5.1-4)
future
	Michael promised to return to Urantia in the future, but nobody knows when (20:4.5) | Jesus:second coming
	Michael will serve in outer space in next universe age (119:8.7)
