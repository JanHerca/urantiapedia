masters | | | | OK
No man can serve two masters; either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to one while he despises the other. (140:6.13) (163:3.1) (169:2.7)
The great problem of life on Urantia is serving two masters: navigating ancestral tendencies while yielding spiritual allegiance to the divine presence. (109:5.4)

The mastodon, preferring sheltered fringes of the forest, was exterminated by red men in the ice age. (61:7.13-14)
The massiveness of passing Reptilia found echo in the elephant and mastodon, linking ancient reptiles to modern mammals. (65:2.10)

Matadormus | | | PERSON | OK
The proud Alpheus twins knew Jesus refused to accept the rich man, revealing his impartiality in forming the kingdom of heaven. (139:10.9)
To enter the kingdom of heaven, Matadormus had to relinquish his pet evil of wealth, only to later become treasurer of the Jerusalem church. (163:2.7)
Matadormus and other Jewish leaders met with Jesus in the home of Nicodemus to discuss his teachings and message of light. (164:2.1)
Matadormus, a rich young Pharisee and member of the Jerusalem Sanhedrin, desired eternal life but struggled to give up his wealth to follow Jesus as one of his messengers. (163:2.4-9) (163:3.3)

First the barbers, later the priests, the matchmakers transitioned primitive marriages from parental planning to free choosing. (83:2.1)
Matchmakers were originally employed to negotiate marriages for deceased individuals, as the ancient belief was that even the dead must be married. (82:3.8)

Material Daughters | | Material Sons | ORDER | OK

material energy | | energy; matter | | OK
Physical energy encompasses all forms of phenomenal motion, action, and potential. (0:6.3)
All physical-energy and cosmic-force circuits find their origin on nether Paradise, a realm devoid of spirit intelligences or the function of the Deity Absolute. (11:5.1)
The vast power currents of space and circuits of spirit energy are controlled by Universe Power Directors, ensuring intelligent supervision and manipulation of all energy systems. (24:1.1)
Material energy is only truly transformed when it is dominated by the Infinite Spirit. (21:2.4)
Material energy is what responds to the material-gravity circuit of Paradise, defining it as matter-energy in all its metamorphic states. (0:6.1)
Material energy, ever true to universal law, obediently and inherently swings around the eternal space paths of the universes, guided by the unfailing pull of the eternal Isle. (12:8.3) (15:6.16)
Gravity is the sole controller of energy-matter, not pattern or space. (0:6.11)
Master Spirits involved in fluctuations of energy manifestations exhibited by linear-gravity-responding units of organized matter, and the behavior of emergent energy when fully liberated from the grasp of the Unqualified Absolute to become responsive to linear gravity and manipulations of Universe Power Directors.

materialism | (195:6-7) | communism; mechanism (theory); secularism | | OK
To the unbelieving materialist, man is merely an evolutionary accident, condemned to a hopeless existence devoid of meaning. (102:0.1)
The false philosophies of mechanism fail to account for the fatalistic agility of the mind of a materialist who asserts the universe is a purposeless energy phenomenon. (195:6.6,8)
Materialism is the maximation of ugliness, the finite antithesis of beauty. (56:10.4)
Materialism is present, but not the exclusive law of the cosmos. (195:6.14)
effects
	Materialism cheapens human life, while the gospel of Jesus exalts and enhances every mortal, bridging the meeting of human upreach and divine downreach. (102:6.10)
	The pursuit of truth, not the false science of materialism, helps mortal man avoid becoming an outcast in the universe, by seeking the divinely real and beautiful symmetrical truth that is replete with both good and evil. (2:7.4)
	The dire harvest of materialism and secularism will bring even more terrible destruction in the future. (195:8.13)
The error in religion increases in proportion to the amount of materialism that corrupts the concept of the Universal Father. (102:4.4)
errors of materialism
	The presence of intelligent purpose in material creation is demonstrated by over 50,000 facts of physics and chemistry that defy accidental chance, as well as numerous other findings outside these domains. (58:2.2-5)
	In denying the personality of the First Source and Center, one is left with the choice of either materialism or pantheism, both of which fall into the corporeality error of equating personality with physical form. (1:5.11-12)
	Materialism disregards the reality that all material things are first conceived within human consciousness. (112:2.9,12)
	Scientific materialism's bankruptcy is evident when it consistently refunds objections by referring the higher to the lower, contradicting the reality of spiritual experience and the activities of a purposive Creator. (102:6.9)
	Understanding of water molecule disproves materialistic philosophy and mechanistic cosmology by revealing the unpredictable superadditive nature of its composition. (12:9.3-5)
	Viewing matter as basic reality, with mind and spirit as postulates rooted in matter, distorts understanding of the Infinite Spirit as the Third Source and Center, better described as the Infinite Reality or Universal Organizer. (8:2.3)
	It is foolish for material-minded man to allow vulnerable theories of a mechanistic universe to deprive him of the vast spiritual resources of true religion. (195:7)

mathematics | | | | OK
Arithmetic regarding sheep shearing may be sound in theory, but it does not always hold true in practice. (133:5.5)
Mathematics could not have predicted the creation of a water molecule, showing that science alone is not sufficient for the full understanding of the universe. (12:9.3)
Mathematics is indispensable to the discussion of the material universe, revealing unexpected complexities that challenge materialistic philosophy and mechanistic cosmology. (12:9.3)
Mathematics is reliable when limited to physical things, but not infallible when applied to life problems. (133:5.5-6)
Science struggles for emancipation from the slavery of mathematics. (12:9.5)
Science teaches man to speak the new language of mathematics, trains his thoughts along lines of exacting precision, stabilizes philosophy through the elimination of error, and purifies religion by the destruction of superstition. (81:6.10)
Young Jesus spent much time on mathematics, learning new techniques and developing a keen sense of numbers, distances, and proportions. (123:6.3)

Matthias was declared the new apostle in Judas’s position, following a meeting where Peter naturally assumed the role of head of the apostolic corps and conducted the selection process. (192:0.2) (193:6.2,3,6)

maturity | | immaturity | | OK
Maturity unites past, present, and future to reveal true meaning in the present moment. (118:1.3-8)
Maturity allows for a more intense present experience, free from its constraints, as plans based on past experiences shape a future of enhanced value. (118:1.7)
Maturity is achieved through co-operative adjustment to change, multiplying the fruits of life efforts. (160:3.3)
Rodan said: The effort toward maturity necessitates work, which requires energy, sourced from spiritual communion and worship, leading to a mature personality recognized by one’s fellows. (160:3-4)
Maturity is the surrender of transient desires and personal pleasures for superior longings, leading to the pursuit of idealistic spiritual realities and the quest for divinity. (100:1.1) (160:1.4,13)
Maturity is directly tied to the time unit used by the conscious self to evaluate life's circumstances and temporal existence. (118:1.3)

The primary maximums in Havona type are the constitutive perfect reality that marks the beginning of universe history and the genesis of time itself. (105:5.6-9)
The secondary maximums represent the supremely perfected evolutionary reality of superuniverse type, marking the beginning of universe history and the coming into existence of time itself. (105:5.6-9)
Tertiary maximums are co-ordinate with ancestral factors, neither perfect nor perfected. (105:5.10)

May Day | | | | OK
Ancients suspended sex regulations on high festival days like May Day, fostering concepts of vice, crime, and sin. (82:2.4)

Willow branches cut at Maza were used for the adornment of the sacrificial altar during the early morning ceremony of the feast. (162:4.4)

meals | | food | | OK

meanings | | science, philosophy, and religion; values | | OK
Meaning is the appreciative consciousness of values that experience adds to our perception of reality. (100:3.4)
In the universe reality, values can be modified and augmented, even in relations with infinite Deity, leading to the increased actualization of divine values through expanded comprehension of reality meanings in experiential universes. (115:2.2)
Meanings are recognized and understood in inner human experience, beyond the sensory world. (111:4.2)
New religious insights arise out of conflicts, where new meanings only emerge amid conflict. (100:4.1)
Religion thrives on faith and insight, discovering spiritual meanings in well-known facts rather than seeking new experiences. (101:1.4)
Meaning requires unraveling and correlation in the mind for true unity and understanding in human experience. (102:2.5)

means versus ends | | ends versus means | | OK

measures | | light-years; time:days and years; weights | | OK
The measures used in constellation headquarters worlds are consistent with those of local universes, including Edentia time reckoning and distance measurement. (43:0.3)
One Jerusem mile equals seven Urantia miles, reflecting the precision and decimal-based gradant weight system of this advanced civilization, where the Satania day is three Urantia days minus one hour, four minutes, and fifteen seconds, while the system year is composed of one hundred Jerusem days, all meticulously monitored by the master chronoldeks. (46:1.2)
Simultaneous measurement of location and velocity is impossible due to the inherent paradoxes, as seen in the analysis of protoplasm by chemists who must kill it to study its chemistry. (65:6.1)

His last or terminal assignment was as counselor and helper attached to a bestowal mission of a Trinity Teacher Son on world 462 in system 84 of constellation 3 in the universe of Nebadon (39:1.15) (119:4)
		in this bestowal he revealed united will of Son and Spirit (119:8.4)
	5th bestowal
		the fifth bestowal of Michael was as a ascending mortal on Uversa, a little over three hundred million years ago. His name was Eventod (119:5)
		he portrayed will of Infinite Spirit (119:8.4)
	6th bestowal
		the sixth bestowal of Michael was as a morontia mortal on Endantum, on the headquarters planet of the fifth constellation (119:6)
		in this bestowal he revealed will of Eternal Son (119:8.4)
	7th Urantia bestowal, the Urantia bestowal
		After a study of the special report on the status of segregated worlds prepared by the Melchizedeks, in counsel with Gabriel, Michael finally chose Urantia as the planet whereon to enact his final bestowal. (63:7.1) (76:5.7) (120:1.1) (122:0.2) (128:0.1)
		The public announcement that Michael had selected Urantia as the theater for his final bestowal was made shortly after the default of Adam and Eve (119:7.2)
		Michael sent a message of friendship and comfort to Adam and Eve, who at that time did not fully understand (76:5.3)
		Michael could hardly come to Urantia until there existed a people believing in the Universal Father among whom he could appear. (96:0.2)
		When Michael incarnated on Urantia, the world presented the most favorable condition for the Creator Son’s bestowal that had ever previously prevailed or has since obtained. (121:1.1)
		in this bestowal he was known as Jesus of Nazareth (32:0.3) (52:5.1-2) (119:7) (120:0.9)
		it was his last bestowal and in it he lived the will of Universal Father (119:8.4)
		preparation
			before departing he recevived a list of commissions by Immanuel, his Union of Days (120:1-3) (141:7.11)
			* he was counseled to function largely as teacher; 
			* atone for Caligastia and Adamic default; 
			* and terminate Lucifer rebellion (93:10.7) (120:2.2-5)
			* the single thought to have in his mission had to be revealing Father (120:1.5)
			Immanuel was responsible for Michael, the voucher for his personality integrity, before the arrival of his Adjuster (120:2.9)
			during the Urantia bestowal Michael voluntarily divested of all extraplanetary support and special assistance (120:1.3)
			All powers of universe administration which had not previously been conferred upon Gabriel, Michael now assigned to the custody of Immanuel. (120:0.6)
			in this time he was born of woman (20:2.7)
			he had nothing to do with selecting his parents. From the three couples nominated, Gabriel made the personal choice of Joseph and Mary (122:0.3) (128:0.1)
		after the bestowal
			After his ascension Michael became master of the experience of Supremacy, the realization of the Supreme; and as the one person in Nebadon able to experience the reality of the Supreme, he forthwith attained to the status of the sovereignty of supremacy in and to his local universe. (101:6.5)
			Fortant is director for all activities related to Michael’s bestowal on Urantia (45:3.7)
			All broadcasts to the individual worlds are relayed from the system capitals except the Michael messages, which sometimes go direct to their destinations over the archangels’ circuit. (46:3.4)
			One special Melchizedek college in Edentia is devoted to to the mastery of the new problems arising out of the fact that Michael made his final bestowal on one of the worlds of Norlatiadek (43:1.6)
			Most High mediator harmonizes bestowal adjustments with constellation administration (43:5.11)
			this bestowal permitted the Urantia bestowal of Thought Adjusters and the Spirit of Truth to all normal mortals. The Spirit of Truth is the spirit of Michael on Urantia. (120:2.6) (15:9.12)
			The Most High adviser is the personal representative of Michael in Norlatiadek since his attainment of the status of a Master Son (43:5.6)
			A memorial to Michael was dedicated on Jerusem 495 years ago, and today it is the center of all activities integrated into the leadership of the system. (46:5.19)
		purposes of 7th bestowal
			* to complete required experience; 
			* to subordinate himself to will of Father (120:0.4) (189:1.10)
			* to gain a creature experience, 
			* to gain the universe sovereignty, 
			* to settle Lucifer rebellion, 
			* to reveal God andlead men to become son-conscious (120) (120:4.4) (128:0.2-4) (128:1.1) (128:7.6) (129:3.5-8) (129:4.7) (185:3.4) (189:1.10) (193:0.3)
		how it happens
			When a Son of God becomes a Son of Man, is literally born of woman, as occurred on your world nineteen hundred years ago, it is a universal mystery. (13:1.8)
			When a personal duplication or divine extension of this Original Son starts on a bestowal mission of mortal incarnation, it becomes literally true that the divine “Word is made flesh,” and that the Word thus dwells among the lowly beings of animal origin. (20:5.1) | Jesus:personality and nature
organization of Nebadon
	The Master Son, Michael, is supremely concerned with but three things: creation, sustenance, and ministry. He does not personally participate in the judicial work of the universe. Creators never sit in judgment on their creatures (33:7.1)
	after his bestowal in Urantia, he established 24 counselors in Jerusem, who represent him concerning roll calls of Satania and in many other phases of the scheme of mortal ascension (45:4.1) (114:1.1)
	Gabriel is regent of Nebadon when Michael is absent from Salvington (33:2.5) (33:4.7) (33:6.1)
	his headquarters is threefold mansion of light on Salvington (33:1.1)
	Although Michael’s headquarters is officially located on Salvington, the capital of Nebadon, he spends much of his time visiting the constellation and system headquarters and even the individual planets. (33:2.5) (33:6.1)
sovereignty
	 At any moment throughout all past local universe time, Michael could have asserted personal sovereignty as a Creator Son and as a Creator Son could have ruled his universe after the manner of his own choosing, but he wisely chose not to. (21:3.2-3) (120:0.3-4) (120:1.6)
	Immanuel of Salvington, number 611,121 of the sixth order of Supreme Trinity Personalities, is a being of sublime dignity and of such superb condescension that he refuses the worship and adoration of all living creatures. He bears the distinction of being the only personality in all Nebadon who has never acknowledged subordination to his brother Michael. He functions as adviser to the Sovereign Son (33:5.2)
	Michael's personal power is limited by the pre-existent gravity circuits centering at Paradise and by the reservation on the part of the Ancients of Days of the superuniverse government of all final executive judgments (33:2.2)
	Michael earned authority through actual experience in the likeness of universe creatures (120:0) (120:1.4) (127:0.4) (191:3.4)
	Michael received all power and authority after bestowals (20:5.5) (21:3.8) (43:4.7) (179:2.3) (180:4.1) (182:1.3)
	After Michael’s final and successful bestowal on Urantia he was not only accepted by the Ancients of Days as sovereign ruler of Nebadon, but he was also recognized by the Universal Father as the established director of the local universe of his own creation (119:8)
	It was an afternoon at the end of the summer of the year 25, on Mount Hermon, amid the trees and the silence of nature, when Michael of Nebadon won the unquestioned sovereignty of his universe. (134:8.9) (136:3.1)
Lucifer rebellion | Lucifer rebellion
	At the time of Lucifer's rebellion and the two which preceded it there was no absolute and personal sovereign authority in the universe of Nebadon. Michael ruled by divine right, as vicegerent of the Universal Father, but not yet in his own personal right (53:5.2-3) (54:5.6)
	Michael knew of Lucifer’s disaffection 500 years before rebellion (53:2.3)
	Michael offered salvation to all rebels. To all who would show proof of sincere repentance, he offered, upon his attainment of complete universe sovereignty, forgiveness and reinstatement in some form of universe service (53:9.1) (54:4.5)
	Seventh bestowal terminated rebellions, the one due to Lucifer, except on planets with apostate Planetary Princes, and the two other ones in other systems (53:8.3-4)
	Michael, upon assuming the supreme sovereignty of Nebadon, petitioned the Ancients of Days for authority to intern all personalities concerned in the Lucifer rebellion pending the rulings of the superuniverse tribunals in the case of Gabriel vs. Lucifer (53:9.3)
	Michael restored spiritual status of realm by his bestowal (7:4.5)
	From the outbreak of rebellion to the day of his enthronement as sovereign ruler of Nebadon, Michael never interfered with the rebel forces of Lucifer; he applied a policy of noninterference and they were allowed to run a free course for almost 200,000 years (53:5.1-4)
future
	Michael promised to return to Urantia in the future, but nobody knows when (20:4.5) | Jesus:second coming
	Michael will serve in outer space in next universe age (119:8.7)

The mid-mammals exhibited improved traits, including disgust reactions, hoarding instincts, and a propensity for constructing elaborate shelters, setting them apart from their ancestors. (62:3.6-7)
Internecine battles nearly destroyed the entire species, but peace prevailed and a lone tribe of less than one hundred individuals resumed a semipeaceful existence. (62:3.8)
The mid-mammals killed off the dawn mammals in a relentless war, leaving no survivors of the pre-existent ancestral race. (62:3.4)
For six hundred generations, the mid-mammals terrorized and subdued their corner of creation in a world devoid of great and vicious predators. (62:3.5)

In each local system of inhabited worlds throughout Nebadon, there is a single sphere designated as a midsonite world where Melchizedeks serve as life carriers, choosing Mother Eves from volunteers selected by the System Sovereign. (36:4.1)
Midsoniters come to local systems in light and life, serving as counselors and advisers, inculcating supreme mota meanings with finaliters. (55:8.4)
Midsonite parental groups volunteer to help at the system probationary nursery supervised by Material Sons and Daughters from Jerusem. (45:6.9)
Midsoniters from universe headquarters worlds promote spiritual growth by inculcating supreme mota meanings into mortal understanding. (55:8.4)
Midsoniters exist in a mysterious realm between mortal and immortal, human and divine, with a destiny shrouded in uncertainty yet untouched by death. (36:4.4,8)
Midsoniters exist in a unique state between mortality and immortality, not being Adjuster indwelt, but never having experienced death. (36:4.4)
The midsoniters are the progeny of Melchizedek Life Carriers and Material Daughters, created in a unique process involving a Melchizedek Son and a Daughter of the material order of sonship. (35:1.3) (36:4.1-2)
Midsoniters live as reproducing beings for 1,000 years before being removed by seraphic transport and becoming nonreproducing forever. (36:4.3)
The purpose of the midsonite creatures remains unknown, as they gather on the seventh finaliter world in preparation for a future event in universe evolution, despite the finaliters' refusal to discuss their wards' destiny. (36:4.8)

The mid-zone of nether Paradise may be the control mechanism of midspace zones. (11:5.6)
Enormous elliptical midspace zones of quiescence separate space levels, including the seven superuniverses from the first outer space level, allowing orderly procession of galaxies around Paradise. (11:7.7)
The midzone of the force center, expanding and contracting through three cycles of activity, appears to function as a control mechanism for the midspace zones separating pervaded and unpervaded space. (11:5.6) (11:7.3)
The midspace zones, separate space levels, now less active than before, seem to serve as control mechanisms between the inner and outer zones of the force center in the master universe. (11:5.6) (11:7.2,7-8) (12:1.2,14)
The midspace zones serve as the transition from time to eternity for Paradise pilgrims, requiring unconsciousness for ultimate ascension to Paradise citizenship. (12:5.4)
