The apostles and their disciples experienced emotional tension, leading Jesus to suggest 3-day vacations on Mount Sartaba for rest and relaxation. (143:3.1)
Jesus enjoyed the annual Jewish vacation time of the feast of tabernacles with John. (134:9.4)
In the main continental nation of a nearby inhabited planet, vacation is a vital part of the adult-education program and is funded through methods similar to old-age insurance, with travel being a common way to spend the one month off each year. (72:4.3) (72:5.9)

vale of tears | | | | OK
Jesus hardly regarded this world as a vale of tears, but as the birth sphere of immortal spirits on the path to eternal achievement and divine validation through fusion with the Universal Father. (40:7.5) (149:5.5) (196:2.9)

values | | ideals; meanings; science, philosophy, and religion | | OK
The Eternal Son, holding all spirit realities and values in his hand, exercises absolute spiritual sovereignty over the spiritual domains. (7:1.1)
All spiritual values are duplicated and retained by the Reflective Spirits and their seconaphim offspring. (17:3.5)
Religion is primarily a pursuit of values, making it easier to agree on values than beliefs or creeds. (103:1.4)
Physical health, temperament, and social environment influence religious experience, but inner spiritual progress thrives when one maintains wholehearted devotion to supreme values. (100:1.6,8)
Every meaningful value in every will creature is certain of survival, as nothing of survival values is ever lost, even in the wide universe. (109:3.2) (109:4.5) (109:6.1-2)
The persistence of true values ensures that no worth-while experience is ever wasted, as every meaningful value in every will creature is certain of survival. (109:6)
Primitive peoples displayed noble values through their touching affection for comrades, valiantly fighting to protect and save injured warriors in battles with inferior tribes, foreshadowing highly human traits of subsequent evolutionary development. (63:4.4)
Van achieved the highest level of personality realization by combining intellectual determination and spiritual insight, showing that mind and spirit united can create superhuman values. (67:3.9)
Jesus taught Angamon that true values must be sought in the spiritual world and divine levels, surpassing transient material standards, as the pursuit of moral insight and spiritual attainment is crucial for civilization's advancement. (132:1)
Evolutionary religion may be psychologized, but only spiritual origin religion can truly conserve, exalt, and spiritualize values, revealing the all-loving Father to be worshiped and loved. (102:5.3)
nature of values
	True values are best discovered in associates' motivations. (100:4.4)
	Values are dynamic and dependent on the fact of relationships for both their actual and potential existence, signifying change, growth, and the quality of cosmic adaptation. (100:3.5)
	Recognize the distinction between what is value and what has value in the contemplation of meaningful integration and realization on higher levels of human experience. (100:3.3)
	Faith is required to detect spiritual values concealed within the phenomena of time and space. (195:7.4)
	The human mind discovers and chooses values, rather than creating them, through self-judgment, social-judgment, and God-judgment. (196:3.10-14)
	The values of spiritual progress are not psychological projections, but spiritual forecasts of the indwelling Adjuster, the spirit of God in the mind of man. (195:7.5)
	God-consciousness, the integration of self with the universe at its highest levels of spiritual reality, ensures that only the imperishable spirit content of value endures, born of love and nurtured in service, a part of the living love of the Universal Father. (196:3.35)
	Values are the mutual creation of mind, which knows, and associated spirit, which reality-izes. (111:3.6) (133:5.7)
	Spiritual experiences reveal the true values of life through supreme love for God and unselfish love for man. (100:4.4)
	The validity of spiritual values is comprehended by doing the will of God, offering the only escape from the material and intellectual worlds and providing the only passport to completion of reality and eternal life. (101:10.6)
	Spiritual values are irresistibly drawn towards God in the central universe due to the intense Godward urge of fully spiritualized beings. (14:2.7)
warnings
	True values can only be found in the spiritual world and on divine levels of eternal reality, with no attainable ideals apart from God. (132:1.2) (160:5.8)
	Pray only for values, not things, for growth in the face of conflict. (91:8.13)
	Values are real and dynamic, dependent on relationships, signifying growth and change. (100:3.5)
	In religion, values must not become disproportionate, as truth should always hold the central place in theology, not just facts. (143:6.3)

(67:6.1-2)
current status
