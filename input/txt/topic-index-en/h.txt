(100:1.8)
It is true that the supremacy of a decision, its crisis relationship, has a great deal to do with its circle-making influence; nevertheless, numbers of decisions, frequent repetitions, persistent repetitions, are also essential to the habit-forming certainty of such reactions. (110:6.6)
When these experiences are frequently repeated, they crystallize into habits, strength-giving and worshipful habits, and such habits eventually formulate themselves into a spiritual character, and such a character is finally recognized by one’s fellows as a mature personality. (160:3.2)

how are compensated
	deficiencies are inevitable on all levels of universe existence. (31:10.14)

	Limitations of intellect, curtailment of education, deprivation of culture, impoverishment of social status, even inferiority of the human standards of morality resulting from the unfortunate lack of educational, cultural, and social advantages, cannot invalidate the presence of the divine spirit in such unfortunate and humanly handicapped but believing individuals. (5:5.13)

happiness; happy; Happiness; cheerful | | joy; peace: spiritual peace; unhappiness | | OK
achieving happiness
	happiness depends very much upon the willingness of man to be led by the Father’s spirit which lives within him, the Adjuster (149:5.2)
	faith, self-consciousness of the assurance of the divine presence, augments happiness (159:3.12)
	Happiness and peace of mind follow pure thinking and virtuous living as the shadow follows the substance of material things. (131:3.3)
	Health, mental efficiency, and happiness arise from the unification of physical systems, mind systems, and spirit systems. Of health and sanity we understand much, but of happiness we has truly realized very little. The highest happiness is indissolubly linked with spiritual progress. Spiritual growth yields lasting joy, peace which passes all understanding. (100:4.3)
	the highest happiness is linked with the intelligent and enthusiastic pursuit of worthy goals, and such achievements constitute true progress in cosmic self-realization (94:8.17)
	Effort does not always produce joy, but there is no happiness without intelligent effort. (48:7.10)
	Human happiness is achieved only when the ego desire of the self and the altruistic urge of the higher self, divine spirit, are co-ordinated and reconciled by the unified will of the integrating and supervising personality. (103:5.5)
	Cheerfulness and gladness are the rewards of deeds well done and to the glory of the Immortal. (131:3.4)
nature of happiness
	Jesus said: “Happy are they who mourn, for they shall be comforted.” So-called common sense or the best of logic would never suggest that happiness could be derived from mourning. But being sensitive and responsive to human need creates genuine and lasting happiness, while such kindly attitudes safeguard the soul from the destructive influences of anger, hate, and suspicion. (140:5.16)
	Jesus gave a long lesson regarding contentment to Simon the Zealot, saying in conclussion: “Seek not, then, for false peace and transient joy but rather for the assurance of faith and the sureties of divine sonship which yield composure, contentment, and supreme joy in the spirit.” (149:5)
	Happiness ensues from the recognition of truth because it can be acted out; it can be lived. (2:7.6)
	The tamed mind yields happiness. He is the greatest of warriors who overcomes and subdues himself.  Contentment is the greatest wealth. (131:3.6)
	A merry heart does good like a medicine. (131:2.9)
	Increasing happiness is always the experience of all who are certain about God. (159:3.10)
	Health, sanity, and happiness are integrations of truth, beauty, and goodness as they are blended in human experience. (2:7.11)
	Education should be a technique of learning the better methods of gratifying our natural and inherited urges, and happiness is the resulting total of these enhanced techniques of emotional satisfactions. Happiness is little dependent on environment, though pleasing surroundings may greatly contribute thereto. (140:4.10)
	It is the business and duty of society to provide everybody with a fair and peaceful opportunity to pursue self-maintenance, participate in self-perpetuation, while at the same time enjoying some measure of self-gratification, the sum of all three constituting human happiness. (70:9.17)
	some persons naturally experience more hapiness than others (149:5.2)
	Happiness and joy take origin in the inner life. We cannot experience real joy all by yourself. A solitary life is fatal to happiness. Even families and nations will enjoy life more if they share it with others. (111:4.7)
	To a child, happiness is the satisfaction of immediate pleasure craving. The adult is willing to sow seeds of self-denial in order to reap subsequent harvests of augmented happiness. In Jesus’ times and since, happiness has all too often been associated with the idea of the possession of wealth. (140:5.7)
Jesus happiness
	Jesus was consistently cheerful, notwithstanding he sometimes drank deeply of the cup of human sorrow. He was filled with enthusiasm for the gospel of the kingdom. But he controlled his enthusiasm; it never controlled him. (100:7.12-13)

	Harmony, the music of the seven levels of melodious association, is the one universal code of spirit communication. Music, such as Urantia mortals understand, attains its highest expression in the schools of Jerusem, the system headquarters, where semimaterial beings are taught the harmonies of sound.

haste; hurry | | | | OK
Religionists seem to live in effective emancipation from harrying haste and the painful stress of the vicissitudes inherent in the temporal currents of time; they exhibit a stabilization of personality and a tranquillity of character not explained by the laws of physiology, psychology, and sociology. (102:2.3)
Jesus was never in a hurry; his composure was sublime.  John was an eager and earnest worker, but Jesus was a calm and happy laborer; only a few times in his entire life was he ever in a hurry. (100:7.14) (136:0.1) (171:7.5)
One of the great troubles with modern life is that man thinks he is too busy to find time for spiritual meditation and religious devotion. (195:6.7)

	Violence is the law of nature, hostility the automatic reaction of the children of nature, while war is but these same activities carried on collectively. (70:1.1)

	Spirit of Truth endows with power to challenge the evils of hate and anger by the fearless acts of love and forbearance. (194:3.12)
	the sum of duty is vanquish hate by benevolence and love (131:4.6) (194:3.11-12)
	When the flood tides of human adversity, selfishness, cruelty, hate, malice, and jealousy beat about our souls, we may rest in the assurance that there is one inner bastion, the citadel of the spirit, which is absolutely unassailable; at least this is true of every one who has dedicated the keeping of his soul to the indwelling spirit of the eternal God.
