Immanuel’s benediction for Michael
	“And now, may your Father and my Father, who has ever sustained us in all past performances, guide and sustain you and be with you from the moment you leave us and achieve the surrender of your consciousness of personality, throughout your gradual return to recognition of your divine identity incarnate in human form, and then on through the whole of your bestowal experience on Urantia until your deliverance from the flesh and your ascension to our Father’s right hand of sovereignty. When I shall again see you on Salvington, we shall welcome your return to us as the supreme and unconditional sovereign of this universe of your own making, serving, and completed understanding. (120:3.10)
Jesus’ benediction to apostles
	“I bade you tarry in Jerusalem until you were endowed with power from on high. I am now about to take leave of you; I am about to ascend to my Father, and soon, very soon, will we send into this world of my sojourn the Spirit of Truth; and when he has come, you shall begin the new proclamation of the gospel of the kingdom, first in Jerusalem and then to the uttermost parts of the world. Love men with the love wherewith I have loved you and serve your fellow mortals even as I have served you. By the spirit fruits of your lives impel souls to believe the truth that man is a son of God, and that all men are brethren. Remember all I have taught you and the life I have lived among you. My love overshadows you, my spirit will dwell with you, and my peace shall abide upon you. Farewell.” (193:5.2)

	During the outworking of his anger-conceived plans of traitorous betrayal, Judas experienced moments of regret and shame, and in these lucid intervals he faintheartedly conceived, as a defense in his own mind, the idea that Jesus might possibly exert his power and deliver himself at the last moment. (139:12.12-13) (182:2.1,4)

birds' evolution
	Cretaceous was the era of birds (60:3)
	The frogs gave rise to the Reptilia, a great animal family which is virtually extinct, but which, before passing out of existence, gave origin to the whole bird family and the numerous orders of mammals. The bird types of today—eagles, ducks, pigeons, and ostriches—all descended from the enormous reptiles of long, long ago. The kingdom of reptiles, descended from the frog family, is today represented by four surviving divisions: two nonprogressive, snakes and lizards, together with their cousins, alligators and turtles; one partially progressive, the bird family, and the fourth, the ancestors of mammals and the direct line of descent of the human species. (65:2.8-10)
	birds evolved from hollow-boned leaping dinosaurs (60:2.12) (60:3.22)
	The wading and swimming prebirds of earlier ages had not been a success in the air, nor had the flying dinosaurs. They were a short-lived species, soon becoming extinct. They, too, were subject to the dinosaur doom, destruction, because of having too little brain substance in comparison with body size. (60:3.21)

	Andon created fire with flint sparks into bird’s nest (63:2.5-7)

Jesus said this about it: “Say what you will about the Son of Man, and it shall be forgiven you; but he who presumes to blaspheme against God shall hardly find forgiveness. When men go so far as knowingly to ascribe the doings of God to the forces of evil, such deliberate rebels will hardly seek forgiveness for their sins. (153:4.3) (165:3.6)

ancient beliefs
	In antiquity, the woman’s periodic hemorrhage and her further loss of blood at childbirth early suggested blood as the creator of the child (84:2.1)
	some ancients believed soul resided in blood (86:5.15)
	Next, any place where blood was shed became the property of the injured person or group. (69:9.8-9)
	Human secretions, being definitely magical, were highly regarded; blood and urine were thus among the earliest medicines and were soon augmented by roots and various salts. (90:4.8)
	The practice of paying “blood money” also came into vogue as a substitute for blood vengeance. Moses was the first in abolish this practices (70:10.12)
	The Phrygian ceremonies were imposing but degrading; their bloody festivals indicate how degraded and primitive these Levantine mysteries became. The most holy day was Black Friday, the “day of blood,” commemorating the self-inflicted death of Attis. (98:4.7)
	kings and royal blood have long been regarded as supernatural, and some Urantia peoples still regard their rulers as having had a divine origin (70:6.4)
salvation by shedding blood
	the barbarous idea of penance by shedding blood represents a religion wholly puerile and primitive (4:5.4)
	The Hebrews believed that “without the shedding of blood there could be no remission of sin. (4:5.5)
	Philo of Alexandria taught deliverance from the doctrine of forgiveness only by the shedding of blood. (121:6.5)
	the temple pavement stained with the blood of the sacrificial animals, the gory hands of the priests, the moaning of the dying animals, all of that made Jesus sick when he first saw it (125:1.4)
	Many still depend upon blood for salvation, but it has at least become figurative, symbolic, and mystic. (89:9.4)
scientific aspects of blood
	At any moment of time, in the blood stream of any human being there exists the possibility of upward of 15 million chemical reactions between the hormone output of a dozen ductless glands. (65:6.6)
	One of the most serviceable and complex episodes in the evolution of the higher types of animals consisted in the development of the ability of the iron in the circulating blood cells to perform in the double role of oxygen carrier and carbon dioxide remover. But other metals can be made to serve the same purpose. The cuttlefish employs copper for this function, and the sea squirt utilizes vanadium. (65:6.4)
	blood retains salinity of ancestors’ ocean environment in which life began (58:1.3-4)

The first treaties of peace were the “blood bonds”. (70:3.10)
The adherents of the cult of Mithra worshiped in caves and other secret places, chanting hymns, mumbling magic, eating the flesh of the sacrificial animals, and drinking the blood. (98:5.4)

The early blue men were responsive to the persuasions of the teachers of Prince Caligastia’s staff and were thrown into great confusion by the subsequent perverted teachings of those traitorous leaders. (64:6.22)
The blue man most of all profited by the Dalamatia teachings, the red man to some extent, and the black man least of all. (68:0.3)
The blue men were scattered all over Europe, but their better centers of culture were situated in the then fertile valleys of the Mediterranean basin and in northwestern Europe. (78:1.8)
In Mexico, Central America, and in the mountains of South America the later and more enduring civilizations were founded by a race predominantly red but containing a considerable admixture of the yellow, orange, and blue. (79:5.8)
The blue races, when mixed with the Andonite stock, were decidedly broad-headed. (81:4.2-3)
usually in all planets the blue race subdues indigo race (51:4.6)
achievements
	Man was himself at one time the beast of burden. One ruler of the blue race once had one hundred thousand men in his colony of burden bearers. (81:2.12)
	blue man early tamed the elephant (66:5.5)
	The blue man was partial to alphabet writing and made the greatest progress along such lines. (66:5.10)
blend with Andonites
	the blue race moved northwest into Europe. They drove Andonites from Europe (64:7.3,8) (78:1.5)
	thirty-five thousand years ago the European blue races were a highly blended people carrying strains of both red and yellow, while on the Atlantic coastlands and in the regions of present-day Russia they had absorbed a considerable amount of Andonite blood and to the south were in contact with the Saharan peoples. (80:3.2) (80:9.2)
	they suffered a great retard due to Neanderthal strain absorption (64:7.9-10) (78:1.8) (79:5.1)
	The blue races, when mixed with the Andonite stock, were decidedly broad-headed. (81:4.2-9)
	The earliest race mixtures in India were a blending of the migrating red and yellow races with the aboriginal Andonites. This group was later weakened by absorbing the greater portion of the extinct eastern green peoples as well as large numbers of the orange race, was slightly improved through limited admixture with the blue man, but suffered exceedingly through assimilation of large numbers of the indigo race. (79:2.2)
blend with Andites
	The Adamic descendants preferred them to all of the later persisting colored races. As the period of the early Adamic migrations ended, about 15,000 B.C., there were already more descendants of Adam in Europe and central Asia than anywhere else in the world, even than in Mesopotamia. The European blue races had been largely infiltrated. (64:6.21) (78:3.5,7) (80:1.5-7) (80:8.1)
	the white invaders of Europe exterminated all peoples encountered who were not quickly absorbed into their own ranks, and thus did the blue man come to an end—and quickly. (80:5.6) (80:9.11)
	In the north the Andites, through warfare and marriage, obliterated the blue men, but in the south they survived in greater numbers. The Basques and the Berbers represent the survival of two branches of this race, but even these peoples have been thoroughly admixed with the Saharans. (80:9.11)
	Slowly the migrating sons of Eden united with the higher types of the blue race, invigorating their cultural practices while ruthlessly exterminating the lingering strains of Neanderthal stock. This technique of race blending, combined with the elimination of inferior strains, produced a dozen or more virile and progressive groups of superior blue men, one of which are the Cro-Magnons. (80:1.5-8)
	The strongholds of the blue man which persisted longest were in southern France, but the last great military resistance was overcome along the Somme. (80:5.5)
the white race
	Although the European blue man did not of himself achieve a great cultural civilization, he did supply the biologic foundation which produced today white race (80:0.1) (80:5.7) (80:9.2,5,10)
	It is a misfortune on Urantia that we so largely lost our superior blue men, except as they persist in our amalgamated “white race”. (51:4.3)
nature
	A blend of the blue man with the Andon stock produced an artistically gifted type, and many of them became master sculptors. (66:5.26) (80:3.3,7)
	The blue man had the brain power of the red man associated with the soul and sentiment of the yellow man. (64:6.21)
	The blue men were hunters, fishers, and food gatherers; they were expert boatbuilders. (68:5.5) (80:3.5-7)
	Neanderthal absorption had greatly retarded the culture of the blue man, but he was otherwise the most aggressive, adventurous, and exploratory of all the evolutionary peoples of Eurasia. (78:1.8) (80:3.3)
	The blue men were perfectly honest in all their dealings and were wholly free from the sexual vices of the mixed Adamites. (80:3.4)
	Like other primitive races they never completely overcome their tendency to fight among themselves. (64:6.22)
Orlandof
	200,000 years ago Orlandof became a great teacher among the blue race and led many of the tribes back to the worship of the true God under the name of the “Supreme Chief. (64:6.23)

	early commerce, started by Andites, was facilitated by the use of boats (79:1.4) (81:3.6-7)
	Before the last Andites were driven out of the Euphrates valley, many of their brethren had entered Europe as adventurers, teachers, traders, and warriors. Some of man’s very early maritime commerce was established on Mediterranean, where blue men from the north and the Saharans from the south met Nodites and Adamites from the east. (80:1.1)
	The Mediterranean coastlands did not become permeated by the Andites until the great invasions of 2500 B.C. Land traffic and trade were nearly suspended. This interference brought about the great expansion of sea traffic and trade; it was in full swing about 4,500 years ago. (80:9.9)
	Not long after conquering India, the Dravidian Andites lost their racial and cultural contact with Mesopotamia, but the later opening up of the sea lanes and the caravan routes re-established these connections (79:3.2)

	By superior technique and greatly improved methods of steaming the boards, Jesus and Zebedee began to build boats of a very superior type, craft which were far more safe for sailing the lake than were the older types. (129:1.3)
	before leaving preaching Andrew found Jesus crying sitting in a boat on the beach (141:0.2)
	Jesus and his sister Ruth spent an hour together in a boat anchored off the coast. Ruth was the only one in the family who believed without doubt throughout her life in the divinity of Jesus' mission. (145:0.3)

	gland chemistry of certain glands comparable to the pituitary bodies effects inherent imagination and spiritual receptivity (49:5.19)

	The body cells of the Material Sons are far more resistant to disease than human beings. The body cells of humans are akin to the living disease-producing microscopic and ultramicroscopic organisms of the realm. These facts explain why we the Urantia peoples must do so much by way of scientific effort to withstand so many physical disorders. We would be far more disease resistant if our races carried more of the Adamic life. (76:4.7)
spiritual characteristics
	The life mechanism of the mortal personality, the human body, is the product of supermortal creative design; therefore it can never be perfectly controlled by man himself. (118:9.3)
	To a certain extent, the appearance of the material body-form is responsive to the character of the personality identity; the physical body does, to a limited degree, reflect something of the inherent nature of the personality. (112:6.3)
	The spirit is the architect, the mind is the builder, the body is the material building. (42:12.12)
	The physical bodies of mortals are “the temples of God”. the body and mind of man are the dwelling place of the gift of the Gods, the spirit of God becoming the spirit of man. (1:4.2) (34:6.7) (143:2.4) (160:4.9)

origin in Aryan Sethites
	Aryans brought Brahmanism to India (94:1.1)
	Many of the ancient gods of the Aryans, such as Agni, Indra, and Soma, have persisted as secondary to the three members of the Trimurti. (94:4.6)
	The Sethites and their followers like Brahmans of the Hindu faith never entirely lost the Trinity concept revealed by Adam. (92:5.9)
	vedism was weakened through rejection of higher truth of the cult of the Aryans (94:2.2)
philosophy
	Brahmanic philosophy has approximated many of the facts of the universe and has approached numerous cosmic truths, but it has all too often fallen victim to the error of failing to differentiate between the several levels of reality, such as absolute, transcendental, and finite. They also fail in recognize the reality of the soul (94:3.7-8)
	Brahman philosophers elaborate in the concept of impersonal Infinity an abstract and misty vapor concept like the one produced by greeks (98:2.9)
	the composite belief of the Brahman-Absolute and the salvationistic gospel of Salem influenced on Taoism (94:5.5-6)
	While the highest phase of Brahmanism was hardly a religion, it was truly one of the most noble reaches of the mortal mind into the domains of philosophy and metaphysics, and did not stop until it had speculated about almost every phase of theology, but lacked belief in Father and ascendant progression (94:3.1)
	The philosophy of Brahmanism also came very near to the realization of the indwelling of the Thought Adjusters, only to become perverted through the misconception of truth. (94:3.6)
priesthood
	the Brahman caste of teacher-priests assumed control over expanding Vedic ritual (94:1.2)
	the Hindu caste system allow to perpetuate the Brahman priests (94:2.1)
	exalted themselves above even their gods in a way not done by any other people (94:2.2)

	Never would the Brahman priests accept the Salem teaching of salvation through faith, favor with God apart from ritualistic observances and sacrificial ceremonials. (94:1.5)
	The vast Vedic priesthood itself floundered and sank beneath the black flood of inertia and pessimism which their own selfish and unwise presumption had brought upon all India. (94:2.2)

human brainedness | mortals:planetary types
	The one physical uniformity of mortals is the brain and nervous system; nevertheless, there are three basic organizations of the brain mechanism: the one-, the two-, and the three-brained types. Urantians are of the two-brained type, somewhat more imaginative, adventurous, and philosophical than the one-brained mortals but somewhat less spiritual, ethical, and worshipful than the three-brained orders. (49:5.13-18) (109:3.5-6)
	Adjusters gain better contact with three-brained mortals (109:3.5)
	The intellectual and spiritual differential between the three brain types characterizes individuals who are otherwise quite alike in mind endowment and spiritual potential, being greatest in the temporal life and tending to diminish as the mansion worlds are traversed one by one (40:5.17)
	These three types of physical-brain endowment are not factors in Adjuster bestowal, in seraphic service, or in any other phase of spirit ministry. (40:5.9,14,17)

Geology
	360,000,000 years ago the land was still rising. Western Europe and the British Isles were emerging, except parts of Wales, which were deeply submerged. (59:1.17)
	A great volcanic activity was in the European sector. Not in millions upon millions of years had such violent and extensive volcanic eruptions occurred as now took place around the Mediterranean trough and especially in the neighborhood of the British Isles.(59:3.6)
	much of western Europe, including the British Isles, was submerged(59:4.8)
	Stumps of other and older mountains are to be found all over Great Britain and Europe. (59:5.12)
	In England the New Red Sandstone belongs to this epoch. (60:1.4)
	10,000,000 years ago began an age of widespread local land deposits; Much of Europe, at this time, was still under water, including parts of England (61:4.2)
	In Europe the ice at various times covered the British Isles excepting the coast of southern England(61:5.4)
	England separated from the continent, and Denmark arose from the sea, at the same time isthmus of Gibraltar gave way as the result of an earthquake. (64:1.5) (80:2.4)
first settlers
	Andonites migrated even to British Isles, that were connected by land with France during most of the ice age (63:5.2-3) (64:1.5-6) (64:7.17)
	Though the remains of the Foxhall peoples were the last to be discovered in England, these Andonites were really the first human beings to live in those regions. (64:2.4-6)
	By 5000 B.C. the evolving white races were dominant throughout all of northern Europe, including northern Germany, northern France, and the British Isles. (80:5.8)

Bronze Age took place at ca. 3000 B.C., overlapping New Stone Age at times, a period associated with mother worship in some places and sun worship in others (80:9.12-13)
it was not a distinct period. There was a bronze culture in Turkestan dating before 9000 B.C., and the Andites early learned to work in iron, gold, and copper, as well. But conditions were very different away from the more advanced centers of civilization. There were no distinct periods, such as the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages; all three existed at the same time in different localities. (81:3.4)

The appearance of genuine brotherhood signifies that a social order has arrived in which all men delight in bearing one another’s burdens; they actually desire to practice the golden rule. (71:4.16)
brotherhood is one of the most powerful and most tenuous factor of civilization (118:8.10)
how to achieve it
	Only through, and by appeal to, the Adjuster can mankind ever attain unity and brotherhood. (149:3.3)
	approaching other religions with the recognition of the truths which are held in common (149:2.5)
	Economic interdependence and social fraternity will ultimately conduce to brotherhood. (99:7.5)
	Religious revelation is essential to the realization of brotherhood on Urantia. (52:6.2)
	such a quality of brotherly affection is invariably manifested itself in unselfish and loving social service (142:7.4)
	Micah taught about a day in which everybody would live according to his understanding of God (97:5.5)
	Brotherhood will be achieved through:
	# Social fraternity. Multiplication of international and interracial social contacts. Development of a common language and the multiplication of multilinguists. (52:6.3)
	# Intellectual cross-fertilization. Brotherhood is impossible on a world whose inhabitants are so primitive that they fail to recognize the folly of unmitigated selfishness. (52:6.4)
	# Ethical awakening. Only ethical consciousness can unmask the immorality of human intolerance and the sinfulness of fratricidal strife. (52:6.5)

	doctrinal fetish betrays man and leads into intolerance and bigotry (88:2.7)
	Rather did the early races learn by sad experience that “in union there is strength”; and it is this lack of natural brotherly attraction that now stands in the way of the brotherhood of man on Urantia. (68:1.1)
	future prophets should not strengthen interrligious barriers but augment the religious brotherhood (92:5.16)
	Seldom do races of different colors and varied natures take kindly to the plan of human brotherhood. (39:5.4)
	Religious peace—brotherhood—can never exist unless all religions are willing to completely divest themselves of all ecclesiastical authority and fully surrender all concept of spiritual sovereignty. (134:4.3-4,8)
	There cannot be peace between light and darkness, between life and death, between truth and error. (175:1.2)
	always happens an inevitable clash between religions of spirit and religious of authority (173:3.3)
	Always we may have diversity of intellectual comprehension and interpretation, even varying degrees of socialization, but lack of spiritual brotherhood is both inexcusable and reprehensible. (170:5.20)
	unless religious, brotherhood is an abstraction devoid of love (16:9.8)

brotherhood of man; Brotherhood | | brotherhood (attitude); gospel | | OK
Brotherhood constitutes a fact of relationship between every personality in universal existence.  (12:7.10-11)
The ultimate goal of human progress is the reverent recognition of the fatherhood of God and the loving materialization of the brotherhood of man. (71:4.15) (143:1.4)
While religion is exclusively a personal spiritual experience—knowing God as a Father—the corollary of this experience—knowing man as a brother—entails the adjustment of the self to other selves, and that involves the social or group aspect of religious life. (99:5.1)
No person can escape the benefits or the penalties that may come as a result of relationship to other persons. (12:7.11)
origin
	The brotherhood of men is founded on the fatherhood of God. (12:7.8,10) (16:9.14) (52:6.7) (134:4.1) (159:5.7) (195:8.11)
	universality of God’s love creates a relationship of the whole, the universal brotherhood (12:7.8,10)
how to achieve it
	Religious revelation is essential to the realization of brotherhood on Urantia. (52:6.2)
	The quickest way to realize the brotherhood of man on Urantia is to effect the spiritual transformation of present-day humanity. (52:6.7)
	impulse of social service is basis of brotherhood of man (103:2.8)
	If each mortal could only become a focus of dynamic affection, this benign virus of love would soon pervade the sentimental emotion-stream of humanity to such an extent that all civilization would be encompassed by love, and that would be the realization of the brotherhood of man. (100:4.6)
Jesus versus Lucifer
	Jesus used term “brotherhood of man” for kingdom of heaven (170:2.24)
	Lucifer was bold and persistent in the advocacy of the “equality of mind” and “the brotherhood of intelligence” (53:4.2)

Buddhism; Buddhists; Buddhist religion; Buddhist faith | (94:8) | Buddha; Gautama Siddhartha | RELIGION | OK
Buddhism is one of the four great international and interracial faiths (92:6.5,16)
Buddhism has shown an adaptability to the mores of many peoples that has been equaled only by Christianity. (92:6.16)
The great weakness in the original gospel of Buddhism was that it did not produce a religion of unselfish social service. (94:8.19)
Buddhism is a living, growing religion today because it succeeds in conserving many of the highest moral values of its adherents. It promotes calmness and self-control, augments serenity and happiness, and does much to prevent sorrow and mourning. (94:9.6)
doctrines
	The great strength of Buddhism is that its adherents are free to choose truth from all religions; such freedom of choice has seldom characterized a Urantian faith. (94:12.4)
	it teaches that all Buddhas were but the manifestation of some higher essence, some Eternal One of infinite and unqualified existence, some Absolute Source of all reality. This final conception of the Buddha Eternal can well be identified as the Absolute, sometimes even as the infinite I AM. (94:11.11-13)(94:12.1)
	Buddhists were earnest devotees of the doctrine of physical humiliation. (89:3.4)
	it held that the Buddha divine nature resided in all men, which is one of the clearest presentations of the truth of the indwelling Adjusters (94:11.5)
	The great weakness in the cosmology of Buddhism is twofold: its contamination with many of the superstitions of India and China and its sublimation of Gautama, first as the enlightened one, and then as the Eternal Buddha. (94:12.1)
	Gradually the concept of God, as contrasted with the Absolute, began to appear in Buddhism, and finally came to fruit in the belief in Amida Buddha.  It is proclaimed that salvation is attained by faith in the divine mercies and loving care of Amida, God of the Paradise in the west. (94:12)
	Buddhism is a great and beautiful philosophy, but without God (103:9.3) (131:3.1) (132:7.5)
	despite a higher morality, its early portrayal of God was even less well-defined than was that of Hinduism, which provided for lesser and personal deities. (94:2.8)
	a great limitation in the original gospel of Siddhartha was that it attempted liberation of the human self from all the limitations of the mortal nature by the technique of isolating the self from objective reality. (94:11.6)
	it teaches that there are “many Buddhas”, an unlimited and infinite number, even that anyone can aspire to become one—to attain the divinity of a Buddha. (94:11.10)
	The great advance made in Buddhist philosophy consisted in its comprehension of the relativity of all truth. (94:11.4)
	Some of his later followers taught that Sakyamuni Buddha’s spirit returns periodically to earth as a living Buddha (94:11.3)
	The Buddhist religion promises salvation from suffering, unending peace (5:4.5)
	Buddhism prospered because it offered salvation through belief in the Buddha, the enlightened one. (94:9.1)
	The Buddhist faith developed two doctrines of a trinitarian nature (104:1.6)
history
	Gautama formulated those theories which grew into the philosophy of Buddhism after six years of the futile practice of Yoga. (94:7.2)
	The spread of Buddhism from its homeland in India to all of Asia is one of the thrilling stories of the spiritual devotion and missionary persistence of sincere religionists. (94:9)
	it was much affected by Taoism in China, Shinto in Japan, Christianity in Tibet. It became Brahmanized and later abjectly surrendered to Islam (94:9.3) (94:12.5)
	Buddhism soon amalgamated with the lingering ritualistic practices of disintegrating Taoism. (94:11.1)
	fitted well into religious customs of yellow race (94:11.1)
	Buddhism finally gave way in northern India before the onslaught of a militant Islam with its clear-cut concept of Allah as the supreme God of the universe. (94:2.8) (94:9.3)
	It became Brahmanized and later abjectly surrendered to Islam, while throughout much of the rest of the Orient it degenerated into a ritual which Gautama Siddhartha would never have recognized. (94:7.8) (94:9.3)
	it ended shackled with those very ceremonial practices and ritualistic incantations against which the founder had so fearlessly fought, and which he had so valiantly denounced. (94:11.3)
	In the Orient the combined teachings of Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism were synthesized by Nanak and his followers into Sikhism, one of the most advanced religions of Asia. (92:5.15) (92:7.2)
	Buddhism is undergoing a twentieth-century renaissance. (94:12.5)
Jesus and Buddhism
	while Jesus and Ganid were at Alexandria Ganid wrote an abstract of Buddhism (131:3)
	It was on the visit to Switzerland, up in the mountains, that Jesus had an all-day talk with both Gonod and his son Ganid about Buddhism. Jesus started saying: “Your Buddha was much better than your Buddhism”. (132:7.3-5)
