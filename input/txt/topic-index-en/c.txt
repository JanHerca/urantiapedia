Cannibalism was once well-nigh universal among the evolving races. (89:5.3)
Eating human flesh became part of a solemn ceremony of revenge (89:5.5-6)

# progressed to the point where only certain parts or organs of the body were eaten
# It became limited to men

Pastoral living afforded further relief from food slavery; man learned to live on the interest of his capital, the increase in his flocks; and this provided more leisure for culture and progress. (68:5.7)
economic freedom has been secured through capital and invention (81:5.5)
Capital-accumulation and property-inheritance mores were a distinct social advance, but subsequently the misuse of capital has been accompanied by gross abuses. (69:9.3)
Capital is labor applied as a renunciation of the present in favor of the future. (69:5.1,4-5)
the accumulation of individual capital and group wealth immediately led to military organization. (69:5.2)
Though capital has tended to liberate man, it has greatly complicated his social and industrial organization. Through capital and invention the present generation enjoys a higher degree of freedom, but that dos not mean any justification of the many misuses of capital by thoughtless and selfish custodians. (69:5.15)
The abuse of capital by unfair capitalists does not destroy the fact that it is the basis of modern industrial society. (69:5.15)
The basic urges which led to the accumulation of capital were: (69:5.3-11)
# Hunger—associated with foresight.

	the ever-increasing drought gradually brought about the great Andite exodus from the lands south and east of the Caspian Sea. (79:1.5)
	For almost 20,000 years the Andonites had been pushed farther and farther to the north of central Asia by the Andites. By 3000 B.C. increasing aridity was driving these Andonites back into Turkestan. This Andonite push southward continued for over a thousand years and, splitting around the Caspian and Black seas, penetrated Europe by way of both the Balkans and the Ukraine.(80:9.6)

First Cause
	Reason, through the study of science, may lead back through nature to a First Cause (101:2.3,7) (195:6.5)
	The vital distinction between first causes and second causes is that first causes produce original effects which are free from inheritance of any factor derived from any antecedent causation (118:4)
	The Infinite can be finally revealed only in infinity; the cause can never be fully comprehended by an analysis of effects; the living God is immeasurably greater than the sum total of creation that has come into being as a result of the creative acts of his unfettered free will. (3:1.2)
	Universe causes cannot be lower than universe effects. (3:6.3)
	Finite origins are helpful, but only divine causes reveal final effects. (19:1.11)

certainty in dogmatic religion
	A fetish man was thought to be more than human; he was divine, even infallible. (88:1.10)

	In the mortal state, nothing can be absolutely proved; both science and religion are predicated on assumptions. (103:7.10)

	The certainty of the God-knowing religionist should not be disturbed by the uncertainty of the doubting materialist; rather should the uncertainty of the unbeliever be mightily challenged by the profound faith and unshakable certainty of the experiential believer. (103:8.5)
	On the spiritual level, the need for finite proof gradually vanishes before the actual experience of reality. (103:7.10)
	certainty extends only as far as one’s personal experience (2:7.2)
	In knowledge alone there can never be absolute certainty, only increasing probability of approximation; but the religious soul of spiritual illumination knows, and knows now. (102:2.4)
	nothing which human nature touches is infallible (159:4.8)
God's certainty
	Of God, the most inescapable of all presences, the most real of all facts, the most living of all truths, the most loving of all friends, and the most divine of all values, we have the right to be the most certain of all universe experiences. (102:7.10)

The shamans were great believers in the mission of chance as revelatory of the will of the spirits; they frequently cast lots to arrive at decisions. (90:2.4)
The savage strives to personalize everything intangible and abstract, and thus both nature and chance become personalized as ghosts—spirits—and later on as gods. (86:2)
to continue to ascribe things difficult of comprehension to supernatural causes is nothing less than a lazy and convenient way of avoiding all forms of intellectual hard work. Luck is merely a term coined to cover the inexplicable (86:2.5)

	Creators forge out strong, noble, and experienced character by the anvils of necessity and the hammers of anguish (23:2.12)

	the basis of their beliefs is ancestor worship (68:4.3) (94:5.7)
	During the spiritually decadent centuries the religion of the yellow race degenerated into a pitiful theology wherein swarmed devils, dragons, and evil spirits, all betokening the returning fears of the unenlightened mortal mind. (94:6.12)

The results of Peter’s preaching on the day of Pentecost were such as to decide the efforts to proclaim the gospel of the kingdom. Peter was the real founder of the Christian church; Paul carried the Christian message to the gentiles, and the Greek believers carried it to the whole Roman Empire. (195)
For some time the believers in Jesus were a sect within Judaism. (194:1.5) (194:4.10)
the fast triumph
	there were three paramount factors in rapid spread of early Christianity: (132:0.5-8)
	# The choosing and holding of Simon Peter as an apostle.
	# The conversion of Saul of Tarsus
	# The preliminary preparation of thirty Romans inadvertently by Jesus
	The triumph of Christianity over the philosophic religions and the mystery cults was due to: (195:0.5-18) (195:1.2-4)
	# The organization
	# Hellenization
	# The ideal of the life of Jesus
	# Compromises to Mithracism
	# Compromises with paganism
Abner and Babylonian church
	Abner represented Babylonian view instead of Hellenic in early church (166:5.2,4) (171:1.6)
	Abnerian church was centered at Philadelphia. From there the missionaries of the Abnerian version of the kingdom of heaven spread throughout Mesopotamia and Arabia. It was eventually lost in the Islamic movement. (171:1.6) (195:1.11)
Paul and Hellenic church
	Pauline church had its headquartered at Antioch (171:1.6) (196:2.6)
	In Antioch Paul’s disciples were first called “Christians.” (121:2.5) (194:4.13)
	Very soon the believers at Antioch were taking up a collection to keep their fellow believers at Jerusalem from starving. (194:4.7)
	Each Jewish synagogue tolerated a fringe of gentile believers, “devout” or “God-fearing” men, and it was among this fringe of proselytes that Paul made the bulk of his early converts to Christianity. (121:2.5)
	first Roman church had been previously the chief Mithraic temple (132:0.5)
	Greek writings determined the drift of Paul’s Christian cult toward the West instead of toward the East. (121:6.2)
	The moral backbone of the early Christian church consisted of Christianized Greek proselytes to Judaism. (121:3.4) (195:3.6)
	Mithraism was for a time contemporary with, and a competitor of, Paul’s rising cult of Christianity (121:5.8)
	During the III century A.D., Mithraic and Christian churches were very similar both in appearance and in the character of their ritual. (98:6.3)
	The one great difference between Mithraism and Christianity, aside from the characters of Mithras and Jesus, was that the one encouraged militarism while the other was ultrapacific. (98:6.4)
	The Christians accepted the empire; the empire adopted Christianity. (195:3)
Peter and the church of Jerusalem
	Jerusalem was to become the cradle of the early gospel movement (176:1.3)
	The early Christian church was largely composed of the lower classes and these slaves. (121:3.7)
	the church at Jerusalem organized under the leadership of Peter, and James the brother of Jesus had been installed as its titular head. Matadormus was treasurer, that rich man who initially refused to be part of the group of seventy evangelists (92:6.18) (163:2.7) (194:4.12)
	fierce persecution against believers in Jerusalem scattered believers to the ends of the earth (143:6.6)
	persecutions againt Christians very much resulted from the use of the term “kingdom” (170:2.24-25)
rituals evolution
	At first they baptized in the name of Jesus; it was almost twenty years before they began to baptize in “the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. (194:4.9)
	Remembrance Supper originated as a version of Passover ceremony (89:9.2)
failings
	* Paul’s Christianity made sure of the adoration of the divine Christ, but it almost wholly lost sight of the struggling and valiant human Jesus of Galilee (196:2.4-5)
	* Paul maintained the belief in the doctrine of atonement for sins through the "shedding of blood" (63:6.4)
	* changed the gospel of the kingdom—sonship with God and brotherhood with man—into the proclamation of the resurrection of Jesus (192:4.7) (194:0.3-7) (194:4.4-6)
	* Christianity preached God as Father of Lord Jesus Christ, believer-fellowship with risen Christ (5:4.8) (194:0.4)
	* Christ thus became the head of the church rather than the elder brother of each individual believer in the Father’s family of the kingdom. (170:5.17-18) (194:4.4-6)
	* Christian church was built around:
	** the concept of glorified Christ (5:4.9)
	** the fact of Christ’s death (143:5.11) (143:6.3)
	** the miraculous concepts and the glorified memories of Jesus’ divine-human personality (98:7.2,8) (166:0.2) (170:2.10) (196:2.1,4,6)
	* It was not loyal to the simple spiritual appeal, such as Jesus had presented to the souls of men; it early struck a decided attitude on religious rituals, education and other mores (195:0.3)
	* elevated the rituals and doctrines of self-abnegation, asceticism, fasting, deprivation, sanctification through sorrow, suffering, and the mortification of the flesh. (89:3.3) (89:4.1)
	* the great mistakes of early Christianity were incorporation of Persian and Greek thought, connection to Judaism, atonement, and overemphasis on person of Jesus (149:2.2-5)
	* Paul and his successors partly transferred the issues of eternal life from the individual to the church. (170:5.17-18)
	* it was the general belief that Jesus was the Eternal Son (161:1.6)
	* The Christian concept of the Trinity, which began to gain recognition near the close of the first century after Christ, was comprised of the Universal Father, the Creator Son of Nebadon, and the Divine Minister of Salvington—Mother Spirit of the local universe and creative consort of the Creator Son. Though the Christian concept of the Trinity erred in fact, it was practically true with respect to spiritual relationships. (104:1.11-13) (161:1.6) (194:4.9)
	* it lacked the moral courage to follow the noble example of Jesus in its subsequent attitude toward women (149:2.9) (167:6.4)
	* the idea of having all possessions held in common, that led to disaster (194:4.2,7)
	* the second coming of Jesus was deemed as near at hand, and when did not happen, began to teach that the kingdom was in reality to appear at the culmination of the Christian age (170:2.1,10) (170:5.14-15) (194:4.5,7) (196:2.5) | Jesus:second coming
	* Paul’s institutionalized church became a virtual substitute for the kingdom of heaven which Jesus had proclaimed. (170:2.8-10) (170:5.7-15)
	* teachers were much unyielding and uncompromising at Lake Urmia (134:6.14-15)
influences
	The people and ideas that most influenced the beginnings of Christianity were:
	* 30 Jesus-taught Roman religious leaders (132:0.4-8)
	* Jesus’ contribution at Corinth led to the formation of a first Christian church there (133:3.10-12)
	* Babylonian and Persian ideas of good and evil (146:1.3)
	* the continence cult of other religions and Paul (89:3.6)

	* Abiding faith in the resurrection of Jesus was the cardinal feature of the faith of all branches of the early gospel teaching. (190:0.4)
	* Christian teachers, were the first to proclaim that the poor could have salvation on equal terms with the rich. (69:9.4)
	* Early Christianity was entirely free from all civil entanglements, social commitments, and economic alliances. (99:3.1)
	* imposed more stringent sex obligations upon men (84:5.6)
	* Christianity was in no sense an economic movement having for its purpose the amelioration of the miseries of the depressed classes. (121:3.9)
	* The early Christian cult was the most effective, appealing, and enduring of any ritual ever conceived or devised (87:7.4)
	* it has built up one of the most progressive human societies which has ever existed on Urantia (170:5.16) (195:0.3)
	* That which gave greatest power to Christianity was the way its believers lived lives of service and even the way they died for their faith during the earlier times of drastic persecution. (194:4.6) (195:3.4)
	* Christian teachings were vastly superior to existing religions (121:5.6)
	* the deciding factor of Christianity was the admission of women into the full fellowship of the Christian faith. (98:6.4) (150:1.3)

evolution
	the church is only the larval stage of the thwarted spiritual kingdom (170:5.21)
	Many of the great truths taught by Jesus were almost lost in these early compromises, but they yet slumber in this religion of paganized Christianity, which was in turn the Pauline version of the life and teachings of the Son of Man. (149:2.2) (195:0.18)
	The church, being an adjunct to society and the ally of politics, was doomed to share in the intellectual and spiritual decline of the so-called European “dark ages. In a spiritual sense, Christianity was hibernating. (195:4)
	Protestant reformation disrupted unity of Christianity (92:5.15)
	It is futile to talk about a revival of primitive Christianity; we must go forward from where we find ourselves. (195:10.1)
problems of Christianity
	paganized and socialized Christianity stands in need of new contact with the uncompromised teachings of Jesus; it languishes for lack of a new vision of the Master’s life on earth. (195:9.2)
	the great tests of twentieth-century Christianity are materialism, mechanism, and secularism (195:9.3)
	If Christianity persists in neglecting its spiritual mission while it continues to busy itself with social and material problems, the spiritual renaissance must await the coming of new teachers (195:9.4)
	Christianity—the best of the religions of the twentieth century—is not only a religion about Jesus, but it is so largely one which men experience secondhand. (195:9.8)
	Christianity has dared to lower its ideals before the challenge of human greed, war-madness, and the lust for power (195:9.9)
	Christianity is threatened by slow death from formalism, overorganization, intellectualism, and other nonspiritual trends. The modern Christian church is not the brotherhood of dynamic believers expected by Jesus (195:9.10-11)
influences
	Christianity had a lot of influence on Buddhism and Hinduism, but by the time they did it was already too Westernized (94:9.3) (94:4.1)
	new and strange religions are only superficially accepted. This is what happened to a New Zealand tribe that nominally accepted Christianity but then crafted a new version based on their beliefs. (92:2.5)
strengths
	* church is inevitable and useful social result of Jesus’ life (170:5.7,10)
	* it is founded upon the historic fact of Michael’s bestowal (121:5.16)
	* sooner or later the gospel will emerge from Christianity to transform the world (194:2.8)
	* at its inception it was the greatest religion ever known and in the twentieth century it is the best religion (92:6.11,16) (194:4.6) (195:9.8)
	* Jesus did not found the so-called Christian church, but he has, in every manner consistent with his nature, fostered it as the best existent exponent of his lifework on earth. (195:10.9)
	* Christianity of the twentieth century has truly been one of the greatest powers for good on earth, and therefore no man should lightly regard it, notwithstanding its inherent and acquired defects. (195:10.12)
	* in recent times has experienced a relative rehabilitation (195:4.3-4)
	* Paul and his conferees founded a religion of faith, hope, and charity. Jesus revealed and exemplified a religion of love (196:3.19)
	* Christianity promises salvation from sin, sanctity (5:4.5-8)
	* there is a river of truth running through the centuries in Christianity (195:9.1)
	* Christianity even now willingly goes the first mile, but mankind languishes and stumbles along in moral darkness because there are so few genuine second-milers (195:10.5)
weaknesses
	* church is institutionalized to spiritual barrenness (195:3.9)
	* church is unconscious obstacle to real gospel (195:10.8)
	* Ecclesiasticism is at once and forever incompatible with that living faith (195:10.8)
	* Jesus never place emphasis upon struggle between soul and body (157:6.4)
	* Marriage which culminates in the home is indeed man’s most exalted institution, but it is essentially human; it should never have been called a sacrament. (83:8.1-4)
	* Christianity is an extemporized religion, and therefore must it operate in low gear. (195:10.18)
	* it is afraid that its unconsecrated, self-sufficient fellowship, its social respectability, and its selfish economic maladjustment will be exposed (196:1.2)
	* the gospel of Jesus became the gospel of ransom to purchase man back from the clutch of the devil (194:2.8)
	* those who have come to venerate the divine and risen Christ should have overlooked the man—the valiant and courageous hero—Joshua ben Joseph. (92:7.12)
	* there is no excuse for the involvement of the church in commerce and politics; such unholy alliances are a flagrant betrayal of the Master. (195:10.13)
	* Christianity languishes for lack of new vision of Master’s life (195:9.2)
	* It has long since ceased to be the religion of Jesus, although it still valiantly portrays a beautiful religion about Jesus (98:7.11) (149:2.2)
	* Because of overmuch false sentiment the beneficent minister of the underprivileged has unwisely perpetuated degenerate stocks (99:3.5)
	* it has seriously blundered in the attempt to put a miraculous interpretation on certain epochs of human history. (97:8.5-6)
	* Throughout Middle Ages existed, alongside slumbering and secularized Christianity, a continuous stream of mysticism, a fantastic spiritual experience bordering on unreality and philosophically akin to pantheism. (195:4.1)
	* Christianity persists in neglecting its spiritual mission while it continues to busy itself with social and material problems (195:9.4)
	* it has become so thoroughly Occidentalized that many non-European peoples very naturally look upon Christianity as a strange revelation of a strange God and for strangers (92:6.18) (94:4.1,10)
	* The Pentateuch was incorporated into Christian theology, profoundly influencing it for a long time. (74:8.12)
	* The Christian teachers perpetuated the belief in the fiat creation of the human race, and all this led directly to the formation of the hypothesis of a onetime golden age of utopian bliss (74:8.13)
	* some fellow Jews of Jesus rejected him and conspired to bring about his ignominious death; but that in no way justifies the unjust hatred, nor condones the unfair attitude of mind, which so many professed Christians have maintained toward individual Jews for many centuries. (175:2)
	* Notwithstanding the Master’s effort to free man from pigeonholed rituals, the Remembrance Supper was reduced to a set formula (179:5.5)
	* Christianity sects are pitiful subdivision of believers, a weakness to Oriental peoples (170:5.20) (195:4.3) (195:10.7,15)
	* Religion is now confronted by the challenge of a new age of scientific minds and materialistic tendencies. In this gigantic struggle between the secular and the spiritual, the religion of Jesus will eventually triumph. (195:4.4-5) (195:8.3) (195:9.9-11)
	* Christians should not require already God-conscious men to reject their historic illuminated leaders (99:5.11)
	* modern Christianity sponsor in excess the social systems and industrial policies of Western civilization  (99:3.1) (195:10.20-21)
	* Christianity, today, has become a religion well adapted to the social, economic, and political mores of the white races. (94:4.1,10) (98:7.11)
	* it is the one shameful thing about the religion that presumed to take Jesus’ name that it lacked the moral courage to follow this noble example in its subsequent attitude toward women. (149:2.9) (167:6.4)

	The living Jesus is the only hope of a possible unification of Christianity. (195:10.11,16)

circumcision | | | | OK
Ancient rite
	The well-nigh universal ancient rite of circumcision was an outgrowth of the cult of partial sacrifice; it was purely sacrificial, no thought of hygiene being attached thereto. Later on became a hygienic procedure. (89:8.2) (92:1.1)
	Circumcision was first practiced as a rite of initiation into one of these secret fraternities. (70:7.10)
	In many ways and by devious methods the olden shamans established their reputations as voices of God and custodians of providence. They sprinkled the newborn with water and conferred names upon them; they circumcised the males. (90:2.10)
At Salem
	Most of the Salem believers had practiced circumcision, though it had never been made obligatory by Melchizedek. (93:6.6)
	Abraham, who was against the rite of circumcision, decided to solemnize the ratification of the Salem covenant accepting the rite. (93:6.6)
In Jesus times

(195:3.8-9)
	* civilization contain within itself the seeds of retrogression when culture advances overfast, when material achievement outruns the evolution of worship-wisdom. Such human societies will recede from high but premature levels of attainment. (78:2.3-4) (118:8.6)

	Love is the essence of religion and the wellspring of superior civilization. (16:9.7) (102:6.3)
	Many intelligent and well-meaning men, even in the more enlightened age of these revelations, maintain that modern civilization could not have been built upon the teachings of Jesus. But all such doubters forget that a much better civilization could have been built upon his teachings.  The secret of a better civilization is bound up in the Master’s teachings of the brotherhood of man, the good will of love and mutual trust. (154:4.6) (194:3.12)
	The Urantia peoples are suffering the consequences of the Caligastia upheaval precipitated world-wide confusion and robbed all subsequent generations of the moral assistance which a well-ordered society would have provided. (34:7.4) (102:8.2)
	A lasting social system without a morality predicated on spiritual realities can no more be maintained than could the solar system without gravity. (39:3.7) (195:5.9)
	Civilization is a racial acquirement; it is not biologically inherent; hence must all children be reared in an environment of culture (68:0.2)
	Secularism can never bring peace to mankind. Nothing can take the place of God in human society. Secular revolt win many liberties and satisfactions but made the mistake of institute a revolt against God himself (16:9.7) (80:7.8) (94:6.12) (195:8.6)
	much, very much, in civilization depends on age, the help of the biologic uplifters, and the subsequent missions of the various orders of the divine Sons. (49:5.16)
	But the security of civilization itself still rests on the growing willingness of one generation to invest in the welfare of the next and future generations. (84:7.27)
development
	Culture is never developed under conditions of poverty; leisure is essential to the progress of civilization. (81:6.6)
	cultural society is no great and beneficent club of inherited privilege;  this guild of civilization exacts costly admission fees (81:5.3-5)
	Society is not a divine institution; it is a phenomenon of progressive evolution (81:6.39)
	society was born, not of mere association of numbers, but rather as a result of the organization of intelligent co-operators (68:1.4)
	Race mixture is always advantageous in that it favors versatility of culture and makes for a progressive civilization (79:2.7)

goals
	the factors in the preservation of civilization are:
	# Conservation of property and wealth. (79:8.11)
	# Pooling of the experience of more than one generation. (79:8.12)
	# Efficient education of children in the arts and sciences of the past. (79:8.13)
	# Development of a strong sense of duty, the enhancement of morality, and the augmentation of ethical sensitivity. (79:8.14)
	An ideal social order is that in which every man loves his neighbor as he loves himself. (99:2.4)
	Society should in every way possible foster originality. (70:2.18)
	The ideal of all social attainment can be realized only in the coming of this divine kingdom. (196:2.11)
	prime gift of society is security, survival possibilities (68:1.5) (70:9.1) (81:5.4)
	refusal to use power selfishly is mark of high civilization (48:7.8)
	we should not tolerate idleness or poverty. No society has progressed very far when it permits idleness or tolerates poverty. (71:3.8)
	It is the business and duty of society to provide the child of nature with a fair and peaceful opportunity to pursue self-maintenance (70:9.17)
	Society thus becomes a co-operative scheme for securing civil freedom through institutions (81:5.5)
	Only in the higher levels of the superconscious mind we find those higher concepts in association with effective master patterns which will contribute to the building of a better and more enduring civilization. (111:4.5)
primitive society
	the four great stages were collection, hunting, pastoral, and agricultural (66:3.2) (68:5.2-11)
	Primitive society was regulated on the theory that the group membership should have an interest in, and some degree of control over, the behavior of each individual. (70:10.4)
	The chief factor in early civilization was the force exerted by wise social masters (81:6.14)
	Chinese were first to achieve a racial solidarity—the first to attain a large-scale cultural, social, and political civilization. (79:6.8)
	For about 35,000 years after the days of Adam, the cradle of civilization was in south-western Asia, extending from the Nile valley eastward and slightly to the north across northern Arabia, through Mesopotamia, and on into Turkestan. (81:1.1)
	first great advances were fire, animal domestication, slavery, and private property (69:6-9) (81:2.7)
	Urantia civilization was literally forged out between the anvil of necessity and the hammers of fear. (66:5.13)
	Primitive society was thus founded on the reciprocity of necessity and on the enhanced safety of association. (68:1.3)
	Primitive society with its four divisions—industrial, regulative, religious, and military—rose through the instrumentality of fire, animals, slaves, and property. (69:6.1)
	Civilization has become man’s insurance against violent death (68:1.2) (68:2.2)
	Hunger and love drove men together; vanity and ghost fear held them together. (68:2.4,6) (68:3)
	Planetary Prince’s and Adam’s headquarters intended to advance (51:6.3) (51:7) (66:3)
	the excessive multiplication of slaves is what caused the aegean culture to perish (80:7.6,13)
	Law is always at first negative and prohibitive; in advancing civilizations it becomes increasingly positive and directive.  (70:11.2)
	second Eden was cradle of civilization for 30,000 years (76:3.8) (78:0.1)
	The influence of Adamic, though in numbers smaller than had been planned, produced an advance in civilization (81:0.2)
	small middle class appeared in Jesus’ time (121:1.8) (121:3.4)
retrogressions en Urantia
	Civilization has not always progressed forward. Throughout history there have been several major setbacks:
	# after Andón's death, more than 900,000 years ago, his civilization was threatened with extinction and his retrogressing descendants did not recover it again for half a million years (63:5.7) (64:1.7) (64:2.4) (64:4.12)
	# after Lucifer rebellion, about 200,000 yeras ago, society quickly sank back to its old biologic level (67:5.3)
	# after death of Onamonalonton, 65,000 years ago, red men continued with internecine wars and never succeed in set a universal peace (64:6.8)
	# From 2500 to 2000 B.C., in Mesopotamia, with emigration of superior Adamite peoples and the immigration of inferiors (78:8.12)
	# many other retrogressions in the long forward struggle of Urantia civilization (68:4.7)
modern civilization
	Society is becoming more mechanical, more compact, more complex, and more critically interdependent. (99:1.4)
	Modern society is enduring the strain of one of its most dangerous phases of far-flung interassociation and highly complicated interdependence. (68:2.5)
	This secularistic human society, notwithstanding its unparalleled materialistic achievement, is slowly disintegrating. (195:8.10)
	scientific secularism, notwithstanding its unparalleled materialistic achievement, is slowly disintegrating society, and the only cohesive force resisting this disintegration is nationalism, but nationalism is the chief barrier to world peace. (195:8.10)
	Society is the offspring of age upon age of trial and error (81:6.41)
	in current civilization lower strata no longer so ignorant or politically helpless (99:1.5)
	Gradually society asserted its rights and, at the present time, they are: (70:9.2-12)
	# Assurance of food supply.
	# Military defence
	# Internal peace preservation
	# Sex control
	# Property
	# Fostering of individual and group competition
	# Provision for educating
	# Promotion of trade and commerce
	# Improvement of labour conditions
	# Freedom of religious practices
future
	The attainment of a high cultural civilization demands, first, the ideal type of citizen and, then, ideal and adequate social mechanisms (99:3.4)
	The progress of civilization is hardly alike on any two planets. Under the benign rule of a Planetary Prince and other leaders an average world will successively pass through the following seven developmental epochs: (50:5-6)
	# The nutrition epoch
	# The security age
	# The material-comfort era
	# The quest for knowledge and wisdom
	# The epoch of philosophy and brotherhood
	# The age of spiritual striving
	# The era of light and life
Status of civilizations
	The status of any civilization may be very accurately determined by the thoroughness and equity of its courts and by the integrity of its judges. (70:11.14)
	The sum of man’s adjustment to the life demands equals his cultural civilization. (68:5.1)
	Civilizations are unstable because they are not cosmic; they are not innate in the individuals of the races. (16:9.4-5) (68:0.2)
	The presence of large numbers of unmarried persons in any society indicates the temporary breakdown or the transition of the mores. (83:7.5)

The clans served a valuable purpose in local self-government, but they greatly delayed the growth of large and strong nations. (70:4.10)
During later times many clans grew out of trades and other industrial associations. (71:1.23)
Many primitive clans were virtually exterminated by the practice of both abortion and infanticide. (68:6.9)
The old idea of friendship meant adoption into the clan (70:3.6)

The lower five or six miles of the earth’s atmosphere is the troposphere; this is the region of winds and air currents which provide weather phenomena. (58:2.6)
changes in climate have caused changes in civilization:

* The Saharans saw their prosperous and peaceful civilization dispersed due to the upthrust of land and the shifting water-laden winds (80:1.4)
* The early expansion of the violet race into Europe was cut short by certain rather sudden climatic and geologic changes. Winds from the west shifted to the north, gradually turning the great open pasture regions of Sahara into a barren desert. (80:2.1)
* 15,000 years ago, Alpine forests were spreading extensively. These great climatic modifications forced the races of Europe that practiced hunting to become herders. (80:3.8)
* By 3000 B.C. increasing aridity was driving Andonites back into Turkestan. (80:9.6)
chief factors causing fluctuations are land elevation, cosmic clouds, and oceans (57:8.22)

	in Jerusem we will learn to co-operate and plan with other and wiser beings helped by Quickeners of Morality seraphim (39:4.10)
	in Edentia we acquire the ability voluntarily and effectively to co-operate with your own order of beings (43:8.4-11)
co-operation and civilization
	In civilization much, very much, depends on an enthusiastic and effective load-pulling spirit. (81:6.34-37)
	Not only are kindred spirits attracted to each other, but kindred minds are also very fraternal and inclined towards co-operation the one with the other. (16:6.3)
	Marriage, the basis of home building, is the highest manifestation of that antagonistic co-operation which so often characterizes the contacts of nature and society. (84:6.2)
	In advanced civilizations co-operation is more efficient than competition. (71:5.3)
	mortals should co-operate with universe managers (65:5.3)
	co-operation is not a natural trait of man (68:1.3-4)
	Someday religionists will get together and actually effect co-operation on the basis of unity of ideals and purposes rather than attempting to do so on the basis of psychological opinions and theological beliefs. (99:5.7)
	teamwork, social co-operation, depends on leadership (81:6.37)

Coal layers often hold both gas and oil. (59:5.16)
The coal layers alternate with shale, stone, and conglomerate. (59:5.15)
In some parts of North America and Europe the coal-bearing strata are 18,000 feet in thickness. (59:5.15)
Coal is the water-preserved and pressure-modified remains of the rank vegetation growing in the bogs and on the swamp shores of this faraway age. (59:5.14-17)

	200 millions years ago the really active stages of the Carboniferous period began. For twenty million years prior to this time the earlier coal deposits were being laid down (59:5.13)

coat | | | | OK
When Jesus instructed his apostles that they should, when one unjustly took away the coat, offer the other garment, he referred not so much to a literal second coat as to the idea of doing something positive to save the wrongdoer in the place of the olden advice to retaliate—“an eye for an eye” and so on.

The domination of the Spirit is never tainted with coercion nor compromised by compulsion. (34:6.11)
The evolution of religious observances progressed from placation, avoidance, exorcism, coercion, conciliation, and propitiation to sacrifice, atonement, and redemption. (90:0.1)
Primitive man believed that something special must be done to win the favor of the gods. The rituals of avoidance, exorcism, coercion, and propitiation all merge into one another. (89:0.2)

Even in modern times superstitious persons make holes in coins. (85:1.4)

cold | | heat; temperature | | OK
The cold and hunger of the open lands stimulate action, invention, and resourcefulness. (64:1.3)
Gravity and absence of heat (cold) organize and hold matter together; heat and antigravity disrupt matter and dissipate energy. Cold merely signifies absence of heat—comparative energy rest—the status of the universal force-charge of space. Gravity presence and action is what prevents the appearance of the theoretical absolute zero, for interstellar space does not have the temperature of absolute zero.  (15:8.10) (42:4.5-9)

The Teacher Sons conduct an agelong course of training, ranging from the planetary courses up to the high College of Wisdom located on Salvington. (20:8.3)

collisions | | | | OK
In those regions of thicker clustering, collisions are not uncommon. When physical systems become stabilized, become physically settled, and are swung into the balanced and established circuits, no more collisions or other devastating catastrophes will occur (15:5.12) (15:8.6)
In the collisional episodes enormous masses of matter are suddenly converted into the rarest form of energy (15:8.6)
Collisions among the giants of space are rare indeed, but gravity-tidal explosions of lesser bodies are quite common. (57:6.4)

coma | | | | OK
The ancients believed that the soul could leave the body in various ways, as in coma (86:5.4-8)
The Jews were in the habit of burying their dead on the day of their demise; this was a necessary practice in such a warm climate. It often happened that they put in the tomb one who was merely comatose, so that on the second or even the third day, such a one would come forth from the tomb (167:4.3)
The daughter of Jairus of Capernaum, who was believed to have resurrected Jesus, was actually in a coma after a prolonged fever (152:1.2)
the son of the widow of Nain was another case of supposed healing of Jesus in which the child was not really dead, but in a coma (146:6.2-3)

Volcanoes, but not mountains, became fetishes; comets, but not stars. (88:1.1)
Many comets are unestablished wild offspring of the solar mother wheels, which are being gradually brought under control of the central governing sun. (15:6.13)
The meteors and other small particles of matter circulating and evolving in space constitute an enormous aggregate of energy and material substance. (15:6.12)
Even some of the comets consist of meteor swarms, but as a rule they are disrupted smaller bodies of matter. (49:3.2)
A comet’s tail points away from the attracting body or sun because of the electrical reaction of its highly expanded gases and because of the actual pressure of light and other energies emanating from the sun. (15:6.13)

	No personal creature can be coerced into the eternal adventure; the portal of eternity opens only in response to the freewill choice of the freewill sons of the God of free will. (5:6.8,12)
Jews
	Shall you love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. (131:2.2)

Jesus
	“You have been taught that you should ‘fear God and keep his commandments, for that is the whole duty of man. ’ But I have come to give you a new and higher commandment.

commerce; trade | | industry | | OK
evolution of commerce
	Man’s first form of trading was woman exchange; it long preceded horse trading. (69:5.10)
	trade by barter followed seizure by raids. (69:4.1)
	Silent barter was first used, securing plazas with fetishes and exchanging grain or animals. Writing had its origin in trade records. (69:4)
	The early traders were women; they were employed as spies, carrying on commerce as a side line. (69:3.11)
	international commerce contributes to peace and brotherhood (52:6.3) (70:3.4) (81:6.19)
	Commerce, linked with adventure, led to exploration and discovery. (69:4.8)
	commerce quickly became the most potent influence in the spread of cultural civilization. (69:4.8) (79:3.8) (81:3)
history
	trade, manufacturing, and banking were taught by Prince’s staff (66:5.11-12)
	commerce appeared ca. 8000 B.C. , when the slowly increasing aridity of the highland regions of central Asia began to drive the Andites to the river bottoms and the seashores. (79:1.3-4)
	The Dravidians of India and Sumerians were among the earliest peoples to engage in an extensive export and import business (79:3.6-7)
	there was great commercial relationships between China and Mesopotamia, but this trading ended on 3,000 B.C. (79:7.6)
	Mediterranean sea-borne commerce was in full swing about 2500 B.C. (80:9.9)
	Some of man’s very early maritime commerce was established on the inland lakes of Mediterranean (80:1.1)
	The Nordics continued the trade in amber from the Baltic coast, building up a great commerce with the broadheads of the Danube valley via the Brenner Pass. (80:9.4)
Jesus and commerce
	Jesus’ advice to rich man on wealth derived from commerce was to apply fairness and honest treatment to deserve wages for his services (132:5.5,17)
	Jesus never meddled with others’ temporal business, but what he never accepted was covetousness (165:4.1,4)

common sense | | | | OK
all Jesus’ plans were characterized by a sanctified common sense (100:7.3)

communication; intercommunication | | broadcasts (celestial); gravity:types:mind gravity; language; writing | | OK
The higher forms of intelligent intercommunication between human beings are greatly helped by the indwelling Adjusters. (109:4.1-3)
Knowledge and wisdom become cumulative because of man’s ability to communicate these possessions to succeeding generations. (81:6.23,25) (160:2.3)
heavenly communication
	Broadcasters, one of superior seraphim, use an ideographic technique able to simultaneously transmit 144,000 messages (39:2.15)
	the chief of Brilliant Evening Stars is ntrusted with custody, dispatch, of all personal messages (39:2.17)
	mind-energy manipulators are the experts of intercommunication between morontia and other types of intelligent beings.  (44:5.3)
	the “harp of God,” a morontia contrivance, allow reception of perfected space communication (47:10.2)
	A local universe is fully provided with adequate means of intercommunication, but personal messengers sometimes required (39:2.17)
	communication is one of the subjects of study in Melchizedek University (35:3.20)
	communication methods in Paradise are utterly beyond the comprehension of human mind: one hour’s instruction on Paradise is the equivalent of ten thousand years of the word-memory methods of Urantia. (27:6.4)
planetary communications
	Urantia is served by twelve technicians of interplanetary and interuniverse communication. (44:5.7)
	the lanes of energy for interplanetary communication are circuits between power centers or physical controllers (29:2.16-17) (44:4.10)
	The physical controllers are occupied in the adjustment of basic energies undiscovered on Urantia, that are very essential to the interplanetary system of transport and to certain techniques of communication. (29:4.14)

communion (mass) | | Remembrance Supper | | OK

communion (spiritual) | | spiritual communion | | OK

communism; Communism | | government; materialism; secularism; socialism | | OK
Modernized co-ordination and fraternal regulation will be productive of longer-lived co-operation than will the older and more primitive methods of communism or dictatorial regulative institutions based on force. (81:6.33)
The present social order is not necessarily right but we must not be persuaded to experiment with the discarded formulas of our forefathers. We must go forward, not backward (69:9.18)
The nations of Urantia have already entered upon the gigantic struggle between nationalistic militarism and industrialism (70:2.11)
primitive communism
	primitive communism was not a mere theory or social doctrine of current communism; prevented pauperism and want (69:9.1)
	Primitive communism put a premium on inactivity and idleness, and it did stifle industry and destroy ambition. Ran counter to strong human proclivities: (69:9.2-6)
	# The family, as erased inheritance
	# Religious tendencies
	# The desire for liberty and leisure
	# The urge for security and power
	Communism was finally destroyed by the deceptive practices of progressive and successful individuals (69:9.6)
weaknesses of communism
	No social system or political regime which denies the reality of God can contribute in any constructive and lasting manner to the advancement of human civilization. (195:10.7)
	any attempt to shift parental responsibility to state or church has proven suicidal to the welfare and advancement of civilization. (84:7.27)
	This was the suicidal weakness of communism: The improvident habitually lived off the thrifty. (69:9.5-6)

comparisons | | | | OK
There is the same relative distance, in comparison with actual size, between the atomic nucleus and the inner electronic circuit as exists between the inner planet, Mercury, and your sun. (42:7.2)
If the mass of an electron were 2.8 grams, the volume of that electron would be as large as that of the Earth. If the volume of a proton were like the head of a pin, the head of a pin would have a diameter equal to that of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. (42:6.8)
stars have just as much comparative elbow room in space as one dozen oranges would have if they were circulating about throughout the interior of Urantia, and were the planet a hollow globe. (41:3.2)
Some of the reddish have acquired a density at their center that one cubic inch of such a star, if on Urantia, would weigh six thousand pounds. (41:3.6)

compass | | direction | | OK
The four points of the compass are universal and inherent in the life of Nebadon. (34:4.13)
the compass needle is responsive to solar influence since it turns slightly to the east as the sun rises and slightly to the west as the sun nears setting. (58:2.9)

compensations; compensation | | | | OK
The Adjuster is our compensatory equalization of the enormous universe tension which is created by the distance of man’s removal from God. (107:0.5)
there are many compensations for rebellions as Lucifer's: one is enhanced careers of those mortal ascenders, the Jerusem citizens, who, by withstanding the sophistries of sin, placed themselves in line for becoming future Mighty Messengers (50:7.1) (54:6.5)
Although the Universal Father is personally present in the residential universe, he does not indwell the minds of the beings originating in that universe (32:3.4)
There are, of course, certain compensations for tribulation, such as Michael’s bestowal on Urantia. (65:5.4)
gains of higher loyalty offset earlier tribulation (35:9.8)
Gods take note of man’s needs at every stage (40:5.11)
It will undoubtedly be the function of the evolutionary citizens of the grand universe to compensate the outer-spacers for this deprivation of the growth of Supremacy. (31:10.14) (117:2.6)
Nevertheless, there is a certain, inevitable penalty attaching to mortal existence on such advanced evolutionary planets. (55:3.11)
In the time-evolving universes of space there is greater divinity attenuation, more difficult problems to be solved, and larger opportunity to acquire experience in their solution. (116:6.7)
Nebadon’s troubles made it an educational clinic for other near-by creations (35:3.22)
isolation of the spheres affords their races a unique opportunity for the exercise of faith and for the development of a peculiar quality of confidence in cosmic reliability (50:7.1)
Ascending mortals, in their long and loving association with the Havona natives, do much to compensate for the spiritual impoverishment of the earlier stages of mortal progression. (19:6.2)
Son and Spirit fusion do, superficially, resemble compensations of unexplained failures in some detail of the Paradise-attainment plan, but is not true. All these happenings unfold in obedience to the established laws (40:10.3-4)
Spirit-fused mortals attain unsurpassed wisdom regarding local universe (37:5.11)
The evolving Supreme will eventually compensate finite creatures for their inability ever to achieve more than limited experience contact with the universe of universes. (117:5.14)
those personalities who are farthest from God, and who can therefore experience the greatest degree of spiritual ascent in the universe (116:4.11)
universe unfailingly applies equalizing techniques designed to insure that no ascender shall be deprived of aught which is essential to his ascension experience. (55:2.12)

competition; competitive spirit; Competition; rivalry  | | capital; private property; profit | | OK
angels make effective use of competitive spirit to promote a wholesome rivalry and inspire a quality of service (28:5.18)
In advanced civilizations co-operation is more efficient than competition. (71:5.3)
Improved tools, ingenious and efficient machines, determine the survival of contending groups in the arena of advancing civilization. (81:6.20)
Competition is healthfully stimulated by diversification of races. (64:6.33)
In the most continental nation of a neighboring planet, there is keen competition, but not only in industry but also in games, skills, science and letters. (72:4.4) (72:5.10)
time and circumstance select the fitter for survival (68:4.7)
in schools of Planetary Princes exists a wholesome rivalry among the races of men to enter them (50:4.9)
benefits and downsides of competition
	Although competition in industry is exceedingly wasteful and highly ineffective, it should not be eliminated if it abrogates the fundamental freedoms of the individual. (71:5.4)
	Competition is essential to social progress, but competition, unregulated, breeds violence. (71:5.1-3)
	Competition-gravity ever pulls man down toward the beast level; poverty is his natural and tyrannical estate. (69:2.2)
	Ruthless competition based on narrow-minded self-interest is ultimately destructive of even those things which it seeks to maintain. (71:6.1)

complaining; complain; complaints; complaint; bemoan | | | | OK
we must learn to accept challenges without complaint and to face difficulties and uncertainties without fear (48:6.35)
man should not bemoan his lowly origin when Creator Sons pass through same experience to be considered worthy and competent to rule over their universe (21:4.6)
Man should not blame God for those afflictions which are the natural result of the life which he chooses to live; neither should man complain of those experiences which are a part of life as it is lived on this world. (148:5.3)
Prayer has turned many an irritable and complaining invalid into a paragon of patience and made him an inspiration to all other human sufferers. (91:6.2)
Jesus and complaints
	Never, since the marvellous bestowal of Jesus as the Planetary Prince of a world in isolation and rebellion, have any of the Material Sons or Daughters in Nebadon been tempted to complain of their assignments or to find fault with the difficulties of their planetary missions. (119:3.7)
	elders of Nazareth complained about Jesus to Joseph and Mary after he draw a picture of the teacher (124:1.4)
	Judas did not think Nathaniel took his apostleship sufficiently seriously and once had the temerity to go secretly to Jesus and lodge complaint against him. (139:6.5)
	In Jesus' parable the workers in the vineyard complained that they were not paid more than those who had been hired last. (163:3.6)
	When thinking men and women look upon Jesus as he offers up his life on the cross, they will hardly again permit themselves to complain at even the severest hardships of life, much less at petty harassments and their many purely fictitious grievances. (188:5.10)
	Jesus said: To suffer evil without complaint and without resistance, the purely negative method, is not enough. We have to return good for evil (159:5.13-14)

complement of being; complements of being | | | | OK
the complemnt of being is an angel of opposite type that is associated to each angel (38:4.3)
sanobim is the complement of being to cherubim. They can work alone but usually do their tasks in pairs. (38:7.2)
When a seraphic pair accept guardian assignment, they serve for the remainder of the life of that human being. The complement of being, one of the two angels, becomes the recorder of the undertaking. (113:2.9)

complemental relationships; complemental; cosmic complement; Complemental relationships | | | | OK
Creator Sons and local universe Mother Spirits work in a complemental way in universe creation and administration (17:6.4)
The experiential nature of the evolutionary type of personality is the natural cosmic complement of the ever-perfect natures of the Paradise-Havona creatures. (32:3.12)
Complemental relationships of angles may be transient; they are not necessarily of a permanent nature. Seraphim can work singly as discrete and localized personalities, but they are able to encircuit only when polarized as liaison pairs. (26:1.16)

complements of rest; complement of rest | | | ORDER | OK
the majestic Complements of Rest enter attainment rest with ascending pilgrims (26:11.7)
The superaphic complements of rest are not so much concerned with training as with promoting understanding association with diverse groups in Havona. (26:11.1-3)

completion seraphim | (39:9) | Corps of Seraphic Completion; seraphim | | OK
To climb to the supernal heights of finaliter sonship with God is a masterly achievement for an angel, an accomplishment far transcending your attainment of eternal survival (40:1.2)
After attainment of the Father of spirits and admission to the seraphic service of completion, angels are sometimes assigned to the ministry of worlds settled in light and life. Large numbers of the completion seraphim return to their native universes, there to complement the ministry of divine endowment by the ministry of experiential perfection. (39:9.1-2)
Many fascinating avenues of ministry are open to the completion seraphim, but just as they all craved assignment as destiny guardians in the pre-Paradise days, so in the post-Paradise experience they most desire to serve as bestowal attendants of the incarnated Paradise Sons. (39:9.3)
often direct seraphic organizations (39:2.1,5)

man must become adept in the art of a continuous human temporal compromise while he yields spiritual allegiance to but one master (109:5.4)
the survival character of a soul is not fostered by attempting to secure peace of mind at any price, by the surrender of noble aspirations, and by the compromise of spiritual ideals (133:7.12)
Jesus
	Jesus conformed to parents’ wishes even if he disagreed with them (123:3.6) (123:4.3) (124:1.4-5,13) (124:4.9) (125:6.11-12)
	he decided against employing compromise in the furtherance of his mission on earth (136:8.4)
	Jesus only partially met the expectations placed on him, something he chose to do when he saw that he would never be fully accepted in his role as the Son of Man. (157:5.2) (157:6.6) (158:2.4)
	Jesus conformed to the preferred terms of the Jews for obtaining a revelation: doing a mighty work (167:4.5)
	he never shirked the responsibility of making the necessary daily adjustments between these realms of loyalty to one’s personal convictions and duty toward one’s family (124:4.9) (124:6.18) (125:6.12) (127:6.12)
	Jesus of Nazareth refused to compromise with evil, much less to consort with sin. (134:8.8) (136:8.8)
the disciples
	The apostles of Jesus and the disciples of John learned to compromise in socialization of religion (144:6.11)
	Having taken the first step along the path of compromise and least resistance, there was nothing apparent to Peter but to go on with the course of conduct decided upon. (184:2.12)

compulsion; coerce; employ force; repression; by force | | might; pressure | | OK
the purpose of the true believer is always to act but never to coerce. (94:6.6)
The chief factor in early civilization was the force exerted by wise social masters (81:6.14)
The domination of the Spirit is never tainted with coercion nor compromised by compulsion. (34:6.11)
Never should a righteous cause be promoted by force; spiritual victories can be won only by spiritual power. (16:7.8) (152:6.3) (159:3.2) (178:1.2-3,6,12)
Gradually the pleasure-seeking weaklings are subjugated by the more strong and truth-loving elements of the advancing civilization. (50:5.6)
Jesus
	Jesus did not look with approval upon the refusal to employ force to protect the majority of any given human group against the unfair and enslaving practices of unjust minorities who may be able to entrench themselves behind political, financial, or ecclesiastical power. (173:1.11)
	Jesus expressed the opinion that organized society had every right to employ force in the execution of its just mandates. (71:4.7-8) (72:6.4,6) (133:1.5) (133:4.12) (140:8.4) (178:1.2)
	The tree which bears no fruit is “hewn down and cast into the fire. ” Moral worth cannot be derived from mere repression —obeying the injunction “Thou shalt not. ” (140:4.7)

concentration; concentrate  | | | | OK
Jesus teach: The heathen are not without excuse when they rage at us. Because their outlook is small and narrow, they are able to concentrate their energies enthusiastically.  (155:1.3)
Jesus possessed the ability effectively to mobilize all his powers of mind, soul, and body on the task immediately in hand. He could concentrate his deep-thinking mind on the one problem which he wished to solve, and this, in connection with his untiring patience, enabled him serenely to endure the trials (127:3.15)

concentric circles, three; three azure blue concentric circles; three circles | | | | OK
the banner of Michael, the material emblem of the Trinity government of all creation, is the three azure blue concentric circles on a white background. (53:5.4) (93:2.5)
the three circles are emblematic of the infinity, eternity, and universality of the Paradise Trinity (93:3.3)
Melchizedek wore it on his chest as an emblem (93:2.5) (104:1.3)
the triads that grew up in many religions all were reminiscent of the trinity teachings of the Andites and the Sumerians and based on the belief of the Salemites in Melchizedek’s insignia of the three circles. (95:1.4)

Concept recorders | | | | OK
Concept recorders are part of Celestial Artisans and are concerned with the preservation of concept pictures, idea patterns. (44:4.5)

concepts; conceptions  | | doctrines; ideas; theories | | OK
Beyond the Supreme, concepts are increasingly names; less and less are they true designations of reality; more and more do they become the creature’s projection of finite understanding toward the superfinite. (115:3.4)
If mind cannot fathom conclusions, if it cannot penetrate to true origins, then will such mind unfailingly postulate conclusions and invent origins that it may have a means of logical thought within the frame of these mind-created postulates. But concepts are only relatively true. God is much, much more (115:1.1-2)
All static, dead, concepts are potentially evil. The finite shadow of relative and living truth is continually moving. Static concepts invariably retard science, politics, society, and religion. (130:4.15)
when truth becomes linked with fact, then both time and space condition its meanings and correlate its values. Such realities of truth wedded to fact become concepts and are accordingly relegated to the domain of relative cosmic realities. (118:3.3)
Mind is unifying of all divergencies, but in the very absence of such divergencies, mind finds no basis upon which to attempt to formulate understanding concepts. (115:3.2)
Urantia Book limitations
	Urantia Papers are guided by the mandate of the superuniverse rulers that give preference to highest existing human concepts pertaining to the subjects to be presented (0:12.11)

conciliating commissions; conciliating commission; commissioners | (25:2-3) | Universal Conciliators | | OK
conciliating commissions are the traveling courts for minor misunderstanding (37:8.6) (39:4.5)
Conciliators do not pass upon matters of eternal import; the soul, the eternal prospects of a creature of time, is never placed in jeopardy by their acts. (25:2.12)
If the contention is honest, if the difficulties arise out of sincere differences of opinion and honest diversity of viewpoints, no matter how few persons may be involved, no matter how apparently trivial the misunderstanding, a conciliating commission can always be had to pass upon the merits of the controversy. (25:3.8)
The members of a conciliating commission are eternally associated as the embodiment of the supreme justice of time and space. (25:3.17)
conciliating commissions are “fourth creatures” and discern spirit and matter (38:7.6) (44:0.17)
they function upon petition of opposing parties (25:3.3)
commissioners, from stage to stage they are evolving from arbiters of differences to explainers of mysteries—judges evolving into interpretative teachers. (25:3.12)
Conciliators maintain group headquarters on the capital of their superuniverse, as well as each mansion world (25:3.1) (47:0.4)
justice guides commonly appear before conciliating commisions (39:4.5)
In each superuniverse the Universal Conciliators find themselves strangely and innately segregated into groups of four, associations in which they continue to serve. (25:2.5-9)
The conciliators are of great value in keeping the universe of universes running smoothly. (25:2.11)
The conciliators traverse space at the seraphic rate of triple velocity (23:3.2) (25:2.11)
a conciliating commission and is made up as follows: Judge-Arbiter, Spirit-advocate, Divine Executioner and Recorder (25:2.5-9)
The members of a conciliating commission are never separated. (25:3.17)
there is absolutely no limit to their authority to call witnesses from anywhere and everywhere (25:3.4)
the exact number operating in Nebadon is not of record, but is estimated in the neighborhood of 100 million conciliating commissions. The last report of registry on Uversa gives the number operating in Orvonton as almost 18 trillion commissions — over 70 trillion individuals (25:3.15) (37:8.6)
The actual administration of Urantia is indeed difficult to describe. there are no absolutely authoritative judicial powers operative on the planet—only the conciliating commissions. (114:5.1-2)
decisions
	a commission has once accepted jurisdiction of a problem, its rulings are final and always unanimous; there is no appeal from the decision of the judge-arbiter. (25:2.12) (25:3.4)
	no arbitrary execution is ever carried out without the consent of the Constellation Father, for the “Most Highs rule in the kingdoms of men.” (50:2.6)
	The commissioners’ decisions are placed on the planetary records and, if necessary, are put into effect by the divine executioner. (25:3.5)
	the Master Physical Controllers are provisionally subject to the orders of the divine executioners of the conciliating commissions but are otherwise solely amenable to their associate directors and to the Supreme Power Centers. (29:4.15)
	conciliators will not formulate a decision until all the evidence has been heard (25:3.4)

conciliation (ceremony) | | | | OK
conciliation ceremony had a place in evolution of religious observances (90:0.1)
As religion evolved, the sacrificial rites of conciliation and propitiation replaced the older methods of avoidance, placation, and exorcism. (89:4.4)

Conciliators, Universal | | Universal Conciliators | ORDER | OK

conclaves; conclave | | | | OK
Not long since a conclave extraordinary was held in Paradise of 150,000 Creator Sons belonging to Sovereign Michaels group, assembled in the parental presence and engaged in deliberations having to do with the progress of the unification and stabilization of the universe of universes (21:0.5)
From time to time, great conclaves take place on these Paradise satellites of the Spirit. (17:1.9)
The Eternals of Days are visible to all will creatures dwelling in Havona. They preside over the regular planetary conclaves. (18:2.2)
Every millennium of sector standard time the various orders of the divine Sons forgather for their periodic conclaves. (7:6.1)
As chief executive of Nebadon, Gabriel is ex officio chairman of, or observer at, most of the Salvington conclaves, and as many as one thousand of these are often in session simultaneously. (37:2.2)

concubinage; Concubinage | | adultery | | OK
Concubinage was the steppingstone to monogamy, the first move away from frank polygyny. The concubines of the Jews, Romans, and Chinese were very frequently the handmaidens of the wife. (83:5.12)

condemnation | | blame | | OK

conduct | | action | | OK

conductors of worship; Conductors of Worship | (27:7) | | ORDER | OK
It is the task of the conductors of worship so to teach the ascendant creatures how to worship (27:7.4)
Conductors of Worship are the first order inside primary Supernaphim (27:0.4)
Never since the times of Grandfanda have the supernaphim been able fully to accommodate the spirit of worship on Paradise. Always is there an excess of worshipfulness (27:7.6-7)

confession; confess; Confession | | amends; forgiveness; repentance; sin | | OK
The confession of sin is a manful repudiation of disloyalty, but it in no wise mitigates the time-space consequences of such disloyalty. But confession—sincere recognition of the nature of sin—is essential to religious growth and spiritual progress. (89:10.5)
When we find ourselves in the wrong, we should not hesitate to confess our error and be quick to make amends. (131:9.3)
Confession, repentance, and prayer have led individuals, cities, nations, and whole races to mighty efforts of reform and courageous deeds of valorous achievement. (91:5.2)
we should leave no fault unconfessed (131:3.3)
Said Jesus: “If you confess your sins, they are forgiven; therefore must you maintain a conscience void of offense”. (131:5.5) (156:2.7)
ancient ritual
	The idea of confession and forgiveness early appeared in primitive religion.  Confession was merely a rite of remission, also a public notification of defilement, a ritual of crying “unclean, unclean!” (89:2.5)
	In the times of Melchisedek they have the idea that if any said ‘I have sinned and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not,’ God would deliver his soul from going into the pit, and he would see the light. (96:7.7) (130:8.2)
	Devotion, to Pharisees, was a means of inducing self-righteous inactivity and the assurance of false spiritual security; devotion should be a means of stirring up the soul to the realization of the need for repentance, confession, and the acceptance, by faith, of merciful forgiveness. (167:5.2)

confidence | | self-confidence | | OK

confiding | | sharing | | OK

conflict; conflicts | | anxiety; confusion; contention; difficulties; fighting | | OK
All forms of soul conflict consist in the lack of harmony between the moral, or spiritual, self-consciousness and the purely intellectual self-consciousness. (133:6.6)
The flight from duty is the sacrifice of truth. The escape from the service of light and life can only result in those distressing conflicts (130:1.2)
All believers will have to pass through a fringe of conflict as they pass from the life lived in the flesh to the higher life lived in the spirit. (159:3.7)
Misadaptation, disharmony, and conflict, all these things are inherent in evolutionary growth, from physical universes to personal creatures. (105:6.4)
All conflict is evil in that it inhibits the creative function of the inner life—it is a species of civil war in the personality. (111:4.11)
New religious insights arise out of conflicts which initiate the choosing of new and better reaction habits in the place of older and inferior reaction patterns. (100:4.1)
conflicts occur when men dare to forsake a life of natural craving for one of adventurous art and uncertain logic (160:1.6)
New meanings only emerge amid conflict; and conflict persists only in the face of refusal to espouse the higher values connoted in superior meanings. (100:4.1)
For Jesus prayer a prevention of conflict (100:6.4) (196:0.10)
Unresolved conflicts destroy unity and may terminate in mind disruption. (133:7.12)

Confucianism | (92:6.6) | Confucius | RELIGION | OK
The Confucian preachment of morality, as in Plato, was predicated on the theory that the earthly way is the distorted shadow of the heavenly way; that the true pattern of temporal civilization is the mirror reflection of the eternal order of heaven. (94:6.10)
Ganid elaborated with Jesus a summary on Confucianism when they were in Alexandria (131:9)
Confucian precepts, while perpetuating the best of the past, were somewhat inimical to the very Chinese spirit of investigation that had produced those achievements which were so venerated. (94:6.11)
The Zoroastrians had a religion of morals; the Hindus a religion of metaphysics; the Confucianists a religion of ethics. (5:4.7)

Confucius; Confucian | (94:6.9-11) | Confucianism | PERSON | OK
Confucius (Kung Fu-tze) was a younger contemporary of Lao in sixth-century China. His chief work consisted in the compilation of the wise sayings of ancient philosophers. He was a rejected teacher during his lifetime, but his writings and teachings have ever since exerted a great influence in China and Japan. (94:6.9)
he was deified by followers in those spiritually dark ages of China which intervened between the decline and perversion of the Taoist faith (94:6.12)
he had a God concept that was almost completely subordinated to the emphasis placed upon the Way of Heaven, the pattern of the cosmos. (94:6.10)
he made a new fetish out of order and established a respect for ancestral conduct that is still venerated by the Chinese at the time of this writing. (94:6.9)
strictly speaking he was not a religious teacher (92:5.12)
Confucius set a new pace for the shamans in that he put morality in the place of magic. (94:6.9)
the writings of Confucius have ever since constituted the basis of the moral fabric of the culture of almost a third of Urantians. (94:6.11)

confusion; Confusion; confused | | anxiety; conflict; misadaptation | | OK
Confusion, being puzzled, even sometimes discouraged and distracted, does not necessarily signify resistance to the leadings of the indwelling Adjuster. Ignorance alone can never prevent survival; neither can confusional doubts nor fearful uncertainty. (110:3.5)
Confusion goes before growth as well as before destruction. (99:6.1)
Many a new religion and strange “ism” has arisen from the aborted, imperfect, misunderstood, and garbled communications of the Thought Adjusters. (110:4.5)
Jesus permitted confusion to pass most intense point to show that holding opinions too earnestly interfere our ability to fully grasp the great truth (151:2.5)
John the Baptist still had confused ideas about the coming kingdom and its king. The longer he preached the more confused he became. Sometimes he questioned everything, but not for long. (135:7.1)
present-day mortals would experience less of this apparent warfare between the flesh and the spirit if they would enter the spirit kingdom (34:7.6)
Much, very much, of the difficulty which Urantia mortals have in understanding God is due to the far-reaching consequences of the Lucifer rebellion and the Caligastia betrayal. On worlds not segregated by sin they suffer less from confusion (4:3.3)
Much that seems disjointed and haphazard to the mortal mind appears orderly and constructive to my understanding. (4:1.5,7)
In Paradise the directors of conduct always teach to avoid confusion. Confusion never appears in Paradise (27:4.3)
Religious perplexities are inevitable; there can be no growth without psychic conflict and spiritual agitation. (100:4.2)
we must not be troubled with doubts of failure or perplexing confusion for in every dark hours, at all crossroad in the forward struggle, the Spirit of Truth will always show the way. (34:7.8)

conglomerates; conglomerate | | | | OK
Conglomerates are matter deposited near the shore lines.
The coal layers alternate with shale, stone, and conglomerate. (59:5.15)
Much of the older sandstone and conglomerates represents the sedimentary accumulations of ancient shores. (58:7.9) (59:1.10) (60:1.1)

conifers | (60:2.7) | | | OK

conjectures | | speculations | | OK

Conjoint Actor | | Infinite Spirit | PERSON | OK

Conjoint Creator | | Infinite Spirit | PERSON | OK

conjurers | | | | OK
practitioners of black arts were called conjurers (90:2.2)

Connecticut; eastern-Connecticut | (60:1.7) | | PLACE | OK

conquest | | military; victory; war | | OK

conscience | | morality | | OK
We should not confuse and confound the mission and influence of the Adjuster with what is commonly called conscience. Conscience, rightly, admonishes you to do right; but the Adjuster, in addition, endeavors to tell you what truly is right; that is, when and as you are able to perceive the Monitor’s leading. (110:5.1)
it is hazardous to attempt the differentiation of the Adjusters’ concept registry from the more or less continuous and conscious reception of the dictations of mortal conscience. (110:5.5)
Growth is predicated on the discovery of selfhood accompanied by self-criticism—conscience, for conscience is really the criticism of oneself by one’s own value-habits, personal ideals. (92:2.6) (100:1.5)
Conscience is a human and purely psychic reaction. It is not to be despised, but it is hardly the voice of God to the soul, which indeed the Adjuster’s would be if such a voice could be heard. (92:2.6) (110:5.1,5)
If we confess your sins, they are forgiven; therefore we must maintain a conscience void of offense. (156:2.7)
A misguided conscience can become responsible for much conflict, worry, sorrow, and no end of human unhappiness. (103:2.10)
Jesus knew how human beings are swayed by the preacher’s eloquence, and how the conscience responds to emotional appeal (154:6.8)
Salem teachers proclaimed conscience as the mandate of God, the voice of Deity. (95:3.5)

consciousness; self-consciousness; Self-consciousness; social consciousness | (16:9) | mind; mortal mind | | OK
Consciousness, much less self-consciousness, cannot be explained by any theory of mechanistic electronic association or materialistic energy phenomena. (112:2.10)
Self-consciousness consists in intellectual awareness of personality actuality; it includes the ability to recognize the reality of other personalities. Connotes recognition of the actuality of mind ministration and the realization of relative independence of creative and determinative free will. (16:8.6) (16:9.4)
One is free to choose and act only within the realm of one’s consciousness. (34:3.8)
Self-consciousness is in essence a communal consciousness: God and man, Father and son, Creator and creature. In human self-consciousness four universe-reality realizations are latent and inherent: (16:6.9) (16:9.1,9-13)
# The quest for knowledge
# The quest for moral values
# The quest for spiritual values
# The quest for personality values, the ability to recognize the reality of God as a personality
the endowment of mind even in impersonal beings qualifies them to think and endows them with consciousness despite the total absence of personality. (9:6.3)
The evolutionary type of knowledge is but the accumulation of protoplasmic memory material; this is the most primitive form of creature consciousness. (101:6.4)
Mind is not inherent in energy; energy is receptive and responsive to mind; mind can be superimposed upon energy, but consciousness is not inherent in the purely material level. (9:4.2)
Mortal consciousness proceeds from the fact, to the meaning, and then to the value. (118:5.3)
In the mortal experience the human intellect resides in the rhythmic pulsations of the adjutant mind-spirits and effects its decisions within the arena produced by encircuitment within this ministry. (102:2.5) (117:5.7)
Human consciousness rests gently upon the electrochemical mechanism below and delicately touches the spirit-morontia energy system above. (111:1.5)
And even as he is this living way of ascension from the self to God, so is the Supreme the living way from finite consciousness to transcendence of consciousness, even to the insight of absonity. (117:3.3)
we should trust all matters of mind beyond the dead level of consciousness to the custody of the Adjusters. (110:4.4)
self-consciousness
	there is a vast body of essential spiritual knowledge, truth indispensable to high spiritual attainment, which cannot be consciously received; self-consciousness would effectively jeopardize the certainty of reception (19:5.9)
	Man’s own personality awareness, self-consciousness, is also directly dependent on this very fact of innate other-awareness (16:9.7)
	Self-consciousness, in and of itself, is not the soul. (133:6.5)

conscription | | military | | OK
the question of conscription or voluntary military service does not enter into the problems of maintaining world-wide peace. (134:5.6)
in the most continental nation of a neighboring planet, military service in peacetime is purely voluntary (72:11.3)

consecration of choice; consecration | (111:5) | decisions; faith; goals; spiritual rebirth; submission | | OK
When man chooses to find God and to be like him, such a choice is superfinite (118:6.7)
To God, as absolute, an ascending mortal who has made the eternal decision is already a Paradise finaliter. (118:1.10)
creativity of inner life can be haphazard or constructive (111:4.9)
Father desires only loyalty which is voluntary, wholehearted, and sophistry-proof (53:4.6)
The affectionate dedication of the human will to the doing of the Father’s will is man’s choicest gift to God; in fact, such a consecration of creature will constitutes man’s only possible gift of true value to the Paradise Father. (1:1.2) (196:0.10)
Jesus’ faith was so real and all-encompassing that it absolutely swept away any spiritual doubts and effectively destroyed every conflicting desire. (196:0.5)
Material mind is the arena in which human personalities live, are self-conscious, make decisions, choose God or forsake him, eternalize or destroy themselves. (111:1)
The first jubilee of mortal human marked the agreement with the Thought Adjuster when the purpose to survive was sealed (27:7.8)
You are so devoid of courageous decisions and consecrated co-operation that your indwelling Adjusters find it next to impossible to communicate directly with the human mind. (110:4.5)
such a will-union is effected by and through Jesus. (180:2.4)
a Hebrew proverb says: “Whatsoever your hand finds to do, do that with all your might”. (133:8.3)
definition
	The consecration of election has been defined as:
	* the affirmation of desire to do Father’s will (111:5.6)
	* the degree of devotion to divine values (92:7.9)
	* the identification of self with universe, the dedication to service of universe family (5:4.3)
	The highest moral choice is the choice of the highest possible value, and always—in any sphere, in all of them—this is to choose to do the will of God. (39:4.14)
	man does not passively, slavishly, surrender his will to the Adjuster. Rather does he actively, positively, and co-operatively (111:1.8)
	Such a creature choice is not a surrender of will. It is a consecration of will, an expansion of will, a glorification of will, a perfecting of will (111:5.5-6)
	Such decisive consecration constitutes the true passport from the limitations of human nature to the finality of divine attainment. (109:6.5)
	Such a consecration of will is tantamount to the realization of eternity-reality of purpose; stated otherwise, that the succession of moments will witness no change in creature purpose. (118:1.2)
	the divine Spirit must dominate and control every phase of human experience. (34:6.7)
	Although man is a mechanism, is much more than a machine. He can increasingly learn how to subordinate this physical-life machine to the directive wisdom of experience by the process of consecrating the human mind to the execution of the spiritual urges (118:8.2)
examples of consecration
	Andon and Fonta’s decision to live together and for each other (62:5.8-9)
	Throughout the seven crucial years of the Caligastia rebellion, Van was wholly devoted to the work of ministry to his loyal army of men, midwayers, and angels. (67:3.6)
	The Adjuster empowered Amadon’s loyalty, the modified human associate of Van. (67:3.7)
	John Mark commanded full attention of God, of Jesus, by his supreme desire, and was alone with him a full day (177:1.3) (177:3.2)
	the widow who gave a few mites in front of Jesus and the apostles had given not some triffle as a gift, but everything she had, including her livelihood (172:4.2)
parables regarding consecration
	* the pearl of great price: the cost of remaining in the progressive ascent of the kingdom is the pearl of great price, in order to possess which a man sells all that he has. (140:8.28) (151:4.5)
	* the treasure in field: In his joy the man went forth to sell all he had that he might have the money to buy the field. (151:4.4)
result of consecration
	consecration inmediately brought Adjuster prior to Spirit of Truth era (108:2.8)
	consecration determines the presence of God (5:2.1) (13:4.4-5)
	spirit alliance liberates choice from the physical level and at the same time assures the divine stability produced by augmented universe insight and increased cosmic comprehension. (118:8.3)
	Man attains divine union by progressive reciprocal spiritual communion, by personality intercourse with the personal God, by increasingly attaining the divine nature through wholehearted and intelligent conformity to the divine will. (1:7.2)
	the Paradise Father is likewise the destiny of all those finite personalities who wholeheartedly choose to do the divine will, those who love God and long to be like him. (5:6.1)
	all of man’s personality endowments must be wholly consecrated to the effort; halfhearted, partial devotion will be unavailing. (1:6.5)
	The act of the creature’s choosing to do the will of the Creator is immediately reacted by the Supreme (117:6.4)
	choosing to do the will of God joins spiritual faith to material decisions in personality action and thus supplies a divine and spiritual fulcrum (110:6.17)
	consecration leads to assignment of a guardian of destiny (113:1.5) (113:2.1)
	produces consciousness of God; ensures survival (5:1.6)
	When man consecrates his will to the doing of the Father’s will, when man gives God all that he has, then does God make that man more than he is. (117:4.14)

consequences | | | | OK
consequences of our actions belong to God (48:7.13) (95:4.3) (117:5.5-6)

Constellation Centers | | Supreme Power Centers | ORDER | OK
there are ten Constellation Centers assigned to each constellation (29:2.17) (41:1.4) (43:8.1)
From these beings there go forth the power lines for communication and transport and for the energizing of those living creatures who are dependent upon certain forms of physical energy for the maintenance of life. (29:2.17)
they appear in Uversa personality register (30:2.97)

Constellation Father of Norlatiadek | | Most Highs of Norlatiadek | PERSON | OK

Constellation Fathers; Constellation Father | | Most Highs | ORDER | OK
Of the three Most Highs who govern the constellations, the Most High reigning at each moment is called the Constellation Father. (35:6.1)

constellations; constellation | (43) | Edentia; Norlatiadek | PLACE | OK
The constellations are the primary and autonomous units of a local universe, each constellation being administered according to its own legislative enactments. (43:0.1) (43:2.1)
consist of 100 local systems presided over by 3 Vorondadek Sons, the Most Highs (15:2.4) (32:0.1)
they contain 100,000 inhabitable worlds (15:2.5,20)
the name of our constellation is Norlatiadek, the number 70 in Nebadon, our local universe (15:14.6) (43:0.1)
the spheres of each headquarters are comparable to Edentia, the capital of Norlatiadek. Edentia is a sphere one hundred times the size of Urantia, it is surrounded by 70 satellites ten times the size of Urantia, and each of the satellites is surrounded by ten sub-satellites the size of Urantia (43:0.2)
The morontia spheres are the transition phases of mortal ascension through the progression worlds of the local universe. All 56 of the system transition abodes, in common with the higher spheres around the constellations and the universe headquarters, are called morontia worlds. (48:1.2)
Nebadon time, broadcast from Salvington, is the standard for all constellations and systems in this local universe. (33:6.8) (43:0.3)
government
	In turn, the constellation rulers pay especial attention to the social and governmental conditions prevailing on the different planets and systems. (33:6.3)
	there is an analogous council of seventy at the constellation headquarters also selected from the evolutionary beings of the realms. (50:2.2)
	Each constellation also has a Faithful of Days in observation, an ambassador of the Paradise Trinity. (15:2.4)
prominent inhabitants
	there are ten Constellation Centers assigned to each constellation (29:2.17) (41:1.4)
	there are ten mechanical controllers and ten frandalanks stationed on capitals of each constellation (41:1.4)
	ascenders have 71 different morontia bodies in course of his ascension in the constellation (48:1.5)
	constellations are the chief realm of activity for celestial artisans (43:7.4) (44:0.1)
	Similar probation nurseries are maintained on the finaliter spheres of the constellation and the universe headquarters for the Adjusterless children of the primary and secondary modified orders of ascenders. (49:6.14)
	supervisor seraphim, univitatia, spironga, and spornagia are assigned to service in constellations (43:0.4)
	The translated souls of the flowering ages of the settled spheres do not pass through the mansion worlds. Neither do they sojourn, as students, on the morontia worlds of the system or constellation. (55:2.9-10)
	From service in the systems the conciliators are promoted to Constellation Conciliators, to the adjudication of the problems of a constellation (25:3.8)
functions
	While the supreme judicial function rests with the central administration of a local universe, there are two subsidiary but major tribunals at the headquarters of each constellation, the Melchizedek council and the court of the Most High. (43:2.3-4)
	The legislative assemblies of the local universe are located on the headquarters of the one hundred constellations. (33:8.1) (39:3.3) (43:2.2-8) (53:4.2)
	The advisory or highest body of constellation legislators consists of the house of peers—the house of the divine Sons. (43:2.7)
	The legislative program of a constellation originates in the lower house of ascenders, a group presided over by a finaliter and consisting of one thousand representative mortals. (43:2.5)
	The mid-chamber of legislators is composed of the seraphic hosts and their associates, other children of the local universe Mother Spirit. This group numbers one hundred (43:2.6)
	Every one hundred years of universe time each system selects its ten representatives to sit in the constellation legislature.  (45:3.22) (45:7.4)
	When a constellation is thus settled in light, the legislative function ceases, and the house of System Sovereigns, presided over by the Most Highs, functions instead. By the attainment of the sixth stage of stabilization these unified constellations will have reached the position of well-nigh complete autonomy. (55:9)

contempt | | | | OK
Adam and Eve were absolved from charges of standing in “contempt of the universe government”. (75:7.2)
Outmarriage finally dominated because it was favored by the man; to get a wife from the outside insured greater freedom from in-laws. Familiarity breeds contempt (82:5.6)
In the universe of Nebadon there are ten thousand systems of inhabited worlds. In all the history of Lanonandek Sons, in all their work throughout these thousands of systems and at the universe headquarters, only three System Sovereigns have ever been found in contempt of the government of the Creator Son. (53:0.2)
Van formally drew his indictment of Daligastia, Caligastia, and Lucifer as standing in contempt of the sovereignty of the universe of Nebadon; and he appealed to the Most Highs of Edentia for support and confirmation. (67:2.2)

Jesus and the apostles
	Jesus avoided controversies with apostles excepting those involving wrong concepts of his Father in heaven (138:6.4)

continental nation | (72) | neighboring planet | | OK
Extensive information is given in The Urantia Book about a neighboring planet of Urantia, not named, and located in the Satania system. The planet is also in quarantine and has many similarities to Urantia. Of this planet we are told above all of the most developed nation, a continental nation. (72:0.1-2)
This nation numbers about 140 million. Its people are a mixed race, predominantly blue and yellow, having a slightly greater proportion of violet than the so-called white race of Urantia. (72:1.1)
enjoys a unique topography and is aproximatedly the size of Australia (72:1.1-2)
This continental nation now has a representative government with a centrally located national capital. The central government consists of a strong federation of 100 comparatively free states. (72:2)

Just now this superior government is planning to establish ambassadorial relations with the inferior peoples (72:12.2)
This nation is adjudicated by two major court systems—the law courts and the socioeconomic courts. (72:2.9-17) (72:5.4) (72:8.3)
The methods of this people in dealing with crime, insanity, and degeneracy, while in some ways pleasing, will, no doubt, in others prove shocking to most Urantians. (72:10)
The educational system of this nation is compulsory and coeducational in the precollege schools that the student attends from the ages of 5 to 18. Estas escuelas son muy diferentes a las de Urantia. No hay aulas, se estudia una sola materia a la vez, y después de los tres primeros años, todos los alumnos se convierten en profesores auxiliares (72:4.1)
Spiritual teachers are under the direction of the Foundation of Spiritual Progress and monitor whether parents educate their children properly. (72:3.6)
The home life of this people has greatly improved during the last century. Attendance of parents, both fathers and mothers, at the parental schools of child culture is compulsory.(72:3)
The industrial situation among this people is far from their ideals; capital and labor still have their troubles. The abolition of slavery happened over one hundred years ago (72:5)
They enjoy a brisk domestic commerce but have little foreign trade owing to the universal hostility of their less progressive neighbors. (72:1.3)
Funds for old-age pensions come from taxes, bequests, compulsory labor wages, and natural resource revenues (72:6)
statesmanship schools are of three classes: national, regional, and state, and prepare for the public offices (72:8.2)
Military training is never given without a associated industrial, scientific, or professional schooling. In this way the creation of a professional military class is avoided. (72:7.9,14) (72:11)
There are five different types of metropolitan government, depending on the size of the city, but no city is permitted to have more than one million inhabitants. (72:2.2)
Cities have no taxing power, neither can they go in debt. There is little or no uniformity among the taxation schemes of the one hundred comparatively free and sovereign states as economic and other conditions vary greatly in different sections of the continent. (72:7)
they has benefited by neither magisterial nor bestowal missions of the Paradise Sons (72:12.2-5)

On going to a young world, a Planetary Prince usually takes with him a group of volunteer ascending beings from the local system headquarters.  This corps of material helpers constitutes the connecting link between the prince and the world races, called the corps of one hundred or staff of the Prince (50:3.1)
The Life Carriers provided such volunteers with new physical bodies, which they occupied for the periods of their planetary sojourn. (50:3.3)
The one hundred, while exempt from the ordinary diseases, are, like the early morontia bodies, subject to certain accidents. (50:3.3)
their immortality was sustained by tree of life (73:6.4)
origin
	Such volunteer assistants are citizens of a system capital, and none of them have fused with their indwelling Adjusters. (50:3.2)
	This group, while enjoying provisional citizenship on Jerusem, were as yet unfused with their Thought Adjusters; and when they volunteered and were accepted for planetary service in liaison with the descending orders of sonship, their Adjusters were detached. (50:3.2,6) (66:4.9) (67:4.5)
descendants
	These assistants to the Planetary Prince seldom mate with the world races, but they do always mate among themselves. (50:3.4-5)
	Two classes of beings result from these unions: the primary type of midway creatures and certain high types of material beings who remain attached to the prince’s staff after their parents have been removed from the planet at the time of the arrival of Adam and Eve. (50:3.5)
	the progeny end as administrators of the planet in light and life eras (55:3.15)
work in planets
	Primitive mortals usually welcome the Planetary Prince and his visible staff; in fact, they often look upon them with awe and reverence, almost with worshipfulness, if they are not restrained. (52:1.8)
	Much of the physical work connected with the establishment of the headquarters city is performed by the corporeal staff. (50:4.2)
	The prince’s corporeal staff are usually removed from the planet in connection with the next adjudication at the time of the second Son’s arrival on the sphere. (50:3.4-6)

corporeality error | | | | OK

As yet there seems to be no specific or settled employment for the Mortal Corps of Finaliters, though they serve in many capacities on worlds settled in light and life. (30:4.32-33)
they were attacked by Lucifer. He intimated that the finaliters were in collusion with the Paradise Sons to foist fraud upon all creation about the existence of the Father since they never brought back a very clear-cut idea of the Father’s actual personality as it is discernible on Paradise. (53:3.2,6)
The primary finaliter corps is composed of Havona natives, Gravity Messengers, Glorified Mortals, Adopted Seraphim, and Glorified Material Sons and Midwayers (31:0.1) (31:2.1)

	Havona natives provide to finaliters the viewpoint of one born in perfection and divine repleteness.  (31:1.1)

	children who have been deprived of the valuable and essential evolutionary experience on the worlds of mortal nativity, and have passed through probationary nurseries, are not mustered into the Corps of the Finality. (47:2.8)
	it is speculated that the fate of the mortal finaliters will be in outer space, in the universes that are currently being organized in outer space (12:2.6) (30:4.33) (31:0.8) (31:3.2-8) (31:7.4-5) (31:10.13-19) (48:8.4) (112:7.16-18)
	there are those who hold that the soul-identity of Jesus now rests in the “bosom of the Father,” and that it will later be released to lead the Corps of the Finality of Nebadon to its undisclosed destiny associated with the universes of outer space. (188:3.8)

To climb to the supernal heights of finaliter sonship with God is a masterly achievement for an angel, an accomplishment far transcending your attainment of eternal survival through the plan of the Eternal Son and the ever-present help of the indwelling Adjuster; but the guardian seraphim, and occasionally others, do actually effect such ascensions. (40:1.2)
bestowal attendants are completion seraphim; they have all traversed the circles of Seraphington and have attained the Seraphic Corps of Completion.  Such seraphim have all achieved Paradise and the personal embrace of the Second Source and Center, the Eternal Son. (39:1.5)
Many of the Seraphington graduates, members of the Seraphic Corps of Completion who are associated with these seraphim, engage in teaching in the Salvington schools concerned with the preparation of the creatures of Nebadon for the next universe age. (39:1.12) (113:7.5)

creation according to The Urantia Book
	At a hypothetical moment in eternity there was no differentiation in all of infinity. So The Infinite One differentiated itself from The Infinitude even continuing as the eternal continuum I AM. This culminates in the multiple differentiation of reality through a sevenfold relationship of I AM with itself. (105:1.5) (105:2.2-4)
	The universe philosophers postulate the eternity existence of the I AM as the primal source of all reality. (105:4.1)
	Just as the original diversification of the I AM must be attributed to inherent and self-contained volition, so must the promulgation of finite reality be ascribed to the volitional acts of Paradise Deity and to the repercussional adjustments of the functional triunities. (105:5.1-6) (105:7.18)
	The Eternal Son is the perfect and final expression of the “first” personal and absolute concept of the Universal Father. We say the “first” thought of God and we allude to an impossible time origin of the Eternal Son, but these events never occurred in sequence. (6:0) (8:0.1)
	creation of Infinite Spirit
		In the dawn of eternity both the Father and the Son become infinitely cognizant of their mutual interdependence, their eternal and absolute oneness; and therefore do they enter into an infinite and everlasting covenant of divine partnership.

		Urantia is of origin in our sun, and our sun is one of the multifarious offspring of the Andronover nebula, which was onetime organized as a component part of the physical power and material matter of the local universe of Nebadon. Andronover was initiated 875,000 millions of years ago. 6,000 millions of years ago Andronover breakups and our sun is born (57)
legends of creation
	The story of the creation of Urantia in six days was based on the tradition of Adam and Eve. Many groups accepted this story of man’s clay origin by some form of special creation (74:8.1-4)
	The Babylonians, because of immediate contact with the remnants of the civilization of the Adamites, enlarged and embellished the story of man’s creation; they taught that he had descended directly from the gods. (74:8.6)
	The Old Testament account of creation dates from long after the time of Moses; he never taught the Hebrews such a distorted story. (74:8.7)
	In his early teachings, Moses very wisely did not attempt to go back of Adam’s time, and since Moses was the supreme teacher of the Hebrews, the stories of Adam became intimately associated with those of creation. (74:8.8-15)

	Creator Sons gain practical mercy, fair judgment, and the patience born of existence by living experience in bestowals (119:0.6)

		Creator Sons may not beget offspring on bestowals. This is the only exception to the rule of live ordinary live (20:6.2)
		Without the bestowal service of the Paradise Sons and the loving ministry of the creatures of the Infinite Spirit, beings of material origin could hardly hope to attain the Eternal Son. (6:8.4)
		In the final bestowal a Creator Son appears as a member of one of the higher mortal races on some inhabited world, usually as a member of that racial group which contains the largest hereditary legacy of the Adamic stock (21:4.3)
		The Eternal Son is the eternal Word of God. On mortal bestowals, Creator Sons are Word made flesh (20:5.1)

	The Creator Sons are endowed with a spirit of universe presence in many ways analogous to that of the Seven Master Spirits of Paradise. This spirit is an inherent endowment of the Creator Son (15:9.12) (34:4.5) (180:4.3) (194:2.11-12)
	Spirit of Truth is sent inmediatly after mortal bestowal of a Creator or Avonal Son (20:6.8-9) (108:2.3)
function of Creator Sons
	Supplications of all kinds belong to the realm of the Eternal Son and the Son’s spiritual organization. Prayers, all formal communications, everything except adoration and worship of the Universal Father, are matters that concern a local universe; they do not ordinarily proceed out of the realm of the jurisdiction of a Creator Son. (5:3.2,4-5)
	The Son functions as a father in his local universe. (33:3.4,7) (33:5.1)
	the universes of time and space are all created and organized by the Paradise corps of the Creator Sons. This implies: (1:0.1) (1:2.9) (8:3.4) (15:2.5) (21:0.1) (32:0.1)
	* start a original personal staff of the Creator Son with a thousand tertiaphim (28:1.2-3)
	* choose the space site for a new universe (21:2.1) (32:0.4)
	* achieve universe materialization and equilibrium (21:2.9)
	* create their children through the liason with the Mother Spirit (21:2.2,9)
	* create Material Sons. The Universe Mother Spirit does not participate in the production of these beings (38:1.1) (51:1.1)
	* start the headquarters sphere work when the Creator Son arrives to the local universe (32:1.5)
	* initiate new creature designs, with the approval of the Eternal Son (33:2.2) (33:3.8)
	* materialize visible matter from pre-existent space energy (32:2.1) (56:9.12) (116:5.13)
	* Power Centers coordinate with Creator Sons’s plans (41:1.1)
	* defend and if needed retrieve personal creation if ever his authority or administration is challenged, attacked, or jeopardized (21:3.14) (33:3.4)
	The fourth Havona circuit is sometimes called the “circuit of the Sons. ” In this circuit the reserve corps of the Paradise Michaels maintain special service schools of mutual ministry to both the ascending and descending pilgrims; (26:8.1)
	The Creator Sons in the Deity association of God the Sevenfold provide the mechanism whereby the mortal becomes immortal and the finite attains the embrace of the infinite. (0:8.11) (180:3.7)
	the Paradise Sons act as rehabilitators of that which misguided creature will has placed in spiritual jeopardy. (7:4.5)
	Creator Sons represent Father and Son in their creations (5:3.6) (6:8.3,7) (7:2.4) (7:3.1) (20:1.14) (33:2.3)
	fusion with a Son
		mortals can do fusion with a Son. See more in the link about Son-fused mortals | Son-fused mortals
		in this cases fragmented entities of Creator Sons fuse with mortals (30:1.102) | Son-fused mortals
		“fusion spirit” of a Creator Son is implemented in the Reflective Spirits of the higher universes. (40:10.2)
relationship with his creatures
	Creators never sit in judgment on their creatures; that is the exclusive function of creatures of high training and actual creature experience. (33:7.1) (134:8.7)
	The mortal creature must find God. The Creator Son never stops until he finds man—the lowest will creature. (26:11.5)
	there exist an intimate personal communion between the Creator Sons and their mortal creatures (1:4.2)
destiny
	the nature, mission, ministry, associations, origin, and destiny of the Creator Sons is studied in the second stage of light and life (55:3.12)
	Speculation concerning the function of these Creator Sons in connection with the outer universes now in process of preliminary assembly is wholly futile. But it is a widely held assumption that the Michaels, the Creator Sons, are destined to function in the outer universes. (55:10.9-11) (56:7.6-7) (119:8.7)
limitations
	A Creator Son, after his elevation to the full sovereignty, cannot formulate entirely new types of creatures (34:5.1)
	His personal power is limited by the pre-existent gravity circuits centering at Paradise (33:2.2)
	they cannot bestow personality, only Universal Father can do it (21:2.6) (33:2.2)
	New creature designs and types must have the consent of the Eternal and Original Mother Son. (21:2.5) (33:2.2)
	Infinite Spirit must agree to any new transformations of energy-matter (21:2.4) (33:2.2)
	The Sons of the local universes can decree the survival of mortal man, but only the Ancients of Days may sit in executive judgment on the issues of eternal life and death. (15:12.2) (33:2.2)
	A Creator Son is not handicapped by time, but he is conditioned by space; he cannot personally be in two places at the same time. (34:3.4-5)
	while the Creator Sons fully share his divinity, even phases of his absoluteness, they are not altogether limited by that finality of wisdom which directs the Father’s infinity of will. (4:4.4)
	a Creator Michael takes an oath to the Trinity not to assume supreme sovereignty until the seven creature bestowals have been completed and certified by the superuniverse rulers. (21:3) (119:0.3)
	The Eternal Son is limited in transmittal of creator prerogatives. But when these co-ordinate Sons have been produced, the prerogatives of creatorship are apparently not further transmissible. Creator Sons are never able to transmit or delegate the prerogatives of creatorship to his Sons (6:5.4) (21:2.3-8) (21:5.8)
	A Creator Son is unable to leave his headquarters world until such a time as gravity stabilization of the realm has been effected (32:2.5) (116:5.13)
	no way to limit time element of creator prerogatives (145:3.11)
local universe Mother Spirits
	Mother Spirits are effective helpers and ministers of Creator Sons (8:4.4) (21:2.2)
	Creator Sons’s spiritual presence can be invested in Mother Spirits during Son's absences (21:2.11)
	after the completion of his seventh bestowal the triumphant Creator Son elevates the Universe Mother Spirit to cosovereignty and acknowledges the Spirit consort as his equal. (17:6.8)
	Mother Spirits may attain union with Creator Sons in eternity (118:9.8)
	Both the Son and the Mother Spirit participate in creation of local universes (8:3.4)
	If the Creator Sons are destined to the outer universes in the future, the Divine Ministers will undoubtedly accompany them.  (55:10.11)
local universe sovereignty
	The sovereignty of a Creator Son in a local universe passes through six, perhaps seven, stages of experiential manifestation (21:3.4-11)
	until they earn the sovereignty, Creator Sons rule as Vicegerents of Father (21:3.1)
	These Sons are able to administer only that which they bring into existence. (7:6.4)
	When the Eternal Son bestows a Creator Son upon a projected local universe, that Creator Son assumes full responsibility for the completion, control, and composure of that new universe (21:2) (119:0.3)
	A Creator Son could assert full sovereignty over his personal creation at any time, but he wisely chooses not to. (21:3.2) (120:0.5)
	A Creator Son is given the range of a universe by the consent of the Paradise Trinity. Such action constitutes title of physical possession, a cosmic leasehold. (21:3.1)
	In accepting the initial vicegerent sovereignty of a projected local universe, a Creator Michael takes an oath to the Trinity not to assume supreme sovereignty until the seven creature bestowals have been completed and certified by the superuniverse rulers. (21:3.12) (21:4.5)
	local universe sovereignty of Master Michaels is like future sovereignty of Supreme (21:5.5)
	all power is concentrated in hands of Creator Sons upon achievement of sovereignty (23:2.18) (33:2.3) (34:1.4)
	In settling the question of sovereignty in a local universe, the Creator Son is not only demonstrating his own fitness to rule but is also revealing the nature and portraying the sevenfold attitude of the Paradise Deities. (21:3.1-3,16-24) (21:4.6)
	The Creator Son rules supreme in all matters of ethical associations, the relations of any division of creatures to any other class of creatures or of two or more individuals within any given group (32:4.3-4)
Universal Father
	While the Universal Father most certainly rules over his vast creation, he functions in a local universe administration through the Creator Sons (32:3.4) (32:4.3,10) (33:0.1)
	The Universal Father speaks in acknowledgment of the eternal union of the Creator Son and the Creative Spirit and in confirmation of the bestowal of certain joint powers of administration (17:6.5)
	the Father gives life to Creator Sons without measure (153:2.7)
	What a Creator Son desires and his Father wills IS (145:3.11) (149:1.7)

crime; Crime | | criminals; justice; lynch law | | OK
in the most developed continental nation of a neighboring planet they use methods to deal with crime, madness and degeneracy, which although in some ways would please us, in others we would find them appalling. The most dangerous hardened criminals and the incurably insane are condemned by the courts to die in lethal gas chambers. (72:6.9) (72:10)
primitive crime
	crime was assault upon tribal mores (70:11.4)
	early methods of detecting crime consisted in conducting ordeals of poison, fire, and pain. (70:10.5-7)
	Accidental murder was not recognized, and in the punishment of crime the motive of the criminal was wholly disregarded; judgment was rendered in accordance with the injury done. (70:10.3)
	Today, in Africa and elsewhere may be found primitive peoples who kill someone every time a nonviolent death occurs. (90:3.6)
	In the early development of their profession the shamans began to specialize in such vocations as rain making, disease healing, and crime detecting. (90:2.1)
	as time passed, it was learned that the severity of the punishment was not so valuable a deterrent to crime as was its certainty and swiftness. (70:10.15)

Jesus’ words for a condemned criminal in Corinth were: “Your fellows have adjudged you guilty; they have determined that you shall die, but there is a Judge to whom you may appeal for forgiveness, and who will judge you by your real motives and better intentions. You need not fear to meet the judgment of God if your repentance is genuine and your faith sincere”. (133:4.12)

crisis; crises | | disaster | | OK
In times of crisis in the affairs of a universe, the enormous influence of the mind as a factor in spiritual choice is demonstrated. Education, training, and experience are important factors, but the Adjuster can empower the consecrated will to perform amazing acts of loyal devotion. (67:3.7)
God has foreseen all the emergencies of the universe, and although it seems that emergency decisions or rectifications are made, this is due to our limited vision of God's plan. (3:2.6-7)
humans sometimes hear Adjuster’s direct voice in moments of supreme desire, in a supreme situation, and consequent upon a supreme decision. (110:7.9)
The men and women of the reserve corps of destiny function in rare social emergencies and spiritual exigencies for the prevention of the breakdown of evolutionary culture or the extinction of the light of living truth. (114:7.9)
The ideas, motives, and longings of a lifetime are openly revealed in a crisis. (187:2.4)
seraphim do not intrude into human drama except in emergencies and then usually on the direct orders of their superiors (113:5.4-5)
spiritual attainment sometimes is secured by a specific crisis (100:2.8)
Woman failed to get social recognition during primitive times because she did not function in an emergency; she was not a spectacular or crisis hero. (84:3.3)
Jesus and crisis
	This crisis in Jesus’ earth life began with the feeding of the five thousand and ended with the famous sermon in the synagogue; the crisis in the lives of the apostles began with the sermon in the synagogue and continued for a whole year, ending only with the Master’s trial and crucifixion. (153:1.4)
	Jesus fully understood how men prepare themselves for the decisions of a crisis and the performance of sudden deeds of courageous choosing by the slow process of the reiterated choosing between the recurring situations of good and evil. (153:1.3)
	For preparing the great crisis of his life on earth Jesus spent much time in communion with the Father in heaven. (152:5.5)
	Jesus referred one phase of the kingdom to the future and intimated that such an event might appear as a part of a world crisis (170:4.15)

Crispus | | | PERSON | OK
Crispus was the head of the Corinthian synagogue; he was married with five children; he met Jesus without knowing it, and later supported Paul in his preaching (133:3.1-4)

criticism | | self-analysis | | OK
Caligastia was inclined to take sides with almost every party of protest, and he was usually sympathetic with those who gave mild expression to implied criticism. (66:8.1)
both Lucifer and Caligastia were patiently instructed and lovingly warned respecting their critical tendencies and the subtle development of their pride of self and its associated exaggeration of the feeling of self-importance. But all of these attempts to help were misconstrued as unwarranted criticism and as unjustified interference with personal liberties. (66:8.2)
conscience is really the criticism of oneself by one’s own value-habits, personal ideals. (100:1.5)
It requires no great depth of intellect to pick flaws, ask questions, or raise objections. (102:7.6)
Jesus said: Let us give authorities no occasion for offense at our attitude. (157:1.2)
If you truly desire to overcome the habit of criticizing some friend, the quickest and surest way of achieving such a change of attitude is to establish the habit of praying for that person every day of your life. (91:5.3-5)
religion does not grow unless it is disciplined by constructive criticism (5:5.12) (99:3.7)
True and genuine inward certainty does not in the least fear outward analysis, nor does truth resent honest criticism. (146:3.2)

Cro-Magnons; Cro-Magnon | (80:3) | blue race | RACE | OK
Cro-Magnon men are the result of the mixing of the Andites of Eden with the higher types of the blue race, combined with the elimination of the inferior strains (80:1.7)
The Cro-Magnon peoples, the blue race, were a brave and farseeing race. They had a familiar spirit and they had an effective system of child culture (80:3.5-7)
Cro-Magnons were absorbed by Andites from Mesopotamia in a final and en masse invasion swept over Europe (80:3.9) (80:4.6)
the Cro-Magnons were wiped out by the superior intelligence and ever-augmenting biologic reserves of the white race of Andites. The decisive struggles between the white man and the blue man were fought out in the valley of the Somme. The strongholds of the blue man which persisted longest were in southern France (80:5.3-6)
The Cro-Magnoid blue man constituted the biologic foundation for the modern European races, but they have survived only as absorbed by the later and virile conquerors of their homelands. (80:5.7)
there are few evidences of the white man’s early culture, although the preceding Cro-Magnon type is well preserved where it has been securely sealed up in caves and grottoes. (80:9.4)
During the previous hunting era the superior tribes had intermarried with the higher types of war captives and had unvaryingly destroyed those whom they deemed inferior. But then they began to save many of the mediocre captives as slaves for agriculture and interbreeding with slaves deteriorated the race (80:3.9)

cross | | atonement doctrine; crucifixion; Jesus:death; Jesus:events in life | | OK
the cross
	Jesus carried the crossbeam on his shoulders, not the whole cross; he was nailed to crossbeam, hoisted on the upright timber and nailed his feet to the wood using one long nail (187:1.1-2) (187:2.1)
	Simon of Cyrene carried the crossbeam to Jesus from the gates to Golgotha (187:1.9-10)
the cross meaning
	The fact of the cross became the very center of subsequent Christianity; but it is not the central truth of the religion which may be derived from the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. (143:6.3)
	Although Jesus did not die this death on the cross to atone for the racial guilt of mortal man nor to provide some sort of effective approach to an otherwise offended and unforgiving God; notwithstanding that these ideas of atonement and propitiation are erroneous, nonetheless, it is a fact that Urantia has become known among other neighboring inhabited planets as the “World of the Cross”. Jesus lived and died for a whole universe, not just for the races of this one world. (188:4-5)
	The cross of Jesus portrays the full measure of the supreme devotion of the true shepherd for even the unworthy members of his flock.  Jesus’ death on the cross exemplifies a love which is sufficiently strong and divine to forgive sin and swallow up all evil-doing. (188:5.1-7)
	On other worlds, as well as on Urantia, this sublime spectacle of the death of the human Jesus on the cross of Golgotha has stirred the emotions of mortals, while it has aroused the highest devotion of the angels. (188:5.8-12)
	We know that the death on the cross was not to effect man’s reconciliation to God but to stimulate man’s realization of the Father’s eternal love and his Son’s unending mercy, and to broadcast these universal truths to a whole universe. (188:5.13)
	The triumph of the death on the cross is all summed up in the spirit of Jesus’ attitude toward those who assailed him. He made the cross an eternal symbol of the triumph of love over hate and the victory of truth over evil when he prayed, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do” (188:5.6)
	The cross does stand as the token of the highest form of unselfish service, the supreme devotion of the full bestowal of a righteous life in the service of wholehearted ministry (188:5.9)

crossbreeding | | eugenics; hybridization | | OK
Present-day prejudice against “half-castes,” “hybrids,” and “mongrels” arises because modern racial crossbreeding is, for the greater part, between the grossly inferior strains of the races concerned. (82:6.3)
it would not prove beneficial for the higher strains of Urantia mortals to mate with the lower races; such an unwise procedure would jeopardize all civilization on the world. we must now work out the planetary problem of race improvement by other methods of adaptation (51:5.7)

crucifixion; Crucifixion; crucified | (187) | atonement doctrine; cross; Jesus:death; Jesus:events in life | | OK
Crucifixion was not a Jewish mode of punishment. Even Herod, with all his cruelty, did not resort to crucifixion. The Romans never crucified a Roman citizen; only slaves and subject peoples were subjected to this dishonorable mode of death.  (187:1.5)
Crucifixion was resorted to in order to provide a cruel and lingering punishment, the victim sometimes not dying for several days. (187:2.3) (187:5.8)
it was strictly against the law to show friendly feelings for one who was being led forth to crucifixion. (187:1.7)
A crucified person could not be buried in a Jewish cemetery (188:1.2)
main crucified
	* Jesus in Jerusalem, on Golgotha (187)
	* Andrew in Patrae, in Achaia (139:1.12)

	* thousands of jews at destruction of Jerusalem, just forty years after the crucifixion of Jesus (187:1.5)

cruelty; cruelties; brutality | | | | OK
A doctrinal fetish will lead mortal man to betray himself into the clutches of bigotry, fanaticism, superstition, intolerance, and the most atrocious of barbarous cruelties. (88:2.7)
The few denunciations of Jesus were largely directed against pride, cruelty, oppression, and hypocrisy. (140:8.21)
In the half-civilized man there still lurks an evil brutality which seeks to vent itself upon those who are superior in wisdom and spiritual attainment. (184:4.5)
When the flood tides of human adversity, selfishness, cruelty, hate, malice, and jealousy beat about the mortal soul, you may rest in the assurance that there is one inner bastion, the citadel of the spirit, which is absolutely unassailable; at least this is true of every human being who has dedicated the keeping of his soul to the indwelling spirit of the eternal God.

cults; cult | | ceremonies; doctrines; mystery cults; religion; traditions | | OK
A race or nation can only assimilate from any advanced religion that which is reasonably consistent and compatible with its current evolutionary status, plus its genius for adaptation. (92:2.4)
atheistic cults claim that such salvation as was attainable could come only by man’s own unaided efforts. (94:2.5)
destiny of cults depends on leadership (99:5.1)
the cults are formed, not to discover truth, but rather to promulgate their creeds. (92:3.1)
primitive cult
	Fetishism ran through all the primitive cults from the earliest belief in sacred stones, through idolatry, cannibalism, and nature worship, to totemism. (88:3.1)
	The ceremonies of the cult were primitive man’s attempt to control the material world in which he found himself. (90:3.1-2)
	The early Christian cult was the most effective, appealing, and enduring of any ritual ever conceived or devised, but much of its value has been destroyed in a scientific age by the destruction of so many of its original underlying tenets. (87:7.4)
strengths
	cults provide symbolism to preserve religious loyalties (87:7.1)
	religion rarely survives without institutions, as private practice of isolated individuals (97:10.7) (98:6.1)
dangers
	The cult preserved sentiment and satisfied emotion, but it has always been the greatest obstacle to social reconstruction and spiritual progress. (87:7.2-3)
	Sectarianism is a disease of institutional religion, and dogmatism is an enslavement of the spiritual nature. (99:6.1) (170:5.20) (195:10.7-15)
	In the spiritual fellowship of the believer-son with the divine Father there can never be doctrinal finality and sectarian superiority of group consciousness. (182:1.8) (195:10.14)
	The cult resists development because real progress is certain to modify or destroy the cult itself; therefore must revision always be forced upon it. (92:3.4)
Jesus
	Jesus avoided in every possible manner the formal establishment of an organized cult, a crystallized religion, or a segregated ethical grouping of mortal beings (120:3.6)
cult of new revelation
	it must be the outgrowth of applied love (87:7.7)
	cult must be predicated on Fatherhood of God and brotherhood of man (87:7.6)
	But a religious cult cannot be manufactured; it must grow. (87:7.3)
	No cult can survive if it retards moral growth and fails to foster spiritual progress. (87:7.10)
	it must symbolize spiritual experience, significance of home; embody mystery; be elastic; not be overly complex (87:7.5-10)
	The new cult must foster sentiment, satisfy emotion, and promote loyalty; but it must do more: It must facilitate spiritual progress, enhance cosmic meanings, augment moral values, encourage social development, and stimulate a high type of personal religious living. (87:7.1-2,7)
	The world is filled with lost souls, not lost in the theologic sense but lost in the directional meaning, wandering about in confusion among the isms and cults of a frustrated philosophic era. (100:5.1)
rituals (90:5.1-3)
	The great danger in all this is that the ritual tends to become a substitute for religion. (90:5.6)
	it is better to reform than destroy group function (97:10.7)
	endless rituals have hampered society and cursed civilization, have been an intolerable burden to every act of life, every racial undertaking. (90:5.1)
	The essence of the ritual is the perfection of its performance; among savages it must be practiced with exact precision. (90:5.1-2)
	The more this ritual has been an unconscious growth, the stronger it has gripped its devotees. (87:7.2)
