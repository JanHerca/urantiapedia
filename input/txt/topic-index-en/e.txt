economic necessity is one of human sacred loyalties (196:0.7)
Success requires not only devotion to one’s work but also that one should function as a part of some one of the channels of material wealth. (160:4.10)

During the earlier ages of a new world, earthquakes are frequent, and they are all characterized by great physical disturbances; especially is this true of the gas-contraction spheres, the worlds born of the immense nebular rings which are left behind in the wake of the early condensation and contraction of certain individual suns. (41:10.4)
the isthmus of Gibraltar, protecting the western basin of the Mediterranean, gave way as the result of an earthquake, quickly raising this inland lake to the level of the Atlantic Ocean.  (80:2.4)

ecstasy | | emotions; joy | | OK
Genuine spiritual ecstasy is usually associated with great outward calmness and almost perfect emotional control. (91:7.3)
Religious ecstasy is permissible when resulting from sane antecedents, but such experiences are more often the outgrowth of purely emotional influences than a manifestation of deep spiritual character. (91:7.3-4)
The practical test of all these strange religious experiences of mysticism, ecstasy, and inspiration is to observe whether these phenomena cause an individual: (91:7.5-12)
# To enjoy better and more complete physical health.
# To function more efficiently and practically in his mental life.
# More fully and joyfully to socialize his religious experience.
# More completely to spiritualize his day-by-day living while faithfully discharging the commonplace duties of routine mortal existence.
# To enhance his love for, and appreciation of, truth, beauty, and goodness.
# To conserve currently recognized social, moral, ethical, and spiritual values.
# To increase his spiritual insight—God-consciousness.

	when the Egyptians undertook to reform the calendar, about 7,000 years ago, they did it with great accuracy, introducing the year of 365 days. (77:2.12)
	Egypt had a notable influence on Judaism.  It must be remembered that the Jews failed to evolve an adequate nontheologic philosophy of life. They struggled with their original and Egyptian concept of divine rewards for righteousness coupled with dire punishments for sin. (97:8.2)
migrations in Egypt
	superior Nodites, Adamites, and Andites arrived from Euphrates valley to Egypt (95:2.1)
	Andites. 10% of the last waves of Andites that came en masse from Mesopotamia between 8,000 and 6,000 B.C. they went to egypt (78:6.5,8) (79:1.3) (80:6)
	Arabian Bedouin Semites entered as laborers and ended enslaved (96:2.2,4)
	the more mixed indigo tribes that inhabited the center of the Saharan plateau headed for Egypt and Palestine. Then Egypt was invaded by inferior tribes from inhospitable Arabia and by blacks from the south. (80:2.2) (80:6.5)
	And so it appears that Egypt was first dominated by the orange man, then by the green, followed by the indigo (black) man, and still later by a mongrel race of indigo, blue, and modified green men. But long before Adam arrived, the blue men of Europe and the mixed races of Arabia had driven the indigo race out of Egypt and far south on the African continent. (64:7.15)
political matters
	The last great struggle between the orange and the green men occurred in the region of the lower Nile valley in Egypt. (64:6.13)
	The fall of Assyria and the ascendancy of Egypt brought deliverance to Judah for a time. (97:9.23)
	Egypt put Judah under tribute (97:9.17)
	Israel conspired with Egypt to refuse Assyria tribute (97:9.21)
	Rome pitted Seleucid Syria against Ptolemaic Egypt and for it necessitated fostering Palestine as a separate and independent state (121:2.8)
religion
	Egypt was intellectual and moral but not overly spiritual. (95:3.5)
	In Egypt the most popular cults were that of Osiris and his mother Isis. These Egyptian mysteries taught that the divine son Osiris had experienced death and had been resurrected by divine power. The rituals of the worship of Isis and Osiris were more refined and impressive than those of the Phrygian cult. (98:4.2-8)
	despite the Andite inheritance very much of the social and ethical idealism of the Egyptians arose in the valley of the Nile as a purely evolutionary development. Thousands of years before the Salem gospel penetrated to Egypt, its moral leaders taught justice, fairness, and the avoidance of avarice. (95:3)
	The Egyptians once believed that soul and body remained together. Among the Egyptians this led to careful tomb construction and efforts at body preservation. (86:4.8)
	egyptians developed an extensive theology and had an equally extensive but burdensome priesthood. (80:6.4)
	They believed that each favored individual had bestowed upon him at birth, or soon thereafter, a protecting spirit which they called the ka. The concept of ba symbolized the soul (111:0.5)
	The Egyptian taboo on pork has been perpetuated by the Hebraic and Islamic faiths. (89:1.5)
	The original Melchizedek teachings really took their deepest root in Egypt, from where they subsequently spread to Europe. (95:2) (95:2.1)
	great Egyptians prophets were Amenemope, Okhban, Ikhnaton, and Moses (95:3.5)
	Egyptians had triad gods, but these were still not true trinities. (104:0.3)

The electronic charge creates an electric field; movement gives rise to an electric current; the current produces a magnetic field. (42:5.8)
light and electricity are not the basic energies of space; they are secondary and subsidiary manifestations. (41:1.2)
Light, heat, electricity, magnetism, chemism, energy, and matter are—in origin, nature, and destiny—one and the same thing, together with other material realities as yet undiscovered on Urantia. (42:4.1-2)
Scientists may some day measure the energy, or force manifestations, of gravitation, light, and electricity, but these same scientists can never scientifically tell you what these universe phenomena are. (133:5.4)

electrons; electron; electronic | (42:3.5) | atoms; matter; gravita | | OK
Mutual attraction holds one hundred ultimatons together in the constitution of the electron; and there are never more nor less than one hundred ultimatons in a typical electron. (42:3.3) (42:4.6) (42:6.4-5)
there are ten modified forms of the electron caused by losses of ultimatons (42:6.5)
35,000,000°F of heat, in association with certain gravity pressures, as the electronic boiling point. (41:7.4,12,13)
Chemical behavior is wholly dependent on the activity of the freely revolving electrons. (42:7.6-10)
Some of the reddish stars have a density at the center that has resulted in bringing the orbits of the basic material units closer and closer together until they now closely approach the status of electronic condensation (41:3.6)
As the ultimatons aggregate into electrons, condensation occurs with a consequent storage of energy. (42:5.4)
Orbital shifting of electrons results in the ejection or the absorption of very definite and uniform measurable particles of light-energy, while the individual electron always gives up a particle of light-energy when subjected to collision. (42:5.6)
Heat is the measurement of electronic activity (42:4.5)
The 30 innermost orbital electrons have individuality, but their energy systems tend to intermingle, extending from electron to electron and well-nigh from orbit to orbit. The last ten electrons are able to escape more or less freely from the control of the mother nucleus. (42:7.9)
mesotrons disintegrate into electrons, releasing a lot of unexpected radioactive energy (42:8.5)
In Orvonton it has never been possible naturally to assemble over one hundred orbital electrons in one atomic system. (42:7.7)
electrons orbit at same relative distance from nucleus as planets around sun (42:7.1)
the orbital velocities of electrons are beyond human imagination (42:7.3)
Ultimatons, electrons, and other mass aggregations of energy are uniform particles of matter, and in their transit through space they really proceed in direct lines. (42:5.14)
When an electron is suddenly stopped, the resultant electromagnetic commotion produces the X ray; the X ray is that disturbance. (42:5.8)
When electrons pass from higher to lower energy levels of orbital revolution, quanta are always given off. (42:5.6)
Each atom is a trifle over 1/100,000,000th of an inch in diameter, while an electron weighs a little more than 1/2,000th of the smallest atom, hydrogen (42:6.7-8)
Physical conditions may be greatly altered because the electron spin is sometimes in the opposite direction from that of the grosser matter behavior, even in the same physical zone. (58:3.3)
Atoms and electrons are subject to gravity. (41:9.2) (42:4.3)
The power centers and their associates are much concerned in the work of transmuting the ultimaton into the circuits and revolutions of the electron.  (42:4.3)
an X-ray-stimulated electron takes 500,000 years to reach sun’s surface (41:5.4)

The material of Havona consists of the organization of exactly 1,000 basic chemical elements and the balanced function of the seven forms of Havona energy. The local universes are of decimal construction. There are just 100 elements in a dual universe; that is the maximum possible organization of matter in Nebadon. These 100 forms of matter consist of a regular series in which from 1 to 100 electrons revolve around a central nucleus. (14:2.3) (42:7.4-7)
The first 27 atoms, those containing 1 to 27 orbital electrons, are more predictable. From the 28th onwards we encounter more and more of the unpredictability of the supposed presence of the Unqualified Absolute. (42:7.10)
above 90, electrons may escape more or less freely from the control of the mother nucleus (42:7.9)
architectural spheres have 100 chemical elements, like evolved planets, plus 100 chemical elements of morontia material (48:1.3)
All the architectural worlds abound in crystals and the so-called precious metals. (46:5.31)
The heavier atoms are not found on the surface of many worlds. (42:7.5)
the atomic world does display a certain periodic characterization which recurs in groups of seven—a birthmark carried by this material world indicative of its far-distant spiritual origin. (42:9.2-3)
radioactive elements are brought in by meteors (57:7.3)

emotions; emotion; Emotional excitement | | sentiment | | OK
When it is not possible to worship God in the tabernacles of nature, men should do their best to provide houses of beauty, sanctuaries of appealing simplicity and artistic embellishment, so that the highest of human emotions may be aroused in association with the intellectual approach to spiritual communion with God. (167:6.6)
While emotion as a factor in human decisions cannot be wholly eliminated, it should not be directly appealed to in the teachings of those who would advance the cause of the kingdom. (152:6.3) (159:3.2) (160:3.1)
The absurdities of dream life not only testify to pressure of unexpressed emotions but also bear witness to the horrible distortion of the representations of the spiritual concepts presented by the Adjusters. (110:5.4)
Emotional excitement is not the ideal spiritual stimulus. Excitement does not augment energy; it rather exhausts the powers of both mind and body. (160:3.1)

	We must remember that feeling, not thinking, was the guiding and controlling influence in all evolutionary development. (85:7.2)
	The divine spirit makes contact with mortal man, not by feelings or emotions, but in the realm of the highest and most spiritualized thinking. It is our thoughts, not our feelings, that lead us Godward. (101:1.3-4)
	en la religión de todas las épocas, la experiencia más importante es el sentimiento relacionado con los valores morales y los significados sociales, y no el pensamiento relativo a los dogmas teológicos o a las teorías filosóficas (103:3.4)
	Material feelings, human emotions, lead directly to material actions, selfish acts. (102:3.3)
Jesus
	Jesus taught the appeal to the emotions as the technique of arresting and focusing the intellectual attention. (152:6.3-4)

taught the Jewish apocalyptists, Israel should take heart; the days of their affliction were almost over; the discipline of God’s chosen people was about finished; God’s patience with the gentile foreigners was about exhausted. The end of Roman rule was synonymous with the end of the age and, in a certain sense, with the end of the world. (135:5.2-5)
For two and a half years John the Baptist lived at Engedi, and he persuaded most of the brotherhood that “the end of the age was at hand”; that “the kingdom of heaven was about to appear. (135:4.3)
many followers of Jesus interpreted his predictions concerning the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem as the “end of the world”, the reappearing of the Messiah and the establishment of the New Jerusalem (176:1.6) (176:4.2)

Everything nonspiritual in human experience, excepting personality, is a means to an end. (112:2.8) (112:5.22)
Intelligence alone can discriminate as to the best means of attaining indiscriminate ends, but a moral being possesses an insight which enables him to discriminate between ends as well as between means. (16:7.4-10) (160:4.11)
Jesus never did he resort to ignoble tactics in meeting the continuous pressure of his enemies, who did not hesitate to employ every sort of false, unfair, and unrighteous mode of attack upon him. (149:4.5) (173:2.7)
Jesus would not serve evil that good might presumably derive therefrom (136:9.3)
Everything nonspiritual in human experience, excepting personality, is a means to an end. Every true relationship of mortal man with other persons—human or divine—is an end in itself. (112:2.8)

Jesus repetead many times: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, and pray for those who despitefully use you. (140:3.15) (140:8.6) (188:5.7)
Prayer may be an angry cry for vengeance or a merciful intercession for one’s enemies. (91:8.7)
Said Jesus: “When an enemy smites you on one cheek, do not stand there dumb and passive but in positive attitude turn the other; that is, do the best thing possible actively to lead your brother in error away from the evil paths into the better ways of righteous living.”  (159:5.9)

circuits of energy
	communication lanes or lines of energy, sometimes also called an energy paths, are a direct circuit of energy from one power center to another power center or from one physical controller to another controller. (29:2.16) (44:4.10)
	specialized currents of time and space are definite and localized energy movements initiated and directed for specific purposes, much as the Gulf Stream of the Atlantic Ocean. (29:2.15)
	The great circuits of energy, mind, and spirit are never the permanent possessions of ascending personality; these ministries remain forever a part of Supremacy. (117:5.7-8)
	The physical-energy circuits administered by the power centers of Uversa require a little over 968 million years to complete the encirclement of the superuniverse. (15:8.2)
	Only those suns which function in the direct channels of the main streams of universe energy can shine on forever. (41:7.14)

energy charge | absoluta
	The power centers and their subordinate controllers are assigned to the working of all of the physical energies of organized space. They work with the three basic currents of ten energies each. That is the energy charge of organized space; and organized space is their domain. (29:3.10)
	the power pressure and the energy charge of an entire superuniverse registered by master frandalanks (29:4.2)
manipulation of energy by celestial agencies
	The manipulation of universe energy is ever in accordance with the personal will and the all-wise mandates of the Universal Father. (42:0.2)
	Creature mind does not inherently control energy; that is a Deity prerogative. (111:6.4-5)
	the eternal cycle of energy, being circuited in the Father of universes, is absolute and, being absolute, is expansile in neither fact nor value (42:10.1)
	Undoubtedly the Paradise Deities know of the existence of these undiscovered energy systems of space, but they never divulge such information. (23:2.20)
	The creation of energy and the bestowal of life are the prerogatives of the Universal Father and his associate Creator personalities.  (42:1.5)

	energies and materia of the universe did not all come from nether Paradise; space is the womb of several forms of matter and prematter as absoluta. Though the outer zone of the Paradise force center is the source of space-energies, space does not originate there. Space is not force, energy, or power. (11:5.9)
	energy proceeds from APradise, and is fashioned after Paradise (12:8.2) (15:4.1) (42:1.6) (101:10.4)

	The material of Havona consists of the organization of exactly one thousand basic chemical elements and the balanced function of the seven forms of Havona energy. (14:2.3)
	there are 30 energy segregations in superuniverses (42:2.14) (44:5.2)

	collisions of dead giants of space convert matter into rarest form of energy (15:8.6)
	in all the physical universes of time and space there is a universal manifestation of the decimal constitution of energy (42:9.1-2)
	energy is the basis of all existence, and pure energy is controlled by the Universal Father. (42:0.1) (42:1.1)
	Force-energy is imperishable, indestructible; these manifestations of the Infinite may be subject to unlimited transmutation, endless transformation, and eternal metamorphosis; but in no sense or degree, not even to the slightest imaginable extent, could they or ever shall they suffer extinction. (42:1.6-8) (42:4)
	Each local universe embraces exactly one one-hundred-thousandth part of the total energy charge of a superuniverse irrespective of nebular relationship, for energy is not organized by nebulae—it is universally distributed. (15:4.6)
	Any and all that responds to the material-gravity circuit centering in nether Paradise, we call matter—energy-matter in all its metamorphic states. (0:6.1)
	Power and energy are the universal evidences of the stability, constancy, and eternity of the central Isle of Paradise. (12:8.3)
	factors preventing gravity from converting all energy to matter are antigravity influences and disintegration of matter (15:8.5-6)
	formula equating energy to matter says the increase of mass in matter is equal to the increase of energy divided by the square of the velocity of light. (42:4.11)
	When electrons pass from higher to lower energy levels of orbital revolution, quanta are always given off. (42:5.6)
	Evolving energy has substance; it has weight, although weight is always relative, depending on revolutionary velocity, mass, and antigravity. (15:8.3)
	heat and antigravity disrupt matter and dissipate energy. (15:8.10)
	The actual energy stored in the invisible particles of physical matter is well-nigh unimaginable. (15:6.9)
	inherent qualities of energy insure orderly evolution of new physical systems (57:1.6)
	lava flows help insulate against space-energies (57:8.18)
	The laws of physical-energy behavior are basically universal, but local influences have much to do with the physical conditions which prevail on individual planets and in local systems. (15:6.16)
	Through animals, fire, wind, water, electricity, and other undiscovered sources of energy, man has liberated, and will continue to liberate, himself from the necessity for unremitting toil. (81:2.14)
	Mass in matter tends to retard velocity in energy (15:8.3)
	Physical materialized energy is organized as so-called matter (42:11.5)

	divine energy pervades all creation. (42:1.5)
	the times of plus energy there are power disturbances and heat fluctuations accompanied by electrical manifestations. (15:8.7)
	Force, energy, is the one thing which stands as an everlasting monument demonstrating and proving the existence and presence of the Universal Absolute. (42:0.1)
	The relative integrity of matter is assured by the fact that energy can be absorbed or released only in those exact amounts which Urantia scientists have designated quanta. (42:4.13-14) (42:5.6)
	All physical force, energy, and matter are one. Same thing as light, heat, electricity, magnetism, chemism, and matter (11:5.9) (42:1.2) (42:4.1-2)
	even after all possible progress, forever will scientists be powerless to create one atom of matter or to originate one flash of energy or ever to add to matter that which we call life. (42:1.4)
	Energy-matter seemingly evolves in the depths of space and is organized as power by the children of the Infinite Spirit in conjunction with the Creator Sons of God. (106:2.3)
	When the energies of the universe are so slowed down that they acquire the requisite degree of motion, then, under favorable conditions, these same energies become mass. (9:3.4) (15:8.7) (42:1.2) (48:2.20) (133:5.10)
	The blazing suns can transform matter into various forms of energy, but the dark worlds and all outer space can slow down electronic and ultimatonic activity to the point of converting these energies into the matter of the realms. (42:4.9)
	The accumulation and transmission of certain universal space-energies is one of the sources of solar energy (41:7.6)
	the threefold energy charge spreads throughout the space of the grand universe; it is like a vast moving ocean of energy which engulfs and bathes the whole of each of the seven supercreations. (29:2.14-15)
	stellar explosions due to ultimatonic condensation become energy of rarest form (41:7.15)
	energy is stored in ultimatons; when ultimatons aggregate into electrons also condensation occurs with a consequent storage of energy(42:5.4)
	suns almost wholly transmute energy into light (15:6.9) (42:4.9)
	suns and the dark giants of space, serve the power centers and physical controllers as way stations for the effective concentrating and directionizing of the energy circuits of the material creations. (41:3.1)
	The ultimaton is the first measurable form of energy, and has Paradise as its nucleus. (42:1.2)
	Force-energy is variously gravity responsive (36:6.6) (42:11.4)
	wave energy
		In the superuniverse of Orvonton there are one hundred octaves of wave energy. (42:5.1)
		Wavelike energy manifestations—from the standpoint of twentieth-century Urantia scientific enlightenment—may be classified into the following ten groups: (42:5.2-13)
		energy moves through space as particles in a straight line, not as waves (41:5.6-8) (42:4.9) (42:5.14-15)
		passage of energy particles through absoluta and segregata, creates wave appearance (42:5.14-16)
		Such wavelike energy ripples are 860 times the diameters of the ultimatons, electrons, atoms, or other units thus performing. (42:4.14)
		The wavelike energy extension of an electron may so spread out as to occupy the whole of the lesser atomic orbits; especially is this true of the electrons nearest the atomic nucleus. (41:5.8) (42:5.14-16)
		The sun’s rays constitute four octaves in the superuniverse scale, the visible rays embracing a single octave, number forty-six in this series. (42:5.1)

unknown forms of energy
	* God, who is energy, from a non-spiritual point of view (3:2.3)

	* an unnamed influence that appears to be a space force reaction of the Unqualified Absolute and is found in interelectronic space (42:8.2)
	* The paradoxical and powerful force that ensures atomic cohesive integrity is a form of energy that has not yet been discovered on Urantia. (42:8.6)

	They can and do change the physical form of the energies of space. (29:4.25)
	They are among the more personal orders of physical controllers, and except when an associate power director is present on an inhabited world, the transformers are in command. (29:4.23)

	the Constellation Fathers dispached a resolution supporting Van against Lucifer's rebellion but the verdict failed to reach Van because the order had been blocked in a relay energy transmitter due to Urantia's isolation. Energy transmitters can receive and transmit intelligence, but they cannot initiate communication. (67:2.2) (67:6.9)
	When energy is to be diverted to a new circuit, the transmitters deploy themselves in a line along the desired energy path (29:4.28)
	These beings, together with the energy transformers, are indispensable to mortals on nonbreathing planets (29:4.31)

Jesus was consistently cheerful, notwithstanding he sometimes drank deeply of the cup of human sorrow. He fearlessly faced the realities of existence, yet was he filled with enthusiasm for the gospel of the kingdom. (100:7.4,12)
Jesus pointed out that overmuch sympathy and pity may degenerate into serious emotional instability; that enthusiasm may drive on into fanaticism. (149:4.3)
And in welcoming Simon as his second apostle, Jesus said: “Simon, your enthusiasm is commendable, but it is dangerous to the work of the kingdom. I admonish you to become more thoughtful in your speech. I would change your name to Peter”. (137:1.3)
apostles must be possessed with zeal and intelligent enthusiasm (163:4.13) (163:6.1)
Ganid, the Hindu student of Jesus, once quoted a Hebrew proverb, and that word of wisdom was: “Whatsoever your hand finds to do, do that with all your might” (133:8.3)
Loveless zeal is always harmful to religion, while persecution diverts the activities of religion into the achievement of some sociologic or theologic drive. (99:3.8)
the religious enthusiasm with which social reforms are sometimes propagated has the great weakness that it is unable to profit from open religious criticism and thereby attain to profitable levels of self-correction (99:3.6-7)

But spiritual progress is opened to all regardless of environment (5:1.4-7)

envy; Envy; covetousness; envious | | jealousy; resentment | | OK
when the acknowledgment of our difficulties entails the reduction of our long-cherished conceit, the admission of envy, or the abandonment of deep-seated prejudices, the average person prefers to cling to the old illusions of safety and to the long-cherished false feelings of security. (160:1.7)
Envy is a deep-seated human trait; therefore did primitive man ascribe it to his early gods. (87:5.6)
Only a moral conscience can condemn the evils of national envy and racial jealousy. (52:6.5)
Jesus comforted a young Phoenician in Ephesus who was envious of a young man who had received promotion over his head (133:6.2)
Jesus insisted in keep free of covetousness: “Take heed and keep yourselves free from covetousness; a man’s life consists not in the abundance of the things which he may possess”. (140:8.17) (165:4.1,4)

The Israelitish consciousness took origin in the hill country of Ephraim; the later Jewish consciousness originated in the southern clan of Judah. But the northern kingdom did not vanish from history until the king of Israel conspired with the king of Egypt and refused to pay further tribute to Assyria. Then began the three years’ siege followed by the total dispersion of the northern kingdom. Ephraim, that is Israel, thus vanished. (97:9.2,21)

Only two influences can modify and uplift the dogmas of natural religion: the pressure of the slowly advancing mores and the periodic illumination of epochal revelation. (92:3.5)
There have been many events of religious revelation but only five of epochal significance. These were as follows: (92:4.4)
# The first was Dalamatia teachings, performed by the 100 corporeal members of Prince Caligastia’s staff (92:4.5)

equality; equal | | inequalities | | OK
the belief that all men are born equal is an erroneous belief, the same as it was an error in European Middle Ages that every man belonged to someone else. Human beings may differ greatly in innate abilities and intellectual endowment (5:1.4) (69:3.8) (70:8.1) (70:9.15)
but in spirit all men are equal (92:7.4)
The weak and the inferior have always contended for equal rights; they have always insisted that the state compel the strong and superior to supply their wants and otherwise make good those deficiencies which all too often are the natural result of their own indifference and indolence. (70:9.16)
The concept of equality never brings peace except in the mutual recognition of some overcontrolling influence of supersovereignty. (134:4.9-10)
Self-assertion was the battle cry of the Lucifer rebellion. One of his chief arguments was that, if self-government was good and right for the Melchizedeks and other groups, it was equally good for all orders of intelligence. He was bold and persistent in the advocacy of the “equality of mind” and “the brotherhood of intelligence.” (53:4.2)
Jesus and equality of men and women
	Jesus was deeply angered by the difference in his time in the religious education of men and women (125:0.4) (125:5.4) (127:1.5)
	The most astonishing and the most revolutionary feature of Michael’s mission on earth was his attitude toward women. In one generation Jesus lifted women out of the disrespectful oblivion and the slavish drudgery of the ages. (149:2.8-9)
	The apostles were at first shocked by, but early became accustomed to, Jesus’ treatment of women; he made it very clear to them that women were to be accorded equal rights with men in the kingdom. (138:8.11) 
	Notwithstanding apostles had many times heard the Master say that “in the kingdom of heaven there is neither rich nor poor, free nor bond, male nor female, all are equally the sons and daughters of God,” they were literally stunned when he proposed formally to commission these ten women as religious teachers and even to permit their traveling about with them. (150:1.3)
	while Jesus refused to make pronouncements dealing with marriage and divorce, he did most bitterly denounce the shameful floutings of the marriage relationship and pointed out their injustice to women and children. He never sanctioned any divorce practice which gave man any advantage over woman; the Master countenanced only those teachings which accorded women equality with men. (167:5.4)
	Woman’s status in Palestine was much improved by Jesus’ teaching. After Pentecost, in the brotherhood of the kingdom woman stood before God on an equality with man. (167:6.4) (194:3.14)

error; Error | | evil; iniquity; mistakes; sin | | OK
The ability to entertain error or experience evil will not be fully lost until the ascending human soul achieves final spirit levels. (132:2.6)
Adam and Eve’s transgression had been an error of judgment and not the sin of conscious and deliberate rebellion. (76:5.1)
Disappointment and sorrow attend upon error because, not being a reality, it cannot be realized in experience. (2:7.6)
Evolutionary man finds it difficult fully to comprehend the significance and to grasp the meanings of evil, error, sin, and iniquity. Man is slow to perceive that contrastive perfection and imperfection produce potential evil; that conflicting truth and falsehood create confusing error (54:0.1)
The mistakes of mortal mind and the errors of human conduct may markedly delay the evolution of the soul, although they cannot inhibit such a morontia phenomenon when once it has been initiated by the indwelling Adjuster with the consent of the creature will. (111:3.1)
memories of past life without spiritual meaning will perish with material brain (112:5.22) (156:5.8)
Error suggests lack of intellectual keenness; evil, deficiency of wisdom; sin, abject spiritual poverty; but iniquity is indicative of vanishing personality control. (67:1.4-5)
dealing with error
	we must be gentle in our dealings with erring mortals (178:1.14)
	Jesus did not attack error or mention the flaws of his disciples, rather embellished the truth they already had (132:0.4)
	living truths drive out all serious error (141:6.2)
	In our lives overthrow error and overcome evil by the love of the living truth. (131:1.7)
	sometimes error is so great that its rectification by revelation would be fatal to those slowly emerging truths which are essential to its experiential overthrow. (48:6.32)
defined as
	error is the inevitable result of the range of choice with which immature creatures must be endowed in order to enjoy universe progression by making freewill contact with reality (118:7.3)
	Misadaptation, disharmony, and conflict, all these things are inherent in evolutionary growth, from physical universes to personal creatures. (105:6.4)
	Error might be regarded as a misconception or distortion of reality. (67:1.4)
	Error is the possibility of choose unwised judgments. The only evolutionary world without error would be a world without free intelligence. (3:5.10,15)
	Error is the shadow of relative incompleteness which must of necessity fall across man’s ascending universe path to Paradise perfection. (130:4.11)
biggest error
	There is no error greater than that species of self-deception which leads intelligent beings to crave the exercise of power over other beings for the purpose of depriving these persons of their natural liberties. (54:1.6-9)

Eskimos; Eskimo | | | RACE | OK
origin
	The Lapps and the Eskimos are blends of Andonite and Sangik-blue races. (81:4.9)
	they are descendants of Foxhall peoples. The Foxhall peoples were farthest west and succeeded in retaining much of the Andonic culture; they also preserved their knowledge of flintworking, which they transmitted to their descendants, the ancient ancestors of the Eskimos. (64:2.5,7)
	Eskimos are sole survivors of Urantia aborigines. Early Andonites more nearly resembled the present-day Eskimo than any other type of living human beings (61:6.3) (63:4.1) (65:2.7) (70:1.2) (81:4.9)
	About five thousand years ago a chance meeting occurred between an Indian tribe and a lone Eskimo group on the southeastern shores of Hudson Bay. (64:7.19) (79:5.7,9)
mores
	The ancients always sacrificed the mother’s interests for the welfare of the child; an Eskimo mother even yet licks her baby in lieu of washing. (84:7.10)
	Eskimo children thrive on so little discipline and correction simply because they are naturally docile little animals; the children of both the red and the yellow men are almost equally tractable. (84:7.21)
	The Eskimos of today still leave the penalty for a crime, even for murder, to be decreed and administered by the family wronged. (70:10.11)
	The Eskimos and early Andonites seldom were cannibalistic except in times of famine. (89:5.4)
Beliefs
	The Eskimos believe that man has three parts: body, soul, and name. (86:5.17)
	The Eskimos still believe that the soul stays with the body three days. (87:2.3)
	the Eskimos still conceive that everything in nature has a spirit. (86:5.1)
	The Andonites were early taught the golden rule, and, even today, their Eskimo descendants live very much by that code; custom is strong among them, and they are fairly free from violent antagonisms. (70:1.2)
	The comparatively recent Eskimos and Amerinds had very meager concepts of God; they believed in ghosts and had an indefinite idea of survival of some sort after death. (92:6.1)

The presence of the Adjuster in the mind of man constitutes the revelation promise and the faith pledge of an eternal existence of divine progression (132:3.9)
the attainment of immortality is achieved with the fusion with our Adjuster.

(110:7)
The Creator Sons in the Deity association of God the Sevenfold provide the mechanism whereby the mortal becomes immortal and the finite attains the embrace of the infinite. (0:8.11) (180:3.7)
That the way which leads to eternal life is straight and narrow, that the door which leads thereto is likewise narrow so that, of those who seek salvation, few can find entrance through this door. But even if the door to the way of life is narrow, it is wide enough to admit all who sincerely seek to enter, for Jesus is that door. (166:3.3)
The life after death is no different in the essentials than the mortal existence. (103:5.7)
the morontia soul, being superadjutant, does not retain self-consciousness without the Adjuster when deprived of the material-mind mechanism (112:6.7)
no misbehavior by others can ever jeopardize one’s eternal prospects (54:6.4)
No personal creature can be coerced into the eternal adventure; the portal of eternity opens only in response to the freewill choice of the freewill sons of the God of free will. (5:6.8,12)

	Eternal life is the endless quest for infinite values. (100:2.5)

There are one billion and were created by Trinity. Each of them directs one of Havona spheres (14:3.3) (14:5.6,9) (18:2.1)
each embellishes his sphere according to own original plans (14:5.6) (18:2.3-4)
Eternals of Days are not creators, but they are perfect administrators. (14:3.3)
Forever have Eternal of Days and Secrets of Supremacy ruled their exquisite worlds of the Paradise-Havona system, and they function without rotation or reassignment. (18:2.1)
they appear in personality registers as the Stationary Sons of the Trinity (30:1.9) (30:2.24)
most superuniverse personnel apprenticed under the Eternals of Days on the various worlds of the perfect Havona universe. (18:4.6)
When an Eternal of Days is absent from his sphere, his world is directed by a Trinity Teacher Son. (18:2.2)
The Eternals of Days are visible to all will creatures dwelling in their domains. (18:2.2)

conception of eternity
	circular simultaneity, not linear sequence. That which formerly appeared as a succession of events then will be viewed as a whole and perfectly related cycle; in this way will circular simultaneity increasingly displace the onetime consciousness of the linear sequence of events. (130:7.5)
	it is more fitting to conceive of eternity as a cycle and the eternal purpose as an endless circle, a cycle of eternity in some way synchronized with the transient material cycles of time (32:5.4-5)
	it is needed to concede human philosophy a point of origin; even personalities far above the human level require a concept of “beginnings.” Nevertheless, the Paradise-Havona system is eternal. (6:0.2,4) (14:4.10)
	In the evolutionary universes eternity is temporal everlastingness—the everlasting now. (118:1.1)
	time-space creatures cannot comprehend eternity (32:5.6) (116:2.3)

ether | | | | OK
The so-called ether is merely a collective name to designate a group of force and energy activities occurring in space. (42:5.14-16)
Primordial-force behavior does give rise to phenomena which are in many ways analogous to your postulated ether. Space is not empty; the spheres of all space whirl and plunge on through a vast ocean of outspread force-energy; neither is the space content of an atom empty. Nevertheless there is no ether, and the very absence of this hypothetical ether enables the inhabited planet to escape falling into the sun and the encircling electron to resist falling into the nucleus. (42:5.16)
Light is a real substance, not simply waves of hypothetical ether. (15:6.13)
not all the suppositions of natural philosophy are valid; for example, the hypothetical ether, which represents an ingenious attempt of man to unify his ignorance of space phenomena. (42:9.4)
the Unqualified Absolute is not an undifferentiated and all-pervading influence comparable either to the pantheistic concepts of metaphysics or to the sometime ether hypothesis of science (0:11.9)

ethics; Ethic; Ethics; ethical | | morality | | OK
All relationships and the application of ethics grow out of the fundamental facts of origin. (28:6.2)
Static ethics and traditional morality are just slightly superanimal. Ethics and morals become truly human when they are dynamic and progressive, alive with universe reality. (12:5.10)
human ethics and the natural consciousness of relative right and wrong were born from the concepts of the appeasement of ever-displeased spirits (86:6.7)
Religion has handicapped social development in many ways, but without religion there would have been no enduring morality nor ethics, no worth-while civilization. (92:3.6-8) (101:0.2)
Civilization is in danger when youth neglect to interest themselves in ethics, sociology, eugenics, philosophy, the fine arts, religion, and cosmology. (111:4.4)
The evolutionary mind is able to discover law, morals, and ethics (196:3.26)
the ethical conscience and the moral consciousness is indispensable to human progress and survival (101:3.1)
man’s understanding of ethics is only relatively true (115:1.2)
Secrecy, insincerity, and hypocrisy may obscure sex problems, but they do not provide solutions, nor do they advance ethics. (82:1.10)
Man’s acquirement of ethical judgment, moral will, is usually coincident with the appearance of early language. (52:1.6)
defined as
	Ethic sensitivity is the sense of the eternal fitness of Deity relations with all beings (56:10.8)
	Ethics is the eternal social or racial mirror that faithfully reflects the otherwise unobservable progress of internal spiritual and religious developments. (102:8.4)
	To love one's neighbor as oneself is the highest ethics. (170:3.6)
	Ethical obligations are innate, divine, and universal. (54:4.4)
	the ethics of Paradise relationships are neither meaningless formalities nor the dictations of artificial castes but rather the inherent proprieties (27:4.1)
	Ethical awareness is simply the recognition by any individual of the rights inherent in the existence of any and all other individuals. (27:3.1) (92:7.5)
	ethics is the necessity for recognizing that the world and the universe are filled with a multitude of differing types of beings, and all of this magnificent creation, including ourselves, was not made just for us. (28:6.18)
	group ethics is the secret of pleasant and profitable interrelationship between the various universe and superuniverse orders of intelligent personalities. (43:8.3)

	Jesus never concerned with ethics as such. He was wholly concerned with that inward and spiritual fellowship with God the Father which so certainly and directly manifests itself as outward and loving service for man. (170:3.8-9)
	Greek philosophy, coupled with Paul’s theology, still forms the basis of European ethics. (98:7.10)

Etruscan priesthood | | | RELIGION | OK
In the great monotheistic renaissance of Melchizedek’s gospel during the sixth century before Christ, too few of the Salem missionaries penetrated Italy, and those who did were unable to overcome the influence of the rapidly spreading Etruscan priesthood with its new galaxy of gods and temples, all of which became organized into the Roman state religion. (98:3.2)

eugenics | (82:6) | genetics; handicaps; races | | OK
Civilization is in danger when youth neglect to interest themselves in ethics, sociology, eugenics, philosophy, the fine arts, religion, and cosmology. (111:4.4)
It is the false sentiment of our partially perfected civilizations that fosters, protects, and perpetuates the hopelessly defective strains of evolutionary human stocks. (52:2.11-12) (99:3.5)
in the most developed continental nation of a neighboring planet, the feeble-minded are committed in colonies and cannot reproduce, slavery has been abolished a hundred years ago and the least capable slaves has been deported, and breeding is prohibited for criminals and defectives (72:4.2) (72:5.2) (72:10.1,3)
there are mortals who are virtually disqualified for survival by disinheritance through the agency of unfit and inferior ancestors (109:3.8)
Adamic age usually witnesses the completion of the elimination of the unfit and the still further purification of the racial strains (52:3.4)
Present-day prejudice against “half-castes,” “hybrids,” and “mongrels” arises because modern racial crossbreeding is, for the greater part, between the grossly inferior strains of the races concerned. (82:6.3)
dangers of an excess of inferior stocks
	Greek culture perished due to imported slaves of the Danubian (80:7.6)
	matings between inferior strata diminish creativity (82:6.5)
	poverty and dependence can never be eliminated if the defective and degenerate stocks are freely supported and permitted to reproduce without restraint. (71:3.8)
recommended societal actions
	The progressive program of an expanding civilization embraces race improvement (71:4.11)
	If the present-day races of Urantia could be freed from the curse of their lowest strata of deteriorated, antisocial, feeble-minded, and outcast specimens, there would be little objection to a limited race amalgamation. (70:9.14) (82:6.4-7)
	an all-important work is eliminating defectives and degenerates from among human strains (52:2.9-12) (64:1.8) (70:8.14-18) (75:1.1-2) (79:2.4-8) (79:4.2) (82:6.11)
	we ought to be able to agree upon the biologic disfellowshiping of our more markedly unfit, defective, degenerate, and antisocial stocks. (51:4.8) (52:5.9)
	The continued improvement of a race throughout the era of light and life is largely a matter of the selective reproduction of those racial strains which exhibit superior qualities of a social, philosophic, cosmic, and spiritual nature. Reproduction is regulated and and couples from lower groups can only procreate half as much as higher couples (55:4.11) (55:6.3)
	The difficulty of executing such a radical program on Urantia consists in the absence of competent judges to pass upon the biologic fitness or unfitness of the individuals of your world races. (51:4.8)
	Civilizations of great promise have successively deteriorated and have finally been extinguished by the folly of allowing the superior freely to procreate with the inferior. (64:1.8)
	The subnormal man should be kept under society’s control and normal man should be fostered (68:6.11)
	it would not prove beneficial for the higher strains of Urantia mortals to mate with the lower races (51:5.7)
	In a general way, man’s evolutionary destiny is in his own hands, and scientific intelligence must sooner or later supersede the random functioning of uncontrolled natural selection and chance survival. (65:3.6)
	unfit should be eliminated before a racial blending (51:4.8)
deplorable means
	During the previous hunting era the superior tribes had intermarried with the higher types of war captives and had unvaryingly destroyed those whom they deemed inferior. (80:3.9)
	the Andonites of Badonan, the Adamites, and the Andites all started wars of extermination of the inferior races. The Andonites exterminated their half-animal neighbors and formed the Neanderthal race. The Adamites exterminated the Neanderthals and formed the Cro-Magnon race. The Andites subsequently exterminated the Cro-Magnon blue men. (64:3.5) (80:1.7) (80:5.5-6)
	Although war must be abandoned when civilization progresses, ancient wars led to the decimation of inferior peoples. Modern warfare does the opposite and destroys the best human stocks (70:2.3-9)
	The early races often resorted to practices designed to restrict population; all primitive tribes killed deformed and sickly children. (68:6.8)
	never did the barter in sex slaves advance society; such traffic was and is a racial disgrace, for at one and the same time it hindered the development of family life and polluted the biologic fitness of superior peoples. (69:5.10)

	Europe and Africa began to rise out of the Pacific depths (57:8.21)
	360,000,000 years ago Western Europe and the British Isles were emerging, except parts of Wales, which were deeply submerged. (59:1.17)
	350,000,000 years ago in Europe no great changes are marked because the land fluctuations were less, while the volcanic action was more persistent. 340,000,000 years ago  large portions of the American continents and Europe began to emerge from the water. 320,000,000 years ago a new inundation occurred in Europe (59:2.2-6)
	A great volcanic activity of this age was in the European sector. Violent earthquakes took place in northern Europe, notably in Scotland. (59:3.2,6)
	Five million years later the land areas Europe were briefly inundated. 260,000,000 years ago extensive coral reefs were created in northern Europe. Later an uplift formed a stratum of Devonian red sandstone in Europe. very much of western Europe, including the British Isles, was submerged. In Wales, Germany, and other places in Europe the Devonian rocks are 20,000 feet thick. As the land rose, North America became connected with Europe by land bridges extending to Greenland. 240,000,000 years ago the land over parts of both Europe and North and South America began to sink. (59:4.5-15)
	210,000,000 years ago the warm-water arctic seas covered most of North America and Europe. Carboniferous age deposits also occurred in Europe. In some parts of North America and Europe the coal-bearing strata are 18,000 feet in thickness. This epoch witnessed the beginning of the Vosges, Black Forest, and Ural mountains. Stumps of other and older mountains are to be found all over Great Britain and Europe. 180,000,000 years ago brought the close of the Carboniferous period in Europe. (59:5.4,10-20)
	Africa once connected Europe to South America (59:5.11)
	It was soon after the arrival of these prereptilian frogs that North America was temporarily isolated, cut off from Europe, Asia, and South America. (59:6.8)

	100,000,000 years ago the North American continent and a part of Europe were well above water. 95,000,000 years ago the American and European land masses again began to sink. Great volcanic actions occurred south of the Alps. 90,000,000 years ago, angiosperms spread throughout Europe. Large deposits of chalk were produced. 65,000,000 years ago there occurred one of the greatest lava flows of all time and affected Europe. Most of Europe was under water. (60:3.4-17)
	The oldest mountains of the world are located in Asia, Greenland, and northern Europe (60:4.3)
	40,000,000 years ago most of Europe was submerged at the end of this time and large amounts of foraminiferous limestone were deposited (61:1.12-13)
	Greenland connected Europe to North America (59:5.20) (61:1.12)
	15,000,000 years ago the mountain regions of Eurasia were rising, and there was some volcanic activity throughout these regions (61:3.7)
	10,000,000 years ago began an age of widespread local land deposits. Much of Europe, at this time, was still under water, including parts of England, Belgium, and France (61:4.2)
	By the close of the Pliocene the lands of the north-eastern part of North America and of northern Europe were highly elevatedThroughout the glacial period, landslides occurred in Europe. In Europe the ice at various times covered the British Isles excepting the coast of southern England, and it overspread western Europe down to France. In Europe the fifth invasion of the ice was not so extensive as the preceding one. (61:5.1-4,7) (61:7.1,5)
	The Neanderthalers gradually spread in Europe. 800,000 years ago game was abundant; many species of deer, as well as elephants and hippopotamuses, roamed over Europe. 750,000 years ago the fourth ice sheet was well on its way south. Neanderthalers  retreated before the advancing ice (64:4.1-5)
	700,000 years ago the fourth glacier, the greatest of all in Europe, was in recession; men and animals were returning north. The climate was cool and moist, and primitive man again thrived in Europe and western Asia. Mammalian life again rapidly spread out over all Europe.600,000 years ago the ice had receded its maximum and the men and animals of Europe changed very little. (64:4.6-9)

	the blue race invaded Europe and there they expelled the Neanderthal Andonites they found (64:7.3,8-10) (78:1.5)
	blue race was most adventurous of colored races in Europe (78:1.8)
	Adamites and Andites entered Europe in their migrations. The first Adamic migrations in Europe ended in 15,000 BC. The last three Andite waves occurred between 8,000 and 6,000 BC. and most of it entered Europe (77:5.10) (78:3.2,5) (78:6.2) (80:1.4-5) (80:9.5)
	Europe received more Andite inheritance than rest of world. By 12,000 B.C. three quarters of the Andite stock of the world was resident in northern and eastern Europe (78:5.4) (80:5.1)
	As the period of the early Adamic migrations ended, about 15,000 B.C., there were already more descendants of Adam in Europe and central Asia than anywhere else in the world, even than in Mesopotamia. In southern Europe there was a mixed race of Andonites and Sangiks with some Adamite. (78:3.5)
	By 5,000 B.C. the three purest strains of Adam’s descendants were in Sumeria, northern Europe, and Greece. (80:7.9)

eventuation is the process by which transcendental beings are brought into existence. These “eventuators” are neither finite nor infinite—they are absonite; and absonity is neither infinity nor absoluteness. (30:1.92-99)
These eventuated beings include the following orders:
# The Architects of the Master Universe.
# Transcendental Recorders.
# Other Transcendentalers.
# Primary Eventuated Master Force Organizers.
# Associate Transcendental Master Force Organizers.
These Transcendentalers create no beings, neither were they ever created. In speaking of their origin, in order to avoid using a new term—an arbitrary and meaningless designation—we deem it best to say that Transcendentalers simply eventuate.(31:8.3)
On Paradise there is a tradition that far back in eternity there was attempted the eventuation of the 28,012th Master Architect, but that this being failed to absonitize, experiencing personality seizure by the Universal Absolute.(31:9.10)

Adjusters are the watchful workers who pilot the God-conscious human mind away from the shoals of evil while expertly guiding the evolving soul of man toward the divine harbors of perfection on far-distant and eternal shores. (110:1.2)
Almost every human being has some one thing which is held on to as a pet evil, and which the entrance into the kingdom of heaven requires as a part of the price of admission. (163:2.7)
While religion produces growth of meanings and enhancement of values, evil always results when purely personal evaluations are elevated to the levels of absolutes. (19:1.4) (100:1.1)

	# To suffer evil without complaint and without resistance—the purely negative method.
	# To return good for evil, to assert the will so as to become master of the situation, to overcome evil with good—the positive and righteous method.

	when Jesus said, “Resist not evil,” he later explained that he did not mean to condone sin or to counsel fraternity with iniquity. He intended the more to teach forgiveness, to “resist not evil treatment of one’s personality, evil injury to one’s feelings of personal dignity. ” (141:3.8) (180:5.9)
	we must overcome then evil with good (130:2.4) (131:1.7) (131:3.6) (133:7.12) (140:6.9) (156:5.5) (159:5.10) (194:3.11)

	As we view the world, we must remember that the black patches of evil which we see are shown against a white background of ultimate good. (195:5.12)
	Socrates and his successors, Plato and Aristotle, taught that virtue is knowledge; goodness, health of the soul; that it is better to suffer injustice than to be guilty of it, that it is wrong to return evil for evil, and that the gods are wise and good. (98:2.6)
	Evil is inherent in the natural order of this world. An spiritual rebirth is essential to deliverance from evil (148:4.6,8)
	When there exists no open door for the reception of evil, there exists no opportunity for the entertainment of sin. (43:4.9)
defined as
	Evil is the immature choosing and the unthinking misstep of those who are resistant to goodness, rejectful of beauty, and disloyal to truth. Evil is only the misadaptation of immaturity or the disruptive and distorting influence of ignorance. Evil is the inevitable darkness which follows upon the heels of the unwise rejection of light. Evil is that which is dark and untrue, and which, when consciously embraced and willfully endorsed, becomes sin. (3:5.15) (130:1.5)
	evil representes the wrong way to achieve righteous ends, because it departed from the right way, the divine plan. (75:4.6)
	Only sin is isolated and evil gravity resisting on the mental and spiritual levels. (56:10.14)
	It is the misuse, distortion, and perversion of the finite that gives origin to evil and sin. (111:6.3)
	Evil is likewise the measure of the imperfectness of obedience to the Father’s will. (130:4.11) (148:4.3)
	evil is inevitable if creature is to be free (3:5.13) (54:3.1) (75:8.6-7) (130:4.13-15) (132:2.10)
	Undiluted evil, complete error, willful sin, and unmitigated iniquity are inherently and automatically suicidal. (2:3.5)
	evil originates in imperfection (105:6.4)
	Evil is a partial realization of, or maladjustment to, universe realities. (67:1.4) (75:4.3)
	Evil is a partiality of creativity which tends toward disintegration and eventual destruction. (111:4.11)
	Man is slow to perceive that contrastive perfection and imperfection produce potential evil (54:0.1-2)
	potential evil is the remoteness from divinity. (3:6.2)
	It is evil to see sin where there is no sin; to see no sin where there is sin. (131:3.3)
	evil, real and potential, is an stimulative of the choosing between truth and error, good and evil, sin and righteousness. (55:3.10)
	Error suggests lack of intellectual keenness; evil, deficiency of wisdom; sin, abject spiritual poverty; but iniquity is indicative of vanishing personality control. (67:1.4-5)
	Evil is a transgression of law, not a violation of the rules of conduct pertaining to life, which is the law. (48:6.33)
Jesus
	Jesus prayer says: deliver us from evil (144:5.18)
	Jesus warned the Jews against choosing to become children of evil (162:7.3)
	Jesus was a man of high ideals, and that he abhorred everything which partook of uncleanness or savored of evi (133:3.6)
	He refrained from placing emphasis on evil by forbidding it, while he exalted the good by commanding its performance. (127:4.2) (140:8.21) (195:5.13)
	Jesus had little to say about the social vices of his day; seldom did he make reference to moral delinquency. (140:8.21)
	 Jesus’ death on the cross exemplifies a love which is sufficiently strong and divine to forgive sin and swallow up all evil-doing. (188:5.2)
	Jesus of Nazareth refused to compromise with evil, much less to consort with sin. (136:8.8)
	He would not serve evil that the worship of God might presumably be derived therefrom. (136:9.3)
result of evil
	The good effort of each man benefits all men; the error or evil of each man augments the tribulation of all men. (12:7.11)
	evil proceeds from heart defiles (153:3.5)
	A sense of proportion is also concerned in the exercise of virtue because evil may be perpetrated when the lesser is chosen in the place of the greater as a result of distortion or deception. (16:7.7)
	escaping duty, we go under control of evil (130:1.2)
	While it is all too true that good cannot come of evil to the one who contemplates and performs evil, it is equally true that all things, including evil, potential and manifest, work together for good to all beings who know God, love to do his will, and are ascending Paradiseward according to his eternal plan and divine purpose. (54:4.7)
	Pain and sorrow follow in the path of evil as the dust follows the wind. (131:3.3)
	Even the evildoer enjoys a season of grace before the time of the full ripening of his evil deeds, but inevitably there must come the full harvest of evil-doing. (2:3.5) (54:4.5) (131:3.5)

Although Christianized for over 1,500 years, these Bretons still retain charms of the New Stone Age for warding off the evil eye. (80:9.14)
Human prosperity was supposed to be especially provocative of the envy of evil spirits, and their method of retaliation was to strike back through a human agency and by the technique of the evil eye. The Koran contains a whole chapter devoted to the evil eye (87:5.4-5)
And intelligent human beings still believe in good luck, the evil eye, and astrology. (88:6.7)
The whole phallic cult grew up as a defense against the evil eye. (87:5.5)
Many primitive peoples believed the soul looked out upon the world through human eyes; therefore did they so cravenly fear the malevolence of the evil eye. (111:0.7)
primitives thought much sickness caused by evil eye (90:3.7)
The monotheists keep their subordinate gods as spirits, demons, fates, Nereids, fairies, brownies, dwarfs, banshees, and the evil eye. (96:1.14)

	The Urantia midwayers have assembled over 50,000 facts of physics and chemistry which prove that evolution is not accidental (58:2.3-5)
	Physics and chemistry alone cannot explain how a human being evolved out of the primeval seaweed (65:2.1) (65:6.8)
	Biologic evolution and cultural civilization are not necessarily correlated; organic evolution in any age may proceed unhindered in the very midst of cultural decadence. (81:5.1)
	missing links never existed between the great divisions of the animal kingdom nor between the highest of the prehuman animal types and the dawn men of the human races (58:6.2-3)
	sin, Caligastia rebellion, Adam’s default, did very little to delay biologic evolution, but it did operate to deprive the mortal races of the full benefit of the Adamic inheritance. (67:0.1) (67:7.6) (73:0.1) (78:1.1) (81:0.1)
	Jesus did not interfere with the normal and orderly progressive evolution of the Urantia races (120:3.5)
	there is no organic evolution on Jerusem, there are no conflicting forms of life, no struggle for existence, no survival of the fittest. (46:2.5)

		It is the integrated functioning of the Life Carriers, the physical controllers, and the spirit adjutants that conditions the course of organic evolution on the inhabited worlds. And this is why evolution—on Urantia or elsewhere—is always purposeful and never accidental. (65:0.7)
		Under the supervision of the Melchizedek receivers, Van and Amadon continued the work of fostering the natural evolution of the human race, carrying forward the physical evolution of man until it reached that culminating attainment which warranted the dispatch of a Material Son and Daughter to Urantia. (67:6.7)
	plant evolution
		In the development of planetary life the vegetable form always precedes the animal and is quite fully developed before the animal patterns differentiate. (49:1.5)
		inland seas were cradle of evolution (57:8.24-26) (58:1.7)
		Man’s primordial ancestors were literally the slime and ooze of the ocean bed (65:2.1)
		Sponge-like organisms are the early intermediate types through which the gradual transition from plant to animal occurred. (65:2.2)
		While some new species are progressing, certain strains remain stationary and others gravitate backward, reverting to a former state. (60:2.10)
		Bacteria and fungi are a retrograde movement in plant evolution (65:2.3)
		Amoebas and protozoa are a retrograde movement in animal evolution (65:2.4)
		most important steps regarding plants were chlorophyll-making and seeds (65:6.3)
	animal evolution
		Before long the early single-celled animal types associated themselves in communities, first on the plan of the Volvox and presently along the lines of the Hydra and jellyfish. Still later there evolved the starfish, stone lilies, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, centipedes, insects, spiders, crustaceans, and the closely related groups of earthworms and leeches, soon followed by the mollusks (65:2.5)
		The stage was thus set for the appearance of the first backboned animals, the fishes. The frog is one of the earliest of surviving human-race ancestors (65:2.6-7)
		The frogs gave rise to the Reptilia, a great animal family which is virtually extinct, but which, before passing out of existence, gave origin to the whole bird family and the numerous orders of mammals. Probably the greatest single leap of all prehuman evolution was executed when the reptile became a bird.(65:2.8-9)
		First herbivorous dinosaurs developed a protective armor. As times passed  brains and agility had replaced armor and size in the progress of animal survival. (60:1.10) (60:2.11,14) (60:3.21) (61:2.5)
		Mice reproduce much more rapidly than elephants, yet elephants evolve more rapidly than mice. (49:1.6)
	human evolution
		We can hardly realize by what narrow margins our prehuman ancestors missed extinction from time to time. (62:3.9)
		the two unique features on Urantia were appearance of Andonic race prior to colored peoples and appearance in a single family of six colored races (64:6.1-2) (65:4.7)
		In Urantia it was intended to produce an early manifestation of will in the evolutionary life, and it was a success. Ordinarily, will does not emerge until the colored races have long been in existence, usually first appearing among the superior types of the red man. Urantia is the only planet in Satania where the human type of will has appeared in a precolored race. (65:4.11)
		Adam’s contribution to the biologic status of the races, notwithstanding the partial failure of the undertaking, enormously upstepped the people of Urantia. (51:0.3) (75:8.1-2) (78:1.1)
		Long before the Material Son and Daughter, the biologic uplifters, arrive on a planet, the human potentials of the evolving animal species have been exhausted. (65:2.13-14) (65:3.5-6)
		Now the human species is slowly gravitating toward twenty-eight. The process of evolution is still actively and adaptatively in progress on this planet. (65:6.5)
	Life Carriers
		evolution is limited by potentials of original Life Carrier implantations (118:8.1)
		During the ages intervening between life establishment and the emergence of human creatures of moral status, the Life Carriers are permitted to manipulate the life environment and otherwise favorably directionize the course of biologic evolution. (36:3.7-8)
		they are not allowed arbitrarily to interfere with life patterns once set in operation (65:3.1-2)
	theory of biologic evolution
		The original life plasm of an evolutionary world must contain the full potential for all future developmental variations and for all subsequent evolutionary changes and modifications. The provision for such far-reaching projects of life metamorphosis may require the appearance of many apparently useless forms of animal and vegetable life. (36:2.17)
		the appearance of primitive man on earth during the ice age was not just an accident; it was by design to produce a hardy type of human. (65:2.16)
		Evolution can be delayed but it cannot be stopped. (81:0.1)
		evolution also cannot be accelerated beyond what planet permits (65:8.2)
		It is the presence of the seven adjutant mind-spirits on the primitive worlds that conditions the course of organic evolution; that explains why evolution is purposeful and not accidental. (36:5.1) (65:6.7-10)
		in some evolutive periods it is eliminated all life without survival value (59:6.10)
		The whole principle of biologic evolution makes it impossible for primitive man to appear on the inhabited worlds with any large endowment of self-restraint. (118:8.5)
		individuals lacking parental instinct eliminate themselves from reproductive stream (84:7.7)
		Material Sons are dispatched when human biologic evolution attains highest level (39:5.3) (49:5.24)
		only organisms attaining cosmic unity persist (58:6.8)
		organisms accommodate themselves to never-ending fluctuations (58:6.6) (65:6.7)
		evolution is subject to sudden changes. From era to era radically new species of animal life arise. The sudden appearance of new species and diversified orders of living organisms is wholly biologic, strictly natural. There is nothing supernatural connected with these genetic mutations. Sudden appearances have been: (58:6.2-4) (65:8.6)
		# the ameba (65:2.4) 
		# first multicellular animals (59:1.4)
		# trilobites and scorpions (59:3.5,11)
		# fishes and ferns (59:4.3,10,13)
		# first amphibians and frogs (59:5.5,23)
		# reptiles (60:1.9)
		# land plants, flowering plants and birds (60:3.7,19,22)
		# first mammal (61:1.2)
		# first hoofed mammal (61:2.8)
		# human dawn mammals, mid-mammals, Primates and humans (61:6.1-2) (62:2.1,6) (62:3.10) (62:4.6)
		# the six colored races (61:7.4) (64:5.2)
		Early evolution is characterized by the survival of the biologically fit (71:5.3)
		Variety is indispensable to opportunity for the wide functioning of natural selection, differential survival of superior strains. (64:6.31)

	process is under perfect control of universe Creators (3:2.2)
	evolution process varies greatly but is orderly and controlled (49:1.4,7)
	Evolution does not at once produce superlative perfection but rather comparative and advancing practical adjustment. (71:2.8)
	Progress towards harmonious unity, a growing experiential synthesis superimposed on an ever-increasing complexity of relationships, could be effected only by a purposive and dominant mind. (42:11.7)
	many groups accepted this story of man’s clay origin by some form of special creation in the place of the earlier beliefs in progressive creation—evolution. (15:6.7) (74:8.4-5) (105:6.5)
	Throughout all these millenniums Providence has been working out the plan of progressive evolution. (4:1.2)

	Evolution may be slow, but it is terribly effective. (66:6.5) (81:1.3) (81:6.1) (86:7.6) (90:3.10) (95:1.8)
	The Master Force Organizers go out into space and mobilize its energies to become gravity responsive to the Paradise pull of the Universal Father; and subsequently there come the Creator Sons, who organize these gravity-responding forces into inhabited universes and therein evolve intelligent creatures who receive unto themselves the spirit of the Paradise Father and subsequently ascend to the Father to become like him in all possible divinity attributes. (56:9.12-13)
	The ability of animals to adapt themselves to air, water, and land is not a supernatural endowment, but it is a superphysical adjustment. (65:6.7)

	celestial evolution is the business of transmuting the potentials of man the temporal into the actuality and divinity of man the eternal, a Paradise finaliter. (103:7.2)
	The slowness of evolution, of human cultural progress, testifies to the effectiveness of that brake—material inertia—which so efficiently operates to retard dangerous velocities of progress. (118:8.6)
	external restraints of hunger and fear circumscribe subspiritual choice range (118:8.5)
	Jesus was a progressive evolutionist (149:2.11)
	Man is gradually backing into the truth, beginning in error, progressing in error, and finally attaining the threshold of truth. (88:4.5)
	Social inheritance enables man to stand on the shoulders of all who have preceded him, and who have contributed aught to the sum of culture and knowledge. (79:8.12) (81:6.23,25,44) (160:2.3)
	When physical conditions are ripe, sudden mental evolutions may take place (65:8.6) (170:4.14)
	Many of the essential factors in man’s evolution have been highly expensive, have cost vast treasure in effort, sacrifice, and self-denial, but these achievements of self-control were the real rungs on which man climbed civilization’s ascending ladder. (89:1.7)
	In the forests man has always deteriorated; human evolution has made progress only in the open and in the higher latitudes. (64:1.3) (81:6.7)
	society is product of ages of trial and error (81:6.41,44)
