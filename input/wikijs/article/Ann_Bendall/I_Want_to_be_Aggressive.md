Once upon a time, before I read *The Urantia Book*, I thought being aggressive was being decidedly anti-social. The dictionary said aggressive people were “quarrelsome or belligerent.” I agreed with them. Gosh the women's movement was screaming that the whole problem with the world was men and their aggression—their aggressive tendencies! We women heaved a sigh of relief that we were not so cursed (despite research which begs to differ—women are just as aggressive as men, if provoked. However, it appears lots of men are just naturally aggressive and can easily imagine provocation has occurred, if the urge to be aggressive comes on strong).

I was pleased to be a lady, and not have any of these aggressive tendencies. And anyway, when highly provoked, I was not aggressive, I was assertive! I denied totally having both an unlady like trait as well as an un-Christian trait.

And so I, dedicatedly, with my dictionary by my side, have delighted in the joy of reading *The Urantia Book* many, many times. I have been so careful to read each word so very precisely, checking in the dictionary if in doubt. Of course I know most of the words, and so do not need to refer to the dictionary very much. I know words like ego means egotist —everyone knows that. I know words like mind are roughly the same as intellect for after all the intellect is in the mind; and anyway the revelators wanted the book to be entertaining reading, as well as in accordance with excellent literary standards for written prose. It is taboo to repeat the same word in the one sentence, so mind and intellect are interchangeable! The poor revelators! It was on about the fourth reading of *The Blue Book* that I decided to check my logic by a quick look at the dictionary. Those clever guys! Intellect is not at all the same as mind. It is a part of the of the mind—the rational thought functions of the mind; the capacity for understanding, thinking, and reasoning as distinct from feeling or wishing. Also it appears that mind embraces, in addition, intention (will) and feelings/emotions.

But of course, we all know the meaning of the word aggressive. So I became a little upset when I discovered a typing error in *The Urantia Book*! Surely someone had made a mistake by referring to Elijah as aggressive [UB 97:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p3_5). Actually there were a few typing errors. Missionaries were referred to as aggressive and so was Paul aggressive.[UB 128:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p3_6) Perhaps where Paul is concerned this might not be a typing error, as he was pretty disparaging towards females.

When I reached the life of Jesus, either the typing errors increased or something was truly amiss in the portrayal of Jesus. Practically from the moment he was born he was classified as aggressive. It was a bit of a shock to me, until I appreciated that this trait was inherited from his mother.[UB 122:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p7_2) But I thought women were not supposed to be aggressive, so Mary must have been provoked an awful lot in her life. Jesus was unfortunate enough to acquire this gene.

Having read of the problems of the Life Carriers and there not being enough blue blood on Urantia, I was very wise on the genetic problems on this planet. After all there is a lot of work to be done in this area, and Mary and Joseph were picked as the best parents for Jesus, but no one claimed they had a perfect genetic pattern. And I must confess, Jesus did make a mess of the temple that time. I really wished they had not said that Jesus was aggressive. They said it too many times in *The Blue Book* for me to ignore ([UB 123:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p4_8); [UB 124:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_4); [UB 127:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p1_3); [UB 132:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p4_4); [UB 139:8.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p8_7)).

And so the above was my story. I felt quite sure Jesus got over it once he got back to Nebadon. A classic “me” example of not dedicatedly reading *The Urantia Book* exactly and precisely as it is written.

One day I was reading a book called “Brain Sex”, and bells started to ring as I read:

> You can remove every obstacle in the path of success, but you cannot ensure that people will actually choose to follow that path; you can encourage aspiration but you cannot inject ambition.
> 
> Success at any venture usually demands a mixture of talent and *aggression*, a rare enough combination. Most men don't have it—very few are talented enough to be a top scientist. Most women don't have the elusive combination either; and they are differentially handicapped by the fact that those sex differences which may give them an abundance of talent do not, on average, also endow them with the aggression and ambition for its ultimate fulfilment.[^1]

*Jesus had these traits they referred to!* He was the most talented person to ever walk this earth. He was aggressive, I know because *The Urantia Book* told me—he was consistently aggressive right from the time he was a child! Thomas admired him because, amongst many tilings, he was “so pure and innocent but at the same time so virile, aggressive, and forceful”. [UB 139:8.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p8_7) He had ambition. With the combination of talent, aggression, ambition (plus hundreds/thousands of other qualities, not to mention his beautiful personality), he was the most successful man this world has and will ever know.

I was on an aircraft at the time. That wretched aircraft took a painfully long time to arrive at my home city. The very first thing I went to when I arrived home?—the dictionary. And if it didn't tell me something really nice about this aggressive trait then it was useless, and I had better buy a different one. Sure enough after, the “not nice” definition are these definitions—forceful; self-assertive; assertive.

And so now I want to try very hard to be aggressive as Jesus is, and the way to do this? You guessed—follow Jesus! His Spirit of Truth will show me how:

> . . . The spirit of the Master’s injunction consists in the nonresistance of all selfish reaction to the universe, coupled with the aggressive and progressive attainment of righteous levels of true spirit values: divine beauty, infinite goodness, and eternal truth—to know God and to become increasingly like him.[^2]

> . . . The spiritual forward urge is the most powerful driving force present in this world; the truth-learning believer is the one progressive and aggressive soul on earth.[^3]

I do not envisage any difficulties on Jesus'/Michael's part because I am female. We have figured out that the simplest way is for me to provoke myself into truth-seeking—all day, every day.
