## What is?

[Urantiapedia](https://urantiapedia.org) is a web for publishing, sharing and collaborate in any content related to [The Urantia Book](https://www.urantia.org/).

---

## How it works?

It is based in [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki/), a powerful and extensible open source Wiki software that is build on top of modern technologies like [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). Wiki.js can be used freely by any org to create any type of Wiki.

A Wiki is webpage maintained and edited collaboratively by a user community. Any registered user, after some validations, can add, modify or delete content, and all changes are saved in a permament historical, so nothing is lost in an accidental removal. Information is stored in a database so it can do the classic actions as massive additions/removals, backups or searches.

---

## How is it organized?

As in any Wiki the content are pages, each one with a unique URL and a title. These are main contents expected:

* Books, like *The Urantia Book*, *The Bible* and other texts related with the Urantia revelations. Each chapter of books is one page in *Urantiapedia*.
* Topics about any matter mentioned in *The Urantia Book*. Each topic is stored in a page.
* Articles written by readers, each one a page.
* Images, either drawings or photographs to illustrate concepts of *The Urantia Book*, each in its own page.
* Diagrams or presentations, also in pages.
* Interactive maps, either in 2D or 3D, showing locations or voyages described in the Urantia revelations. Each map is one page. Maps can be static or contain animations to create flyovers.
* 3D models, each in a page, that can be static or interactive as in maps.
