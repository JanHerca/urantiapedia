He made no request of Jesus for healing, but the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> knew full well that this afflicted man came to this breakfast hoping thereby to escape the crowds which thronged him and thus be more likely to engage his attention. This man knew that few miracles were then being performed; however, he had reasoned in his heart that his sorry plight might possibly appeal to the Master’s compassion. And he was not mistaken, for, when he entered the room, both Jesus and the self-righteous Pharisee from <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> took notice of him. The Pharisee was not slow to voice his resentment that such a one should be permitted to enter the room. But Jesus looked upon the sick man and smiled so benignly that he drew near and sat down upon the floor. As the meal was ending, the Master looked over his fellow guests and then, after glancing significantly at the man with <a href="/en/topic/dropsy">dropsy</a>, said: “My friends, teachers in <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a> and learned lawyers, I would like to ask you a question: Is it lawful to heal the sick and afflicted on the <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> day, or not?” But those who were there present knew Jesus too well; they held their peace; they answered not his question.</p>

You have not asked to be healed, but I know the desire of your heart and the faith of your soul.” Before the man left the room, Jesus returned to his seat and, addressing those at the table, said: “Such works my Father does, not to tempt you into the kingdom, but to reveal himself to those who are already in the kingdom. You can perceive that it would be like the Father to do just such things because which one of you, having a favorite animal that fell in the well on the Sabbath day, would not go right out and draw him up?” And since no one would answer him, and inasmuch as his host evidently approved of what was going on, Jesus stood up and spoke to all present: “My brethren, when you are bidden to a <a href="/en/topic/marriage_feast">marriage feast</a>, sit not down in the <a href="/en/topic/chief_seat">chief seat</a>, lest, perchance, a more honored man than you has been invited, and the host will have to come to you and request that you give your place to this other and honored guest. In this event, with shame you will be required to take a lower place at the table. When you are bidden to a feast, it would be the part of wisdom, on arriving at the festive table, to seek for the lowest place and take your seat therein, so that, when the host looks over the guests, he may say to you: ‘My friend, why sit in the seat of the least? come up higher’; and thus will such a one have glory in the presence of his fellow guests. Forget not, every one who exalts himself shall be humbled, while he who truly humbles himself shall be exalted. Therefore, when you entertain at dinner or give a supper, invite not always your friends, your brethren, your kinsmen, or your rich neighbors that they in return may bid you to their feasts, and thus will you be recompensed. When you give a <a href="/en/topic/banquets">banquet</a>, sometimes bid the <a href="/en/topic/poor">poor</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/maimed">maimed</a>, and the <a href="/en/topic/blind">blind</a>. In this way you shall be blessed in your heart, for you well know that the <a href="/en/topic/lame">lame</a> and the halt cannot repay you for your loving ministry.”</p>
