1. God, as the First Source and Center, is primal in relation to total reality—unqualifiedly; infinite as well as eternal and therefore limited or conditioned only by volition.  0:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p3_9)

2. The God of the First Source and Center exercises cosmic overcontrol by absolute Paradise gravity.  1:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p2_10)
