#### ANGELS

#### I. MANIFOLD SERVICES OF ANGELS

> 1\. They enjoy a wide range of ministry.
> 
> > “Angels are the ministering-spirit associates of the evolutionary and ascending will creatures of all space; they are also the colleagues and working associates of the higher hosts of the divine personalities of the spheres. The angels of all orders are distinct personalities and are highly individualized. They all have a large capacity for appreciation of the ministrations of the reversion directors. Together with the Messenger Hosts of Space, the ministering spirits enjoy seasons of rest and change; they possess very social natures and have an associative capacity far transcending that of human beings.” [(285.2) 26:1.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-26-ministering-spirits-central-universe#U26_1_1)
> 
> 2\. In service, angels range from Urantia to Paradise.
> 
> > “The individual members of the angelic orders are not altogether stationary as to personal status in the universe. Angels of certain orders may become Paradise Companions for a season; some become Celestial Recorders; others ascend to the ranks of the Technical Advisers. Certain of the cherubim may aspire to seraphic status and destiny, while evolutionary seraphim can achieve the spiritual levels of the ascending Sons of God.” [(285.11) 26:1.10](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-26-ministering-spirits-central-universe#U26_1_10)
> 
> 3\. Angels function on both material and spiritual levels.
> 
> > “The seraphim are so created as to function on both spiritual and literal levels. There are few phases of morontia or spirit activity which are not open to their ministrations. While in personal status angels are not so far removed from human beings, in certain functional performances seraphim far transcend them. They possess many powers far beyond human comprehension. For example: You have been told that the ‘very hairs of your head are numbered,’ and it is true they are, but a seraphim does not spend her time counting them and keeping the number corrected up to date. Angels possess inherent and automatic (that is, automatic as far as you could perceive) powers of knowing such things; you would truly regard a seraphim as a mathematical prodigy. Therefore, numerous duties which would be tremendous tasks for mortals are performed with exceeding ease by seraphim.” [(419.3) 38:2.3](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-38-ministering-spirits-local-universe#U38_2_3) [Matt 10:30](https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-30.htm).
> 
> 4\. Angels do not judge us.
> 
> > “Angels are superior to you in spiritual status, but they are not your judges or accusers. No matter what your faults, "the angels, although greater in power and might, bring no accusation against you." Angels do not sit in judgment on mankind, neither should individual mortals prejudge their fellow creatures.” [(419.4) 38:2.4](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-38-ministering-spirits-local-universe#U38_2_4)
> 
> 5\. Angels are not to be worshipped.
> 
> > “You do well to love them, but you should not adore them; angels are not objects of worship. The great seraphim, Loyalatia, when your seer ‘fell down to worship before the feet of the angel,’ said: ‘See that you do it not; I am a fellow servant with you and with your races, who are all enjoined to worship God.’” [(419.5) 38:2.5](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-38-ministering-spirits-local-universe#U38_2_5) [Rev 19:10](https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-10.htm); [22:9](https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-9.htm).
> 
> 6\. In nature, angels are near humans.
> 
> > “In nature and personality endowment the seraphim are just a trifle ahead of mortal races in the scale of creature existence. Indeed, when you are delivered from the flesh, you become very much like them. On the mansion worlds you will begin to appreciate the seraphim, on the constellation spheres to enjoy them, while on Salvington they will share their places of rest and worship with you. Throughout the whole morontia and subsequent spirit ascent, your fraternity with the seraphim will be ideal; your companionship will be superb.” [(419.6) 38:2.6](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-38-ministering-spirits-local-universe#U38_2_6)
> 
> 7\. Angels are mind stimulators.
> 
> > “The guardian seraphim are not mind, though they do spring from the same source that also gives origin to mortal mind, the Creative Spirit. Seraphim are mind stimulators; they continually seek to promote circle-making decisions in human mind. They do this, not as does the Adjuster, operating from within and through the soul, but rather from the outside inward, working through the social, ethical, and moral environment of human beings. Seraphim are not the divine Adjuster lure of the Universal Father, but they do function as the personal agency of the ministry of the Infinite Spirit.” [(1245.1) 113:4.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-113-seraphic-guardians-destiny#U113_4_1)
> 
> 8\. Angels are teachers of mind and soul.
> 
> > “Mortal man, subject to Adjuster leading, is also amenable to seraphic guidance. The Adjuster is the essence of man’s eternal nature; the seraphim is the teacher of man’s evolving nature—in this life the mortal mind, in the next the morontia soul. On the mansion worlds you will be conscious and aware of seraphic instructors, but in the first life men are usually unaware of them.
> > 
> > “Seraphim function as teachers of men by guiding the footsteps of the human personality into paths of new and progressive experiences. To accept the guidance of a seraphim rarely means attaining a life of ease. In following this leading you are sure to encounter, and if you have the courage, to traverse, the rugged hills of moral choosing and spiritual progress.” [(1245.2) 113:4.2](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-113-seraphic-guardians-destiny#U113_4_2)
> 
> 9\. Angels prompt us to worship.
> 
> > “The impulse of worship largely originates in the spirit promptings of the higher mind adjutants, reinforced by the leadings of the Adjuster. But the urge to pray so often experienced by God-conscious mortals very often arises as the result of seraphic influence. The guarding seraphim is constantly manipulating the mortal environment for the purpose of augmenting the cosmic insight of the human ascender to the end that such a survival candidate may acquire enhanced realization of the presence of the indwelling Adjuster and thus be enabled to yield increased co-operation with the spiritual mission of the divine presence.” [(1245.4) 113:4.4](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-113-seraphic-guardians-destiny#U113_4_4)
> 
> 10\. Angels co-operate with Thought Adjusters.
> 
> > “While there is apparently no communication between the indwelling Adjusters and the encompassing seraphim, they always seem to work in perfect harmony and exquisite accord. The guardians are most active at those times when the Adjusters are least active, but their ministry is in some manner strangely correlated. Such superb co-operation could hardly be either accidental or incidental.” [(1245.5) 113:4.5](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-113-seraphic-guardians-destiny#U113_4_5)
> 
> 11\. Angels may attain their Corps of Completion.
> 
> > “After attainment of the Father of spirits and admission to the seraphic service of completion, angels are sometimes assigned to the ministry of worlds settled in light and life. They gain attachment to the high trinitized beings of the universes and to the exalted services of Paradise and Havona. These seraphim of the local universes have experientially compensated the differential in divinity potential formerly setting them apart from the ministering spirits of the central and superuniverses. Angels of the Seraphic Corps of Completion serve as associates of the superuniverse seconaphim and as assistants to the high Paradise-Havona orders of supernaphim. For such angels the career of time is finished; hence- forth and forever they are the servants of God, the consorts of divine personalities, and the peers of the Paradise finaliters.” [(441.5) 39:9.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-39-seraphic-hosts#U39_9_1)

#### II. MINISTERING SPIRITS TO ASCENDERS

> 1\. Supernaphim to seraphim are all ministers.
> 
> > “As the supernaphim in the central universe and the seconaphim in a superuniverse, so the seraphim, with the associated cherubim and sanobim, constitute the angelic corps of a local universe.
> > 
> > “The seraphim are all fairly uniform in design. From universe to universe, throughout all seven of the superuniverses, they show a minimum of variation; they are the most nearly standard of all spirit types of personal beings. Their various orders constitute the corps of the skilled and common ministers of the local creations.” [(418.2) 38:0.2](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-38-ministering-spirits-local-universe#U38_0_2)
> 
> 2\. Angelic assistance for ascenders.
> 
> > “All orders of the angelic hosts are devoted to the various universe services, and they minister in one way or another to the higher orders of celestial beings; but it is the supernaphim, seconaphim, and seraphim who, in large numbers, are employed in the furtherance of the ascending scheme of progressive perfection for the children of time. Functioning in the central, super-, and local universes, they form that unbroken chain of spirit ministers which has been provided by the Infinite Spirit for the help and guidance of all who seek to attain the Universal Father through the Eternal Son.” [(286.3) 26:1.15](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-26-ministering-spirits-central-universe#U26_1_15)
> 
> 3\. Angels are very close to mortals.
> 
> > “Angels do not have material bodies, but they are definite and discrete beings; they are of spirit nature and origin. Though invisible to mortals, they perceive you as you are in the flesh without the aid of transformers or translators; they intellectually understand the mode of mortal life, and they share all of man’s nonsensuous emotions and sentiments. They appreciate and greatly enjoy your efforts in music, art, and real humor. They are fully cognizant of your moral struggles and spiritual difficulties. They love human beings, and only good can result from your efforts to understand and love them.” [(419.1) 38:2.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-38-ministering-spirits-local-universe#U38_2_1)
> 
> 4\. Angels do not control human mind.
> 
> > “Angels do not invade the sanctity of the human mind; they do not manipulate the will of mortals; neither do they directly contact with the indwelling Adjusters. The guardian of destiny influences you in every possible manner consistent with the dignity of your personality; under no circumstances do these angels interfere with the free action of the human will. Neither angels nor any other order of universe personality have power or authority to curtail or abridge the prerogatives of human choosing.” [(1245.7) 113:5.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-113-seraphic-guardians-destiny#U113_5_1)
> 
> 5\. They figuratively “weep” over us.
> 
> > “Angels are so near you and care so feelingly for you that they figuratively ‘weep because of your willful intolerance and stubbornness.’ Seraphim do not shed physical tears; they do not have physical bodies; neither do they possess wings. But they do have spiritual emotions, and they do experience feelings and sentiments of a spiritual nature which are in certain ways comparable to human emotions.” [(1246.1) 113:5.2](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-113-seraphic-guardians-destiny#U113_5_2)
> 
> 6\. They minister regardless of our appeals.
> 
> > “The seraphim act in your behalf quite independent of your direct appeals; they are executing the mandates of their superiors, and thus they function regardless of your passing whims or changing moods. This does not imply that you may not make their tasks either easier or more difficult, but rather that angels are not directly concerned with your appeals or with your prayers.” [(1246.2) 113:5.3](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-113-seraphic-guardians-destiny#U113_5_3)
> 
> 7\. Co-operation with midwayers.
> 
> > “Seraphim are able to function as material ministers to human beings under certain circumstances, but their action in this capacity is very rare. They are able, with the assistance of the midway creatures and the physical controllers, to function in a wide range of activities in behalf of human beings, even to make actual contact with mankind, but such occurrences are very unusual. In most instances the circumstances of the material realm proceed unaltered by seraphic action, although occasions have arisen, involving jeopardy to vital links in the chain of human evolution, in which seraphic guardians have acted, and properly, on their own initiative.” [(1246.4) 113:5.5](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-113-seraphic-guardians-destiny#U113_5_5)

#### III. THE SERAPHIM

> 1\. Classification of seraphim.
> 
> > “As far as we are cognizant, the Infinite Spirit, as personalized on the local universe headquarters, intends to produce uniformly perfect seraphim, but for some unknown reason these seraphic offspring are very diverse. This diversity may be a result of the unknown interposition of evolving experiential Deity; if so, we cannot prove it. But we do observe that, when seraphim have been subjected to educational tests and training discipline, they unfailingly and distinctly classify into the following seven groups:
> > 
> > 1. Supreme Seraphim.
> > 2. Superior Seraphim.
> > 3. Supervisor Seraphim.
> > 4. Administrator Seraphim.
> > 5. Planetary Helpers.
> > 6. Transition Ministers.
> > 7. Seraphim of the Future.” [(426.1) 39:0.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-39-seraphic-hosts#U39_0_1)
> 
> 2\. Organization of seraphim.
> 
> > “After the second millennium of sojourn at seraphic headquarters the seraphim are organized under chiefs into groups of twelve (12 pairs, 24 seraphim), and twelve such groups constitute a company (144 pairs, 288 seraphim), which is commanded by a leader. Twelve companies under a commander constitute a battalion (1,728 pairs or 3,456 seraphim), and twelve battalions under a director equal a seraphic unit (20,736 pairs or 41,472 individuals), while twelve units, subject to the command of a supervisor, constitute a legion numbering 248,832 pairs or 497,664 individuals. Jesus alluded to such a group of angels that night in the garden of Gethsemane when he said: ‘I can even now ask my Father, and he will presently give me more than twelve legions of angels.’
> > 
> > “Twelve legions of angels comprise a host numbering 2,985,984 pairs or 5,971,968 individuals, and twelve such hosts (35,831,808 pairs or 71,663,616 individuals) make up the largest operating organization of seraphim, an angelic army. A seraphic host is commanded by an archangel or by some other personality of co-ordinate status, while the angelic armies are directed by the Brilliant Evening Stars or by other immediate lieutenants of Gabriel. And Gabriel is the ‘supreme commander of the armies of heaven,’ the chief executive of the Sovereign of Nebadon, ‘the Lord God of hosts.’” [(421.4) 38:6.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-38-ministering-spirits-local-universe#U38_6_1) [Matt 26:53](https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-53.htm).
> 
> 3\. Negative and positive seraphim.
> 
> > “Though not male and female as are the Material Sons and the mortal races, seraphim are negative and positive. In the majority of assignments it requires two angels to accomplish the task. When they are not encircuited, they can work alone; neither do they require complements of being when stationary. Ordinarily they retain their original complements of being, but not necessarily. Such associations are primarily necessitated by function; they are not characterized by sex emotion, though they are exceedingly personal and truly affectionate.” [(420.4) 38:4.3](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-38-ministering-spirits-local-universe#U38_4_3)

#### IV. CHERUBIM AND SANOBIM

> 1\. They are our nearest of spirit kin.
> 
> > “In all essential endowments cherubim and sanobim are similar to seraphim. They have the same origin but not always the same destiny. They are wonderfully intelligent, marvelously efficient, touchingly affectionate, and almost human. They are the lowest order of angels, hence all the nearer of kin to the more progressive types of human beings on the evolutionary worlds.” [(422.1) 38:7.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-38-ministering-spirits-local-universe#U38_7_1)
> 
> 2\. Why they usually work in pairs.
> 
> > “Cherubim and sanobim are inherently associated, functionally united. One is an energy positive personality; the other, energy negative. The right-hand deflector, or positively charged angel, is the cherubim—the senior or controlling personality. The left-hand deflector, or negatively charged angel, is the sanobim—the complement of being. Each type of angel is very limited in solitary function; hence they usually serve in pairs. When serving independently of their seraphic directors, they are more than ever dependent on mutual contact and always function together.” [(422.2) 38:7.2](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-38-ministering-spirits-local-universe#U38_7_2)
> 
> 3\. They are faithful seraphic helpers.
> 
> > “Cherubim and sanobim are the faithful and efficient aids of the seraphic ministers, and all seven orders of seraphim are provided with these subordinate assistants. Cherubim and sanobim serve for ages in these capacities, but they do not accompany seraphim on assignments beyond the confines of the local universe.” [(422.3) 38:7.3](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-38-ministering-spirits-local-universe#U38_7_3)
> 
> 4\. “Fourth creatures” of the cherubim.
> 
> > “Cherubim and sanobim are by nature very near the morontia level of existence, and they prove to be most efficient in the borderland work of the physical, morontial, and spiritual domains. These children of the local universe Mother Spirit are characterized by ‘fourth creatures’ much as are the Havona Servitals and the conciliating commissions. Every fourth cherubim and every fourth sanobim are quasi-material, very definitely resembling the morontia level of existence.
> > 
> > “These angelic fourth creatures are of great assistance to the seraphim in the more literal phases of their universe and planetary activities. Such morontia cherubim also perform many indispensable borderline tasks on the morontia training worlds and are assigned to the service of the Morontia Companions in large numbers. They are to the morontia spheres about what the midway creatures are to the evolutionary planets. On the inhabited worlds these morontia cherubim frequently work in liaison with the midway creatures. Cherubim and midway creatures are distinctly separate orders of beings; they have dissimilar origins, but they disclose great similarity in nature and function.” [(422.6) 38:7.6](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-38-ministering-spirits-local-universe#U38_7_6)

#### V. GUARDIAN ANGELS

> 1\. Guardian angels are not a myth.
> 
> > “The teaching about guardian angels is not a myth; certain groups of human beings do actually have personal angels. It was in recognition of this that Jesus, in speaking of the children of the heavenly kingdom, said: ‘Take heed that you despise not one of these little ones, for I say to you, their angels do always behold the presence of the spirit of my Father.’” [(1241.3) 113:1.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-113-seraphic-guardians-destiny#U113_1_1) [Matt 18:10](https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-10.htm).
> 
> 2\. Assignment of guardian angels.
> 
> > “Originally, the seraphim were definitely assigned to the separate Urantia races. But since the bestowal of Michael, they are assigned in accordance with human intelligence, spirituality, and destiny. Intellectually, mankind is divided into three classes:“1. The subnormal minded—those who do not exercise normal will power; those who do not make average decisions. This class embraces those who cannot comprehend God; they lack capacity for the intelligent worship of Deity. The subnormal beings of Urantia have a corps of seraphim, one company, with one battalion of cherubim, assigned to minister to them and to witness that justice and mercy are extended to them in the life struggles of the sphere.
> > 
> > “2. The average, normal type of human mind. From the standpoint of seraphic ministry, most men and women are grouped in seven classes in accordance with their status in making the circles of human progress and spiritual development.
> > 
> > “3. The supernormal minded—those of great decision and undoubted potential of spiritual achievement; men and women who enjoy more or less contact with their indwelling Adjusters; members of the various reserve corps of destiny. No matter in what circle a human happens to be, if such an individual becomes enrolled in any of the several reserve corps of destiny, right then and there, personal seraphim are assigned, and from that time until the earthly career is finished, that mortal will enjoy the continuous ministry and unceasing watchcare of a guardian angel. Also, when any human being makes _the_ supreme decision, when there is a real betrothal with the Adjuster, a personal guardian is immediately assigned to that soul.” [(1241.4) 113:1.2](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-113-seraphic-guardians-destiny#U113_1_2)
> 
> 3\. When guardians are assigned.
> 
> > “Seraphim are not known as guardians of destiny until such time as they are assigned to the association of a human soul who has realized one or more of three achievements: has made a supreme decision to become Godlike, has entered the third circle, or has been mustered into one of the reserve corps of destiny.
> > 
> > “In the evolution of races a guardian of destiny is assigned to the very first being who attains the requisite circle of conquest. On Urantia the first mortal to secure a personal guardian was Rantowoc, a wise man of the red race of long ago.” [(1242.4) 113:2.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-113-seraphic-guardians-destiny#U113_2_1)
> 
> 4\. Guardians are volunteers.
> 
> > “All angelic assignments are made from a group of volunteering seraphim, and these appointments are always in accordance with human needs and with regards to the status of the angelic pair—in the light of seraphic experience, skill, and wisdom. Only seraphim of long service, the more experienced and tested types, are assigned as destiny guards. Many guardians have gained much valuable experience on those worlds which are of the non-Adjuster fusion series. Like the Adjusters, the seraphim attend these beings for a single lifetime and then are liberated for new assignment. Many guardians on Urantia have had this previous practical experience on other worlds.” [(1242.6) 113:2.3](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-113-seraphic-guardians-destiny#U113_2_3)
> 
> 5\. Guardians’ affection for mortals.
> 
> > “The angels develop an abiding affection for their human associates; and you would, if you could only visualize the seraphim, develop a warm affection for them. Divested of material bodies, given spirit forms, you would be very near the angels in many attributes of personality. They share most of your emotions and experience some additional ones. The only emotion actuating you which is somewhat difficult for them to comprehend is the legacy of animal fear that bulks so large in the mental life of the average inhabitant of Urantia. The angels really find it hard to understand why you will so persistently allow your higher intellectual powers, even your religious faith, to be so dominated by fear, so thoroughly demoralized by the thoughtless panic of dread and anxiety.” [(1243.2) 113:2.5](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-113-seraphic-guardians-destiny#U113_2_5)
> 
> 6\. Reassignment of disappointed guardians.
> 
> > “When human beings fail to survive, their personal or group guardians may repeatedly serve in similar capacities on the same planet. The seraphim develop a sentimental regard for individual worlds and entertain a special affection for certain races and types of mortal creatures with whom they have been so closely and intimately associated.” [(1243.1) 113:2.4](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-113-seraphic-guardians-destiny#U113_2_4)
> 
> 7\. Life assignment of guardians.
> 
> > “When a seraphic pair accept guardian assignment, they serve for the remainder of the life of that human being. The complement of being (one of the two angels) becomes the recorder of the undertaking. These complemental seraphim are the recording angels of the mortals of the evolutionary worlds. The records are kept by the pair of cherubim (a cherubim and a sanobim) who are always associated with the seraphic guardians, but these records are always sponsored by one of the seraphim.” [(1243.6) 113:2.9](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-113-seraphic-guardians-destiny#U113_2_9)
> 
> 8\. They guard and guide—are not overlords.
> 
> > “In the life of the flesh the intelligence of angels is not directly available to mortal men. They are not overlords or directors; they are simply guardians. The seraphim _guard_ you; they do not seek directly to influence you; you must chart your own course, but these angels then act to make the best possible use of the course you have chosen. They do not (ordinarily) arbitrarily intervene in the routine affairs of human life. But when they receive instructions from their superiors to perform some unusual exploit, you may rest assured that these guardians will find some means of carrying out these mandates. They do not, therefore, intrude into the picture of human drama except in emergencies and then usually on the direct orders of their superiors. They are the beings who are going to follow you for many an age, and they are thus receiving an introduction to their future work and personality association.” [(1246.3) 113:5.4](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-113-seraphic-guardians-destiny#U113_5_4)
> 
> 9\. Guardian angels after death.
> 
> > “Having told you something of the ministry of seraphim during natural life, I will endeavor to inform you about the conduct of the guardians of destiny at the time of the mortal dissolution of their human associates. Upon your death, your records, identity specifications, and the morontia entity of the human soul—conjointly evolved by the ministry of mortal mind and the divine Adjuster—are faithfully conserved by the destiny guardian together with all other values related to your future existence, everything that constitutes you, the real you, except the identity of continuing existence represented by the departing Adjuster and the actuality of personality.
> > 
> > “The instant the pilot light in the human mind disappears, the spirit luminosity which seraphim associate with the presence of the Adjuster, the attending angel reports in person to the commanding angels, successively, of the group, company, battalion, unit, legion, and host; and after being duly registered for the final adventure of time and space, such an angel receives certification by the planetary chief of seraphim for reporting to the Evening Star (or other lieutenant of Gabriel) in command of the seraphic army of this candidate for universe ascension. And upon being granted permission from the commander of this highest organizational unit, such a guardian of destiny proceeds to the first mansion world and there awaits the consciousizing of her former ward in the flesh.” [(1246.5) 113:6.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-113-seraphic-guardians-destiny#U113_6_1)

#### VI. MANSION WORLD MINISTRY

> 1\. Seraphic help on mansion worlds.
> 
> > “On the mansion worlds the seraphic evangels will help you to choose wisely among the optional routes to Edentia, Salvington, Uversa, and Havona. If there are a number of equally advisable routes, these will be put before you, and you will be permitted to select the one that most appeals to you. These seraphim then make recommendations to the four and twenty advisers on Jerusem concerning that course which would be most advantageous for each ascending soul.” [(552.3) 48:6.5](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-48-morontia-life#U48_6_5)
> 
> 2\. Early contacts on the mansion worlds.
> 
> > “It is indeed an epoch in the career of an ascending mortal, this first awakening on the shores of the mansion world; there, for the first time, actually to see your long-loved and ever-present angelic companions of earth days; there also to become truly conscious of the identity and presence of the divine Monitor who so long indwelt your mind on earth. Such an experience constitutes a glorious awakening, a real resurrection.
> > 
> > “On the morontia spheres the attending seraphim (there are two of them) are your open companions. These angels not only consort with you as you progress through the career of the transition worlds, in every way possible assisting you in the acquirement of morontia and spirit status, but they also avail themselves of the opportunity to advance by study in the extension schools for evolutionary seraphim maintained on the mansion worlds.
> > 
> > “The human race was created just a little lower than the more simple types of the angelic orders. Therefore will your first assignment of the morontia life be as assistants to the seraphim in the immediate work awaiting at the time you attain personality consciousness subsequent to your liberation from the bonds of the flesh.” [(1248.1) 113:7.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-113-seraphic-guardians-destiny#U113_7_1)
> 
> 3\. Following us through the local universe.
> 
> > “Before leaving the mansion worlds, all mortals will have permanent seraphic associates or guardians. And as you ascend the morontia spheres, eventually it is the seraphic guardians who witness and certify the decrees of your eternal union with the Thought Adjusters. Together they have established your personality identities as children of the flesh from the worlds of time. Then, with your attainment of the mature morontia estate, they accompany you through Jerusem and the associated worlds of system progress and culture. After that they go with you to Edentia and its seventy spheres of advanced socialization, and subsequently will they pilot you to the Melchizedeks and follow you through the superb career of the universe headquarters worlds. And when you have learned the wisdom and culture of the Melchizedeks, they will take you on to Salvington, where you will stand face to face with the Sovereign of all Nebadon. And still will these seraphic guides follow you through the minor and major sectors of the superuniverse and on to the receiving worlds of Uversa, remaining with you until you finally enseconaphim for the long Havona flight.” [(1248.4) 113:7.4](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-113-seraphic-guardians-destiny#U113_7_4)
> 
> 4\. Through the superuniverse and on to Paradise.
> 
> > “Some of the destiny guardians of attachment during the mortal career follow the course of the ascending pilgrims through Havona. The others bid their long-time mortal associates a temporary farewell, and then, while these mortals traverse the circles of the central universe, these guardians of destiny achieve the circles of Seraphington. And they will be in waiting on the shores of Paradise when their mortal associates awaken from the last transit sleep of time into the new experiences of eternity. Such ascending seraphim subsequently enter upon divergent services in the finaliter corps and in the Seraphic Corps of Completion.” [(1248.5) 113:7.5](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-113-seraphic-guardians-destiny#U113_7_5)

> 5\. Mansion world seraphic evangels.
> 
> > “These seraphic evangels are dedicated to the proclamation of the gospel of eternal progression, the triumph of perfection attainment. On the mansion worlds they proclaim the great law of the conservation and dominance of goodness: No act of good is ever wholly lost; it may be long thwarted but never wholly annulled, and it is eternally potent in proportion to the divinity of its motivation.” [(552.5) 48:6.7](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-48-morontia-life#U48_6_7)

#### VII. TRANSPORT SERAPHIM

> 1\. Source of conventional idea of angels.
> 
> > “Your conventional idea of angels has been derived in the following way: During moments just prior to physical death a reflective phenomenon sometimes occurs in the human mind, and this dimming consciousness seems to visualize something of the form of the attending angel, and this is immediately translated into terms of the habitual concept of angels held in that individual’s mind.
> > 
> > “The erroneous idea that angels possess wings is not wholly due to olden notions that they must have wings to fly through the air. Human beings have sometimes been permitted to observe seraphim that were being prepared for transport service, and the traditions of these experiences have largely determined the Urantian concept of angels. In observing a transport seraphim being made ready to receive a passenger for interplanetary transit, there may be seen what are apparently double sets of wings extending from the head to the foot of the angel. In reality these wings are energy insulators—friction shields.” [(438.4) 39:5.11](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-39-seraphic-hosts#U39_5_11)
> 
> 2\. Preparations for seraphic transport.
> 
> > “When celestial beings are to be enseraphimed for transfer from one world to another, they are brought to the headquarters of the sphere and, after due registry, are inducted into the transit sleep. Meantime, the transport seraphim moves into a horizontal position immediately above the universe energy pole of the planet. While the energy shields are wide open, the sleeping personality is skillfully deposited, by the officiating seraphic assistants, directly on top of the transport angel. Then both the upper and lower pairs of shields are carefully closed and adjusted.” [(438.6) 39:5.13](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-39-seraphic-hosts#U39_5_13)
> 
> 3\. The technique of seraphic transport.
> 
> > “And now, under the influence of the transformers and the transmitters, a strange metamorphosis begins as the seraphim is made ready to swing into the energy currents of the universe circuits. To outward appearance the seraphim grows pointed at both extremities and becomes so enshrouded in a queer light of amber hue that very soon it is impossible to distinguish the enseraphimed personality. When all is in readiness for departure, the chief of transport makes the proper inspection of the carriage of life, carries out the routine tests to ascertain whether or not the angel is properly encircuited, and then announces that the traveler is properly enseraphimed, that the energies are adjusted, that the angel is insulated, and that everything is in readiness for the departing flash. The mechanical controllers, two of them, next take their positions. By this time the transport seraphim has become an almost transparent, vibrating, torpedo-shaped outline of glistening luminosity. Now the transport dispatcher of the realm summons the auxiliary batteries of the living energy transmitters, usually one thousand in number; as he announces the destination of the transport, he reaches out and touches the near point of the seraphic carriage, which shoots forward with lightninglike speed, leaving a trail of celestial luminosity as far as the planetary atmospheric investment extends. In less than ten minutes the marvelous spectacle will be lost even to reinforced seraphic vision.” [(438.7) 39:5.14](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-39-seraphic-hosts#U39_5_14)

#### VIII. RELATION TO OTHER SPIRITS

> 1\. They co-ordinate all impersonal spirit influences.
> 
> > “One of the most important things a destiny guardian does for her mortal subject is to effect a personal co-ordination of the numerous impersonal spirit influences which indwell, surround, and impinge upon the mind and soul of the evolving material creature. Human beings are personalities, and it is exceedingly difficult for nonpersonal spirits and prepersonal entities to make direct contact with such highly material and discretely personal minds. In the ministry of the guarding angel all of these influences are more or less unified and made more nearly appreciable by the expanding moral nature of the evolving human personality.” [(1244.2) 113:3.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-113-seraphic-guardians-destiny#U113_3_1)
> 
> 2\. Correlate manifold influences of Infinite Spirit.
> 
> > “More especially can and does this seraphic guardian correlate the manifold agencies and influences of the Infinite Spirit, ranging from the domains of the physical controllers and the adjutant mind-spirits up to the Holy Spirit of the Divine Minister and to the Omnipresent Spirit presence of the Paradise Third Source and Center. Having thus unified and made more personal these vast ministries of the Infinite Spirit, the seraphim then undertakes to correlate this integrated influence of the Conjoint Actor with the spirit presences of the Father and the Son.” [(1244.3) 113:3.2](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-113-seraphic-guardians-destiny#U113_3_2)
> 
> 3\. Combine love of the Father and mercy of the Son.
> 
> > “The Adjuster is the presence of the Father; the Spirit of Truth, the presence of the Sons. These divine endowments are unified and co-ordinated on the lower levels of human spiritual experience by the ministry of the guardian seraphim. The angelic servers are gifted in combining the love of the Father and the mercy of the Son in their ministry to mortal creatures.” [(1244.4) 113:3.3](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-113-seraphic-guardians-destiny#U113_3_3)
> 
> 4\. Custodian of mind patterns and soul realities.
> 
> > “And herein is revealed the reason why the seraphic guardian eventually becomes the personal custodian of the mind patterns, memory formulas, and soul realities of the mortal survivor during that interval between physical death and morontia resurrection. None but the ministering children of the Infinite Spirit could thus function in behalf of the human creature during this phase of transition from one level of the universe to another and higher level. Even when you engage in your terminal transition slumber, when you pass from time to eternity, a high supernaphim likewise shares the transit with you as the custodian of creature identity and the surety of personal integrity.” [(1244.5) 113:3.4](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-113-seraphic-guardians-destiny#U113_3_4)

#### IX. SUPERNAPHIM AND SECONAPHIM

> 1\. Associates of the ascending career.
> 
> > “Each of these working groups contains angels of all seven created types, and a pilgrim of space is always tutored by secondary supernaphim of origin in the Master Spirit who presides over that pilgrim’s superuniverse of nativity. When you mortals of Urantia attain Havona, you will certainly be piloted by supernaphim whose created natures—like your own evolved natures—are derived from the Master Spirit of Orvonton. And since your tutors spring from the Master Spirit of your own superuniverse, they are especially qualified to understand, comfort, and assist you in all your efforts to attain Paradise perfection.” [(289.13) 26:4.10](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-26-ministering-spirits-central-universe#U26_4_10)
> 
> 2\. Ascender ministry of supernaphim.
> 
> > “The secondary supernaphim are ministers to the seven planetary circuits of the central universe. Part are devoted to the service of the pilgrims of time, and one half of the entire order is assigned to the training of the Paradise pilgrims of eternity. These Paradise Citizens, in their pilgrimage through the Havona circuits, are also attended by volunteers from the Mortal Finality Corps, an arrangement that has prevailed since the completion of the first finaliter group.” [(289.4) 26:4.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-26-ministering-spirits-central-universe#U26_4_1)
> 
> 3\. Ascender ministry of seconaphim.
> 
> > “The seconaphim have their origin and headquarters on the capitals of the superuniverses, but with their liaison fellows they range from the shores of Paradise to the evolutionary worlds of space. They serve as valued assistants to the members of the deliberative assemblies of the super-governments and are of great help to the courtesy colonies of Uversa: the star students, millennial tourists, celestial observers, and a host of others, including the ascendant beings in waiting for Havona transport. The Ancients of Days take pleasure in assigning certain of the primary seconaphim to assist the ascending creatures domiciled on the four hundred ninety study worlds surrounding Uversa, and here also do many of the secondary and tertiary orders serve as teachers. These Uversa satellites are the finishing schools of the universes of time, presenting the preparatory course for the seven-circuited university of Havona.” [(317.4) 28:7.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-28-ministering-spirits-superuniverses#U28_7_1)
> 
> 4\. The secoraphic living mirrors.
> 
> > “The primary seconaphim, of assignment to the Ancients of Days, are living mirrors in the service of these triune rulers. Think what it means in the economy of a superuniverse to be able to turn, as it were, to a living mirror and therein to see and therewith to hear the certain responses of another being a thousand or a hundred thousand light-years distant and to do all this instantly and unerringly. Records are essential to the conduct of the universes, broadcasts are serviceable, the work of the Solitary and other messengers is very helpful, but the Ancients of Days from their position midway between the inhabited worlds and Paradise—between man and God—can instantly look both ways, hear both ways, and _know_ both ways.
> > 
> > “This ability—to hear and see, as it were, all things—can be perfectly realized in the superuniverses only by the Ancients of Days and only on their respective headquarters worlds. Even there limits are encountered: From Uversa, such communication is limited to the worlds and universes of Orvonton, and while inoperative between the superuniverses, this same reflective technique keeps each one of them in close touch with the central universe and with Paradise. The seven supergovernments, though individually segregated, are thus perfectly reflective of the authority above and are wholly sympathetic, as well as perfectly conversant, with the needs below.” [(307.5) 28:4.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-28-ministering-spirits-superuniverses#U28_4_1)
> 
> 5\. Reflectivity of the seconaphim.
> 
> > “Seconaphim of the secondary order are no less reflective than their primary fellows. Being classed as primary, secondary, and tertiary does not indicate a differential of status or function in the case of seconaphim; it merely denotes orders of procedure. Identical qualities are exhibited by all three groups in their activities.
> > 
> > “The seven reflective types of secondary seconaphim are assigned to the services of the co-ordinate Trinity-origin associates of the Ancients of Days as follows:
> > 
> > “To the Perfectors of Wisdom—the Voices of Wisdom, the Souls of Philosophy, and the Unions of Souls.
> > 
> > “To the Divine Counselors—the Hearts of Counsel, the Joys of Existence, and the Satisfactions of Service.
> > 
> > “To the Universal Censors—the Discerners of Spirits.
> > 
> > “Like the primary order, this group is created serially; that is, the first-born was a Voice of Wisdom, and the seventh thereafter was similar, and so with the six other types of these reflective angels.” [(310.3) 28:5.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-28-ministering-spirits-superuniverses#U28_5_1)

#### X. SERAPHIC PLANETARY GOVERNMENT

> 1\. Planetary supervisors on Urantia.
> 
> > “When the first governor general arrived on Urantia, concurrent with the outpouring of the Spirit of Truth, he was accompanied by twelve corps of special seraphim, Seraphington graduates, who were immediately assigned to certain special planetary services. These exalted angels are known as the master seraphim of planetary supervision and are, aside from the overcontrol of the planetary Most High observer, under the immediate direction of the resident governor general.
> > 
> > “These twelve groups of angels, while functioning under the general supervision of the resident governor general, are immediately directed by the seraphic council of twelve, the acting chiefs of each group. This council also serves as the volunteer cabinet of the resident governor general.
> > 
> > “As planetary chief of seraphim, I preside over this council of seraphic chiefs, and I am a volunteer supernaphim of the primary order serving on Urantia as the successor of the onetime chief of the angelic hosts of the planet who defaulted at the time of the Caligastia secession.” [(1254.7) 114:6.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-114-seraphic-planetary-government#U114_6_1)
> 
> 2\. The twelve seraphic planetary corps.
> 
> > “The twelve corps of the master seraphim of planetary supervision are functional on Urantia as follows:
> > 
> > > "1. _The epochal angels_. These are the angels of the current age, the dispensational group. These celestial ministers are intrusted with the oversight and direction of the affairs of each generation as they are designed to fit into the mosaic of the age in which they occur. The present corps of epochal angels serving on Urantia is the third group assigned to the planet during the current dispensation.
> > > 
> > > “2. _The progress angels_. These seraphim are intrusted with the task of initiating the evolutionary progress of the successive social ages. They foster the development of the inherent progressive trend of evolutionary creatures; they labor incessantly to make things what they ought to be. The group now on duty is the second to be assigned to the planet.
> > > 
> > > “3. _The religious guardians_. These are the ‘angels of the churches,’ the earnest contenders for that which is and has been. They endeavor to maintain the ideals of that which has survived for the sake of the safe transit of moral values from one epoch to another. They are the checkmates of the angels of progress, all the while seeking to translate from one generation to another the imperishable values of the old and passing forms into the new and therefore less stabilized patterns of thought and conduct. These angels do contend for spiritual forms, but they are not the source of ultrasectarianism and meaningless controversial divisions of professed religionists. The corps now functioning on Urantia is the fifth thus to serve. (Rev. 1:20)
> > > 
> > > “4. _The angels of nation life_. These are the ‘angels of the trumpets,’ directors of the political performances of Urantia national life. The group now functioning in the overcontrol of international relations is the fourth corps to serve on the planet. It is particularly through the ministry of this seraphic division that ‘the Most Highs rule in the kingdoms of men.’ ([Rev 8:2,6](https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/8-2.htm))
> > > 
> > > “5. _The angels of the races_. Those who work for the conservation of the evolutionary races of time, regardless of their political entanglements and religious groupings. On Urantia there are remnants of nine human races which have commingled and combined into the people of modern times. These seraphim are closely associated with the ministry of the race commissioners, and the group now on Urantia is the original corps assigned to the planet soon after the day of Pentecost.
> > > 
> > > “6. _The angels of the future_. These are the projection angels, who forecast a future age and plan for the realization of the better things of a new and advancing dispensation; they are the architects of the successive eras. The group now on the planet has thus functioned since the beginning of the current dispensation.
> > > 
> > > “7. _The angels of enlightenment_. Urantia is now receiving the help of the third corps of seraphim dedicated to the fostering of planetary education. These angels are occupied with mental and moral training as it concerns individuals, families, groups, schools, communities, nations, and whole races.
> > > 
> > > “8. _The angels of health_. These are the seraphic ministers assigned to the assistance of those mortal agencies dedicated to the promotion of health and the prevention of disease. The present corps is the sixth group to serve during this dispensation.
> > > 
> > > “9. _The home seraphim_. Urantia now enjoys the services of the fifth group of angelic ministers dedicated to the preservation and advancement of the home, the basic institution of human civilization.
> > > 
> > > “10. _The angels of industry_. This seraphic group is concerned with fostering industrial development and improving economic conditions among the Urantia peoples. This corps has been seven times changed since the bestowal of Michael.
> > > 
> > > “11. _The angels of diversion_. These are the seraphim who foster the values of play, humor, and rest. They ever seek to uplift man’s recreational diversions and thus to promote the more profitable utilization of human leisure. The present corps is the third of that order to minister on Urantia.
> > > 
> > > “12. _The angels of superhuman ministry_. These are the angels of the angels, those seraphim who are assigned to the ministry of all other superhuman life on the planet, temporary or permanent. This corps has served since the beginning of the current dispensation.” [(1255.3) 114:6.4](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-114-seraphic-planetary-government#U114_6_4)
> 
> 3\. How Most Highs rule the kingdoms of men.
> 
> > “The Most Highs rule in the Kingdoms of men through many celestial forces and agencies but chiefly through the ministry of seraphim.
> > 
> > “At noon today the roll call of planetary angels, guardians, and others on Urantia was 501,234,619 pairs of seraphim. There were assigned to my command two hundred seraphic hosts—597,196,800 pairs of seraphim, or 1,194,393,600 individual angels. The registry, however, shows 1,002,469,238 individuals; it follows therefore that 191,924,362 angels were absent from this world on transport, messenger, and death duty. (On Urantia there are about the same number of cherubim as seraphim, and they are similarly organized.)” [(1250.1) 114:0.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-114-seraphic-planetary-government#U114_0_1)

#### XI. JESUS TALKS ABOUT ANGELS

> “‘The angelic hosts are a separate order of created beings; they are entirely different from the material order of mortal creatures, and they function as a distinct group of universe intelligences. Angels are not of that group of creatures called “the Sons of God” in the Scriptures; neither are they the glorified spirits of mortal men who have gone on to progress through the mansions on high. Angels are a direct creation, and they do not reproduce themselves. The angelic hosts have only a spiritual kinship with the human race. As man progresses in the journey to the Father in Paradise, he does traverse a state of being at one time analogous to the state of the angels, but mortal man never becomes an angel.
> 
> “‘The angels never die, as man does. The angels are immortal unless, perchance, they become involved in sin as did some of them with the deceptions of Lucifer. The angels are the spirit servants in heaven, and they are neither all-wise nor all-powerful. But all of the loyal angels are truly pure and holy.
> 
> “‘And do you not remember that I said to you once before that, if you had your spiritual eyes anointed, you would then see the heavens opened and behold the angels of God ascending and descending? It is by the ministry of the angels that one world may be kept in touch with other worlds, for have I not repeatedly told you that I have other sheep not of this fold? And these angels are not the spies of the spirit world who watch upon you and then go forth to tell the Father the thoughts of your heart and to report on the deeds of the flesh. The Father has no need of such service inasmuch as his own spirit lives within you. But these angelic spirits do function to keep one part of the heavenly creation informed concerning the doings of other and remote parts of the universe. And many of the angels, while functioning in the government of the Father and the universes of the Sons, are assigned to the service of the human races. When I taught you that many of these seraphim are ministering spirits, I spoke not in figurative language nor in poetic strains. And all this is true, regardless of your difficulty in comprehending such matters.
> 
> “‘Many of these angels are engaged in the work of saving men, for have I not told you of the seraphic joy when one soul elects to forsake sin and begin the search for God? I did even tell you of the joy in the _presence of the angels_ of heaven over one sinner who repents, thereby indicating the existence of other and higher orders of celestial beings who are likewise concerned in the spiritual welfare and with the divine progress of mortal man.
> 
> “‘Also are these angels very much concerned with the means whereby man’s spirit is released from the tabernacles of the flesh and his soul escorted to the mansions in heaven. Angels are the sure and heavenly guides of the soul of man during that uncharted and indefinite period of time which intervenes between the death of the flesh and the new life in the spirit abodes.’” [(1841.1) 167:7.2](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-167-visit-philadelphia#U167_7_2) [John 1:51](https://biblehub.com/john/1-51.htm).
