**Keys of the kingdom**  
  

The keys of the kingdom of heaven are: sincerity, more sincerity , and more sincerity. All men have these keys. Men use them-advance in spirit status-by decisions, by more decisions, and by more decisions. The highest moral choice is the choice of the highest possible value, and always-in any sphere, in all of them-this is to choose to do the will of God. [UB 39:4.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p4_14)  
  

**Kingdom of God**  
  

And at this time he earnestly sought to induce them to abandon the use of the term _kingdom of God_ in favor of the more practical equivalent, _the will of God_. But he did not succeed. [UB 170:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p2_11)  
  
The kingdom of God in this world, the supreme desire to do the will of God, the unselfish love of man which yields the good fruits of improved ethical and moral conduct. [UB 170:2.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p2_18)  
  

**Kingdom of Heaven**  
  

Jesus never tired of telling them that the kingdom of heaven was their personal experience of realizing the higher qualities of spiritual living; that these realities of the spirit experience are progressively translated to new and higher levels of divine certainty and eternal grandeur. [UB 170:2.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p2_16)  
  
The kingdom of heaven is neither a social nor economic order; it is an exclusively spiritual brotherhood of God-knowing individuals. [UB 99:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p3_2)  
  
John asked Jesus, “Master, what is the kingdom of heaven?” and Jesus answered: “The kingdom of heaven consists in these three essentials: first, recognition of the fact of the sovereignty of God: second, belief in the truth of sonship with God; and third, faith in the effectiveness of the supreme human desire to do the will of God-to be like God. And this is the good news of the gospel: that by faith every mortal may have all these essentials of salvation.” [UB 140:10.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p10_9)  
  
They were commencing to comprehend that the “kingdom of heaven is not meat and drink but the realization of the spiritual joy of the acceptance of divine sonship.” [UB 155:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p3_1)  
  

**Knowledge**  
  

Knowledge is power. [UB 81:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_9)  
  
Time is an invariable element in the attainment of knowledge; religion makes its endowments immediately available albeit there is the important factor of growth in grace, definite advancement in all chases of religious experience. Knowledge is an eternal quest; always are you learning, but never are you able to arrive at the full knowledge of absolute truth. In knowledge alone there can never be absolute certainty, only increasing probability of approximation; but the religious soul of spiritual illumination knows, and knows now. [UB 102:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p2_4)  
  
Knowledge leads to placing men, to originating social strata and castes. Religion leads to serving men, thus creating ethics and altruism.  
  
Wisdom leads to the higher and better fellowship of both ideas and one’s fellows. Revelation liberates men and starts them out on the eternal adventure. [UB 102:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p3_6)  
  
Knowledge is the sphere of the material or fact-discerning mind. Truth is the domain of the spiritually endowed intellect that is conscious of knowing God. Knowledge is demonstrable; truth is experienced. Knowledge is a possession of the mind; truth an experience of the soul, the progressing self. Knowledge is a function of the nonspiritual level; truth is a phase of the mind-spirit level of the universes. The eye of the material mind perceives a world of factual knowledge; the eye of the spiritualized intellect discerns a world of true values. These two views, synchronized and harmonized, reveal the world of reality, wherein wisdom interprets the phenomena of the universe in terms of progressive personal experience. [UB 130:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p4_10)
