4. Date: Nineveh fell in August 612. The book was probably written sometime between 614 and 612 B.C.

III. COMPOSITION

1. There is none of the spirit of Amos, Hosea, Micah, or Isaiah in Nahum.

2. Nahum gloats over the fall of Nineveh-the Assyrian capital.

3. Despite its spiritual deficiencies, Nahum is one of the outstanding literary masterpieces of the Bible.

4. It is an oracle of vengeance. For vigor and fervor, it holds a place all its own.

5. In [2:4](/en/Bible/Nahum/2#v4) it reads: "The chariots rage in the streets, they rush to and fro through the squares." This verse has been construed as a prophecy-foretelling railroads and automobiles.

6. It is a poem of revenge-a masterpiece of vindictive literature.

7. To the Jews, Assyria was a symbol of the incarnation of evil-a bloodthirsty militarism.

8. Nahum was a contemporary of Zephaniah, Habakkuk, and Jeremiah.

9. It is supposed to portray the moral indignation of a righteous God, who is international in his jurisdiction.

10. Tyrants become corrupt, dissolute, drunken, and effeminate, and then they are doomed.

3. **Railroads and automobiles**. "The chariots rage in the streets, they rush to and fro through the squares; they gleam like torches, they dart like lightening." 2:4.
