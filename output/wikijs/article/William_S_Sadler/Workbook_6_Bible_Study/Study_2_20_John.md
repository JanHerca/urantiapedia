II. AUTHORSHIP

1. The Urantia Book [UB 121:8.10)](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_10) says 1 John was a covering letter for the Gospel of John, written by Nathan.

2. Most critics agree that the three epistles have the same author.

3. There is little doubt that the three letters were written by the apostle John around the turn of the first century, from a province in Asia.

4. The style, in general, is that of the fourth Gospel.

5. Slight differences between the epistles and the Gospel of John may be explained by the fact that the epistles were personal letters written by John, while the Gospel of John was really written by Nathan at John's direction.

III. BACKGROUND AND MESSAGE

1. The epistles are distinct from both Jewish Christianity and Paulinism.

2. All of John's writings are to safeguard the "incarnation" from Docetic error-that Jesus was not to be identified with Christ.

3. There is a distinction between the "world" and the "new life" in Christ.

4. The theme song of the three epistles is "fellowship."

5. The epistles combat heresy-Docetic and Gnostic.

6. The heart of the first epistle is "God is love," 1 John 4:8.
