III. AUTHORSHIP

1. Paul wrote Romans. It is his longest and weightiest letter to the churches.

2. Some think Paul did not write the last two chapters.

3. Romans was written during Paul's longest period of rest and leisure- probably at Corinth in A.D. 58 during his third and last visit.

4. Romans may have been a general letter to all. the churches. The last two chapters might have been added to the Rome copy.

5. The heretic Marcion made the first collection of Paul's letters.

6. Purpose of the letter was to pave the way for his visit to Rome on the way to Spain.

7. Paul was not too sure of being well received at Rome. Jerusalem was the seat of conservative and Jewish Christianity. Rome was the center of the radical and gentile branch of Christendom.

8. We really do not know who founded the church at Rome. Peter has been credited, but we cannot be sure.

9. If Peter had been founder of the Rome church, Paul would undoubtedly have mentioned him.

IV. PAUL'S MESSAGE

1. Paul was not so much a theologian as a preacher and evangelist. But he was the leading theologian of all Christendom.

2. Romans is the most important theological book ever written. It is the only systematic statement of Paul's theology.

3. He preached the doctrine of salvation.

4. Paul All but personalized sin-and he believed in "original sin." As in Adam all died, so in Christ all are made alive.

5. By sin, man is estranged from God; by Christ he becomes reconciled.

6. It seems that Paul recognized three parts of man: body, soul, and spirit.

7. Christ pays a ransom for man's sin-enslaved soul.

8. Much of Romans has to do with LAW-how Christ takes man from being "under the law" and puts him "under grace."

9. The Christian church is a "colony of heaven."

10. Paul's theology is sunned up in: "Justification by faith."

11. Paul's attitude: "I am not ashamed of the gospel: it is the power of God for salvation." 1:16.

12. Romans shows that Paul is the propounder of the atonement doctrine.

**Note**: As concerns the great conflict between the flesh and the Spirit-see Urantia Book, [UB 34:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p7_1).
