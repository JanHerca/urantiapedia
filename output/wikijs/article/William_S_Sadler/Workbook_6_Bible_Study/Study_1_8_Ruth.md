2. The main purpose of this story is to counteract the attitude of Ezra and Nehemiah against mixed marriages.

3. It is the ideal "short story." It is a "friendship" story; there is no villain.

4. It is a rare story of friendship between two women-like that of David and Jonathan, among men.

5. It counteracts the popular notion of difficulty in getting along with mothers-in-law.

6. It is a story of irresistible charm.

7. The heroine is brave, determined, loyal, and sagacious.

8. The book exemplifies the teaching of Paul: "There is neither Jew nor Greek." Gal. 3:28.
