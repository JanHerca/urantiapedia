II. AUTHORSHIP

1. Paul wrote 1 Corinthians from Ephesus in A.D. 54.

2. Paul sent four letters to the church at Corinth.

3. The first letter written from Ephesus has been lost, but a fragment (2 Cor. 6:14-7:1) is thought to have been preserved.

4. The second letter is our 1 Corinthians.

5. Most of the third letter (referred to in 2 Cor. 2:4 and 7:8) is also lost. A fragment of it is believed to be 2 Cor. 10-13. It was written from Ephesus.

6. Paul's fourth letter is our 2 Corinthians 1-9 (except 6:14-7:1).

7. Paul spent eighteen months at Corinth. He wrote Romans and the two Thessa-Ionians.

III. OCCASION FOR THE LETTERS

1. Apollos, of Alexandria, did considerable work in Corinth, Priacilla and Aquila gave him advanced instruction.

2. Peter may have visited this church, since there was a three-way division. Some said they were of Apollos, some Cephas, others Paul.

3. Paul's letter deals with the following troubles:

- Party divisions.
- Marriage.
- Meat offered idols.
- Spiritual gifts.
- Incest.
- Legal disputes.
- Disorders at Lord's Supper.
- Denial of the resurrection.

4. Speaking with tongues made trouble at Corinth-as well as in other churches.

5. This is not a doctrinal letter-it deals with practical and daily living problems.

6. Paul advocated women's wearing veils in church.

7. A keynote in Paul's advice: "Let all things be done decently and in order."

8. Always remember: In these early years, Paul was expecting the second advent of Christ any day.

9. Paul was a bang-up evangelist and the leading theologian of his time, but he was not a profound philosopher.
