III. AUTHORSHIP

1. Samuel did not write the book.

2. The early book was of dual authorship-J and E. Note:

A. Saul is anointed king privately by Samuel, and twice in public.

B. Saul is twice deposed from the throne.

C. David is introduced twice to Saul.

D. David twice offered a daughter of Saul in marriage.

E. David twice escapes Saul.

F. David three times makes a covenant with Jonathan.

G. Goliath is slain by David and by Elhanan.

3. The book was thoroughly overhauled and rewritten by D.

4. Samuel is one of the most brilliantly written histories of ancient times- 500 years before Herodotus

5. D and P turned Samuel, a village seer, into a "mighty prophet."

6. Samuel is a masterpiece of history, psychological insight, literary style, and dramatic power.

**Note**: Field Marshal Allenby, when in Palestine in 1918, examined the battle-field account of Jonathan's attack on the Philistine garrison (1 Sam. 14:1-23) and was able to identify the crag "on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba." He pronounced Jonathan's strategy as sound.

IV. HISTORICAL VALUE

1. Evidences of repetition and duplication, not already noted, show that the Deuteronomic redactor failed to iron out these contradictions:

A. The Ziphite treachery to David is told two times.

B. Two stories of David's escape from Nob.

C. Two conflicting accounts of Saul's death.

D. Two stories of the war against Amalek.

2. It will be helpful in understanding the rather sudden change in Saul's character, to recall that he was a manic-depressive.

3. There are three types of history:

A. **Narrative type**. To record a good tale.

B. **Didactic type**. To treat events as a storehouse for moral teaching.

C. **Scientific type**. To ascertain the facts.

4. The types A and B characterize the writing of most Old Testament history.

5. Samuel may not be accurate history, but it is a good source book.

V. THEOLOGY

1. The theology of Samuel is just about as primitive as that of Joshua and Judges. But there is some indication of growth.

2. Note the following reminders of primitive theology:

A. Sacred stones. [1Sam. 7:12](/en/Bible/1_Samuel/7#v12).

B. Sacred trees. [1Sam 14:2](/en/Bible/1_Samuel/14#v2).

C. Sacred hills. [1Sam 10:5](/en/Bible/1_Samuel/10#v5).

D. Blood revenge. [2Sam 3:27](/en/Bible/2_Samuel/3#v27).

E. The taboo. [1Sam 21:4](/en/Bible/1_Samuel/21#v4).

F. The vow. [1Sam 14:24](/en/Bible/1_Samuel/14#v24).

G. Propitiatory sacrifice. [1Sam 26:19](/en/Bible/1_Samuel/26#v19).

H. Necromancy. [1Sam 28](/en/Bible/1_Samuel/28.htm).

3. It has been suggested that the Semites had a genius for religion. But the Jews were specialists.

4. The Jewish religion had many things in common with all man-made religions.

5. At first the Jews shared many things with primitive paganism, but they evolved-they experienced growth.

6. The Hebrews had revelation. There arrived the prophets.

7. When Saul could not get comfort from the prophets he went back to necromancy-he consulted with the witch of Endor.

8. There was a great deal of lottery in Hebrew theology-finding out about the divine will by casting lots.

9. The early prophets were associated with "ecstatic frenzy." In some ways this was like the dancing dervishes.

10. Plato regarded all prophets as being afflicted with some sort of "divine madness."

11. In Jewish religion, the ecstatic trance played the part that "speaking with tongues" played in the early Christian religion.

12. Paul warned the church at Corinth that there were many more valuable spiritual gifts than "speaking with tongues."

13. Both Samuel and Nathan were types of "advanced" prophecy. They functioned without either ecstatic frenzy or trance-visions.

14. On special occasions Samuel had visions, but Nathan did not.

15. The nations around Israel had their tribal gods:

A. Chemosh-god of Moab.

B. Melek-god of Ammon.

C. Dagon-god of the Philistines.

16. But unlike these tribal gods, Yahweh continued to grow-evolved into the God of all creation-"King of Kings and Lord of Lords."

17. Now and then Israel would revert to nationalism, as in the case of Nehemiah and Ezra.

18. We all have trouble with the ethics of Yahweh, who could order the complete extermination of whole peoples. But that was common practice among Semites.

19. The Hebrews still clung to their olden concepts of Providence-Yahweh, God of history, Lord of life and death. All success is the reward of virtue.

20. The concept of the chosen people-election of Israel-is still predominant. The sons of Eli did not reform because it was "the will of God to kill them."

21. The Hebrew theology is pervaded with the idea of a whole, nation suffering because of the sin of one individual.

22. Later on both Jeremiah and Ezekiel tried to modify this concept of punishing the innocent for the sins of others.
