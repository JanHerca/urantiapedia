II. AUTHORSHIP

1. Paul wrote Ephesians, The doctrinal half is Paul's theology; the philosophical half is Paul's teaching.

2. But the polished literary style throughout is **not** Paul's. After Paul wrote the epistle, some well qualified Christian editor rewrote the letter -making it one of the most polished pieces of literature to be found in either the Old or the New Testament.

3. The letter was not written just to the church at Ephesus. It was a general epistle addressed to all the churches. (The Revised Standard Version leaves off "Ephesus" in the introduction.)

4. There are 82 words in Ephesians not to be found in any of Paul's other letters.

5. The chief topics of this letter conform to Paul's teaching, but there are at least four secondary ideas that seem foreign to Paul's thinking.

A. **Paul's mission**. He did not claim to be the only missionary to the gentiles. There were earlier teachers-see Acts 11:20.

IV. THEOLOGY OF EPHESIANS

1. It cannot be denied that this book is strongly "tainted" with predestination.

2. The brotherhood concept gains its chief support from Ephesians.

3. Ephesians is up to date. Its battle cry-"Unite or perish."

4. The goal is **unity**\-"in the fullness of time."

5. The theme-all creation moving toward ultimate unity in Christ.

6. All the time Ephesians preaches unity-"till we all come into the unity of the faith."

7. It presents a picture of a sort of "Christian imperialism," all mankind united in the service of Christ.

8. The Fatherhood of God is a chief thought. He is a universal Father-"one God and Father of all."

9. The "mystery of God" is openly revealed "in Christ."

10. In Ephesians the church has fully displaced the "kingdom."

11. The letter fully upholds all of Paul's preaching about "Christ and him crucified."

12. The Jewish Messiah is displaced by a transcendental and cosmic Messiah of infinite attributes.

13. The letter is true to Paul's doctrine of the atonement.

14. The theology of Ephesians is interspersed with prayers that border on grandeur and beauty.

**Note**: Predestination is the Christian analogue of the "chosen people" doctrine of the Jews.
