Our _Urantia Book_ teaches us that we have a Universe Mother and a Universe Father and that they are our spiritual parents. It states that they both are coequal creators as well as coequal administrators. “A Creator Son ... and a Creative Spirit ... created you and your universe ... [and they] minister to the creatures of their own making.” [[UB 8:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/8#p3_4)] 

As Urantians, we need to keep the bow of our boat well pointed into the wave of change. The forward thinking authors of our book brought us new ideas and ideals of change. 

All throughout our book we read passages that show us the feminine face of God. She is our Paradise Mother Spirit, our Eternal Mother Son and the Supreme. But more importantly in our own Universe, she is our spiritual Mother who brings us her Holy Spirit. And she stands equally beside our spiritual Father and his Spirit of Truth. Together they represent the **_balance_** of Spirit, the Yin and Yang, Mother and Father, female and male. **She is a new revelation to this world.**

That is the good “news” that our _Urantia Book_ is bringing to our torn world! Urantia is a world fallen into rebellion. Consequently, we lack knowledge and wisdom that our more advanced neighbors have, but we have _The Urantia Book_. 

I firmly believe that our movement could become alive and infect the world with this radical new knowledge of our spiritual Mother and Father. 

At times, it feels like we have locked Her up, hid Her inside a closet and almost shut the door. In some groups, among old and new readers alike, the talk is very much about Michael, our Creator Son, and hardly ever does our Mother Spirit come into the picture. It is as if She is second class or not as important to us as He is. Our Universe Mother Spirit is the one who works with us personally every day, minute by minute through Her Holy Spirit and Her angels to lead us, guide us, and support us in our daily spiritual lives. 

I believe that our own angels and our special angels of progress are asking this of us - to be more balanced as on other non-rebellion-torn worlds. There they love, honor and respect our Universe Mother and our Universe Father as their Universal spiritual parents and creators. This is the good news our beloved _Urantia Book_ teaches us. We are fishing for souls who are ready to seek truth with these teachings! 

> “Divine executioners are masterful manipulators of that which is in the interests of that which ought to be.” [[UB 25:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/25#p3_5)] 

There are three distinct spirit circuits that inhabit our world and our Universe. They are: 1) Our Divine Mother and her Holy Spirit, 2) our Divine Father and his Spirit of Truth and 3) the Adjutant Mind Spirits. 

When we find our balance in our movement, when we really fully embrace God as our Mother and Father, when we live and are led by not only The Spirit of Truth, but also by the Holy Spirit, then I hope and believe that our Urantia Movement will come alive. It will flourish and blossom like never before. Then will our hungry youths rush to find the beautiful teachings that our book espouses!
