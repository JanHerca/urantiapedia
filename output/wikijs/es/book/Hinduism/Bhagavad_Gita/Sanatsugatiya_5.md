[^862]

Grief and wrath, and avarice, desire, delusion, laziness, want of forgiveness, vanity, craving, friendship [^863], censoriousness, and reviling others—these twelve great enormities are destructive of a man's life. These, O king of kings! attend on each and every man. Beset by these, a man, deluded in his understanding, acts sinfully. A man full of attachments, merciless, harsh (of speech), talkative, cherishing wrath in his heart, and boastful—these are the men of cruel qualities; (such) persons, even obtaining wealth, do not always enjoy (it) [^864].

<span id="p182"><sup><small>[ p. 182 ]</small></sup></span>

One whose thoughts are fixed on enjoyments, who is partial [^865], proud [^866], boastful when he makes a gift, miserly, and devoid of power [^867], who esteems the group (of the senses), and who hates (his) wife—thus have been stated the seven (classes of) cruel persons of sinful dispositions. Piety, and truthfulness, and penance, and self-restraint, freedom from animosity, modesty, endurance, freedom from censoriousness, liberality, sacred learning, courage, forgiveness—these are the twelve great observances of a Brâhma<i>n</i>a. Whoever does not swerve from these twelve may govern this whole world. And one who is possessed of three, two, or even one, of these, must be understood to have nothing of his own [^868]. Self-restraint, abandonment, freedom from delusion, on these immortality depends [^869]. These are possessed by those talented Brâhma<i>n</i>as to whom the Brahman is the principal [^870] (thing). A Brâhma<i>n</i>a's speaking ill of others, whether true or false, is not commended. <span id="p183"><sup><small>[ p. 183 ]</small></sup></span> The men who act thus have their places in hell. Frenzy has eighteen defects—as already described here—hatred of men, factiousness [^871], censoriousness, untruthful speech, lust, wrath, wand of self-control [^872], speaking ill of others, backbiting, mismanagement in business [^873], quarrelsomeness, animosity, troubling living creatures, want of forgiveness, delusion, flippancy, loss of reason [^874], censoriousness [^875]; therefore a wise man should not be subject to frenzy, for it is always censured. Six characteristics should be understood as (belonging) to friendship—that one should rejoice at (anything) agreeable, and feel grieved at (anything) disagreeable; that with a pure heart one, when asked by a deserving (man), should give to him who asks what can [^876] certainly be given, (though it) may be beneficial to oneself, and even though it ought not to be asked, (namely) ones favourites, sons, wealth, and one's own wife; that one should not dwell there where one has bestowed (all one's) wealth, through a desire (to get a return for one's liberality); that one should enjoy (the <span id="p184"><sup><small>[ p. 184 ]</small></sup></span> fruit of one's [^877] own) toils (only); and that one should forego one's own profit [^878]. Such a man, possessed of wealth, and possessed of merits, is a liberal man of the quality of goodness [^879]; such a one diverts the five elements from the five [^880] (senses). This [^881] pure penance, acquired out of desire [^882] by those who are. fallen off from the truth, even though developed, leads upwards [^883]; since sacrifices are performed owing to a misapprehension of the truth [^884]. (The <span id="p185"><sup><small>[ p. 185 ]</small></sup></span> sacrifices) of some are by the mind, of others by speech, and also by deed. The man void of fancies takes precedence over the man perfected by fancies,—especially among Brâhma<i>n</i>as [^885]. And hear this further from me. One should teach this great and glorious [^886] (doctrine); (other doctrines) the wise call mere arrangements of words. On this, concentration of mind [^887], all this [^888] depends. Those who know this become immortal. Not by meritorious action only, O king! does one conquer the truth [^889]. One may offer offerings, or sacrifice. By that the child(-like man) does not cross beyond death; nor, O king! does he obtain happiness in his last moments [^890]. One should practise devotion quietly, and should not be active even in the mind [^891]; and then one should avoid delight and wrath (resulting) from praise and censure [^892]. I say to you, O learned person! that adhering to this [^893], one attains the Brahman and perceives it, O Kshatriya! by a course (of study) of the Vedas.

## Footnotes

[^863]: 180:8 Cf. <i>S</i>vetâ<i>s</i>vatara, p. 347.

[^864]: 180:9 Cf. the famous passage in the Taittirîya, p. 123: and also Mu<i>nd</i>aka, p. 289.

[^865]: 180:10 The explanations of the commentators are not quite clear as to the word ahnâ, ‘in the form of light.’ Probably the meaning is: The universe depends on the Brahman, and is, as it were, the light of the Brahman. <i>S</i>ankara compares the passages referred to at Gîtâ, [p. 112](Bhagavadgita_15#p112), note .

[^866]: 180:11 ‘Not by means of action,’ says <i>S</i>ankara.

[^867]: 181:1 The whole of this chapter is wanting in one of our copies of <i>S</i>ankara's commentary. In the copy published in the Mahâbhârata (Madras edition) there is, however, this passage: ‘Wrath &c. have been already explained, still there are some differences here and there, and those only are now explained.’ The chapter is for the most part a repetition of what we have already had. For such repetitions cf. B<i>ri</i>hadâra<i>n</i>yaka, pp. 317-1016; 444-930. The same copy of <i>S</i>ankara's commentary gives this general statement of the object of this and the next chapter: ‘The course of study of the science of the Brahman, in which knowledge is the principal thing, and concentration of mind &c. are subsidiary, has been. described. Now is described the course of study in which concentration of mind is principal, and knowledge subsidiary. The first mode consists in understanding the meaning of the word “you” by means of concentration of mind, and then identifying it with the Brahman by means of a study of the Upanishads; the second, in first intellectually understanding the identity of the individual self and Brahman, by such study of the Upanishads, and then realising the identity to consciousness by contemplation, &c. In both modes the fruit is the same, and the means are the same; and to show this, the merits and defects already stated are here again declared.’ This explanation is verbatim the same in Nîlaka<i>ri</i>a's commentary.

[^868]: 181:2 The original is ‘pity,’ which is explained to mean ‘friendship’ by <i>S</i>ankara and Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a.

[^869]: 181:3 ‘Owing to there being in it no enjoyment for the self,’ says one p. 182 copy of <i>S</i>ankara's commentary. Another reading, which is in the Madras edition and in Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a, may be rendered, ‘even obtaining benefits, they do not respect one (from whom they obtain them).’

[^870]: 182:1 The commentary says the meaning is the same as that of the expression used in the corresponding place before, viz. one who prospers by injuring others.

[^871]: 182:2 One copy of <i>S</i>ankara's commentary takes this to mean one who thinks the not-self to be the self. I adopt the other meaning, however, as agreeing, with that of atimânî, which is the reading of some copies instead of abhimânî.

[^872]: 182:3 Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a reads durbala and does not explain it. See [p. 167](Sanatsugatiya_3#p167).

[^873]: 182:4 One commentator says this means that he should not be supposed to have incurred the demerit of having any attachment to this world. Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a says, he gives up everything in the pursuit of even one of these observances.

[^874]: 182:5 See [p. 168](Sanatsugatiya_3#p168).

[^875]: 182:6 I. e. the goal to be reached. The commentary takes Brahman to mean the Vedas, and the whole, phrase to mean those who devote themselves to the performance of actions stated in the Vedas.

[^876]: 183:1 One copy of <i>S</i>ankara's commentary says this means 'obstructing other people's acts of piety,' &c.

[^877]: 183:2 One copy of <i>S</i>ankara's commentary says this means ‘being given up to intoxicating drinks,’ &c.; another copy says, doing another's bidding without thought.’

[^878]: 183:3 One copy says this means ‘inattention to any work undertaken.,’ another renders the original by ‘destruction of property, i.e. squandering it on dancers,’ &c.

[^879]: 183:4 I. e. discrimination between right and wrong.

[^880]: 183:5 This seems to be some error, for censoriousness' has occurred before. But neither the texts nor the commentaries give any help to correct the error. Perhaps the latter is to be distinguished as referring to the habit, and the former only to sporadic acts, of censoriousness. These qualities, I presume, constitute frenzy; they are not the ‘defects.’

[^881]: 183:6 I. e. where the power to give exists.

[^882]: 184:1 Not a friend's.

[^883]: 184:2 For a friend.

[^884]: 184:3 See Gîtâ, [p. 120](Bhagavadgita_17#p120).

[^885]: 184:4 The commentators take this to mean objects of sense, and they interpret ‘elements’ before to mean senses.

[^886]: 184:5 ‘Viz. the turning away of the senses from their objects,’ says one copy of <i>S</i>ankara.

[^887]: 184:6 Scil. to enjoy the higher enjoyments of superior worlds.

[^888]: 184:7 I. e. to the higher worlds; it does not lead to emancipation here.

[^889]: 184:8 Cf. Mu<i>nd</i>aka, p. 277. I must own that I do not quite understand this passage, nor its explanation as given in the commentaries. I do not quite see what the penance here mentioned has to do with sacrifice, and yet the commentators seem to take the words ‘since sacrifices,’ &c., with what precedes them, not with what follows. Taking them,. however, with what follows, it is difficult to explain the word ‘since.’ As far as I can understand the passage I take the sense of it to be as follows: The author having said that penance performed out of a particular motive does not lead to final emancipation, he then proceeds to point out that all ‘action’ or ‘sacrifice’ is due to an imperfect understanding of the truth (cf. [p. 171](Sanatsugatiya_3#p171) supra), being mostly due to some particular motive. Then he goes on to show the different classes of sacrifice, and finally points out that he who is free from desires as superior to one who is actuated by desires. The original for ‘misapprehension’ is avabodha, which commonly means ‘apprehension,’ but <i>S</i>ankara finally makes it mean moha or ‘delusion.’ The original for truth is rendered by Nîlaka<i>nd</i>a to mean ‘fancies.’ Nîlaka<i>nd</i>a says that the sacrifice by the mind is the highest; that by speech, viz. Brahmaya<i>g</i>ña, <i>G</i>apa, &c., is middling; and that by deed, viz. with clarified butter and other offerings, of the lowest class. ‘Perfected by fancies’ = one whose fancies are always fulfilled ‘through a knowledge,’ says Nîlaka<i>nd</i>a, ‘of the Brahma as possessing qualities.’

[^890]: 185:1 This also is far from clear. Should it be, ‘and a Brâhma<i>n</i>a more especially?’ This might be taken as referring to one who knows the Brahman as devoid of qualities, as Nîlaka<i>nth</i>a does take it. But his construction is not quite clear.

[^891]: 185:2 As serviceable in attaining to ‘the glory,’ the Brahman; see [p. 180](#p180).

[^892]: 185:3 See note at [p. 181](#p181). As to ‘arrangements of words,’ cf. Maitrî, p. 179.

[^893]: 185:4 ‘Everything,’ says one copy of <i>S</i>ankara's commentary; ‘all that is good and desirable,’ says another.

[^894]: 185:5 Cf. inter alia, Mu<i>nd</i>aka, pp. 281-314.

[^895]: 185:6 For he has got to undergo migration from one life to another as the result of the action. Cf. B<i>ri</i>hadâra<i>n</i>yaka, p. 856; Mu<i>ri</i>aka. p. 278.

[^896]: 185:7 Cf. Gîtâ, [p. 70](Bhagavadgita_6#p70).

[^897]: 185:8 Ibid. pp. [101](Bhagavadgita_12#p101)\-[110](Bhagavadgita_14#p110).

[^898]: 185:9 I. e. the yoga or concentration of mind here described. This stanza, like many others in this chapter, occurs in chapter III with slight variations.
