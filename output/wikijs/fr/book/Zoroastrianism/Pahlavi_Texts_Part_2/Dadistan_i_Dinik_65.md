## DÂ<i>D</i>ISTÂN-Î DÎNÎK. CHAPTER LXV.

1\. _As to_ the sixty-fourth question _and_ reply, that which you ask is thus: Where _and_ from what did the origin of race, _which_ they say _was_ next-of-kin marriage (khvêtûdâ<i>d</i>ŏ) [^1], arise; and from what place did it arise? <span id="p200"><sup><small>[ p. 200 ]</small></sup></span> 2\. The reply is this, that the first consummation of next-of-kin marriage was owing to that _which_ Mashyâîh _and_ Mashyâyôîh [^2] did, who were brother and sister together, and their consummation of intercourse produced a son [^3] as a consummation of the first next-of-kin marriage. 3. So that they effected the first intercourse of man with woman, _and_ the entire progress of the races of every kind of lineage of men arose from that, _and_ all the men _of_ the world are of that race.

4\. It is truly said, that it was the joy of the lord _and_ creator after the creation of the creatures, and, owing to that, its consummation, which _was_ his complete accomplishment of the existence of the creatures (dâmânîh), was owing to him. 5. And its occurrence, too, is in evidence that the creator, who is so with unflinching (atôrâk) will, is as much _the cause of_ the begetting and entire progress of his own perfect creatures [^4], in whom begetting is by destiny, as Hôshâng [^5] by whom two-thirds [^6] of the demons _were_ smitten, Tâkhmôrup [^7] who overturned Aharman through the power of the angels, Yim by <span id="p201"><sup><small>[ p. 201 ]</small></sup></span> whom order _was_ arranged and death _was_ driven away (avakâl<i>d</i>ŏ) [^8], Frê<i>d</i>ûn _who_ fettered A<i>z</i>\-î Dahâk [^9] and stripped his blaspheming (nîrangâk) from the world, and the many princes (kayân) and high-priests of grave spirit _who_ were, _and_ are, _and will_ be.

## Footnotes

[^1]: (199:3) Usually written khvêtûk-das (Av. <i>h</i><i>v</i>aêtvadatha, ‘a giving of, or to, one’s own'). It is a term applied to marriages between near relations, and is extolled as specially meritorious. For centuries past the Parsis have understood it to refer to marriages between first cousins, and all allusions to marriage between nearer relations they attribute to the practices of heretics (see Sls. XVIII, 4 n); though, like the professors of all other religions, they must admit the necessity of such a practice in the first family of mankind, as detailed in the text. Translations of other passages relating to the subject will be found in Appendix III, and it is also mentioned in Chaps. XXXVII, 82, LXXVII, 6, and LXXVIII, 19.

[^2]: (200:1) See Chap. LXIV, 2. The names are here written Mashyêîh and Mashyêyôîh.

[^3]: (200:2) Twins, according to Bd. XV, 22, 24.

[^4]: (200:3) That is, he is not only the original creator, but also the perpetual promoter of the increase and progress of the creation, as much as those who appear to be such promoters, though merely acting as his agents.

[^5]: (200:4) Here written Hôshyâng. For the Av. names of these four primeval monarchs, see Chap. II, 10 n.

[^6]: (200:5) K35 has ‘three-thirds,’ but see Âbân Yt. 22, Râm Yt. 8, Zamyâ<i>d</i> Yt. 26.

[^7]: (200:6) He is said to have subjugated the evil spirit, and to have used him as a steed for thirty years (see Chaps. II, 10, XXXVII, 35).

[^8]: (201:1) He is said to have kept away cold and heat, decay and death, and other evils from the earth (see Râm Yt. 16, Zamyâ<i>d</i> Yt. 33).

[^9]: (201:2) See Chap. XXXVII, 97.
