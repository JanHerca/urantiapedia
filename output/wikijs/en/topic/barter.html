<p>Trade by barter followed seizure by raids. But a long period of piracy intervened between the early practices of silent barter and the later <a href="/topic/commerce">trade</a> by modern exchange methods. A <a href="/topic/fetishes">fetish</a> was used to stand guard over the deposits of goods for silent barter. Such <a href="/topic/market_places">market places</a> were secure against <a href="/topic/theft">theft</a>; nothing would be removed except by barter or purchase; with a fetish on guard the goods were always safe. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Never did the barter in <a href="/topic/sex">sex</a> <a href="/topic/slaves">slaves</a> advance <a href="/topic/clubs">society</a>; such traffic was and is a racial disgrace, for at one and the same <a href="/topic/time">time</a> it hindered the development of <a href="/topic/family">family</a> <a href="/topic/life">life</a> and polluted the biologic fitness of <a href="/topic/superior_seraphim">superior</a> peoples. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
