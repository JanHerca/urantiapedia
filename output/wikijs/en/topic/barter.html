<p>Trade by barter followed seizure by raids. But a long period of piracy intervened between the early practices of silent barter and the later trade by modern exchange methods. A fetish was used to stand guard over the deposits of goods for silent barter. Such <a href="/topic/market_places">market places</a> were secure against theft; nothing would be removed except by barter or purchase; with a fetish on guard the goods were always safe. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Never did the barter in sex slaves advance <a href="/topic/clubs">society</a>; such traffic was and is a racial disgrace, for at one and the same time it hindered the development of family life and polluted the biologic fitness of superior peoples. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
