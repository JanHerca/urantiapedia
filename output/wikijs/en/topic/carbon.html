<p>Some of the upper layers of rock deposits contain small amounts of shale or slate of dark colors, indicating the presence of organic carbon and testifying to the existence of the ancestors of those forms of plant life which overran the earth during the <a href="/topic/Carboniferous">Carboniferous</a> or coal age. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Much of the carbon of the atmosphere was abstracted to form the carbonates. Later on, much greater quantities of these <a href="/topic/carbon_dioxide">carbon gases</a> were consumed by the early and prolific plant life. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In those suns which are encircuited in the <a href="/topic/absoluta">space-energy</a> channels, solar energy is liberated by various complex nuclear-reaction chains, the most common of which is the hydrogen-carbon-helium reaction. In this metamorphosis, carbon acts as an energy catalyst. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
