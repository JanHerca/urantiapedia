<p>Hap, the Planetary Prince assistant, taught Dalamatians the seven chants of <a href="/topic/worship">worship</a> and also gave them the daily praise-phrase and eventually taught them “the Father’s prayer,” which was: <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>“Father of all, whose Son we honor, look down upon us with favor. Deliver us from the fear of all save you. Make us a pleasure to our divine <a href="/topic/teachers">teachers</a> and forever put truth on our lips. Deliver us from violence and anger; give us respect for our elders and that which belongs to our neighbors. Give us this season green pastures and fruitful flocks to gladden our hearts. We pray for the hastening of the coming of the promised uplifter, and we would do your will on this world as others do on worlds beyond”. </p>
