<p>The ghost cult evolved as an offset to the hazards of bad luck; its primitive <a href="/topic/ceremonies">religious observances</a> were the outgrowth of anxiety about bad luck and of the inordinate fear of the dead. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Many early peoples associated ghosts with the sea; hence virgins were greatly restricted in their <a href="/topic/bathing">bathing</a> practices; young women were far more afraid of bathing in the sea at high tide than of having sex relations. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Man inherited a natural <a href="/topic/environment">environment</a>, acquired a social environment, and imagined a ghost environment. The state is man’s reaction to his natural environment, the home to his social environment, the church to his illusory ghost environment. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> The most primitive idea of the human <a href="/topic/soul">soul</a>, the ghost, was derived from the breath-dream idea-system. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> Moses persistently sought to uproot the remnants of the ghost cult among his people, even prescribing the <a href="/topic/death_penalty">death penalty</a> for its practitioners. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> Fear of ghosts </h2>
<p>The dread of the ghosts of the dead brought to light a new and amazing form of fear, an appalling and powerful terror, which contributed to whipping the loose social orders of early ages into the more thoroughly <a href="/topic/discipline">disciplined</a> and better controlled primitive groups of ancient times. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup> Primitive <a href="/topic/desires">desires</a> produced the original society, but ghost fear held it together and imparted an extrahuman aspect to its existence. <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Ghost fear drove primitive man to envision the supernatural and thus securely laid the foundations for those powerful social influences of ethics and religion which in turn preserved inviolate the mores and customs of society from generation to generation. Ghost fear was the fountainhead of all <a href="/topic/Roman_Catholic_Church">world religion</a>; and for ages many tribes clung to the old belief in one class of ghosts. <sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Prepared the minds of men, through superstitious fear of the unreal and the <a href="/topic/supernatural">supernatural</a>, for the later discovery of “the fear of the Lord which is the beginning of wisdom. ”. <sup id="cite9"><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup> Produced dread of <a href="/topic/being">being</a> alone. <sup id="cite10"><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup> The savage lived in fear of the ghosts of his fellows and spent his spare time planning for the safe <a href="/topic/conduct">conduct</a> of his own ghost after death. <sup id="cite11"><a href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup> It was a senseless <a href="/topic/superstition">superstition</a>. <sup id="cite12"><a href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> Nature and activities of ghosts </h2>
<p>It was very early believed that ghosts administered justice through the <a href="/topic/medicine_men">medicine men</a> and priests; this constituted these orders the first crime detectors and officers of the law. <sup id="cite13"><a href="#fn13">[13]</a></sup> </p>
<p>It was once thought that the great desire of a ghost was to be quickly “laid” so that it might proceed undisturbed to deadland. Any error was believed to be displeasing to the ghost, and an angered ghost was supposed to be a source of calamity, misfortune, and <a href="/topic/unhappiness">unhappiness</a>. <sup id="cite14"><a href="#fn14">[14]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The earliest hypothesis advanced in explanation of <a href="/topic/disease">disease</a> and death was that spirits caused disease by enticing the soul out of the body; if it failed to return, death ensued. <sup id="cite15"><a href="#fn15">[15]</a></sup> Though the savage credited ghosts with supernatural powers, he hardly conceived of them as having supernatural <a href="/topic/intelligence">intelligence</a>. <sup id="cite16"><a href="#fn16">[16]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Primitive man viewed the spirits and ghosts as having almost unlimited rights but no duties; the spirits were <a href="/topic/thought">thought</a> to regard man as having manifold duties but no rights. <sup id="cite17"><a href="#fn17">[17]</a></sup> Ghosts wanted wives and servants; a well-to-do savage expected that at least one slave wife would be buried alive at his <a href="/topic/death">death</a>. <sup id="cite18"><a href="#fn18">[18]</a></sup> </p>
<p>And this belief in the existence of disembodied <a href="/topic/spirits">spirits</a> or ghosts seemed to explain the occurrence of the unusual, the extraordinary, the infrequent, and the inexplicable. <sup id="cite19"><a href="#fn19">[19]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Ghosts were supposed to be disturbed and frightened by noise; shouting, bells, and drums drove them away from the <a href="/topic/living">living</a>; and these ancient methods are still in vogue at “wakes” for the dead. <sup id="cite20"><a href="#fn20">[20]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Still later the imagination of man envisioned the concept of both good and bad supernatural agencies; some ghosts never evolved to the level of good spirits. When the doctrine of good and bad spirits finally matured, it became the most widespread and persistent of all religious beliefs. Man’s early philosophy was able to reconcile spirit constancy with the <a href="/topic/vicissitudes">vicissitudes</a> of temporal fortune only by postulating two kinds of spirits, one good and the other bad. <sup id="cite21"><a href="#fn21">[21]</a></sup> </p>
<p>It was the general belief of mankind that ghosts levied a continuous tribute of <a href="/topic/conscription">service</a> as the price of noninterference in human affairs, and the least mischance was laid to ghost activities. <sup id="cite22"><a href="#fn22">[22]</a></sup> It was a supposed <a href="/topic/preference">preference</a> of ghosts to indwell some object which had belonged to them when alive in the flesh. <sup id="cite23"><a href="#fn23">[23]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The one thing which early established and crystallized the mores was the belief that the dead were jealous of the ways by which they had lived and died; therefore would they visit dire <a href="/topic/punishment">punishment</a> upon those living mortals who dared to treat with careless disdain the rules of living which they had honored when in the flesh. <sup id="cite24"><a href="#fn24">[24]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Fasting and other forms of <a href="/topic/self-denial">self-denial</a> were thought to be pleasing to the ghosts, who took pleasure in the discomfort of the living during the transition period of lurking about before their actual departure for deadland. <sup id="cite25"><a href="#fn25">[25]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> Influence in religion </h2>
<p>In religion the negative program of ghost <a href="/topic/placation">placation</a> long preceded the positive program of spirit coercion and supplication. <sup id="cite26"><a href="#fn26">[26]</a></sup> </p>
<p>None of early religions had much to do with the <a href="/topic/recognition">recognition</a> of Deity or with reverence for the superhuman; their rites were mostly negative, designed to avoid, expel, or coerce ghosts. <sup id="cite27"><a href="#fn27">[27]</a></sup> Eventually the savage conceived of himself as a double—body and <a href="/topic/breath">breath</a>. The breath minus the body equaled a spirit, a ghost. <sup id="cite28"><a href="#fn28">[28]</a></sup> Shamans howled away ghosts responsible for <a href="/topic/disease">disease</a>. <sup id="cite29"><a href="#fn29">[29]</a></sup> All primitive tribes, except those little above <a href="/topic/animals">animals</a>, have developed some concept of the soul. <sup id="cite30"><a href="#fn30">[30]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Jesus further explained to his <a href="/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a> that the spirits of departed human beings do not come back to the world of their origin to communicate with their living fellows. <sup id="cite31"><a href="#fn31">[31]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Man’s first <a href="/topic/effort">efforts</a> at defense were directed against the ghosts. As the ages passed, the living began to devise methods of resisting the dead. Many techniques were developed for frightening ghosts and driving them away. <sup id="cite32"><a href="#fn32">[32]</a></sup> </p>
<p>From age to age and from generation to generation, race after race has sought to improve this superghost doctrine, but no generation has ever yet dared to wholly reject it. <sup id="cite33"><a href="#fn33">[33]</a></sup> Superstition of ghosts in the <a href="/topic/dreams">dream</a> still persists today. <sup id="cite34"><a href="#fn34">[34]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The ghost gods, who are of supposed human origin, should be distinguished from the nature gods, for nature worship did evolve a pantheon—nature spirits elevated to the <a href="/topic/position">position</a> of gods. <sup id="cite35"><a href="#fn35">[35]</a></sup> </p>
