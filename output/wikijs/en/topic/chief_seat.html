<p>Said Jesus:: “My brethren, when you are bidden to a <a href="/topic/marriage_feast">marriage feast</a>, sit not down in the chief seat, lest, perchance, a more honored man than you has been invited, and the host will have to come to you and request that you give your place to this other and honored guest”. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
