<p>The ancients believed that the <a href="/topic/soul">soul</a> could leave the <a href="/topic/body,_human">body</a> in various ways, as in coma. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The <a href="/topic/Jews">Jews</a> were in the habit of burying their <a href="/topic/dead">dead</a> on the day of their demise; this was a necessary practice in such a warm <a href="/topic/climate">climate</a>. It often happened that they put in the tomb one who was merely comatose, so that on the second or even the <a href="/topic/third_day">third day</a>, such a one would come forth from the tomb. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> The daughter of <a href="/topic/Jairus">Jairus</a> of <a href="/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, who was believed to have resurrected <a href="/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, was actually in a coma after a prolonged fever. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> The son of the widow of <a href="/topic/Nain">Nain</a> was another case of supposed <a href="/topic/healing">healing</a> of Jesus in which the <a href="/topic/children">child</a> was not really dead, but in a coma. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
