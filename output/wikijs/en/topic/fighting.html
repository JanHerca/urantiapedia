<p>Too often we engage in a fight merely to convince ourselves that we are not afraid. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> Antiquity </h2>
<p>When the early chiefs would try to iron out <a href="/topic/misunderstandings">misunderstandings</a>, they often found it necessary, at least once a year, to permit the tribal stone fights. The clan would divide up into two groups and engage in an all-day battle. And this for no other reason than just the fun of it; they really enjoyed fighting. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> Since Eden Garden times play, <a href="/topic/humor">humor</a> and competitive substitutes for physical fighting were practiced. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> Jesus </h2>

Before any attack he first discriminated if the aggressor was a son of God, and he only applied force if that person did not possess moral judgment and spiritual reason. But if he were a son of God he would not use force or <a href="/topic/self-defense">self-defense</a> against him, and he would try to use any artifice to appease him. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
