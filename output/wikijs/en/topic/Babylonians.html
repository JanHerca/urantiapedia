<p>The Babylonians, because of immediate contact with the remnants of the <a href="/topic/civilization">civilization</a> of the Adamites, enlarged and embellished the story of man’s creation; they taught that he had descended directly from the gods. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Jews were a part of the older Semitic race, which also included the Babylonians, the Phoenicians, and the more recent enemies of Rome, the <a href="/topic/Carthage">Carthaginians</a>. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> Babylonians, as many other <a href="/topic/races">races</a>, had triad gods, but these were still not true trinities. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
