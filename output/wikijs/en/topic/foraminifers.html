<p>The Cretaceous period is named after the prolific foraminifers that dominated the seas, producing vast amounts of chalk, and it marks the near end of the long reign of reptiles, the emergence of flowering plants and birds, and significant geological activities including <a href="/topic/continental_drift">continental drift</a>, crustal deformations, lava flows, and volcanic activities, with large deposits of foraminiferal limestone found in regions such as the Alps, Himalayas, Tibet, and along the coasts of Africa, Australia, South America, and the Antilles. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
