<p>After the priests of the Babylonian exile had prepared their new record of God’s supposedly miraculous dealings with the Hebrews, the sacred history of Israel as portrayed in the Old Testament, they carefully and completely destroyed the existing records of Hebrew affairs—such books as “The Doings of the Kings of Israel” and “<a href="/topic/Doings_of_Kings_of_Judah">The Doings of the Kings of Judah</a>,” together with several other more or less accurate records of Hebrew history. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
