<p>The Chinese worship of the dragon is a <a href="/topic/survival_(of_mortal_death)">survival</a> of the snake cults. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> In Apostle John’s vision he saw a great red dragon. He wrote: “And his tail drew a third part of the stars of heaven and cast them down in <a href="/topic/darkness">darkness</a>”. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The dragon became the symbolic representation of all Lucifer and his rebel followers. Upon the triumph of Michael, “Gabriel came down from <a href="/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> and bound the dragon (all the rebel leaders) for an age”. “There was war in heaven; Michael’s commander and his angels fought against the dragon”, Lucifer, Satan, and the apostate princes; “and the dragon and his rebellious angels fought but prevailed not”. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
