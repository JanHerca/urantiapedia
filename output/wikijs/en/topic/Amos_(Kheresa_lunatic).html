<p><a href="/topic/Amos_(brother_of_Jesus)">Amos</a> led <a href="/topic/Aden">Aden</a> to believe in <a href="/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and Aden later dedicated himself to preaching. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>He was a lunatic who lived in the <a href="/topic/caves">caves</a> and the <a href="/topic/cemetery">cemetery</a> near <a href="/topic/Kheresa">Kheresa</a>. He used to be in chains but he had managed to untie himself and was wandering around when he found Jesus. <a href="/topic/Amos_(John_Mark’s_friend)">Amos</a> did not have any demonic <a href="/topic/possession">possession</a> as he believed nor was he healed by Jesus but he had a mental affliction and abruptly changed his <a href="/topic/behavior">behavior</a> when <a href="/topic/listening">listening</a> to Jesus. The story that he later believed, that the <a href="/topic/demons">demons</a> that tormented him happened to dwell in a <a href="/topic/swine">swine</a>, helped to consolidate his recovery. All the <a href="/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a> except <a href="/topic/Thomas_Didymus">Thomas</a> believed in the story of the swine. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
