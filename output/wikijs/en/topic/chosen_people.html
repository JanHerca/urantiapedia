<p>There is no such thing as a “chosen people. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> Jews </h2>
<p>Moses proclaimed that Yahweh was the <a href="/topic/Lord_God_of_Israel">Lord God of Israel</a>, who had singled out the Hebrews as his chosen people; he was building a new nation, and he wisely nationalized his religious teachings, telling his followers that Yahweh was a hard taskmaster, a “jealous God. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Moses taught israelites that they would become the chosen people of God only on condition that they “kept all his <a href="/topic/commandments">commandments</a> and obeyed all his statutes.”. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> Samuel proclaimed a Yahweh who made all men but was occupied chiefly with the <a href="/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a>, his chosen people. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Amos and Hosea preached a God who thought no differently of the Hebrews than of any other nation when it came to the <a href="/topic/punishment">punishment</a> of wrongdoing. This was a direct attack on the egoistic doctrine of the “chosen people,”. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In their reaction against national <a href="/topic/inferiority">inferiority</a> they swung to the other extreme of national and racial egotism, in which they distorted and perverted their traditions with the view of exalting themselves above all races as the chosen people of God. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>It was <a href="/topic/resentment">resentment</a> of the loss of their national god that led the Jewish priests to go to such lengths in the invention of fables and miracles in Hebrew history in an effort to restore the Jews as the chosen people. <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Israelite leaders taught that they were a chosen people, not for special <a href="/topic/indulgence">indulgence</a> and monopoly of divine favor, but for the special service of carrying the truth of the one God over all to every nation. <sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The <a href="/topic/chance">fortuitous</a> liberty and independence of the political rule of surrounding and more powerful peoples the Jews attributed to the fact that they were the “chosen people,” to the direct interposition of Yahweh. <sup id="cite9"><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup> Due to this Jews were perplexed by <a href="/topic/Babylonian_captivity">Babylonian captivity</a> due to belief that they were the chosen people. <sup id="cite10"><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> Dangers of the doctrine </h2>
<p>One of the dangers of institutional religion is the <a href="/topic/creation">creation</a> of the aristocratic “chosen-people” attitude. <sup id="cite11"><a href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup> Religion become tainted with that persistently mischief-making <a href="/topic/error">error</a>, the chosen-people delusion. <sup id="cite12"><a href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup> The doctrine of the chosen people has been a primary factor in uniting tribes and <a href="/topic/buildings">building</a> nations until modern times. <sup id="cite13"><a href="#fn13">[13]</a></sup> </p>
