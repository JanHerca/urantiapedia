<p>Modern <a href="/topic/man">man</a> no longer attempts openly to <a href="/topic/compulsion">coerce</a> the <a href="/topic/spirits">spirits</a>, though he still evinces a disposition to bargain with <a href="/topic/Deity">Deity</a>. And he still <a href="/topic/cursing">swears</a>, knocks on <a href="/topic/wood">wood</a>, crosses his fingers, and follows <a href="/topic/expectoration">expectoration</a> with some trite phrase; once it was a magical formula. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> At one <a href="/topic/time">time</a> it was really dangerous to point a finger at anyone; it is still regarded as ill-mannered to point. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
