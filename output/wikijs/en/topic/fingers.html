<p>Modern man no longer attempts openly to coerce the spirits, though he still evinces a disposition to bargain with Deity. And he still swears, knocks on wood, crosses his fingers, and follows <a href="/topic/expectoration">expectoration</a> with some trite phrase; once it was a magical formula. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> At one <a href="/topic/time">time</a> it was really dangerous to point a finger at anyone; it is still regarded as ill-mannered to point. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
