<p>Judas Iscariot was the twelfth apostle. He was chosen by Nathaniel, and later confirmed in this election by Jesus. He was born in Kerioth, a small town in southern Judea. When he was a lad, his parents moved to Jericho, where he lived and had been employed in his father’s various business enterprises until he became interested in the preaching and work of <a href="/topic/John_the_Baptist">John the Baptist</a>. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> Judas’s parents were Sadducees, and when their son joined John’s <a href="/topic/disciples">disciples</a>, they disowned him. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>When Nathaniel met Judas at Tarichea, he was seeking employment with a fish-drying enterprise at the lower end of the <a href="/topic/Sea_of_Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a>. He was thirty years of age in A.D. 26 and unmarried when he joined the apostles. He was probably the best-educated man among the twelve and the only Judean in the Master’s apostolic family. He was cultured, educated, and a good thinker, but he was not truly honest. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Judas was accepted by Jesus in the group of apostles along with Thomas, in Tarichea. When Jesus accepted Judas, he told him: “Judas, we are all of one flesh, and as I receive you into our midst, I pray that you will always be loyal to your Galilean <a href="/topic/brethren">brethren</a>. Follow me.”. Judas was the only Judean. All the rest were from Galilee. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> His work as treasurer </h2>
<p>Andrew appointed Judas treasurer of <a href="/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">the twelve</a>, a position which he was eminently fitted to hold, and up to the time of the betrayal of his Master he discharged the responsibilities of his office honestly, faithfully, and most efficiently. He carried the bag. He paid all expenses and kept the books. He made budget estimates for Matthew from week to week and also made weekly reports to Andrew. Judas paid out funds on Andrew’s authorization. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Judas really was a great executive, a farseeing and able financier. And he was a stickler for organization. None of <a href="/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">the twelve</a> ever criticized Judas. As far as they could see, Judas Iscariot was a matchless treasurer, a learned man, a loyal, though sometimes critical, apostle, and in every sense of the word a great success. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup> Judas carried in a bag with the apostolic funds, and used to keep that bag in a deep pocket. <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup> Judas wisely made a deposit of the surplus of funds in a Jericho bank run by a friend. This deposit was there until <a href="/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> year of Jesus' life. <sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p><a href="/topic/David_Zebedee">David Zebedee</a> turned over to Judas the funds realized from the sale of the equipment of the Pella encampment, and Judas placed the greater part of this money in Simon of Bethany's care. <sup id="cite9"><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup> Judas willingly gave all apostolic funds to <a href="/topic/David_Zebedee">David Zebedee</a> before Jesus' death. <sup id="cite10"><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> His criticism </h2>
<p>Judas did not get along with Nathanael. He once took his criticism of Nathanael to Jesus because he thought he didn't take his <a href="/topic/apostleship">apostleship</a> seriously, which earned him a rebuke from Jesus. <sup id="cite11"><a href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup> All the apostles, with the exception of Judas, succeeded in overcoming much of their prejudice against the <a href="/topic/Samaritans">Samaritans</a>. <sup id="cite12"><a href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Judas, along with Peter, John, and <a href="/topic/Simon_Zelotes">Simon Zelotes</a>, was in favor of proclaiming Jesus king. When Jesus did not live up to these expectations, he thought that he would be oppressed with regrets that he did not have the courage to be made king. <sup id="cite13"><a href="#fn13">[13]</a></sup> Judas, with Simon Zelotes, attempted to heal <a href="/topic/James_of_Safed">James of Safed</a>’s son, unsuccessfully. <sup id="cite14"><a href="#fn14">[14]</a></sup> Judas Iscariot thought that Jesus had fled in haste into Phoenicia because he feared the Jewish leaders and <a href="/topic/Herod_Antipas">Herod Antipas</a>. <sup id="cite15"><a href="#fn15">[15]</a></sup> Of all the apostles, Judas Iscariot was the most adversely affected by the processional entry of Jesus into <a href="/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. <sup id="cite16"><a href="#fn16">[16]</a></sup> Judas did not realize it, but he had been a subconscious critic of Jesus ever since <a href="/topic/John_the_Baptist">John the Baptist</a> was beheaded by Herod. <sup id="cite17"><a href="#fn17">[17]</a></sup> While his companions hesitated, Judas took a seat of honor at the <a href="/topic/Last_Supper">Last Supper</a>. <sup id="cite18"><a href="#fn18">[18]</a></sup> The washing of the feet during the last supper was further proof to Judas that Jesus was not Israel's <a href="/topic/Deliverer">deliverer</a> and would never qualify to be. <sup id="cite19"><a href="#fn19">[19]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> His relationship with Jesus </h2>
<p>Jesus advised Andrew to continue to place the utmost <a href="/topic/confidence">confidence</a> in Judas despite his last acts. <sup id="cite20"><a href="#fn20">[20]</a></sup> <a href="/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> did everything possible to save Judas. <sup id="cite21"><a href="#fn21">[21]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Judas was faith adventure to Jesus. From the beginning the Master fully understood the weakness of this apostle and well knew the dangers of admitting him to <a href="/topic/fellowship">fellowship</a>. <sup id="cite22"><a href="#fn22">[22]</a></sup> </p>
<p>At <a href="/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> supper Jesus addressed his last words to Judas. He first warned him in a veiled way: “Although it is necessary that I return to the Father, it was not necessary for one of you to become a traitor to fulfill the will of the Father.” In view of the fact that Judas was determined in his purpose, he simply told him: “What you have decided to do, do it immediately.”. <sup id="cite23"><a href="#fn23">[23]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The words of <a href="/topic/encouragement">encouragement</a> in Bethany for Judas were: “Judas, I have loved you and have prayed that you would love your brethren. Be not weary in well doing; and I would warn you to beware the slippery paths of flattery and the poison darts of ridicule.”. <sup id="cite24"><a href="#fn24">[24]</a></sup> Jesus warned the apostles of an impending <a href="/topic/betrayal">betrayal</a>, without indicating that it was Judas. <sup id="cite25"><a href="#fn25">[25]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> The betrayal </h2>
<p>Judas was always financially loyal to his Master and his fellow apostles. Money could never have been the motive for his <a href="/topic/betrayal">betrayal</a> of the Master. It was not for money that Judas went to the home of Caiaphas to arrange for the betrayal of Jesus. <sup id="cite26"><a href="#fn26">[26]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The day that Mary, Lazarus' sister, broke an expensive jar of incense at the feet of Jesus seemed to Judas such a waste that when Jesus so sweepingly disallowed his public protest, it was too much for him, and this event determined the mobilization of all the accumulated hate, hurt, malice, <a href="/topic/prejudice">prejudice</a>, jealousy, and revenge of a lifetime, and decided Judas to take revenge. <sup id="cite27"><a href="#fn27">[27]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Some relatives and <a href="/topic/Sadducees">Sadducees</a> led Judas to believe that he would forthwith receive high honors from the Sanhedrin if he withdrew from the movement of Jesus and his “Galilean” followers. <sup id="cite28"><a href="#fn28">[28]</a></sup> In various situations that bothered Judas is when he began to seriously think about how to break with Jesus the <a href="/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a>. <sup id="cite29"><a href="#fn29">[29]</a></sup> <a href="/topic/David_Zebedee">David Zebedee</a> knew about Judas's plot to kill Jesus and so he tried to let the Master know, but he asked him to keep quiet. <sup id="cite30"><a href="#fn30">[30]</a></sup> The <a href="/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a> only began to harbor suspicions of Judas' treachery when they were returning to the camp from the upper room. <sup id="cite31"><a href="#fn31">[31]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Judas really feared for his life when going to capture <a href="/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, and for this reason he dared to ask for a company of forty armed soldiers, which the Jews had to request from Pilate. <sup id="cite32"><a href="#fn32">[32]</a></sup> Judas betrayed Jesus with a kiss on the brow while greeting him in front of the captive <a href="/topic/Jerusalem_temple_guards">guards</a>. <sup id="cite33"><a href="#fn33">[33]</a></sup> Both the temple guards and the <a href="/topic/Roman_centurion_in_Corinth">Roman centurion</a> showed deep contempt for Judas as the traitor. <sup id="cite34"><a href="#fn34">[34]</a></sup> Judas did not dare to enter the house of Annas but he was present at the trial of Jesus before the <a href="/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> and then before Pilate. <sup id="cite35"><a href="#fn35">[35]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Throughout the trial of Jesus before Caiaphas and during his appearance before Pilate, Judas was pricked in his <a href="/topic/conscience">conscience</a> about his traitorous conduct. <sup id="cite36"><a href="#fn36">[36]</a></sup> The <a href="/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> rewarded Judas with a bag containing 30 pieces of silver, the current price for a healthy slave. <sup id="cite37"><a href="#fn37">[37]</a></sup> Seeing Jesus raised on the crossbar where he was nailed to the cross, he felt strong <a href="/topic/repentance">repentance</a> and ran to the temple to deliver his reward money. <sup id="cite38"><a href="#fn38">[38]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> Causes of downfall </h2>
<p>When analyzing the <a href="/topic/causation">causes</a> of the fall of Judas, we are told: </p>
<ul>
<li>Failed to love the truth with his whole soul; he let deceitful intellectual <a href="/topic/pride">pride</a> lead him to spiritual downfall. <sup id="cite39"><a href="#fn39">[39]</a></sup> </li>
<li>Judas was tremendously influenced by the <a href="/topic/ridicule">ridicule</a> of his Sadducean friends. <sup id="cite40"><a href="#fn40">[40]</a></sup> </li>
<li>He was an isolated type of human <a href="/topic/being">being</a>. He was highly individualistic and chose to grow into a confirmed “shut-in” and unsociable sort of person. <sup id="cite41"><a href="#fn41">[41]</a></sup> </li>
<li>His love grew cold, and he refused to trust his loyal <a href="/topic/brethren">brethren</a>. <sup id="cite42"><a href="#fn42">[42]</a></sup> </li>
<li>Despite Jesus' prohibition to enter <a href="/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> without him, Judas encountered Jesus' enemies, exposing himself to their clever insinuations and subtle taunts. <sup id="cite43"><a href="#fn43">[43]</a></sup> </li>
<li>He persistently harbored grudges and fostered such psychologic enemies as revenge and the generalized craving to “get even” with somebody for all his <a href="/topic/disappointment">disappointments</a>; sought revenge for hurt feelings. <sup id="cite44"><a href="#fn44">[44]</a></sup> </li>
<li>Judas was an only son of unwise <a href="/topic/parents">parents</a>. When very young, he was pampered and petted; he was a spoiled child. <sup id="cite45"><a href="#fn45">[45]</a></sup> </li>
<li>He persistently refused to confide in, or freely fraternize with, his fellow <a href="/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a>. <sup id="cite46"><a href="#fn46">[46]</a></sup> </li>
<li>When he was impelled, by the accumulation of his emotional conflicts, to seek relief, he sought the advice and the unwise <a href="/topic/consolation">consolation</a> of his unspiritual relatives or those chance acquaintances who were either indifferent, or actually hostile, to the heavenly kingdom. <sup id="cite47"><a href="#fn47">[47]</a></sup> </li>
<li>Judas was self-satisfied and he dared to criticize <a href="/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> often. <sup id="cite48"><a href="#fn48">[48]</a></sup> </li>
<li>Judas was a well-intentioned but cowardly and self-centered <a href="/topic/personality">personality</a>. <sup id="cite49"><a href="#fn49">[49]</a></sup> </li>
</ul>
<h2> His end </h2>
<p>After the terrible <a href="/topic/disappointment">disappointment</a> with the reward from the Sanhedrin, Judas committed suicide by attempting to hang himself from a tree in the Valley of Hinnom. The belt he used came undone and he died when he hit the rocks of the precipice. <sup id="cite50"><a href="#fn50">[50]</a></sup> The worlds have found it <a href="/topic/difficulties">difficult</a> to forgive Judas, and his name has become eschewed throughout a far-flung universe. <sup id="cite51"><a href="#fn51">[51]</a></sup> </p>
