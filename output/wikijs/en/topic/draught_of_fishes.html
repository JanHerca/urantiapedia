<p>This episode in the life of Jesus, known as the miraculous catch of fish, occurred on a Friday morning when Jesus was teaching by the shore. The crowd pressed so close to him that he signaled to some fishermen in a nearby boat to come to his aid. He boarded the boat, which belonged to Simon Peter and had been built by Jesus himself, and continued teaching for over two hours. After finishing, Jesus suggested they go fishing. Despite having caught nothing all night, the fishermen followed Jesus' instructions and caught so many fish that their nets nearly broke. Amazed at the catch, David Zebedee, a man named Simon, and their companions left their nets and followed Jesus. Although not a miracle, Jesus' knowledge of fishing and the habits of the fish in the <a href="/topic/Sea_of_Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a> led to this remarkable event, which his followers always regarded as miraculous. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
