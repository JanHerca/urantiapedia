<p>This episode in the <a href="/topic/life">life</a> of <a href="/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, known as the miraculous catch of <a href="/topic/fish">fish</a>, occurred on a <a href="/topic/Fridays">Friday</a> morning when Jesus was teaching by the shore. The crowd pressed so close to him that he signaled to some <a href="/topic/fishermen">fishermen</a> in a nearby <a href="/topic/boats">boat</a> to come to his aid. He boarded the boat, which belonged to <a href="/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a> and had been built by Jesus himself, and continued teaching for over two hours. After finishing, Jesus suggested they go fishing. Despite having caught nothing all night, the fishermen followed Jesus' instructions and caught so many fish that their nets nearly broke. Amazed at the catch, <a href="/topic/David_Zebedee">David Zebedee</a>, a <a href="/topic/man">man</a> named <a href="/topic/Simon_(assistant_of_David_Zebedee)">Simon</a>, and their companions left their nets and followed Jesus. Although not a miracle, Jesus' <a href="/topic/knowledge">knowledge</a> of fishing and the <a href="/topic/habits">habits</a> of the fish in the <a href="/topic/Sea_of_Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a> led to this remarkable event, which his followers always regarded as miraculous. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
