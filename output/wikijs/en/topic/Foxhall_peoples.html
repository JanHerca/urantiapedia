<p>Though the remains of the Foxhall peoples were the last to be discovered in England, these Andonites were really <a href="/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> human beings to live in those regions. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>During a long period of cultural decadence the Foxhall peoples of England and the <a href="/topic/Badonan_tribes">Badonan tribes</a> northwest of India continued to hold on to some of the traditions of Andon and certain remnants of the culture of Onagar. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Foxhall peoples were farthest west and succeeded in retaining much of the Andonic culture; they also preserved their knowledge of flintworking, which they transmitted to their descendants, the ancient <a href="/topic/ancestor_worship">ancestors</a> of the Eskimos. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
