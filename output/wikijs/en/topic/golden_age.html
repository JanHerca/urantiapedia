<p>The modern phrase, “<a href="/topic/back_to_nature">back to nature</a>,” is a delusion of ignorance, a belief in the reality of the onetime fictitious “golden age.” The only basis for the legend of the golden age is the historic fact of Dalamatia and Eden. But these improved societies were far from the realization of utopian dreams. But this ideas were discouraging since they were predicated upon a belief in retrogression rather than progression, as well as implying a vengeful Deity. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> The tradition of Adam and the <a href="/topic/Garden_of_Eden">Garden of Eden</a> also lent substance to the dream of a onetime “golden age” of the dawn of the races. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> The <a href="/topic/truth">truth</a> is that the early experiences of the human race were characterized by terrible antisocial conditions. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> Times of <a href="/topic/Onagar">Onagar</a> were, indeed, the golden age for primitive man. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> Ages of <a href="/topic/light_and_life">light and life</a> that will come to Urantia in a distant future will be truly golden ages. </p>
