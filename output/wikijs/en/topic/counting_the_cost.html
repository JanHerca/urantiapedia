<p>This is a speech that Jesus delivered to his followers at the ford of Bethany in the Jordan: Jesus emphasized the importance of being willing to pay the full price of <a href="/topic/consecration_of_choice">dedication</a> to God's will. He urged his disciples to be ready to abandon everything, including family and even their own lives, to follow him. He illustrated this with examples of calculating the cost before building a tower or going to war. Jesus warned that following him would involve severe persecutions and sacrifices, and that only those who were fully committed and willing to renounce all worldly attachments would be worthy of being his disciples. He concluded by urging his followers to examine their motives and be prepared for the trials ahead. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
