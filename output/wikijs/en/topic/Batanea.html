<p>In the <a href="/topic/time">time</a> of <a href="/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, Batanea was a region frequently traversed by him and his followers during their travels. <a href="/topic/Matthew_Levi">Matthew Levi</a>, a <a href="/topic/customs">customs</a> collector in <a href="/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, had his tax office near the borders of Batanea, just east of the <a href="/topic/cities">city</a>. This area became significant during one of Jesus’ escapes from the <a href="/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a>, who were searching for him in the vicinity of Capernaum after he had departed. While the Pharisees spent almost a <a href="/topic/week">week</a> unsuccessfully searching for Jesus, he and his group journeyed northward through Batanea. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>On one memorable <a href="/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a>, Jesus and his twenty-four <a href="/topic/disciples">disciples</a> landed near <a href="/topic/Kheresa">Kheresa</a> and proceeded <a href="/topic/north">north</a> to camp overnight in a familiar park south of <a href="/topic/Bethsaida-Julias">Bethsaida-Julias</a>. This spot, often used by the group in previous travels, provided a peaceful retreat. That evening, Jesus gathered his followers to outline <a href="/topic/plans">plans</a> for their upcoming tour, which would take them through Batanea and northern <a href="/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> before reaching the Phoenician coast. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
