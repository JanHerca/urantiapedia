<p>In the time of Jesus, Batanea was a region frequently traversed by him and his followers during their travels. <a href="/topic/Matthew_Levi">Matthew Levi</a>, a customs collector in Capernaum, had his tax office near the borders of Batanea, just east of the city. This area became significant during one of Jesus’ escapes from the Pharisees, who were searching for him in the vicinity of Capernaum after he had departed. While the Pharisees spent almost a week unsuccessfully searching for Jesus, he and his group journeyed northward through Batanea. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>On one memorable Sunday, Jesus and his twenty-four disciples landed near Kheresa and proceeded north to camp overnight in a familiar park south of <a href="/topic/Bethsaida-Julias">Bethsaida-Julias</a>. This spot, often used by the group in previous travels, provided a peaceful retreat. That evening, Jesus gathered his followers to outline plans for their upcoming tour, which would take them through Batanea and northern Galilee before reaching the Phoenician coast. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
