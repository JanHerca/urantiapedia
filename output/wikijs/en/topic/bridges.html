<p>In his devotion to <a href="/topic/causation">the cause</a> of the kingdom, Jesus burned all bridges behind him; he sacrificed all hindrances to the doing of his Father’s will. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>As they walked over this bridge, <a href="/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, among other things, said: “This world is only a bridge; you may pass over it, but you should not think to build a dwelling place upon it”. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
