<p>The apostolate, unlike the less rigorous path of the simple <a href="/topic/disciples">disciples</a>, is the commission that Jesus gave to those who wish to give everything in the service of the kingdom. </p>
<p>The apostleship, originally a requirement only for <a href="/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">the twelve</a>, Jesus did not restrict it only to them. A group of some seventy later disciples can also be considered apostles, and anyone willing to agree to pay the price was accepted by Jesus as an apostle. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> The hard requirements made by Jesus to apostles: </h2>
<ul>
<li>Live as those who have tasted the glories of a better life and have been sent back to earth as <a href="/topic/ambassadors">ambassadors</a> of the Sovereign of that new and better world. </li>
<li>Return <a href="/topic/good">good</a> for evil. </li>
<li>Mercy always shall determine judgements. </li>
<li>Be willing, then, to take up the responsibilities and follow him. </li>
<li>Do your good <a href="/topic/action">deeds</a> in secret. </li>
<li>When you pray, go apart by yourselves and use not vain repetitions and meaningless phrases. </li>
<li>Be not given to <a href="/topic/fasting">fasting</a> with a sad countenance to be seen by men. </li>
<li>Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth; lay up for yourselves treasures in <a href="/topic/heaven">heaven</a>. </li>
<li>Be not <a href="/topic/anxiety">anxious</a> for your lives; much less be concerned with what you shall eat or what you shall drink. </li>
<li>Seek first the <a href="/topic/kingdom">kingdom</a> of God. </li>
</ul>
<p>He never taught his followers to avoid earthly <a href="/topic/possessions">possessions</a>, only his twelve apostles. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Jesus never taught that it was wrong to have wealth. He required only the twelve and the seventy to dedicate all of their worldly <a href="/topic/possessions">possessions</a> to the common cause. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>“You who would follow after me must be willing to pay the price of wholehearted <a href="/topic/consecration_of_choice">dedication</a> to the doing of my Father’s will. If you would be my disciples, you must be willing to forsake father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, even your life. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
