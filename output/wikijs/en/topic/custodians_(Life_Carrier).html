<p>The custodians are a subgroup within the <a href="/topic/Life_Carriers">Life Carriers</a>, who are classified into three main divisions: the oldest Life Carriers, the assistants, and the custodians. The custodians, along with the assistants, focus on studying and developing methods to protect and conserve life. They are specialists in handling the basic life patterns and are crucial in the life conservation plans for new worlds. On Urantia, there were twenty-four custodians, two for each fundamental life pattern. Their work ensures the proper establishment and maintenance of life on planets. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
