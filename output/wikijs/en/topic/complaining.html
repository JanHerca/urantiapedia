<p>We must learn to accept challenges without complaint and to face <a href="/topic/difficulties">difficulties</a> and uncertainties without fear. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Man should not bemoan his lowly origin when <a href="/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Sons</a> pass through same experience to be considered worthy and competent to rule over their universe. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Man should not <a href="/topic/blame">blame</a> God for those afflictions which are the natural result of the life which he chooses to live; neither should man complain of those experiences which are a part of life as it is lived on this world. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> Prayer has turned many an irritable and complaining invalid into a paragon of patience and made him an <a href="/topic/inspiration">inspiration</a> to all other human sufferers. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> Jesus and complaints </h2>
<p>Never, since the marvellous bestowal of Jesus as the Planetary Prince of a world in isolation and rebellion, have any of the <a href="/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a> or Daughters in Nebadon been tempted to complain of their assignments or to find fault with the difficulties of their planetary missions. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> Elders of <a href="/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> complained about Jesus to Joseph and Mary after he draw a picture of the teacher. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Judas did not think Nathaniel took his <a href="/topic/apostleship">apostleship</a> sufficiently seriously and once had the temerity to go secretly to Jesus and lodge complaint against him. <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup> In Jesus' parable the workers in the <a href="/topic/vineyard">vineyard</a> complained that they were not paid more than those who had been hired last. <sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p>When thinking men and women look upon <a href="/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> as he offers up his life on the cross, they will hardly again permit themselves to complain at even the severest hardships of life, much less at petty harassments and their many purely fictitious grievances. <sup id="cite9"><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup> Jesus said: To suffer evil without complaint and without <a href="/topic/resistance">resistance</a>, the purely negative method, is not enough. We have to return good for evil. <sup id="cite10"><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup> </p>
