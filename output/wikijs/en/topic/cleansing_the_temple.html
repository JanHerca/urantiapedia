<p><a href="/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ cleansing of the <a href="/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> was a decisive <a href="/topic/action">act</a> against the commercialization of <a href="/topic/worship">worship</a> and the <a href="/topic/exploitation">exploitation</a> of the <a href="/topic/poor">poor</a>. The temple had become a center of <a href="/topic/profit">profit</a> through the sale of sacrificial <a href="/topic/animals">animals</a> and currency exchange, benefiting the priestly families. Amid the <a href="/topic/noise">noise</a> and chaos of <a href="/topic/commerce">commerce</a>, Jesus drove out the animals, declaring, “My <a href="/topic/houses">house</a> shall be called <a href="/topic/houses">a house</a> of <a href="/topic/prayer">prayer</a>, but you have made it a den of <a href="/topic/thieves">robbers</a>.” His <a href="/topic/action">action</a> inspired the admiration of his listeners, who, following his <a href="/topic/example">example</a>, overturned the tables of the <a href="/topic/money-changers">money-changers</a>, but it deeply alarmed the temple authorities. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
