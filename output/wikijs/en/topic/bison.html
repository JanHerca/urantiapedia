<p>Bison, an iconic species of <a href="/topic/North_America">North America</a>, played a pivotal role in the continent's ecosystem during the <a href="/topic/ice">ice</a> age. As <a href="/topic/ruminants">ruminants</a> spread across the <a href="/topic/land">land</a>, bison thrived alongside <a href="/topic/deer">deer</a>, <a href="/topic/oxen">oxen</a>, <a href="/topic/camels">camels</a>, and other species. However, the advancing and retreating <a href="/topic/glaciers">glaciers</a> of the ice age <a href="/topic/doubt">challenged</a> their <a href="/topic/survival_(of_mortal_death)">survival</a>, forcing bison to migrate repeatedly. These <a href="/topic/animals">animals</a> adapted to the harsh conditions, following the ice back and forth across the land. While many species, including <a href="/topic/mammoths">mammoths</a> and <a href="/topic/mastodons">mastodons</a>, <a href="/topic/backsliding">succumbed</a> to <a href="/topic/extinction">extinction</a>, bison endured, eventually becoming integral to the lives of indigenous peoples. Early <a href="/topic/humans">humans</a> hunted bison by surrounding herds, a practice that foreshadowed the domestication of animals. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
