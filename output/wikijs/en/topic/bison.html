<p>Bison, an iconic species of <a href="/topic/North_America">North America</a>, played a pivotal role in the continent's ecosystem during the ice age. As ruminants spread across the land, bison thrived alongside deer, oxen, camels, and other species. However, the advancing and retreating glaciers of the ice age challenged their survival, forcing bison to migrate repeatedly. These animals adapted to the harsh conditions, following the ice back and forth across the land. While many species, including mammoths and mastodons, succumbed to extinction, bison endured, eventually becoming integral to the lives of indigenous peoples. Early humans hunted bison by surrounding herds, a practice that foreshadowed the domestication of animals. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
