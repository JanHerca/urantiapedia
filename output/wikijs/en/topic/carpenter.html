<p><a href="/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was an expert carpenter and cabinetmaker. He also was a boatbuilder. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Jesus made use of his <a href="/topic/first">first</a> and only <a href="/topic/absent_landlord_(parable)">parable</a> having to do with his own <a href="/topic/commerce">trade</a>, the parable of the foolish: “Do not make the mistake of the foolish carpenter who wastes valuable <a href="/topic/time">time</a> squaring, measuring, and smoothing his worm-eaten and inwardly rotting timber and then, when he has thus bestowed all of his <a href="/topic/labor">labor</a> upon the unsound <a href="/topic/beam">beam</a>, must reject it as unfit to enter into the foundations of the <a href="/topic/buildings">building</a> which he would construct to withstand the assaults of time and storm”. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
