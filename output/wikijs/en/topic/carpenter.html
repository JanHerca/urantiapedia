<p><a href="/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was an expert carpenter and cabinetmaker. He also was a boatbuilder. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Jesus made use of his first and only parable having to do with his own trade, the parable of the foolish: “Do not make the mistake of the foolish carpenter who wastes valuable time squaring, measuring, and smoothing his worm-eaten and inwardly rotting timber and then, when he has thus bestowed all of his labor upon the unsound beam, must reject it as unfit to enter into the foundations of the <a href="/topic/buildings">building</a> which he would construct to withstand the assaults of time and storm”. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
