<p>Bartholomew is the father of Nathaniel the apostle, and he lived with his wife in Cana of Galilee. They were both elderly and suffering from some illness. He passed away shortly after <a href="/topic/Pentecost_(bestowal_of_Spirit_of_Truth)">Pentecost</a>. Surely his death caused Nathaniel to prepare to travel abroad to preach, because until that moment he had been the only support for his parents. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
