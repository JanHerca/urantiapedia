<p>Around 240 million years ago, during a period of widespread land subsidence, the Catskill Mountains formed as one of North America's largest geological monuments from this era. These mountains, located along the west bank of the <a href="/topic/Hudson_River">Hudson River</a>, bear evidence of the Devonian floods that slowly advanced and retreated. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
