<p>Judas never acquired a philosophic technique for meeting <a href="/topic/disappointment">disappointment</a>. Instead of accepting <a href="/topic/disappointment">disappointments</a> as a regular and commonplace feature of human existence, he unfailingly resorted to the practice of blaming someone in particular, or his associates as a group, for all his personal <a href="/topic/difficulties">difficulties</a> and disappointments. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> How prone is <a href="/topic/man">man</a>, when he is confronted with the <a href="/topic/defeat">failures</a> of his own making, to put the blame upon others, oftentimes upon those who <a href="/topic/least">least</a> deserve it! <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p><a href="/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> asked to refrain from <a href="/topic/condemnation">condemnation</a>: <a href="/topic/will">will</a> you call upon the Lord, and he shall answer; you will cry out, and he shall say—Here am I. And all this he will do if you refrain from <a href="/topic/oppression">oppression</a>, condemnation, and <a href="/topic/vanity">vanity</a>. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
