<p>Amata is the mother of <a href="/topic/Perpetua">Perpetua</a>, <a href="/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a>’s wife. She suffered from <a href="/topic/malaria">malaria</a>, a <a href="/topic/disease">disease</a> that she usually presented with cyclical fevers, an erroneous reason why it was considered that <a href="/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> cured her immediately while he comforted her in her bed. However, Jesus did miraculously heal her hours later in the context of the massive <a href="/topic/healing">healing</a> that occurred at sunset. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
