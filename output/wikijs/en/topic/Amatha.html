<p>Amata is the mother of Perpetua, <a href="/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a>’s wife. She suffered from malaria, a disease that she usually presented with cyclical fevers, an erroneous reason why it was considered that Jesus cured her immediately while he comforted her in her bed. However, Jesus did miraculously heal her hours later in the context of the massive healing that occurred at sunset. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
