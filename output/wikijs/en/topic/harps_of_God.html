<p>“harps of God” are a <a href="/topic/morontia">morontia</a> devices used at Jerusem for reception of space communications. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Adam and Eve, when on Earth, could communicate with each other and with their immediate children over a distance of about 50 miles. This thought exchange was effected by means of the delicate <a href="/topic/gas_chambers">gas chambers</a> located in close proximity to their brain structures. By this mechanism they could send and receive thought oscillations. But this power was instantly suspended upon the mind’s surrender to the discord and disruption of evil. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
