<p>Amadonites were derived from the group of 144 loyal <a href="/topic/Andonites">Andonites</a> to which Amadon belonged, and who have become known by his name. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Fifty-six of this number were of immortality status, and all, except Amadon, were translated along with the <a href="/topic/Caligastia_one_hundred">loyal members of the staff</a>. The remainder of this noble band continued on earth to the end of their mortal days under the leadership of Van and Amadon. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>They were the descendants of <a href="/topic/Andonites">Andonites</a> who remained loyal with Van and Amadon; it is more cultural than racial term. Amadonites were esentially Andonites. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> They joined <a href="/topic/Nodites">Nodites</a> to become the Vanites. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> Nodites and Amadonites had a traditional enmity between them and they found exceedingly <a href="/topic/difficulties">difficult</a> to work together. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> </p>
