<p>First transaction recorded in Paradise is the personification of <a href="/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> The first entry appearing in the personality section in Paradise is the recital of the trinitization of twenty-one <a href="/topic/Ancients_of_Days">Ancients of Days</a>. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> Creation according to The Urantia Book </h2>
<p>At a hypothetical moment in eternity there was no differentiation in all of infinity. So <a href="/topic/Infinite_One_(The)">The Infinite One</a> differentiated itself from The Infinitude even continuing as the eternal continuum I AM. This culminates in the multiple differentiation of reality through a sevenfold relationship of I AM with itself. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> The universe philosophers postulate the <a href="/topic/eternity">eternity</a> existence of the I AM as the primal source of all reality. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Just as the original <a href="/topic/diversity">diversification</a> of the I AM must be attributed to inherent and self-contained volition, so must the promulgation of finite reality be ascribed to the volitional acts of Paradise Deity and to the repercussional adjustments of the functional triunities. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Eternal Son is the perfect and final expression of the “first” personal and absolute concept of the <a href="/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>. We say the “first” thought of God and we allude to an impossible time origin of the Eternal Son, but these events never occurred in sequence. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<h3> Creation of Infinite Spirit </h3>
<p>In the dawn of eternity both the Father and the Son become infinitely cognizant of their mutual interdependence, their eternal and absolute oneness; and therefore do they enter into an infinite and everlasting covenant of divine partnership. We are now face to face with the eternity origin of the Infinite Spirit, the <a href="/topic/Third_Person_of_Deity">Third Person of Deity</a>. <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<h3> Creation of Havona </h3>
<p><a href="/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a> functions and the dead vaults of space are astir. One billion perfect spheres flash into existence. Prior to this hypothetical eternity moment the space-energies inherent in Paradise are existent and potentially operative, but they have no actuality of being. <sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<h3> Creation of Urantia </h3>
<p>Urantia is of origin in our sun, and our sun is one of the multifarious offspring of the <a href="/topic/Andronover">Andronover</a> nebula, which was onetime organized as a component part of the physical power and material matter of the local universe of Nebadon. Andronover was initiated 875,000 millions of years ago. 6,000 millions of years ago Andronover breakups and our sun is born. <sup id="cite9"><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> Legends of creation </h2>
<p>The story of the creation of <a href="/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> in six days was based on the tradition of Adam and Eve. Many groups accepted this story of man’s clay origin by some form of special creation. <sup id="cite10"><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Babylonians, because of immediate contact with the remnants of the <a href="/topic/civilization">civilization</a> of the Adamites, enlarged and embellished the story of man’s creation; they taught that he had descended directly from the gods. <sup id="cite11"><a href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup> The <a href="/topic/Old_Testament">Old Testament</a> account of creation dates from long after the time of Moses; he never taught the Hebrews such a distorted story. <sup id="cite12"><a href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In his early teachings, Moses very wisely did not attempt to go back of Adam’s time, and since Moses was the supreme teacher of the <a href="/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a>, the stories of Adam became intimately associated with those of creation. <sup id="cite13"><a href="#fn13">[13]</a></sup> </p>
