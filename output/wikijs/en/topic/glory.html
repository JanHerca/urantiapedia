<p>The Second <a href="/topic/Isaiah_(first)">Isaiah</a> proclaimed that man was very closely related to God, saying: “Every one who is called by my name I have created for my glory, and they shall show forth my praise. I, even I, am he who blots out their transgressions for my own sake, and I will not remember their sins.”. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> <a href="/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> sought not his own glory but the glory of God. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> Some are tempted to <a href="/topic/love">love</a> the glory of men more than the glory of God. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Said Jesus: “If any man really <a href="/topic/desires">desires</a> to do my Father’s will, he shall certainly know about my teaching, whether it be God’s or whether I speak for myself. He who speaks for himself seeks his own glory, but when I declare the words of the Father, I thereby seek the glory of him who sent me. Seek in your daily lives, not self-glorification, but the glory of God.”. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
