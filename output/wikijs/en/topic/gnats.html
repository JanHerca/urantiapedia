<p>Jesus said once: “My people take themselves too seriously; they are just about devoid of an appreciation of humor. The burdensome religion of the <a href="/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> could never have had origin among a people with a sense of humor. They also lack consistency; they strain at gnats and swallow camels.”. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>And also: “Woe upon you, scribes and <a href="/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> and all other hypocrites who make sure that they tithe mint, anise, and cumin and at the same time disregard the weightier matters of the law—faith, mercy, and judgment! Within reason, the one you ought to have done but not to have left the other undone. You are truly blind guides and dumb teachers; you strain out the gnat and swallow the camel.”. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
