<p>During the <a href="/topic/Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> era, ammonites were a dominant marine species, with over a thousand species developing on the Californian Pacific coast and fossil remains found globally. They ranged in size from three to four inches, with some reaching eight feet in diameter, but their influence declined by the end of the period. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
