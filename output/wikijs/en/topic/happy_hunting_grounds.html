<p>Andites referred by the term “happy hunting grounds” to a supposed place after death. Inferior captives of the <a href="/topic/blue_race">blue race</a> who had been declared unfit, after an elaborate ceremony, were drowned in the river and told that they were being sent to “happy hunting grounds”. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
