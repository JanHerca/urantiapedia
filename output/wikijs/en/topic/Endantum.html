<p>Endantum is the seat of the 5th <a href="/topic/constellations">constellation</a> of Nebadon, just as Edentia is the seat of our constellation, the 70th. This is where Jesus, that is, Michael, made his sixth bestowal to his creatures in the form of a morontia mortal of evolutionary ascension. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
