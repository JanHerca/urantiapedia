<p>Bronze Age took place at ca. 3000 B.C., overlapping <a href="/topic/New_Stone_Age">New Stone Age</a> at times, a period associated with mother worship in some places and sun worship in others. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>It was not a distinct period. There was a bronze culture in Turkestan dating before 9000 B.C., and the Andites early learned to work in iron, gold, and copper, as well. But conditions were very different away from the more advanced centers of <a href="/topic/civilization">civilization</a>. There were no distinct periods, such as the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages; all three existed at the same time in different localities. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
