<p>Bronze Age took place at ca. 3000 B.C., overlapping <a href="/topic/New_Stone_Age">New Stone Age</a> at times, a period associated with mother <a href="/topic/worship">worship</a> in some places and <a href="/topic/sun_(Urantia’s)">sun</a> worship in others. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>It was not a distinct period. There was a <a href="/topic/bronze">bronze</a> <a href="/topic/culture">culture</a> in <a href="/topic/Turkestan">Turkestan</a> dating before 9000 B.C., and the <a href="/topic/Andites">Andites</a> early learned to work in <a href="/topic/iron_(metal)">iron</a>, <a href="/topic/gold">gold</a>, and <a href="/topic/copper">copper</a>, as well. But conditions were very different away from the more advanced centers of <a href="/topic/civilization">civilization</a>. There were no distinct periods, such as the Stone, Bronze, and <a href="/topic/Iron_Age">Iron</a> Ages; all <a href="/topic/three">three</a> existed at the same <a href="/topic/time">time</a> in different localities. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
