<p>Ascendant beings, like humans, living in planetary isolation are known by the name agondonters, which means evolutionary will creatures that can believe without seeing and persevere when isolated. This is the case with us, the inhabitants of Urantia. Along with the other isolated worlds, we are assigned our own residential sector on Jerusem and are soon entrusted with special tasks involving great trust. <a href="/topic/Tabamantia">Tabamantia</a> is an agondonter with finaliter status who survived in one of the quarantined spheres involved in the first rebellion that has ever taken place. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
