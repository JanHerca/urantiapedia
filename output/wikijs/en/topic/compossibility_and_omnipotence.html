<p>The <a href="/topic/omnipotence">omnipotence</a> of the Deity does not imply that anything, even meaningless to the Deity, exists. Compatibility is innate in divine power. Omnipotence is the origin not only of nature but of the nature of things, of the original pattern which everything created is then destined to follow. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
