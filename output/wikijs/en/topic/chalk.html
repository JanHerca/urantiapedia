<p>During the <a href="/topic/Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> period, chalk formations, derived from deposits of <a href="/topic/foraminifers">foraminifers</a>, predominated and gave the epoch its name. These deposits, which also include <a href="/topic/greensand_marl">greensand marl</a>, <a href="/topic/shale">shale</a>, <a href="/topic/sandstone">sandstone</a>, and small amounts of <a href="/topic/limestone">limestone</a>, reached thicknesses of 200 to <a href="/topic/10">10</a>,000 <a href="/topic/feet">feet</a> in regions such as the foothills of the <a href="/topic/Rocky_Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> and <a href="/topic/Europe">Europe</a>. These porous layers store <a href="/topic/water">water</a>, making them crucial for supplying arid regions today. Additionally, tectonic movements and associated volcanic activity contributed to significant crustal deformations, impacting Pacific coastal areas and mountain regions like the <a href="/topic/Andes_mountains">Andes</a>. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Cretaceous period marked the <a href="/topic/end">end</a> of major marine invasions, especially in <a href="/topic/North_America">North America</a>, where 24 extensive <a href="/topic/floods">inundations</a> had shaped the <a href="/topic/land">land</a>. Chalk formations from this <a href="/topic/time">time</a>, derived from marine deposits, remain prominent today. These include limestone now uplifted to 10,000 feet in the <a href="/topic/Alps">Alps</a>, 16,000 feet in the <a href="/topic/Himalayas">Himalayas</a>, and 20,000 feet in <a href="/topic/Tibet">Tibet</a>. Chalk deposits are also found along the coasts of <a href="/topic/Africa">Africa</a> and <a href="/topic/Australia">Australia</a>, the west coast of <a href="/topic/South_America">South America</a>, and around the <a href="/topic/West_Indies">West Indies</a>. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
