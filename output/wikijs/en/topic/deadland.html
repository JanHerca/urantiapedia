<p>It was once <a href="/topic/thought">thought</a> that the great desire of a ghost was to be quickly “laid” so that it might proceed undisturbed to deadland. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Fasting and other forms of <a href="/topic/self-denial">self-denial</a> were thought to be pleasing to the ghosts, who took pleasure in the discomfort of the living during the transition period of lurking about before their actual departure for deadland. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
