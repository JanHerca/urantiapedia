<p>About danger Jesus <a href="/topic/decisions">decided</a> to exercise normal watchcare over his human safety and to take reasonable precaution to prevent the untimely termination of his career in the flesh but to refrain from all superhuman intervention. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Jesus warned his <a href="/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a> not to expose themselves needlessly to peril when he was arrested, explaining that it was imperative that they stay behind to bear witness to the gospel when he was gone. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Pentecost endowed mortal man with the power to forgive personal injuries, to keep sweet in the midst of the gravest injustice, to remain unmoved in the face of appalling danger, and to <a href="/topic/doubt">challenge</a> the evils of hate and anger by the fearless acts of love and forbearance. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
