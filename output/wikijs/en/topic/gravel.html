<p>The deposits of the early <a href="/topic/Carboniferous">Carboniferous</a> age are from 500 to 2,000 feet thick, consisting of sandstone, shale, and limestone. The oldest strata yield the fossils of both land and marine animals and plants, along with much gravel and basin sediments. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
