<p>Gileadites were a reputed biblical tribe. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Pretentious Hebrew history begins with Saul’s rallying the northern clans to withstand an attack by the <a href="/topic/Ammonites">Ammonites</a> upon their fellow tribesmen—the Gileadites—east of the Jordan. With an army of a little more than three thousand he defeated the enemy, and it was this exploit that led the hill tribes to make him king. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
