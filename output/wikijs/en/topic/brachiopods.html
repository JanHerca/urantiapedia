<p>The brachiopods, marine <a href="/topic/organisms">organisms</a> with protective shells, flourished during the #<a href="/topic/3">3</a># period, with 3,000 varieties emerging, though only 200 survive today. They lived much as they do now, with hinged and notched shells for defense. Brachiopods coexisted with <a href="/topic/gastropods">gastropods</a>, <a href="/topic/mollusks">mollusks</a>, and <a href="/topic/coral">coral</a> reef builders in ancient seas, contributing significantly to <a href="/topic/limestone">limestone</a> formations from their calcified remains. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>As the <a href="/topic/Silurian">Silurian</a> seas advanced and retreated, marine ecosystems evolved. Fossil <a href="/topic/evidence">evidence</a> shows brachiopods and other <a href="/topic/marine_life">marine life</a> thrived even near the poles, where warm seas bathed the shorelines. Toward the <a href="/topic/end">end</a> of the epoch, brachiopods declined, succeeded by <a href="/topic/arthropods">arthropods</a> and <a href="/topic/cephalopods">cephalopods</a>, signaling a shift in oceanic dominance. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
