<h2> Ancient ritual </h2>
<p>Ancients treated <a href="/topic/disease">disease</a> with fasting. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> Fasting can induce mystic state. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> Renunciation came as the next step in religious <a href="/topic/evolution">evolution</a>; fasting was a common practice. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Next came the practice of ritual vows, soon to be followed by religious pledges and sacred oaths. Most of these oaths were accompanied by <a href="/topic/self-torture">self-torture</a> and self-mutilation; later on, by fasting and prayer. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> Fasting and other forms of <a href="/topic/self-denial">self-denial</a> were thought to be pleasing to the ghosts, who took pleasure in the discomfort of the living. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Sacrifice as a part of religious devotions, like many other worshipful rituals, did not have a simple and single origin. As <a href="/topic/civilization">civilization</a> advanced, these crude concepts of sacrifice were elevated to the level of the rituals of self-abnegation, asceticism, fasting, deprivation, and the later Christian doctrine of sanctification through sorrow, suffering, and the mortification of the flesh. <sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> Isaiah </h2>
<p>For Isaiah, acceptable fasting was not afflicting the soul, bowing the head, or dressing in sackloth. What he asked was to loosen the bonds of <a href="/topic/wickedness">wickedness</a>, undo the knots of heavy burdens, let the oppressed go free, break every yoke, share bread with the hungry, bring home the homeless poor. <sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<h2> Jesus </h2>
<p>Jesus ate frugally while on <a href="/topic/Mount_Hermon">Mount Hermon</a>; but he abstained from all food only a day or two at a time. <sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Fasting is not part of gospel. Nazarites refused to accept Jesus as a teacher sent from heaven because he did not teach fasting and other forms of <a href="/topic/self-denial">self-denial</a>. Jesus said: “In the old order you fasted and prayed; as the new creature of the rebirth of the spirit, you are taught to believe and rejoice”. <sup id="cite9"><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<p>It is most dangerous to knowingly engage in spiritual fasting in order to improve one’s appetite for spiritual <a href="/topic/endowments">endowments</a>. Prolonged fasting, either physical or spiritual, tends to destroy hunger. <sup id="cite10"><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup> </p>
