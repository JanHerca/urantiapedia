<p>While the apostles were baptizing believers, Jesus spoke to those who remained. A young man asked Jesus to intervene in a dispute over <a href="/topic/inheritance">inheritance</a> with his brother. Jesus used this opportunity to teach about the dangers of greed and the importance of spiritual wealth. He told the parable of a rich man who stored up earthly wealth but neglected his spiritual life, only to lose everything when he died suddenly. Jesus emphasized that wealth itself is not a sin, but the love of wealth can blind one to spiritual realities. He concluded by stating that wealth should be used responsibly and generously, and that one's true treasure should be in heaven. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
