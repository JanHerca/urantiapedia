<p>Centipedes emerged early in the evolution of multicellular life, developing alongside other organisms such as starfish, sea urchins, insects, and <a href="/topic/crustaceans">crustaceans</a>. These creatures represent one of the groups that survived the long evolutionary struggle, although many other species perished. Centipedes, along with other early animals like earthworms and mollusks, are considered stationary branches in the evolutionary tree, reflecting life forms that ceased to progress significantly over time. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
