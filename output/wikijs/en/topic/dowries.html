<p>Many <a href="/topic/tribes">tribes</a> allowed rulers to have <a href="/topic/sex">sex</a> relations with a <a href="/topic/brides">bride</a> just before she was to be given to her husband. The dowry consisted of the presents received in <a href="/topic/reward">reward</a> for her sex <a href="/topic/conscription">service</a> in the bride’s exhibition hall. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>At <a href="/topic/first">first</a>, it was the custom for the <a href="/topic/man">man</a> to go to <a href="/topic/Claudia_Procula">his wife</a>’s people, but in later times, after a man had paid or worked out the bride price, he could take his wife and <a href="/topic/children">children</a> back to his own people. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Many of the better classes of <a href="/topic/women">women</a> collected their dowries by temporary sex <a href="/topic/service">service</a> in the temples, and most men preferred to have such women for <a href="/topic/wives">wives</a>. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>As <a href="/topic/civilization">civilization</a> progressed, <a href="/topic/fathers">fathers</a> did not like to appear to sell their daughters and used presents instead of <a href="/topic/money">money</a>. And upon the later discontinuance of payment for the bride, these presents became the bride’s dowry. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The idea of a dowry was to convey the impression of the <a href="/topic/brides">bride</a>’s independence, to suggest far removal from the times of slave wives and property companions. A man could not <a href="/topic/divorce">divorce</a> a dowered wife without paying back the dowry in full. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> </p>
