<p>Many tribes allowed rulers to have sex relations with a bride just before she was to be given to her husband. The dowry consisted of the presents received in reward for her sex <a href="/topic/conscription">service</a> in the bride’s exhibition hall. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>At first, it was the custom for the man to go to his wife’s people, but in later times, after a man had paid or worked out the bride price, he could take his wife and <a href="/topic/children">children</a> back to his own people. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Many of the better classes of women collected their dowries by temporary sex <a href="/topic/conscription">service</a> in the temples, and most men preferred to have such women for wives. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>As <a href="/topic/civilization">civilization</a> progressed, fathers did not like to appear to sell their daughters and used presents instead of money. And upon the later discontinuance of payment for the bride, these presents became the bride’s dowry. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The idea of a dowry was to convey the impression of the bride’s independence, to suggest far removal from the times of slave wives and property companions. A man could not <a href="/topic/divorce">divorce</a> a dowered wife without paying back the dowry in full. <sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> </p>
