<p>There is the same relative distance, in comparison with actual size, between the atomic nucleus and the inner <a href="/topic/electrons">electronic</a> circuit as exists between the inner planet, Mercury, and your sun. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>If the mass of an <a href="/topic/electrons">electron</a> were 2.8 grams, the volume of that electron would be as large as that of the Earth. If the volume of a proton were like the head of a pin, the head of a pin would have a diameter equal to that of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Stars have just as much comparative elbow room in space as one dozen oranges would have if they were circulating about throughout the interior of <a href="/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>, and were the planet a hollow globe. <sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> Some of the reddish have acquired a <a href="/topic/density">density</a> at their center that one cubic inch of such a star, if on Urantia, would weigh six thousand pounds. <sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
