<p>Aden is a <a href="/topic/strange_preacher">strange preacher</a> of the gospel who was converted by Amos of Jeresa, the madman whom Jesus had supposedly cured of a possession. The apostle John forbade him to preach, but he ignored it and managed to gather a considerable group of believers, continuing his preaching in Mesopotamia. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
