_The Urantia Book_ Encyclopedia consists of a series of web pages, one for each specific subject or topic in _The Urantia Book_, that compile all relevant information that appears in the book on that topic. It is based on earlier work by the Fellowship called [_Topical Index_](https://archive.urantiabook.org/urantiabook/topical_index/index.htm), but this work is only an index. The creation of the Encyclopedia goes much further by forming a more complete and comprehensible, as well as linked text of all the topics listed in the index.

The topic pages are attempted to be automatically linked when content from _The Urantia Book_ or the _Bible_ is uploaded using the _Urantiapedia Tools_ software, which is responsible for generating these pages. Thus _The Urantia Book_ (and in the future the _Bible_) have added links in the text that lead to the Encyclopedia, and conversely, one can go from the pages of the Encyclopedia to the paragraphs of _The Urantia Book_ or the _Bible_ that have been mentioned in each topic.

Some examples of topics are concepts like [absonity](/en/topic/absonity), or people like [Grandfanda](/en/topic/Grandfanda), or types of beings like [Thought Adjusters](/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters), or places like [Nazareth](/en/topic/Nazareth) or [Orvonton](/en/topic/Orvonton_(superuniverse)), or events like the [arrival of Adam and Eve](/en/topic/Adam#arrival-of-adam-and-eve), etc.

There is currently a catalogue of more than 4,000 terms created, and a first version of them is being created in Spanish, English and French. Once this first version in these languages ​​is finished, an appropriate technical mechanism will be sought to facilitate the translation into the rest of the languages.

To learn more about how the Encyclopedia is being organized in the project, consult the [Help of Urantiapedia](/en/help/content).
