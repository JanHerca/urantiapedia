## Description

“Joseph and Aseneth”

_From “Joseph and Asenath”,  E.W. Brooks (1918)_

Joseph and Aseneth is a narrative that dates from between 200 BCE and 200 CE. It concerns the Hebrew patriarch Joseph and his marriage to Asenath, expanding the fleeting mentions of their relationship in the Book of Genesis. The text was translated widely, including into Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Early Modern German, Latin, Middle English, Old French, Romanian, Serbian and Syriac.

Chr. Burchard writes: “JosAsen appears to have originated in the Jewish diaspora of Egypt, no later than _c_. AD 100 and perhaps as early as the first century BC. A sectarian milieu has been suggested: Essenes, Therapeutae, or some unknown form of Judaism shaped in the iamge of a hellenistic mystery religion. But the book presents Judaism, not a special form distinct from others. According to some scholars, it was written to promote Jewish mission among non-Jews, or Jews, or both. However, Judaism as depicted in JosAsen is not mission-minded. Besides the book never bothers to explain Jewish life. The sabbath, circumcision, the interdiction against pork, the standards of levitical purity, indeed the necessity of keeping the Law, which is fundamental to all forms of Judaism, go unmentioned. So it is safer to assume that JosAsen was meant to be read by Jews as a reminder of the supernatural vitality and lofty morality which were theirs. We should remember, however, that the Egyptian diaspora undoubtedly included many proselytes and attracted 'God-fearing' sympathizers such as we know, e.g., from the Book of Acts.” (_Outside the Old Testament_, p. 94)

James Charlesworth writes: “That Joseph and Asenath is a fifth-century Christian work, based upon a Jewish writing, is a dated conclusion (P. Batiffol, _Le Livre de la Prière d'Asénath_ \[Studia Patristica 1-2\] Paris: Leroux, 1889-1890). That it is an early, perhaps late first-century A.D., Jewish composition is a contemporary perspective (cf. C. Burchard, _Untersuchungen zu Joseph und Aseneth_ \[WUNT 8\] Tübingen: Mohr, 1965; see esp. pp. 148-51; Philonenko, no. 1003; A.-M. Denis, no. 24, pp. 40-48). Most scholars now contend that the original language is Greek (Burchard, _Untersuch_., pp. 91-99; Philonenko, no. 1003, pp. 27-32). The parallels with the Dead Sea Scrolls have raised the possibility of influence from the Essenes, or more probably from the Therapeutae; some scholars affirm a relationship (P. Riessler, no. 62, p. 1303; K. G. Kuhn in _The Scrolls and the New Testament_, ed. K. Stendhal. New York: Harper, 1957; pp. 75f.; M. Delcor, 'Un roman d'amour d'origine thérapeute: le livre de Joseph et Asénath,' _BLE_ 63 \[1962\] 3-27); others deny it (Philonenko, no. 1003, p. 105; Burchard, _Untersuch_., pp. 107-12).” (_The Pseudepigrapha and Modern Research_, p. 137)
