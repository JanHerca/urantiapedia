## Description

“The Lives of the Prophets”

_From “The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, Vol. 2”, James H. Charlesworth (1985)_

The Lives of the Prophets is an ancient apocryphal account of the lives of the prophets of the Old Testament. It is not regarded as scripture by any Jewish or Christian denomination. The work may have been known by the author of some of the Pauline epistles, as there are similarities in the descriptions of the fates of the prophets, although without naming the individuals concerned.

Raymond F. Surburg writes: “The Lives of the Prophets is an account of the Hebrew prophets, each of whom is portrayed as telling where he was born, to what tribe he belonged, and where he was buried. The Biblical materials about the prophet's life are not repeated but supplemented. Many legendary stories have been added. This holds true in the biographies of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Jonah, and Habakkuk, while those of other prophets are short and as a rule contain extra-Biblical material.” (_Introduction to the Intertestamental Period_, p. 135)

James Charlesworth writes: “The original text was probably composed from diverse and ancient oral traditions sometime just prior to or in the first century A.D. (T. Schermann, _Peropheten- und Apostellegenden nebst Jüngerkatalogen des Dorotheus und verwandter Texte_ \[TU 31.3\] Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1907; pp. 119, 126; Torrey, _Lives_, p. 11; _idem, Apoc. Lit._, p. 135; R. H. Pfeiffer, _IB_ 1 \[1952\] 425). The original language is probably Hebrew (Schermann in TU 31.3, pp. 130-33; Torrey, _Lives_, pp. 1, 7, 16f.; _idem, Apoc. Lit._, pp. 135-40; Pfeiffer in _IB_ 1 \[1952\] 425. Schermann noted it might be Syriac and Hall argued for a Syriac original, _JBL_ 7 \[1887\] 38f.), or possibly Greek (cf. A.-M. Denis, no. 24, p. 89; M. E. Stone, no. 1229). The author, who was apparently more a compiler of legends—some of which he missed (cf. L. Ginzberg, _Legende_, _ad. loc. cit._)—probably lived in Jerusalem, since there is convincing evidence that he was intimately familiar with Jerusalem, Judaean, and Palestinian topography and geography. The Jeremiah legends, however, betray an Egyptian provenance. Christian additions abound in the various recensions, but the only ancient ones are in the life of Jeremiah, verses 7-8 and 10 (cf. only vaguely possible Christian interpolations in Hosea, vs. 2, and in Habakkuk, vss. 11-14).” (_The Pseudepigrapha and Modern Research_, pp. 178-177)
