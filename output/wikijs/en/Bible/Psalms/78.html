<p> Maschil of Asaph. </p>
<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Give ear, O my people, to my law: Incline your ears to the words of my mouth. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings of old, </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  Which we have heard and known, And our fathers have told us. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  We will not hide them from their children, Telling to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah, And his strength, and his wondrous works that he hath done. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  For he established a testimony in Jacob, And appointed a law in Israel, Which he commanded our fathers, That they should make them known to their children; </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  That the generation to come might know [them], even the children that should be born; Who should arise and tell [them] to their children, </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  That they might set their hope in God, And not forget the works of God, But keep his commandments, </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  And might not be as their fathers, A stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation that set not their heart aright, And whose spirit was not stedfast with God. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, Turned back in the day of battle. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  They kept not the covenant of God, And refused to walk in his law; </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  And they forgat his doings, And his wondrous works that he had showed them. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. </p>
<p id="v13"><sup><small>13</small></sup>  He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through; And he made the waters to stand as a heap. </p>
<p id="v14"><sup><small>14</small></sup>  In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, And all the night with a light of fire. </p>
<p id="v15"><sup><small>15</small></sup>  He clave rocks in the wilderness, And gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths. </p>
<p id="v16"><sup><small>16</small></sup>  He brought streams also out of the rock, And caused waters to run down like rivers. </p>
<p id="v17"><sup><small>17</small></sup>  Yet went they on still to sin against him, To rebel against the Most High in the desert. <sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v18"><sup><small>18</small></sup>  And they tempted God in their heart By asking food according to their desire. </p>
<p id="v19"><sup><small>19</small></sup>  Yea, they spake against God; They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness? </p>
<p id="v20"><sup><small>20</small></sup>  Behold, he smote the rock, so that waters gushed out, And streams overflowed; Can he give bread also? Will he provide flesh for his people? </p>
<p id="v21"><sup><small>21</small></sup>  Therefore Jehovah heard, and was wroth; And a fire was kindled against Jacob, And anger also went up against Israel; </p>
<p id="v22"><sup><small>22</small></sup>  Because they believed not in God, And trusted not in his salvation. </p>
<p id="v23"><sup><small>23</small></sup>  Yet he commanded the skies above, And opened the doors of heaven; </p>
<p id="v24"><sup><small>24</small></sup>  And he rained down manna upon them to eat, And gave them food from heaven. </p>
<p id="v25"><sup><small>25</small></sup>  Man did eat the bread of the mighty: He sent them food to the full. </p>
<p id="v26"><sup><small>26</small></sup>  He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens; And by his power he guided the south wind. </p>
<p id="v27"><sup><small>27</small></sup>  He rained flesh also upon them as the dust, And winged birds as the sand of the seas: </p>
<p id="v28"><sup><small>28</small></sup>  And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, Round about their habitations. </p>
<p id="v29"><sup><small>29</small></sup>  So they did eat, and were well filled; And he gave them their own desire. </p>
<p id="v30"><sup><small>30</small></sup>  They were not estranged from that which they desired, Their food was yet in their mouths, </p>
<p id="v31"><sup><small>31</small></sup>  When the anger of God went up against them, And slew of the fattest of them, And smote down the young men of Israel. </p>
<p id="v32"><sup><small>32</small></sup>  For all this they sinned still, And believed not in his wondrous works. </p>
<p id="v33"><sup><small>33</small></sup>  Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, And their years in terror. </p>
<p id="v34"><sup><small>34</small></sup>  When he slew them, then they inquired after him; And they returned and sought God earnestly. </p>
<p id="v35"><sup><small>35</small></sup>  And they remembered that God was their rock, And the Most High God their redeemer. </p>
<p id="v36"><sup><small>36</small></sup>  But they flattered him with their mouth, And lied unto him with their tongue. <sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="v37"><sup><small>37</small></sup>  For their heart was not right with him, Neither were they faithful in his covenant. </p>
<p id="v38"><sup><small>38</small></sup>  But he, being merciful, forgave [their] iniquity, and destroyed [them] not: Yea, many a time turned he his anger away, And did not stir up all his wrath. </p>
<p id="v39"><sup><small>39</small></sup>  And he remembered that they were but flesh, A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. </p>
<p id="v40"><sup><small>40</small></sup>  How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness, And grieve him in the desert! </p>
<p id="v41"><sup><small>41</small></sup>  And they turned again and tempted God, And provoked the Holy One of Israel. </p>
<p id="v42"><sup><small>42</small></sup>  They remember not his hand, Nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary; </p>
<p id="v43"><sup><small>43</small></sup>  How he set his signs in Egypt, And his wonders in the field of Zoan, </p>
<p id="v44"><sup><small>44</small></sup>  And turned their rivers into blood, And their streams, so that they could not drink. </p>
<p id="v45"><sup><small>45</small></sup>  He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; And frogs, which destroyed them. </p>
<p id="v46"><sup><small>46</small></sup>  He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, And their labor unto the locust. </p>
<p id="v47"><sup><small>47</small></sup>  He destroyed their vines with hail, And their sycomore-trees with frost. </p>
<p id="v48"><sup><small>48</small></sup>  He gave over their cattle also to the hail, And their flocks to hot thunderbolts. </p>
<p id="v49"><sup><small>49</small></sup>  He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, Wrath, and indignation, and trouble, A band of angels of evil. </p>
<p id="v50"><sup><small>50</small></sup>  He made a path for his anger; He spared not their soul from death, But gave their life over to the pestilence, </p>
<p id="v51"><sup><small>51</small></sup>  And smote all the first-born in Egypt, The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham. </p>
<p id="v52"><sup><small>52</small></sup>  But he led forth his own people like sheep, And guided them in the wilderness like a flock. </p>
<p id="v53"><sup><small>53</small></sup>  And he led them safely, so that they feared not; But the sea overwhelmed their enemies. </p>
<p id="v54"><sup><small>54</small></sup>  And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, To this mountain, which his right hand had gotten. </p>
<p id="v55"><sup><small>55</small></sup>  He drove out the nations also before them, And allotted them for an inheritance by line, And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. </p>
<p id="v56"><sup><small>56</small></sup>  Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, And kept not his testimonies; </p>
<p id="v57"><sup><small>57</small></sup>  But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers: They were turned aside like a deceitful bow. </p>
<p id="v58"><sup><small>58</small></sup>  For they provoked him to anger with their high places, And moved him to jealousy with their graven images. </p>
<p id="v59"><sup><small>59</small></sup>  When God heard [this], he was wroth, And greatly abhorred Israel; </p>
<p id="v60"><sup><small>60</small></sup>  So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, The tent which he placed among men; </p>
<p id="v61"><sup><small>61</small></sup>  And delivered his strength into captivity, And his glory into the adversary's hand. </p>
<p id="v62"><sup><small>62</small></sup>  He gave his people over also unto the sword, And was wroth with his inheritance. </p>
<p id="v63"><sup><small>63</small></sup>  Fire devoured their young men; And their virgins had no marriage-song. </p>
<p id="v64"><sup><small>64</small></sup>  Their priests fell by the sword; And their widows made no lamentation. </p>
<p id="v65"><sup><small>65</small></sup>  Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, Like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. </p>
<p id="v66"><sup><small>66</small></sup>  And he smote his adversaries backward: He put them to a perpetual reproach. </p>
<p id="v67"><sup><small>67</small></sup>  Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph, And chose not the tribe of Ephraim, </p>
<p id="v68"><sup><small>68</small></sup>  But chose the tribe of Judah, The mount Zion which he loved. </p>
<p id="v69"><sup><small>69</small></sup>  And he built his sanctuary like the heights, Like the earth which he hath established for ever. </p>
<p id="v70"><sup><small>70</small></sup>  He chose David also his servant, And took him from the sheepfolds: </p>
<p id="v71"><sup><small>71</small></sup>  From following the ewes that have their young he brought him, To be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. </p>
<p id="v72"><sup><small>72</small></sup>  So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, And guided them by the skilfulness of his hands. </p>
