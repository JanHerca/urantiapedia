<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  Oh come, let us sing unto Jehovah; Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; Let us make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  For Jehovah is a great God, And a great King above all gods. </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  In his hand are the deep places of the earth; The heights of the mountains are his also. </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  The sea is his, and he made it; And his hands formed the dry land. </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  Oh come, let us worship and bow down; Let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker: </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  For he is our God, And we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To-day, oh that ye would hear his voice! </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, As in the day of Massah in the wilderness; </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  When your fathers tempted me, Proved me, and saw my work. </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  Forty years long was I grieved with [that] generation, And said, It is a people that do err in their heart, And they have not known my ways: </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Wherefore I sware in my wrath, That they should not enter into my rest. </p>
