<p id="v1"><sup><small>1</small></sup>  And the chief-captain departed from before the face of God, and went down to Abraham to the oak of Mamre, and found the righteous Abraham in the field close by, sitting beside yokes of oxen for ploughing, together with the sons of Masek and other servants, to the number of twelve. </p>
<p id="v2"><sup><small>2</small></sup>  And behold the chief-captain came to him, and Abraham, seeing the chief-captain Michael coming from afar, like to a very comely warrior, arose and met him as was his custom, meeting and entertaining all strangers. </p>
<p id="v3"><sup><small>3</small></sup>  And the chief-captain saluted him and said: “Hail, most honored father, righteous soul chosen of God, true son of the heavenly one.” </p>
<p id="v4"><sup><small>4</small></sup>  Abraham said to the chief-captain: “Hail, most honored warrior, bright as the sun and most beautiful above all the sons of men; you are welcome; </p>
<p id="v5"><sup><small>5</small></sup>  therefore I beseech your presence, tell me whence the youth of your age has come; teach me, your suppliant, whence and from what army and from what journey your beauty has come hither.” </p>
<p id="v6"><sup><small>6</small></sup>  The chief-captain said: “I, O righteous Abraham, come from the great city. I have been sent by the great king to take the place of a good friend of his, for the king has summoned him.” </p>
<p id="v7"><sup><small>7</small></sup>  And Abraham said, “Come, my Lord, go with me as far as my field”. The chief-captain said: “I come”; </p>
<p id="v8"><sup><small>8</small></sup>  and going into the field of the ploughing, they sat down beside the company. </p>
<p id="v9"><sup><small>9</small></sup>  And Abraham said to his servants, the sons of Masek: “Go to the herd of horses, and bring two horses, quiet, and gentle and tame, so that I and this stranger may sit thereon.” </p>
<p id="v10"><sup><small>10</small></sup>  But the chief-captain said, “Nay, my Lord, Abraham, let them not bring horses, for I abstain from ever sitting upon any four-footed beast. </p>
<p id="v11"><sup><small>11</small></sup>  Is not my king rich in much merchandise, having power both over men and all kinds of cattle? But I abstain from ever sitting upon any four-footed beast. </p>
<p id="v12"><sup><small>12</small></sup>  Let us go, then, O righteous soul, walking lightly until we reach your house.” And Abraham said, “Amen, be it so.” </p>
