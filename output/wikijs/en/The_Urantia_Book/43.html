<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p1_2">43:1.2</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/water">water</a> of Edentia and similar architectural spheres is no different from the water of the evolutionary planets. The water systems of such spheres are both surface and subterranean, and the moisture is in constant circulation. Edentia can be circumnavigated via these various water routes, though the chief channel of <a href="/en/topic/transportation">transportation</a> is the atmosphere. Spirit beings would naturally travel above the surface of the sphere, while the morontia and material beings make use of material and semimaterial means to negotiate atmospheric passage.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_2_2"><a href="#fn_s1_2_2">[1]</a></sup></p>

But while this atmosphere is both material and morontial, there are no <a href="/en/topic/storms">storms</a> or hurricanes; neither is there summer nor winter. This absence of atmospheric disturbances and of <a href="/en/topic/seasons">seasonal</a> variation makes it possible to embellish all outdoors on these especially created worlds.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_3_20"><a href="#fn_a1_3_20">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p1_4">43:1.4</a></small></sup>  The Edentia highlands are magnificent physical features, and their beauty is enhanced by the endless profusion of life which abounds throughout their length and breadth. Excepting a few rather isolated structures, these highlands contain no work of creature hands. Material and morontial ornamentations are limited to the dwelling areas. The lesser elevations are the sites of special residences and are beautifully embellished with both biologic and morontia art.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p1_5">43:1.5</a></small></sup>  Situated on the summit of the seventh highland range are the resurrection halls of <a href="/en/topic/Edentia">Edentia</a>, wherein awaken the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortals</a> of the secondary modified order of ascension. These chambers of creature reassembly are under the supervision of the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_Sons">Melchizedeks</a>. The first of the receiving spheres of Edentia (like the planet <a href="/en/topic/Machiventa_Melchizedek">Melchizedek</a> near <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a>) also has special resurrection halls, wherein the <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of the modified orders of ascension are reassembled.</p>

The other, the bestowal school, is dedicated to the mastery of the new problems arising out of the fact that <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a> made his final bestowal on one of the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_worlds">worlds</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Norlatiadek">Norlatiadek</a>.

<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p1_9">43:1.9</a></small></sup>  The morontia area assigned to <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortals</a> resident on <a href="/en/topic/Edentia">Edentia</a> is located in the mid-zone of the thirty-fifth triangle adjoining the headquarters of the <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliters</a>, situated in the thirty-sixth triangle. The general headquarters of the <a href="/en/topic/univitatia">univitatia</a> occupies an enormous area in the mid-region of the thirty-fourth triangle immediately adjoining the residential reservation of the morontia citizens. From these arrangements it may be seen that provision is made for the accommodation of at least seventy major divisions of celestial life, and also that each of these seventy triangular areas is correlated with some one of the seventy major spheres of morontia training.</p>

<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. THE CONSTELLATION GOVERNMENT </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p2_1">43:2.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/constellations">constellations</a> are the autonomous units of a <a href="/en/topic/local_universes">local universe</a>, each constellation being administered according to its own legislative enactments. When the courts of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> sit in judgment on universe affairs, all internal matters are adjudicated in accordance with the laws prevailing in the constellation concerned. These judicial decrees of <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a>, together with the legislative enactments of the constellations, are executed by the administrators of the <a href="/en/topic/local_systems">local systems</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p2_2">43:2.2</a></small></sup>  Constellations thus function as the legislative or lawmaking units, while the local systems serve as the executive or enforcement units. The Salvington government is the supreme judicial and co-ordinating authority.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p2_3">43:2.3</a></small></sup>  While the supreme judicial function rests with the central administration of a local universe, there are two subsidiary but major tribunals at the headquarters of each <a href="/en/topic/constellations">constellation</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Machiventa_Melchizedek">Melchizedek</a> council and the court of the <a href="/en/topic/Most_High">Most High</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p2_4">43:2.4</a></small></sup>  All judicial problems are first reviewed by the council of the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_Sons">Melchizedeks</a>. Twelve of this order who have had certain requisite experience on the evolutionary planets and on the system headquarters <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_worlds">worlds</a> are empowered to review evidence, digest pleas, and formulate provisional verdicts, which are passed on to the court of the Most High, the reigning <a href="/en/topic/Constellation_Fathers">Constellation Father</a>. The mortal division of this latter tribunal consists of seven judges, all of whom are <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascendant mortals</a>.

The legislative program of a constellation originates in the lower house of ascenders, a group presided over by a <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliter</a> and consisting of one thousand representative mortals. Each system nominates ten members to sit in this deliberative assembly. On <a href="/en/topic/Edentia">Edentia</a> this body is not fully recruited at the present time.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p2_6">43:2.6</a></small></sup>  The mid-chamber of legislators is composed of the <a href="/en/topic/seraphic_hosts">seraphic hosts</a> and their associates, other children of the <a href="/en/topic/local_universe_Mother_Spirits">local universe Mother Spirit</a>. This group numbers one hundred and is nominated by the supervising personalities who preside over the various activities of such beings as they function within the constellation.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p2_7">43:2.7</a></small></sup>  The advisory or highest body of <a href="/en/topic/constellations">constellation</a> legislators consists of the house of peers—the house of the divine Sons. This corps is chosen by the <a href="/en/topic/Most_High">Most High</a> Fathers and numbers ten. Only Sons of special experience may serve in this upper house. This is the fact-finding and timesaving group which very effectively serves both of the lower divisions of the legislative assembly.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p2_8">43:2.8</a></small></sup>  The combined council of legislators consists of three members from each of these separate branches of the constellation deliberative assembly and is presided over by the reigning junior Most High. This group sanctions the final form of all enactments and authorizes their promulgation by the <a href="/en/topic/broadcasters_(superior_seraphim)">broadcasters</a>. The approval of this supreme commission renders legislative enactments the <a href="/en/topic/law">law</a> of the realm; their acts are final.
