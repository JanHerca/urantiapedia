<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p1_1">5:1.1</a></small></sup>  The inability of the finite creature to approach the infinite Father is inherent, not in the Father’s aloofness, but in the finiteness and material limitations of created beings. The magnitude of the spiritual difference between the highest personality of universe existence and the lower groups of created intelligences is inconceivable.

They would there be just as oblivious of the presence of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a> as where they now are. There is a long, long road ahead of mortal man before he can consistently and within the realms of possibility ask for safe conduct into the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> presence of the Universal Father.
