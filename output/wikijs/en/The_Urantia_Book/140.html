<p id="p8_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_2">140:8.2</a></small></sup>  1. <i>Doing the Father’s will.</i> Jesus’ teaching to trust in the overcare of the heavenly Father was not a blind and passive <a href="/en/topic/fatalism">fatalism</a>. He quoted with approval, on this afternoon, an old Hebrew saying: “He who will not work shall not eat<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b64"><a href="#fn_b64">[64]</a></sup>.” He pointed to his own experience as sufficient commentary on his teachings. His precepts about trusting the Father must not be adjudged by the social or economic conditions of modern times or any other age. His instruction embraces the ideal principles of living near <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> in all ages and on all worlds.</p>
<p id="p8_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_3">140:8.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> made clear to the three the difference between the requirements of apostleship and discipleship. And even then he did not forbid the exercise of prudence and foresight by the twelve. What he preached against was not forethought but <a href="/en/topic/anxiety">anxiety</a>, worry. He taught the active and alert <a href="/en/topic/submission">submission</a> to God’s will. In answer to many of their questions regarding frugality and thriftiness, he simply called attention to his life as carpenter, boatmaker, and fisherman, and to his careful organization of the twelve. He sought to make it clear that the world is not to be regarded as an enemy; that the <a href="/en/topic/circumstances">circumstances</a> of life constitute a divine dispensation working along with the children of God.</p>
<p id="p8_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_4">140:8.4</a></small></sup>  Jesus had great difficulty in getting them to understand his personal practice of <a href="/en/topic/nonresistance">nonresistance</a>. He absolutely refused to defend himself, and it appeared to the apostles that he would be pleased if they would pursue the same policy. He taught them not to resist evil, not to combat <a href="/en/topic/injustice">injustice</a> or injury, but he did not teach passive tolerance of wrongdoing. And he made it plain on this afternoon that he approved of the social punishment of evildoers and criminals, and that the civil <a href="/en/topic/government">government</a> must sometimes <a href="/en/topic/compulsion">employ force</a> for the maintenance of social order and in the execution of justice.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a65"><a href="#fn_a65">[65]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a66"><a href="#fn_a66">[66]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p8_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_5">140:8.5</a></small></sup>  He never ceased to warn his disciples against the evil practice of <i>retaliation</i>; he made no allowance for <a href="/en/topic/revenge">revenge</a>, the idea of getting even. He deplored the holding of grudges. He disallowed the idea of an <a href="/en/topic/eyes">eye</a> for an eye and a tooth for a tooth<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b65"><a href="#fn_b65">[65]</a></sup>. He discountenanced the whole concept of private and personal revenge, assigning these matters to civil government, on the one hand, and to the judgment of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, on the other<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b66"><a href="#fn_b66">[66]</a></sup>. He made it clear to the three that his teachings applied to the <i>individual,</i> not the state. He summarized his instructions up to that time regarding these matters, as:</p>
<p id="p8_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_6">140:8.6</a></small></sup>  Love your <a href="/en/topic/enemies">enemies</a>—remember the moral claims of human brotherhood<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b67"><a href="#fn_b67">[67]</a></sup>.</p>

<p id="p8_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_9">140:8.9</a></small></sup>  2. <i>Political attitude.</i> He cautioned his apostles to be discreet in their remarks concerning the strained relations then existing between the Jewish people and the Roman <a href="/en/topic/government">government</a>; he forbade them to become in any way embroiled in these difficulties. He was always careful to avoid the political snares of his enemies, ever making reply, “Render to Caesar the things which are Caesar’s and to <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> the things which are God’s<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b70"><a href="#fn_b70">[70]</a></sup>.” He refused to have his attention <a href="/en/topic/distractions">diverted</a> from his mission of establishing a new way of salvation; he would not permit himself to be concerned about anything else. In his personal life he was always duly observant of all civil laws and regulations; in all his public teachings he ignored the civic, social, and economic realms. He told the three apostles that he was concerned only with the principles of man’s inner and personal spiritual life.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a68"><a href="#fn_a68">[68]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a69"><a href="#fn_a69">[69]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a70"><a href="#fn_a70">[70]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a71"><a href="#fn_a71">[71]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p8_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_10">140:8.10</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was not, therefore, a political reformer. He did not come to reorganize the world; even if he had done this, it would have been applicable only to that day and generation. Nevertheless, he did show man the best way of living, and no generation is exempt from the labor of discovering how best to adapt Jesus’ life to its own problems. But never make the mistake of identifying Jesus’ teachings with any political or economic theory, with any social or industrial system.</p>
<p id="p8_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_11">140:8.11</a></small></sup>  3. <i>Social attitude.</i> The Jewish rabbis had long debated the question: Who is my <a href="/en/topic/neighbor">neighbor</a>? Jesus came presenting the idea of active and spontaneous kindness, a love of one’s fellow men so genuine that it expanded the neighborhood to include the whole world, thereby making all men one’s neighbors<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b71"><a href="#fn_b71">[71]</a></sup>. But with all this, Jesus was interested only in the <a href="/en/topic/individual">individual</a>, not the mass. Jesus was not a sociologist, but he did labor to break down all forms of selfish <a href="/en/topic/isolation">isolation</a>. He taught pure sympathy, compassion. <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael of Nebadon</a> is a mercy-dominated Son; compassion is his very nature.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a72"><a href="#fn_a72">[72]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a73"><a href="#fn_a73">[73]</a></sup></p>

He did not teach his apostles that they were to be imposed upon by social parasites or professional alms-seekers. The nearest he came to making sociological pronouncements was to say, “Judge not, that you be not judged<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b73"><a href="#fn_b73">[73]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p8_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_13">140:8.13</a></small></sup>  He made it clear that indiscriminate <a href="/en/topic/tenderness">kindness</a> may be blamed for many social evils. The following day Jesus definitely instructed Judas that no apostolic funds were to be given out as alms except upon his request or upon the joint petition of two of the apostles. In all these matters it was the practice of Jesus always to say, “Be as wise as serpents but as harmless as <a href="/en/topic/doves">doves</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b74"><a href="#fn_b74">[74]</a></sup>.” It seemed to be his purpose in all social situations to teach patience, tolerance, and forgiveness.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a74"><a href="#fn_a74">[74]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a75"><a href="#fn_a75">[75]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a76"><a href="#fn_a76">[76]</a></sup></p>

He based his teachings about <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> on the family, while he sought to correct the Jewish tendency to overhonor <a href="/en/topic/ancestor_worship">ancestors</a>. He exalted family life as the highest human <a href="/en/topic/duty">duty</a> but made it plain that family relationships must not interfere with religious <a href="/en/topic/obligations">obligations</a>. He called attention to the fact that the family is a temporal institution; that it does not survive death. Jesus did not hesitate to give up his family when the family ran counter to the Father’s will. He taught the new and larger brotherhood of man—the sons of God. In Jesus’ time <a href="/en/topic/divorce">divorce</a> practices were lax in <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a> and throughout the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_Empire">Roman Empire</a>. He repeatedly refused to lay down laws regarding marriage and divorce, but many of Jesus’ early followers had strong opinions on divorce and did not hesitate to attribute them to him. All of the <a href="/en/topic/New_Testament">New Testament</a> writers held to these more stringent and advanced ideas about divorce except <a href="/en/topic/John_Mark">John Mark</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a77"><a href="#fn_a77">[77]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a78"><a href="#fn_a78">[78]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a79"><a href="#fn_a79">[79]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p8_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_15">140:8.15</a></small></sup>  4. <i>Economic attitude.</i> Jesus worked, lived, and traded in the world as he found it. He was not an economic reformer, although he did frequently call attention to the injustice of the unequal distribution of <a href="/en/topic/wealth">wealth</a>. But he did not offer any suggestions by way of remedy. He made it plain to the three that, while his apostles were not to hold property, he was not preaching against wealth and property, merely its unequal and unfair distribution. He recognized the need for social justice and industrial fairness, but he offered no rules for their attainment.</p>
<p id="p8_16"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_16">140:8.16</a></small></sup>  He never taught his followers to avoid earthly possessions, only his twelve apostles. <a href="/en/topic/Luke">Luke</a>, the physician, was a strong believer in social equality, and he did much to interpret <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ sayings in harmony with his personal beliefs. Jesus never personally directed his followers to adopt a communal mode of life; he made no pronouncement of any sort regarding such matters.</p>
<p id="p8_17"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_17">140:8.17</a></small></sup>  Jesus frequently warned his listeners against <a href="/en/topic/envy">covetousness</a>, declaring that “a man’s happiness consists not in the abundance of his material possessions<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b75"><a href="#fn_b75">[75]</a></sup>.” He constantly reiterated, “What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?” He made no direct attack on the possession of property, but he did insist that it is eternally essential that spiritual values come first<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b76"><a href="#fn_b76">[76]</a></sup>. In his later teachings he sought to correct many erroneous <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> views of life by narrating numerous parables which he presented in the course of his public ministry. Jesus never intended to formulate economic theories; he well knew that each age must evolve its own remedies for existing troubles. And if Jesus were on earth today, living his life in the flesh, he would be a great disappointment to the majority of good men and women for the simple reason that he would not take sides in present-day political, social, or economic disputes. He would remain grandly aloof while teaching you how to perfect your inner spiritual life so as to render you manyfold more competent to attack the solution of your purely human problems.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a80"><a href="#fn_a80">[80]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a81"><a href="#fn_a81">[81]</a></sup></p>

He lived a perfected life on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>, and his unique teachings can only be understood when that life is visualized in its immediate background. It is his life, and not his lessons to the twelve or his sermons to the multitudes, that will assist most in revealing the Father’s divine character and loving personality.</p>
<p id="p8_20"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_20">140:8.20</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> did not attack the teachings of the Hebrew prophets or the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> moralists. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> recognized the many good things which these great teachers stood for, but he had come down to earth to teach something <i>additional,</i> “the voluntary conformity of man’s will to <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>’s will<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b78"><a href="#fn_b78">[78]</a></sup>.” Jesus did not want simply to produce a <i>religious man,</i> a mortal wholly occupied with religious feelings and actuated only by spiritual impulses. Could you have had but one look at him, you would have known that Jesus was a real man of great experience in the things of this world. The teachings of Jesus in this respect have been grossly perverted and much misrepresented all down through the centuries of the Christian era; you have also held perverted ideas about the Master’s meekness and humility. What he aimed at in his life appears to have been a <i>superb <a href="/en/topic/self-respect">self-respect</a>.</i> He only advised man to humble himself that he might become truly exalted; what he really aimed at was true humility toward God. He placed great value upon sincerity—a pure heart. Fidelity was a cardinal virtue in his estimate of character, while <i><a href="/en/topic/courage">courage</a></i> was the very heart of his teachings. “Fear not” was his watchword, and patient endurance his ideal of strength of character<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b79"><a href="#fn_b79">[79]</a></sup>. The teachings of Jesus constitute a religion of valor, courage, and heroism. And this is just why he chose as his personal representatives twelve commonplace men, the majority of whom were rugged, virile, and manly fishermen.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a83"><a href="#fn_a83">[83]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a84"><a href="#fn_a84">[84]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a85"><a href="#fn_a85">[85]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p8_21"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_21">140:8.21</a></small></sup>  Jesus had little to say about the social <a href="/en/topic/vices">vices</a> of his day; seldom did he make reference to moral delinquency. He was a positive teacher of true virtue. He studiously avoided the negative method of imparting instruction; he refused to advertise <a href="/en/topic/evil">evil</a>. He was not even a moral reformer. He well knew, and so taught his apostles, that the sensual urges of mankind are not suppressed by either religious rebuke or legal prohibitions. His few denunciations were largely directed against <a href="/en/topic/pride">pride</a>, <a href="/en/topic/cruelty">cruelty</a>, <a href="/en/topic/oppression">oppression</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/hypocrisy">hypocrisy</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a86"><a href="#fn_a86">[86]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a87"><a href="#fn_a87">[87]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a88"><a href="#fn_a88">[88]</a></sup></p>

This Sabbath afternoon Jesus assembled the apostles around him on the hillside and gave them into the hands of his heavenly Father in preparation for the day when he would be compelled to leave them alone in the world. There was no new teaching on this occasion, just visiting and communion.</p>
<p id="p9_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p9_2">140:9.2</a></small></sup>  Jesus reviewed many features of the ordination sermon, delivered on this same spot, and then, calling them before him one by one, he commissioned them to go forth in the world as his representatives. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s consecration charge was: “Go into all the world and preach the glad tidings of the kingdom<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b86"><a href="#fn_b86">[86]</a></sup>.

<h2 id="p10" class="toc-header"><a href="#p10" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 10. THE EVENING AFTER THE CONSECRATION </h2>
<p id="p10_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p10_1">140:10.1</a></small></sup>  That evening while teaching in the house, for it had begun to rain, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> talked at great length, trying to show the twelve what they must <i>be,</i> not what they must <i>do.</i> They knew only a religion that imposed the <i>doing</i> of certain things as the means of attaining <a href="/en/topic/righteousness">righteousness</a>—<a href="/en/topic/salvation">salvation</a>. But Jesus would reiterate, “In the kingdom you must <i>be</i> righteous in order to do the work.” Many times did he repeat, <i>“Be</i> you therefore perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b91"><a href="#fn_b91">[91]</a></sup>.” All the while was the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> explaining to his bewildered apostles that the salvation which he had come to bring to the world was to be had only by <i>believing,</i> by simple and sincere <a href="/en/topic/faith">faith</a>. Said Jesus: “John preached a baptism of <a href="/en/topic/repentance">repentance</a>, sorrow for the old way of living. You are to proclaim the baptism of fellowship with <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. Preach repentance to those who stand in need of such teaching, but to those already seeking sincere entrance to the kingdom, open the doors wide and bid them enter into the joyous fellowship of the sons of God<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b92"><a href="#fn_b92">[92]</a></sup>.” But it was a difficult task to persuade these Galilean fishermen that, in the kingdom, <i><a href="/en/topic/being">being</a></i> righteous, by faith, must precede <i>doing</i> righteousness in the daily life of the <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of earth.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a104"><a href="#fn_a104">[104]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a105"><a href="#fn_a105">[105]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a106"><a href="#fn_a106">[106]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a107"><a href="#fn_a107">[107]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a108"><a href="#fn_a108">[108]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a109"><a href="#fn_a109">[109]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p10_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p10_2">140:10.2</a></small></sup>  Another great handicap in this work of teaching the twelve was their tendency to take highly idealistic and spiritual principles of religious truth and remake them into concrete rules of personal conduct. Jesus would present to them the beautiful spirit of the soul’s attitude, but they insisted on translating such teachings into rules of personal behavior. Many times, when they did make sure to remember what the Master said, they were almost certain to forget what he did <i>not</i> say. But they slowly assimilated his teaching because Jesus <i>was</i> all that he taught. What they could not gain from his verbal instruction, they gradually acquired by living with him.</p>
<p id="p10_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p10_3">140:10.3</a></small></sup>  It was not apparent to the apostles that their <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> was engaged in living a life of spiritual <a href="/en/topic/inspiration">inspiration</a> for every person of every age on every world of a far-flung universe. Notwithstanding what <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> told them from time to time, the apostles did not grasp the idea that he was doing a work <i>on</i> this world but <i>for</i> all other worlds in his vast creation. Jesus lived his earth life on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>, not to set a personal <a href="/en/topic/example">example</a> of mortal living for the men and women of this world, but rather to create a <i>high spiritual and inspirational ideal</i> for all mortal beings on all worlds.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a110"><a href="#fn_a110">[110]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a111"><a href="#fn_a111">[111]</a></sup></p>

When I asked you to become as little children as the price of entering the kingdom, I referred not to ease of deception, mere willingness to believe, nor to quickness to trust pleasing <a href="/en/topic/strangers">strangers</a>. What I did desire that you should gather from the illustration was the child-father relationship. You are the child, and it is <i>your</i> Father’s kingdom you seek to enter.
