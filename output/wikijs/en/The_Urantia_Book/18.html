<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/18#p1_1">18:1.1</a></small></sup>  There are seven worlds in the innermost circuit of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> satellites, and each of these exalted worlds is presided over by a corps of ten <a href="/en/topic/Trinitized_Secrets_of_Supremacy">Trinitized Secrets of Supremacy</a>. They are not creators, but they are supreme and ultimate administrators. The conduct of the affairs of these seven fraternal spheres is wholly committed to this corps of seventy supreme directors. Though the offspring of the <a href="/en/topic/Trinity">Trinity</a> supervise these seven sacred spheres nearest Paradise, this group of worlds is universally known as the personal circuit of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_1_4"><a href="#fn_s1_1_4">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_1_10"><a href="#fn_s1_1_10">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_1_5"><a href="#fn_s1_1_5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_1_7"><a href="#fn_s1_1_7">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/18#p1_2">18:1.2</a></small></sup>  The Trinitized Secrets of Supremacy function in groups of ten as co-ordinate and joint directors of their respective spheres, but they also function individually in particular fields of responsibility. The work of each of these special worlds is divided into seven major departments, and one of these co-ordinate rulers presides over each such division of specialized activities. The remaining three act as the personal representatives of triune <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> in relation to the other seven, one representing the Father, one the Son, and one the Spirit.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_4"><a href="#fn_a1_2_4">[1]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_2_1"><a href="#fn_s1_2_1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_2_7"><a href="#fn_s1_2_7">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_2_11"><a href="#fn_s1_2_11">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/18#p1_3">18:1.3</a></small></sup>  Although there is a definite class resemblance which typifies the <a href="/en/topic/Trinitized_Secrets_of_Supremacy">Trinitized Secrets of Supremacy</a>, they also disclose <a href="/en/topic/7">seven</a> distinct group characteristics. The ten supreme directors of <a href="/en/topic/Divinington">Divinington</a> affairs are reflective of the personal character and nature of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>; and so it is with each of these <a href="/en/topic/seven">seven</a> spheres: Each group of ten resembles that Deity or Deity association which is characteristic of their domain. The ten directors who rule <a href="/en/topic/Ascendington">Ascendington</a> are reflective of the combined nature of the Father, Son, and Spirit.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_3_1"><a href="#fn_s1_3_1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/18#p1_4">18:1.4</a></small></sup>  I can reveal very little about the work of these high personalities on the seven sacred worlds of the Father, for they are truly the <i>Secrets</i> of Supremacy. There are no arbitrary secrets associated with the approach to the Universal Father, the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a>, or the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>. The Deities are an open book to all who attain divine perfection, but all the Secrets of Supremacy can never be fully attained.

<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/18#p1_5">18:1.5</a></small></sup>  Since the work of these supreme directors has to do with the intimate and personal contact of the Deities with these seven basic groupings of universe beings when domiciled on these seven special worlds or while functioning throughout the grand universe, it is fitting that these very personal relations and extraordinary contacts should be held sacredly secret. The <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Creators respect the <a href="/en/topic/privacy">privacy</a> and sanctity of personality even in their lowly creatures. And this is true both of individuals and of the various separate orders of personalities.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/18#p1_6">18:1.6</a></small></sup>  To beings of even high universe attainment these secret worlds ever remain a test of loyalty.
