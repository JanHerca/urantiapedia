<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/152#p0_2">152:0.2</a></small></sup>  As Jesus went along with Jairus, the large crowd which had heard the father’s request followed on to see what would happen. Shortly before they reached the ruler’s house, as they hastened through a narrow street and as the throng jostled him, Jesus suddenly stopped, exclaiming, “Someone touched me.” And when those who were near him denied that they had touched him, <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> spoke up: “Master, you can see that this crowd presses you, threatening to crush us, and yet you say ‘someone has touched me.’ What do you mean?” Then Jesus said: “I asked who touched me, for I perceived that living energy had gone forth from me.” As Jesus looked about him, his eyes fell upon a near-by woman, who, coming forward, knelt at his feet and said: “For years I have been afflicted with a scourging hemorrhage. I have suffered many things from many <a href="/en/topic/physicians">physicians</a>; I have spent all my substance, but none could cure me. Then I heard of you, and I thought if I may but touch the <a href="/en/topic/hem">hem</a> of his garment, I shall certainly be made whole. And so I pressed forward with the crowd as it moved along until, standing near you, Master, I touched the border of your garment, and I was made whole; I know that I have been healed of my affliction<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/152#p0_3">152:0.3</a></small></sup>  When <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> heard this, he took the woman by the hand and, lifting her up, said: “Daughter, your <a href="/en/topic/faith">faith</a> has made you whole; go in peace.” It was her <i>faith</i> and not her <i>touch</i> that made her whole<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>. And this case is a good illustration of many apparently miraculous cures which attended upon Jesus’ earth career, but which he in no sense consciously willed. The passing of time demonstrated that this woman was really cured of her malady. Her faith was of the sort that laid direct hold upon the creative power resident in the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s person. With the faith she had, it was only necessary to approach the Master’s person. It was not at all necessary to touch his garment; that was merely the superstitious part of her belief. Jesus called this woman, <a href="/en/topic/Veronica_of_Caesarea_Philippi">Veronica</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Caesarea_Philippi">Caesarea-Philippi</a>, into his presence to correct two errors which might have lingered in her mind, or which might have persisted in the minds of those who witnessed this healing: He did not want Veronica to go away thinking that her fear in attempting to steal her cure had been honored, or that her superstition in associating the touch of his garment with her healing had been effective. He desired all to know that it was her pure and living <i>faith</i> that had wrought the cure.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_3_7"><a href="#fn_a0_3_7">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_3_12"><a href="#fn_a0_3_12">[4]</a></sup></p>

Even before they entered the ruler’s yard, one of his servants came out, saying: “Trouble not the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>; your daughter is dead.” But <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> seemed not to heed the servant’s words, for, taking with him <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a>, he turned and said to the grief-stricken father: “Fear not; only believe.” When he entered the house, he found the <a href="/en/topic/flute_players">flute-players</a> already there with the mourners, who were making an unseemly tumult; already were the relatives engaged in weeping and wailing. And when he had put all the mourners out of the room, he went in with the father and mother and his three apostles. He had told the mourners that the damsel was not dead, but they laughed him to scorn. Jesus now turned to the mother, saying: “Your daughter is not dead; she is only asleep.” And when the house had quieted down, Jesus, going up to where the child lay, took her by the hand and said, “Daughter, I say to you, awake and arise!” And when the girl heard these words, she immediately rose up and walked across the room. And presently, after she had recovered from her daze, Jesus directed that they should give her something to eat, for she had been a long time without food<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_1_16"><a href="#fn_a1_1_16">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/152#p1_4">152:1.4</a></small></sup>  Jesus’ apostles, let alone the common people, could not understand the nature and attributes of this God-man. Neither has any subsequent generation been able to evaluate what took place on earth in the person of Jesus of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>. And there can never occur an opportunity for either science or religion to check up on these remarkable events for the simple reason that such an extraordinary situation can never again occur, either on this world or on any other world in <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>. Never again, on any world in this entire universe, will a being appear in the likeness of mortal flesh, at the same time embodying all the attributes of creative energy combined with spiritual endowments which transcend time and most other material limitations.</p>

To repeat these phenomena, we would have to go into the immediate presence of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a>, the Creator, and find him as he was in those days—the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>. Likewise, today, while his absence prevents such material manifestations, you should refrain from placing any sort of limitation on the possible exhibition of his <i>spiritual power.</i> Though the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> is absent as a material being, he is present as a spiritual influence in the hearts of men.

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/152#p2_1">152:2.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> continued to teach the people by day while he instructed the apostles and evangelists at night. On <a href="/en/topic/Fridays">Friday</a> he declared a furlough of one week that all his followers might go home or to their friends for a few days before preparing to go up to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> for the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a>. But more than one half of his disciples refused to leave him, and the multitude was daily increasing in size, so much so that <a href="/en/topic/David_Zebedee">David Zebedee</a> desired to establish a new encampment, but Jesus refused consent. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> had so little rest over the <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> that on <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a> morning, March 27, he sought to get away from the people.

This region was a favorite resorting place for <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> folks; they were all familiar with these parks on the eastern shore.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_1_13"><a href="#fn_a2_1_13">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_1_3"><a href="#fn_a2_1_3">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/152#p2_3">152:2.3</a></small></sup>  By late afternoon more than a thousand persons had located the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> in one of the parks, and he spoke to them briefly, being followed by <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>. Many of these people had brought food with them, and after eating the evening meal, they gathered about in small groups while <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ apostles and disciples taught them.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/152#p2_4">152:2.4</a></small></sup>  Monday afternoon the multitude had increased to more than three thousand. And still—way into the evening—the people continued to flock in, bringing all manner of sick folks with them. Hundreds of interested persons had made their plans to stop over at <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> to see and hear Jesus on their way to the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a>, and they simply refused to be disappointed. By <a href="/en/topic/Wednesday">Wednesday</a> noon about five thousand men, women, and children were assembled here in this park to the south of <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida-Julias">Bethsaida-Julias</a>. The weather was pleasant, it being near the end of the rainy season in this locality.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/152#p2_5">152:2.5</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a> had provided a three days’ supply of food for <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the twelve, which was in the custody of the Mark lad, their boy of all chores. By afternoon of this, the third day for almost half of this multitude, the food the people had brought with them was nearly exhausted. <a href="/en/topic/David_Zebedee">David Zebedee</a> had no tented city here to feed and accommodate the crowds. Neither had <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Tetrarch)">Philip</a> made food provision for such a multitude. But the people, even though they were hungry, would not go away. It was being quietly whispered about that Jesus, desiring to avoid trouble with both <a href="/en/topic/Herod_Antipas">Herod</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> leaders, had chosen this quiet spot outside the jurisdiction of all his enemies as the proper place to be crowned king. The enthusiasm of the people was rising every hour. Not a word was said to Jesus, though, of course, he knew all that was going on. Even the twelve apostles were still tainted with such notions, and especially the younger evangelists. The apostles who favored this attempt to proclaim Jesus king were <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Zelotes">Simon Zelotes</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>. Those opposing the plan were <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a>, <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a>, and Thomas. Matthew, Philip, and the <a href="/en/topic/Alpheus_twins">Alpheus twins</a> were noncommittal. The ringleader of this plot to make him king was <a href="/en/topic/Joab">Joab</a>, one of the young evangelists.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_5_4"><a href="#fn_s2_5_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/152#p2_6">152:2.6</a></small></sup>  This was the stage setting about five o’clock on <a href="/en/topic/Wednesday">Wednesday</a> afternoon, when Jesus asked <a href="/en/topic/James_Alpheus">James Alpheus</a> to summon Andrew and Philip. Said Jesus: “What shall we do with the multitude? They have been with us now three days, and many of them are hungry. They have no food<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>.” Philip and Andrew exchanged glances, and then Philip answered: “<a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, you should send these people away so that they may go to the villages around about and buy themselves food.” And Andrew, fearing the materialization of the king plot, quickly joined with Philip, saying: “Yes, Master, I think it best that you dismiss the multitude so that they may go their way and buy food while you secure rest for a season.” By this time others of the twelve had joined the conference. Then said Jesus: “But I do not desire to send them away hungry; can you not feed them?” This was too much for Philip, and he spoke right up: “Master, in this country place where can we buy bread for this multitude? Two hundred <a href="/en/topic/denarii">denarii</a> worth would not be enough for lunch.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_6_1"><a href="#fn_s2_6_1">[1]</a></sup></p>

To avoid the multitudes and to attract as little attention as possible, they journeyed by way of <a href="/en/topic/Gerasa">Gerasa</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. He forbade them to do any public teaching on this trip; neither did he permit them to teach or preach while sojourning in Jerusalem. They arrived at <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a>, near Jerusalem, late on <a href="/en/topic/Wednesday">Wednesday</a> evening, April 6.

Many of the Jerusalem believers were brought out by <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a> to meet Jesus at Bethany. During this sojourn at Jerusalem the twelve learned how bitter the feeling was becoming toward their <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>.
