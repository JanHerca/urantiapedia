<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p0_1">157:0.1</a></small></sup>  BEFORE <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> took the twelve for a short sojourn in the vicinity of <a href="/en/topic/Caesarea_Philippi">Caesarea-Philippi</a>, he arranged through the <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> of <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a> to go over to <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> on <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a>, August 7, for the purpose of meeting his family. By prearrangement this visit was to occur at the <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a> boatshop. <a href="/en/topic/David_Zebedee">David Zebedee</a> had arranged with <a href="/en/topic/Jude">Jude</a>, Jesus‚Äô brother, for the presence of the entire <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> family‚Äî<a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> and all of Jesus‚Äô brothers and sisters‚Äîand Jesus went with <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> to keep this appointment. It was certainly the intention of <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Clopas)">Mary</a> and the children to keep this engagement, but it so happened that a group of the <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a>, knowing that Jesus was on the opposite side of the lake in <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a>‚Äôs domains, decided to call upon <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)">Mary</a> to learn what they could of his whereabouts. The arrival of these <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> emissaries greatly perturbed <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(sister_of_Lazarus)">Mary</a>, and noting the tension and nervousness of the entire family, they concluded that Jesus must have been expected to pay them a visit. Accordingly they installed themselves in <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(mother_of_Alpheus_twins)">Mary</a>‚Äôs home and, after summoning reinforcements, waited patiently for Jesus‚Äô arrival. And this, of course, effectively prevented any of the family from attempting to keep their appointment with Jesus. Several times during the day both Jude and <a href="/en/topic/Ruth_(Old_Testament)">Ruth</a> endeavored to elude the vigilance of the Pharisees in their efforts to send word to Jesus, but it was of no avail.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p0_2">157:0.2</a></small></sup>  Early in the afternoon David‚Äôs messengers brought Jesus word that the Pharisees were encamped on the doorstep of his mother‚Äôs house, and therefore he made no attempt to visit his family. And so again, through no fault of either, Jesus and his earth family failed to make contact.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 1. THE TEMPLE-TAX COLLECTOR </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p1_1">157:1.1</a></small></sup>  As <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, with <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, tarried by the lake near the boatshop, a temple-tax collector came upon them and, recognizing Jesus, called <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Peter</a> to one side and said: ‚ÄúDoes not your <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> pay the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> tax?‚Äù Peter was inclined to show indignation at the suggestion that Jesus should be expected to contribute to the maintenance of the religious activities of his sworn enemies, but, noting a peculiar expression on the face of the tax collector, he rightly surmised that it was the purpose to entrap them in the act of refusing to pay the customary half shekel for the support of the <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a> services at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. Accordingly, Peter replied: ‚ÄúWhy of course the Master pays the temple tax. You wait by the gate, and I will presently return with the tax.‚Äù<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_1_2"><a href="#fn_s1_1_2">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p1_2">157:1.2</a></small></sup>  Now Peter had spoken hastily. <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas</a> carried their funds, and he was across the lake. Neither he, his brother, nor Jesus had brought along any money. And knowing that the <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> were looking for them, they could not well go to <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a> to obtain money. When Peter told Jesus about the collector and that he had promised him the money, Jesus said: ‚ÄúIf you have promised, then should you pay. But wherewith will you redeem your promise? Will you again become a fisherman that you may honor your word? Nevertheless, Peter, it is well in the circumstances that we pay the tax. Let us give these men no occasion for offense at our attitude<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>. We will wait here while you go with the <a href="/en/topic/boats">boat</a> and cast for the fish, and when you have sold them at yonder market, pay the collector for all three of us.‚Äù</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p1_3">157:1.3</a></small></sup>  All of this had been overheard by the secret messenger of <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a> who stood near by, and who then signaled to an associate, fishing near the shore, to come in quickly. When <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> made ready to go out in the boat for a catch, this messenger and his fisherman friend presented him with several large baskets of fish and assisted him in carrying them to the fish merchant near by, who purchased the catch, paying sufficient, with what was added by the messenger of <a href="/en/topic/David_Zebedee">David</a>, to meet the <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a> tax for the three. The collector accepted the tax, forgoing the penalty for tardy payment because they had been for some time absent from <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p1_4">157:1.4</a></small></sup>  It is not strange that you have a record of Peter‚Äôs catching a <a href="/en/topic/fish">fish</a> with a shekel in its mouth. In those days there were current many stories about finding treasures in the mouths of fishes; such tales of near <a href="/en/topic/miracles">miracles</a> were commonplace. So, as Peter left them to go toward the boat, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> remarked, half-humorously: ‚ÄúStrange that the sons of the king must pay tribute; usually it is the stranger who is taxed for the upkeep of the court, but it behooves us to afford no stumbling block for the authorities. Go hence! maybe you will catch the fish with the shekel in its mouth.‚Äù Jesus having thus spoken, and Peter so soon appearing with the temple tax, it is not surprising that the episode became later expanded into a miracle as recorded by the writer of Matthew‚Äôs Gospel.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p1_5">157:1.5</a></small></sup>  Jesus, with <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, waited by the seashore until nearly sundown. Messengers brought them word that <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a>‚Äôs house was still under surveillance; therefore, when it grew dark, the three waiting men entered their <a href="/en/topic/boats">boat</a> and slowly rowed away toward the eastern shore of the <a href="/en/topic/Sea_of_Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 2. AT BETHSAIDA-JULIAS </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p2_1">157:2.1</a></small></sup>  On Monday, August 8, while <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the twelve apostles were encamped in <a href="/en/topic/Magadan_Park">Magadan Park</a>, near <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida-Julias">Bethsaida-Julias</a>, more than one hundred believers, the evangelists, the women‚Äôs corps, and others interested in the establishment of the kingdom, came over from <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> for a conference. And many of the <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a>, learning that Jesus was here, came also. By this time some of the <a href="/en/topic/Sadducees">Sadducees</a> were united with the Pharisees in their effort to entrap Jesus. Before going into the closed conference with the believers, Jesus held a public meeting at which the Pharisees were present, and they heckled the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and otherwise sought to disturb the assembly. Said the leader of the disturbers: ‚ÄúTeacher, we would like you to give us a sign of your authority to teach, and then, when the same shall come to pass, all men will know that you have been sent by <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>.‚Äù And Jesus answered them: ‚ÄúWhen it is evening, you say it will be fair weather, for the heaven is red; in the morning it will be foul weather, for the heaven is red and lowering. When you see a cloud rising in the west, you say showers will come; when the wind blows from the south, you say scorching heat will come. How is it that you so well know how to discern the face of the heavens but are so utterly unable to discern the <a href="/en/topic/signs">signs</a> of the times? To those who would know the truth, already has a sign been given; but to an evil-minded and hypocritical generation no sign shall be given.‚Äù<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_1_11"><a href="#fn_a2_1_11">[1]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_3"><a href="#fn_s2_1_3">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p2_2">157:2.2</a></small></sup>  When Jesus had thus spoken, he withdrew and prepared for the evening conference with his followers. At this conference it was decided to undertake a united mission throughout all the cities and villages of the <a href="/en/topic/Decapolis">Decapolis</a> as soon as Jesus and the twelve should return from their proposed visit to <a href="/en/topic/Caesarea_Philippi">Caesarea-Philippi</a>. The Master participated in planning for the Decapolis mission and, in dismissing the company, said: ‚ÄúI say to you, beware of the <a href="/en/topic/leaven">leaven</a> of the Pharisees and the Sadducees<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>. Be not deceived by their show of much learning and by their profound loyalty to the forms of <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a>. Be only concerned with the spirit of living truth and the power of true religion. It is not the <a href="/en/topic/fear">fear</a> of a dead religion that will save you but rather your <a href="/en/topic/faith">faith</a> in a living experience in the spiritual realities of the kingdom. Do not allow yourselves to become blinded by <a href="/en/topic/prejudice">prejudice</a> and paralyzed by fear. Neither permit reverence for the <a href="/en/topic/traditions">traditions</a> so to pervert your understanding that your eyes see not and your ears hear not<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>. It is not the purpose of true religion merely to bring <a href="/en/topic/peace">peace</a> but rather to insure progress. And there can be no peace in the heart or progress in the mind unless you fall wholeheartedly in <a href="/en/topic/love">love</a> with truth, the ideals of eternal realities. The issues of life and death are being set before you‚Äîthe sinful pleasures of time against the righteous realities of eternity. Even now you should begin to find deliverance from the bondage of fear and doubt as you enter upon the living of the new life of faith and hope. And when the feelings of <a href="/en/topic/service">service</a> for your fellow men arise within your soul, do not stifle them; when the emotions of love for your neighbor well up within your heart, give expression to such urges of affection in intelligent ministry to the real needs of your fellows.‚Äù<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_2_5"><a href="#fn_a2_2_5">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_2_9"><a href="#fn_a2_2_9">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_2_10"><a href="#fn_a2_2_10">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_2_14"><a href="#fn_a2_2_14">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_2_16"><a href="#fn_a2_2_16">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_2_23"><a href="#fn_a2_2_23">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p3_1">157:3.1</a></small></sup>  Early Tuesday morning <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the twelve apostles left <a href="/en/topic/Magadan_Park">Magadan Park</a> for <a href="/en/topic/Caesarea_Philippi">Caesarea-Philippi</a>, the capital of the Tetrarch <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a>‚Äôs domain<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>. Caesarea-Philippi was situated in a region of wondrous beauty. It nestled in a charming valley between scenic hills where the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> poured forth from an underground <a href="/en/topic/caves">cave</a>. The heights of <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Hermon">Mount Hermon</a> were in full view to the north, while from the hills just to the south a magnificent view was had of the upper Jordan and the <a href="/en/topic/Sea_of_Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_1_20"><a href="#fn_a3_1_20">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p3_2">157:3.2</a></small></sup>  Jesus had gone to Mount Hermon in his early experience with the affairs of the kingdom, and now that he was entering upon the final epoch of his work, he desired to return to this mount of trial and triumph, where he hoped the apostles might gain a new vision of their responsibilities and acquire new strength for the trying times just ahead. As they journeyed along the way, about the time of passing south of the <a href="/en/topic/Waters_of_Merom">Waters of Merom</a>, the apostles fell to talking among themselves about their recent experiences in Phoenicia and elsewhere and to recounting how their message had been received, and how the different peoples regarded their <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p3_3">157:3.3</a></small></sup>  As they paused for lunch, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> suddenly confronted the twelve with <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> question he had ever addressed to them concerning himself. He asked this surprising question, ‚ÄúWho do men say that I am?‚Äù<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b9"><a href="#fn_b9">[9]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_3_4"><a href="#fn_s3_3_4">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p3_4">157:3.4</a></small></sup>  Jesus had spent long months in training these apostles as to the nature and character of the kingdom of heaven, and he well knew the time had come when he must begin to teach them more about his own nature and his personal relationship to the kingdom. And now, as they were seated under the mulberry trees, the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> made ready to hold one of the most momentous sessions of his long association with the chosen apostles.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p3_5">157:3.5</a></small></sup>  More than half the apostles participated in answering <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>‚Äô question. They told him that he was regarded as a prophet or as an extraordinary man by all who knew him; that even his enemies greatly feared him, accounting for his powers by the indictment that he was in league with the prince of devils. They told him that some in <a href="/en/topic/Judea">Judea</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Samaria">Samaria</a> who had not met him personally believed he was <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John the Baptist</a> risen from the dead. <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> explained that he had been, at sundry times and by various persons, compared with <a href="/en/topic/Moses">Moses</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Elijah_Mark">Elijah</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Isaiah_(first)">Isaiah</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup>. When Jesus had listened to this report, he drew himself upon his feet, and looking down upon the twelve sitting about him in a semicircle, with startling emphasis he pointed to them with a sweeping gesture of his hand and asked, ‚ÄúBut who say you that I am?‚Äù There was a moment of tense silence<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b11"><a href="#fn_b11">[11]</a></sup>. The twelve never took their eyes off the Master, and then <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a>, springing to his feet, exclaimed: ‚ÄúYou are the <a href="/en/topic/Deliverer">Deliverer</a>, the Son of the living <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b12"><a href="#fn_b12">[12]</a></sup>.‚Äù And the eleven sitting apostles arose to their feet with one accord, thereby indicating that Peter had spoken for all of them.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_5_3"><a href="#fn_a3_5_3">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_5_6"><a href="#fn_a3_5_6">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_5_27"><a href="#fn_a3_5_27">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_5_28"><a href="#fn_a3_5_28">[12]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_5_4"><a href="#fn_s3_5_4">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p3_6">157:3.6</a></small></sup>  When Jesus had beckoned them again to be seated, and while still standing before them, he said: ‚ÄúThis has been revealed to you by my Father<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b13"><a href="#fn_b13">[13]</a></sup>.

<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 4. THE TALK ABOUT THE KINGDOM </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p4_1">157:4.1</a></small></sup>  Since the occasions of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>‚Äô baptism by <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a> and the turning of the water into wine at <a href="/en/topic/Cana">Cana</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a> had, at various times, virtually accepted him as the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a>. For short periods some of them had truly believed that he was the expected <a href="/en/topic/Deliverer">Deliverer</a>. But hardly would such <a href="/en/topic/hopes">hopes</a> spring up in their hearts than the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> would dash them to pieces by some crushing word or disappointing deed. They had long been in a state of turmoil due to conflict between the concepts of the expected Messiah which they held in their minds and the experience of their extraordinary association with this extraordinary man which they held in their hearts.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p4_2">157:4.2</a></small></sup>  It was late forenoon on this <a href="/en/topic/Wednesday">Wednesday</a> when the apostles assembled in <a href="/en/topic/Celsus">Celsus</a>‚Äô <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a> for their noontime meal. During most of the night and since they had arisen that morning, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Zelotes">Simon Zelotes</a> had been earnestly laboring with their brethren to bring them all to the point of the wholehearted acceptance of the Master, not merely as the Messiah, but also as the divine Son of the living <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. The two Simons were well-nigh agreed in their estimate of Jesus, and they labored diligently to bring their brethren around to the full acceptance of their views. While <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> continued as the director-general of the apostolic corps, his brother, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, was becoming, increasingly and by common consent, the spokesman for the twelve.</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p4_3">157:4.3</a></small></sup>  They were all seated in the garden at just about noon when the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> appeared.

The first stage was that of his childhood, the years when he was only dimly conscious of his origin, nature, and destiny as a human being. The second stage was the increasingly self-conscious years of youth and advancing manhood, during which he came more clearly to comprehend his divine nature and human mission. This second stage ended with the experiences and revelations associated with his baptism. The third stage of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>‚Äôs earth experience extended from the baptism through the years of his ministry as teacher and healer and up to this momentous hour of Peter‚Äôs confession at <a href="/en/topic/Caesarea_Philippi">Caesarea-Philippi</a>. This third period of his earth life embraced the times when his apostles and his immediate followers knew him as the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> and regarded him as the Messiah. The fourth and last period of his earth career began here at Caesarea-Philippi and extended on to the crucifixion. This stage of his ministry was characterized by his acknowledgment of divinity and embraced the labors of his last year in the flesh. During the fourth period, while the majority of his followers still regarded him as the Messiah, he became known to the apostles as the Son of God. Peter‚Äôs confession marked the beginning of the new period of the more complete realization of the truth of his supreme ministry as a bestowal Son on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> and for an entire universe, and the recognition of that fact, at least hazily, by his chosen ambassadors.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s6_3_4"><a href="#fn_s6_3_4">[3]</a></sup></p>

He did not place emphasis, as did his later followers, upon the incessant struggle between the soul and the body. He rather taught that the spirit was easy victor over both and effective in the profitable reconciliation of much of this intellectual and instinctual warfare.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a6_4_9"><a href="#fn_a6_4_9">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a6_4_7"><a href="#fn_a6_4_7">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a6_4_19"><a href="#fn_a6_4_19">[23]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a6_4_25"><a href="#fn_a6_4_25">[24]</a></sup></p>

Before <a href="/en/topic/Caesarea_Philippi">Caesarea-Philippi</a> he presented the gospel of the kingdom as its master teacher.

<p id="p6_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p6_6">157:6.6</a></small></sup>  Jesus had sincerely endeavored to lead his followers into the spiritual kingdom as a teacher, then as a teacher-healer, but they would not have it so. He well knew that his earth mission could not possibly fulfill the Messianic expectations of the Jewish people; the olden prophets had portrayed a <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a> which he could never be. He sought to establish the Father‚Äôs kingdom as the Son of Man, but his followers would not go forward in the adventure.

<h2 id="p7" class="toc-header"><a href="#p7" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 7. ANDREW‚ÄôS CONFERENCE </h2>
<p id="p7_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p7_1">157:7.1</a></small></sup>  That evening <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> took it upon himself to hold a personal and searching conference with each of his brethren, and he had profitable and heartening talks with all of his associates except <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>. Andrew had never enjoyed such intimate personal association with Judas as with the other apostles and therefore had not thought it of serious account that Judas never had freely and confidentially related himself to the head of the apostolic corps. But Andrew was now so worried by Judas‚Äôs attitude that, later on that night, after all the apostles were fast asleep, he sought out <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and presented his cause for anxiety to the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>. Said Jesus: ‚ÄúIt is not amiss, Andrew, that you have come to me with this matter, but there is nothing more that we can do; only go on placing the utmost confidence in this apostle. And say nothing to his brethren concerning this talk with me.‚Äù<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a7_1_0"><a href="#fn_a7_1_0">[31]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_1_30"><a href="#fn_a7_1_30">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p7_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p7_2">157:7.2</a></small></sup>  And that was all Andrew could elicit from Jesus. Always had there been some strangeness between this Judean and his Galilean brethren. Judas had been shocked by the death of <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John the Baptist</a>, severely hurt by the Master‚Äôs rebukes on several occasions, disappointed when Jesus refused to be made king, humiliated when he fled from the <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a>, chagrined when he refused to accept the challenge of the Pharisees for a sign, bewildered by the refusal of his Master to resort to manifestations of power, and now, more recently, depressed and sometimes dejected by an empty treasury. And Judas missed the stimulus of the multitudes.</p>
<p id="p7_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p7_3">157:7.3</a></small></sup>  Each of the other apostles was, in some and varying measure, likewise affected by these selfsame trials and tribulations, but they loved <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. At least they must have loved the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> more than did <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas</a>, for they went through with him to the bitter end.</p>
<p id="p7_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p7_4">157:7.4</a></small></sup>  Being from <a href="/en/topic/Judea">Judea</a>, Judas took personal offense at Jesus‚Äô recent warning to the apostles to ‚Äúbeware the leaven of the <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a>‚Äù; he was disposed to regard this statement as a veiled reference to himself<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b34"><a href="#fn_b34">[34]</a></sup>. But the great mistake of Judas was: Time and again, when Jesus would send his apostles off by themselves to pray, Judas, instead of engaging in sincere communion with the spiritual forces of the universe, indulged in thoughts of human fear while he persisted in the entertainment of subtle doubts about the mission of Jesus as well as giving in to his unfortunate tendency to harbor feelings of <a href="/en/topic/revenge">revenge</a>.</p>
<p id="p7_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p7_5">157:7.5</a></small></sup>  And now <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> would take his apostles along with him to <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Hermon">Mount Hermon</a>, where he had appointed to inaugurate his fourth phase of earth ministry as the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_God">Son of God</a>. Some of them were present at his baptism in the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> and had witnessed the beginning of his career as the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>, and he desired that some of them should also be present to hear his authority for the assumption of the new and public role of a Son of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. Accordingly, on the morning of <a href="/en/topic/Fridays">Friday</a>, August 12, Jesus said to the twelve: ‚ÄúLay in provisions and prepare yourselves for a journey to yonder mountain, where the spirit bids me go to be endowed for the finish of my work on earth. And I would take my brethren along that they may also be strengthened for the trying times of going with me through this experience.‚Äù<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s7_5_4"><a href="#fn_s7_5_4">[3]</a></sup></p>
