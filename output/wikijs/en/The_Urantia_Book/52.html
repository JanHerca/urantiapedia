These successive ages are determined by the planetary missions of the divine Sons, and on an average inhabited world these epochs appear in the following order:<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_1_3"><a href="#fn_a0_1_3">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_1_18"><a href="#fn_a0_1_18">[3]</a></sup></p>

The entire period from life initiation to the appearance of man is designated the prehuman era and precedes the successive mortal epochs considered in this narrative.</p>

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p1_1">52:1.1</a></small></sup>  From the time of man’s emergence from the animal level—when he can choose to worship the Creator—to the arrival of the Planetary Prince, mortal will creatures are called <i>primitive men.</i> There are six basic types or <a href="/en/topic/races">races</a> of primitive men, and these early peoples successively appear in the order of the spectrum colors, beginning with the red. The length of time consumed in this early life evolution varies greatly on the different worlds, ranging from one hundred and fifty thousand years to over one million years of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> time.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_1_11"><a href="#fn_a1_1_11">[2]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_1_2"><a href="#fn_s1_1_2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p1_2">52:1.2</a></small></sup>  The evolutionary races of color—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo—begin to appear about the time that primitive man is developing a simple <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a> and is beginning to exercise the creative imagination. By this time man is well accustomed to standing erect.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p1_3">52:1.3</a></small></sup>  Primitive men are mighty hunters and fierce fighters. The <a href="/en/topic/law">law</a> of this age is the physical survival of the fittest; the government of these times is wholly tribal. During the early racial struggles on many worlds some of the evolutionary <a href="/en/topic/races">races</a> are obliterated, as occurred on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. Those who survive are usually subsequently blended with the later imported violet race, the <a href="/en/topic/Adamites">Adamic peoples</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_3_2"><a href="#fn_s1_3_2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p1_4">52:1.4</a></small></sup>  In the light of subsequent civilization, this era of primitive man is a long, dark, and bloody chapter. The ethics of the jungle and the morals of the primeval forests are not in keeping with the standards of later dispensations of revealed religion and higher spiritual development. On normal and nonexperimental worlds this epoch is very different from the prolonged and extraordinarily brutal struggles which characterized this age on Urantia. When you have emerged from your first world experience, you will begin to see why this long and painful struggle on the evolutionary worlds occurs, and as you go forward in the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> path, you will increasingly understand the wisdom of these apparently strange doings. But notwithstanding all the vicissitudes of the early ages of human emergence, the performances of primitive man represent a splendid, even a heroic, chapter in the annals of an evolutionary world of time and space.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_4_2"><a href="#fn_s1_4_2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p1_5">52:1.5</a></small></sup>  Early evolutionary man is not a colorful creature. In general, these primitive <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> are cave dwellers or cliff residents. They also build crude huts in the large trees. Before they acquire a high order of intelligence, the planets are sometimes overrun with the larger types of animals. But early in this era mortals learn to kindle and maintain <a href="/en/topic/fire">fire</a>, and with the increase of inventive imagination and the improvement in tools, evolving man soon vanquishes the larger and more unwieldy animals. The early races also make extensive use of the larger flying animals. These enormous birds are able to carry one or two average-sized men for a nonstop flight of over five hundred miles. On some planets these birds are of great service since they possess a high order of intelligence, often being able to speak many words of the languages of the realm. These birds are most intelligent, very obedient, and unbelievably affectionate. Such <a href="/en/topic/passenger_birds">passenger birds</a> have been long extinct on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>, but your early ancestors enjoyed their services.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_5_25"><a href="#fn_a1_5_25">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_5_33"><a href="#fn_a1_5_33">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_5_49"><a href="#fn_a1_5_49">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_5_53"><a href="#fn_a1_5_53">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_5_68"><a href="#fn_a1_5_68">[8]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_5_2"><a href="#fn_s1_5_2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p1_6">52:1.6</a></small></sup>  Man’s acquirement of <a href="/en/topic/ethics">ethical</a> judgment, moral will, is usually coincident with the appearance of early <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a>. Upon attaining the human level, after this emergence of mortal will, these beings become receptive to the temporary indwelling of the divine Adjusters, and upon death many are duly elected as survivors and sealed by the <a href="/en/topic/archangels">archangels</a> for subsequent resurrection and Spirit fusion<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. The archangels always accompany the <a href="/en/topic/Planetary_Princes">Planetary Princes</a>, and a dispensational adjudication of the realm is simultaneous with the prince’s arrival.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_6_7"><a href="#fn_a1_6_7">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p1_7">52:1.7</a></small></sup>  All <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> who are indwelt by <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Thought Adjusters</a> are potential worshipers; they have been “lighted by the true light,” and they possess capacity for seeking reciprocal contact with divinity<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>. Nevertheless, the early or biologic <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> of primitive man is largely a persistence of animal <a href="/en/topic/fear">fear</a> coupled with ignorant awe and tribal superstition. The survival of superstition in the <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> races is hardly complimentary to your evolutionary development nor compatible with your otherwise splendid achievements in material progress. But this early fear religion serves a very valuable purpose in subduing the fiery tempers of these primitive creatures. It is the forerunner of civilization and the soil for the subsequent planting of the seeds of revealed religion by the Planetary Prince and his ministers.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_7_64"><a href="#fn_a1_7_64">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p1_8">52:1.8</a></small></sup>  Within one hundred thousand years from the time man acquires erect posture, the Planetary Prince usually arrives, having been dispatched by the System Sovereign upon the report of the <a href="/en/topic/Life_Carriers">Life Carriers</a> that will is functioning, even though comparatively few individuals have thus developed. Primitive mortals usually welcome the Planetary Prince and his <a href="/en/topic/corporeal_staffs_of_Planetary_Princes">visible staff</a>; in fact, they often look upon them with awe and reverence, almost with worshipfulness, if they are not restrained.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_8_2"><a href="#fn_s1_8_2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. POST-PLANETARY PRINCE MAN </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p2_1">52:2.1</a></small></sup>  With the arrival of the Planetary Prince a new dispensation begins. Government appears on earth, and the advanced tribal epoch is attained. Great social strides are made during a few thousand years of this regime. Under normal conditions <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> attain a high state of civilization during this age. They do not struggle so long in barbarism as did the <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> races. But life on an inhabited world is so changed by <a href="/en/topic/rebellion_(spiritual)">rebellion</a> that you can have little or no idea of such a regime on a normal planet.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_1_11"><a href="#fn_a2_1_11">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_1_7"><a href="#fn_a2_1_7">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_1_55"><a href="#fn_a2_1_55">[11]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_2"><a href="#fn_s2_1_2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p2_2">52:2.2</a></small></sup>  The average length of this dispensation is around five hundred thousand years, some longer, some shorter. During this era the planet is established in the circuits of the system, and a full quota of seraphic and other celestial helpers is assigned to its administration. The <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Thought Adjusters</a> come in increasing numbers, and the seraphic guardians amplify their regime of mortal supervision.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p2_3">52:2.3</a></small></sup>  When the Planetary Prince arrives on a primitive world, the evolved <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> of fear and ignorance prevails. The prince and his staff make <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> revelations of higher truth and universe organization. These initial presentations of revealed religion are very simple, and they usually pertain to the affairs of the local system. Religion is wholly an evolutionary process prior to the arrival of the Planetary Prince. Subsequently, religion progresses by graduated <a href="/en/topic/revelation">revelation</a> as well as by evolutionary growth. Each dispensation, each mortal epoch, receives an enlarged presentation of spiritual truth and religious ethics. The evolution of the religious capacity of receptivity in the inhabitants of a world largely determines their rate of spiritual advancement and the extent of religious revelation.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p2_4">52:2.4</a></small></sup>  This dispensation witnesses a spiritual dawn, and the different races and their various tribes tend to develop specialized systems of religious and philosophic thought. There uniformly run through all of these racial religions two strains: the early fears of primitive men and the later revelations of the Planetary Prince. In some respects Urantians do not seem to have wholly emerged from this stage of planetary evolution. As you pursue this study, you will the more clearly discern how far your world departs from the average course of evolutionary progress and development.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p2_5">52:2.5</a></small></sup>  But the Planetary Prince is not “the <a href="/en/topic/Prince_of_Peace">Prince of Peace</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>.” Racial struggles and tribal wars continue over into this dispensation but with diminishing frequency and severity. This is the great age of racial dispersion, and it culminates in a period of intense <a href="/en/topic/nationalism">nationalism</a>. Color is the basis of tribal and national groupings, and the different <a href="/en/topic/races">races</a> often develop separate languages. Each expanding group of <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> tends to seek isolation. This segregation is favored by the existence of many languages. Before the unification of the several races their relentless warfare sometimes results in the obliteration of whole peoples; the orange and green men are particularly subject to such extinction.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_5_2"><a href="#fn_s2_5_2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p2_6">52:2.6</a></small></sup>  On average worlds, during the latter part of the prince’s rule, national life begins to replace tribal organization or rather to be superimposed upon the existing tribal groupings. But the great social achievement of the prince’s epoch is the emergence of family life. Heretofore, human relationships have been chiefly tribal; now, the <a href="/en/topic/home">home</a> begins to materialize.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p2_7">52:2.7</a></small></sup>  This is the dispensation of the realization of sex equality. On some planets the male may rule the female; on others the reverse prevails. During this age normal worlds establish full equality of the <a href="/en/topic/sexes">sexes</a>, this being preliminary to the fuller realization of the ideals of home life. This is the dawn of the golden age of the home. The idea of tribal rule gradually gives way to the dual concept of national life and family life.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_7_17"><a href="#fn_a2_7_17">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p2_8">52:2.8</a></small></sup>  During this age <a href="/en/topic/agriculture">agriculture</a> makes its appearance. The growth of the <a href="/en/topic/family">family</a> idea is incompatible with the roving and unsettled life of the hunter. Gradually the practices of settled habitations and the cultivation of the soil become established. The domestication of <a href="/en/topic/animals">animals</a> and the development of home arts proceed apace. Upon reaching the apex of biologic evolution, a high level of civilization has been attained, but there is little development of a mechanical order; invention is the characteristic of the succeeding age.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_8_6"><a href="#fn_s2_8_6">[3]</a></sup></p>

The early development of a normal world is greatly helped by the plan of promoting the increase of the higher types of <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> with proportionate curtailment of the lower. And it is the failure of your early peoples to thus discriminate between these types that accounts for the presence of so many defective and degenerate individuals among the present-day <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> races.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_9_21"><a href="#fn_a2_9_21">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p2_10">52:2.10</a></small></sup>  One of the great achievements of the age of the prince is this restriction of the multiplication of mentally defective and socially unfit individuals. Long before the times of the arrival of the second Sons, the Adams, most worlds seriously address themselves to the tasks of race purification, something which the Urantia peoples have not even yet seriously undertaken.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_10_21"><a href="#fn_a2_10_21">[13]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_10_2"><a href="#fn_s2_10_2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_10_10"><a href="#fn_s2_10_10">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p2_11">52:2.11</a></small></sup>  This problem of race improvement is not such an extensive undertaking when it is attacked at this early date in human evolution. The preceding period of tribal struggles and rugged competition in race survival has weeded out most of the abnormal and defective strains. An idiot does not have much chance of survival in a primitive and warring tribal social organization. It is the false <a href="/en/topic/sentiment">sentiment</a> of your partially perfected civilizations that fosters, protects, and perpetuates the hopelessly defective strains of evolutionary human stocks.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_11_21"><a href="#fn_a2_11_21">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_11_52"><a href="#fn_a2_11_52">[14]</a></sup></p>

There exist on even the most normal of the evolutionary worlds sufficient differences between individuals and between numerous social groups to provide for the full exercise of all those noble traits of altruistic sentiment and unselfish mortal ministry without perpetuating the socially unfit and the morally degenerate strains of evolving humanity. There is abundant opportunity for the exercise of tolerance and the function of altruism in behalf of those unfortunate and needy individuals who have not irretrievably lost their moral heritage and forever destroyed their spiritual birthright.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_12_52"><a href="#fn_a2_12_52">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_12_46"><a href="#fn_a2_12_46">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_12_51"><a href="#fn_a2_12_51">[16]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_12_2"><a href="#fn_s2_12_2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_12_3"><a href="#fn_s2_12_3">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_12_8"><a href="#fn_s2_12_8">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p3_1">52:3.1</a></small></sup>  When the original impetus of evolutionary life has run its biologic course, when man has reached the apex of animal development, there arrives the second order of sonship, and the second dispensation of grace and ministry is inaugurated. This is true on all evolutionary worlds. When the highest possible level of evolutionary life has been attained, when primitive man has ascended as far as possible in the biologic scale, a Material Son and Daughter always appear on the planet, having been dispatched by the System Sovereign.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_1_2"><a href="#fn_s3_1_2">[2]</a></sup></p>
