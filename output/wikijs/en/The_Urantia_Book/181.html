<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/181#p0_1">181:0.1</a></small></sup>  AFTER the conclusion of the farewell discourse to the eleven, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> visited informally with them and recounted many experiences which concerned them as a group and as individuals. At last it was beginning to dawn upon these Galileans that their friend and teacher was going to leave them, and their hope grasped at the promise that, after a little while, he would again be with them, but they were prone to forget that this return visit was also for a little while. Many of the apostles and the leading disciples really thought that this promise to return for a short season (the short interval between the resurrection and the ascension) indicated that Jesus was just going away for a brief visit with his Father, after which he would return to establish the kingdom. And such an interpretation of his teaching conformed both with their preconceived beliefs and with their ardent hopes. Since their lifelong beliefs and hopes of <a href="/en/topic/wish_fulfillment">wish fulfillment</a> were thus agreed, it was not difficult for them to find an interpretation of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s words which would justify their intense longings.</p>

The peace of Jesus’ mind was founded on an absolute human faith in the actuality of the divine Father’s wise and sympathetic overcare.

I would rejoice to know that you would not falter; I would be made happy if I could know that, after I go to the Father, you would not cease to be my apostle, and that you would acceptably deport yourself as an ambassador of the heavenly kingdom.”</p>
