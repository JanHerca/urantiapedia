<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p1_1">190:1.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a> did not want <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> to leave them; therefore had they slighted all his statements about dying, along with his promises to rise again. They were not expecting the resurrection as it came, and they refused to believe until they were confronted with the compulsion of unimpeachable evidence and the absolute proof of their own experiences.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p1_2">190:1.2</a></small></sup>  When the apostles refused to believe the report of the five women who represented that they had seen Jesus and talked with him, <a href="/en/topic/Mary_Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a> returned to the tomb, and the others went back to <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>’s house, where they related their experiences to his daughter and the other women. And the women believed their report. Shortly after six o’clock the daughter of <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Arimathea">Joseph of Arimathea</a> and the four women who had seen Jesus went over to the home of <a href="/en/topic/Nicodemus">Nicodemus</a>, where they related all these happenings to <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_(Old_Testament)">Joseph</a>, Nicodemus, <a href="/en/topic/David_Zebedee">David Zebedee</a>, and the other men there assembled. Nicodemus and the others doubted their story, doubted that Jesus had risen from the dead; they conjectured that the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> had removed the body. <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_(father_of_Jesus)">Joseph</a> and <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a> were disposed to believe the report, so much so that they hurried out to inspect the tomb, and they found everything just as the women had described. And they were <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> to so view the sepulchre, for the high priest sent the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_centurion_of_Jerusalem">captain</a> of the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple_guards">temple guards</a> to the tomb at half past seven o’clock to remove the grave cloths. The captain wrapped them all up in the linen sheet and threw them over a near-by cliff.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_4"><a href="#fn_a1_2_4">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_2_9"><a href="#fn_a1_2_9">[6]</a></sup></p>

Only <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John Zebedee</a> was disposed to believe, even faintly, that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had risen from the dead. <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> had believed at first but, when he failed to find the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, fell into grave doubting. They were all disposed to believe that the Jews had removed the body. David would not argue with them, but when he left, he said: “You are the apostles, and you ought to understand these things. I will not contend with you; nevertheless, I now go back to the home of Nicodemus, where I have appointed with the <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> to assemble this morning, and when they have gathered together, I will send them forth on their last mission, as heralds of the Master’s resurrection. I heard the Master say that, after he should die, he would rise on the <a href="/en/topic/third_day">third day</a>, and I believe him.” And thus speaking to the dejected and forlorn ambassadors of the kingdom, this self-appointed chief of communication and intelligence took leave of the apostles.

The whole family was startled and well-nigh confounded by the news brought by the messenger. Even as James stood before <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Nazarite_parable)">Lazarus</a>’s empty tomb, Mary Magdalene arrived on the scene and was excitedly relating to the family her experiences of the early morning hours at the tomb of <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>.

He was too much amazed to speak and too frightened to flee. And then the strange form spoke, saying: “James, I come to call you to the service of the kingdom. Join earnest hands with your brethren and follow after me.” When James heard his name spoken, he knew that it was his eldest brother, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, who had addressed him.
