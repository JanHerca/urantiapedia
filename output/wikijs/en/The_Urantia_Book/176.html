See the massive stones and the beautiful adornment; can it be that these buildings are to be destroyed?” As they went on toward <a href="/en/topic/Olivet">Olivet</a>, Jesus said: “You see these stones and this massive temple; verily, verily, I say to you: In the days soon to come there shall not be left one stone upon another.

<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p0_2">176:0.2</a></small></sup>  In order to avoid the crowds passing along the <a href="/en/topic/Kidron">Kidron</a> valley toward Gethsemane, Jesus and his associates were minded to climb up the western slope of Olivet for a short distance and then follow a trail over to their private camp near Gethsemane located a short distance above the public camping ground. As they turned to leave the road leading on to <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a>, they observed the temple, glorified by the rays of the setting sun; and while they tarried on the mount, they saw the lights of the city appear and beheld the beauty of the illuminated temple; and there, under the mellow light of the full <a href="/en/topic/moon_(Urantia’s)">moon</a>, Jesus and the twelve sat down. The Master talked with them, and presently <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a> asked this question: “Tell us, Master, how shall we know when these events are about to come to pass?”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p1_1">176:1.1</a></small></sup>  In answering <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a>’s question, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> said: “Yes, I will tell you about the times when this people shall have filled up the cup of their iniquity; when justice shall swiftly descend upon this city of our fathers. I am about to leave you; I go to the Father. After I leave you, take heed that no man deceive you, for many will come as deliverers and will lead many astray. When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, be not troubled, for though all these things will happen, the end of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> is not yet at hand<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>.

And when you stand before judges, be not anxious beforehand as to what you should say, for the spirit will teach you in that very hour what you should answer your adversaries. In these days of travail, even your own kinsfolk, under the leadership of those who have rejected the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>, will deliver you up to prison and death<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>. For a time you may <a href="/en/topic/hatred">be hated</a> by all men for my sake, but even in these persecutions I will not forsake you; my spirit will not desert you. Be patient! doubt not that this gospel of the kingdom will triumph over all enemies and, eventually, be proclaimed to all nations.”</p>

<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p1_2">176:1.2</a></small></sup>  Jesus paused while he looked down upon the city. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> realized that the rejection of the spiritual concept of the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a>, the determination to cling persistently and blindly to the material mission of the expected deliverer, would presently bring the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> in direct conflict with the powerful Roman armies, and that such a contest could only result in the final and complete overthrow of the Jewish nation. When his people rejected his spiritual bestowal and refused to receive the light of heaven as it so mercifully shone upon them, they thereby sealed their doom as an independent people with a special spiritual mission on earth. Even the Jewish leaders subsequently recognized that it was this secular idea of the Messiah which directly led to the turbulence which eventually brought about their destruction.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p1_3">176:1.3</a></small></sup>  Since <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> was to become the cradle of the early gospel movement, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> did not want its teachers and preachers to perish in the terrible overthrow of the Jewish people in connection with the destruction of Jerusalem; wherefore did he give these instructions to his followers. Jesus was much concerned lest some of his disciples become involved in these soon-coming revolts and so perish in the downfall of Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p1_4">176:1.4</a></small></sup>  Then <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> inquired: “But, <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, if the <a href="/en/topic/Holy_City">Holy City</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> are to be destroyed, and if you are not here to direct us, when should we forsake Jerusalem?” Said Jesus: “You may remain in the city after I have gone, even through these times of travail and bitter persecution, but when you finally see Jerusalem being encompassed by the Roman armies after the revolt of the false prophets, then will you know that her desolation is at hand; then must you flee to the mountains. Let none who are in the city and around about tarry to save aught, neither let those who are outside dare to enter therein<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>.

And after you have deserted the city, this disobedient people will fall by the edge of the sword and will be led captive into all nations; and so shall Jerusalem be trodden down by the gentiles. In the meantime, I warn you, be not deceived. If any man comes to you, saying, ‘Behold, here is the <a href="/en/topic/Deliverer">Deliverer</a>,’ or ‘Behold, there is he,’ believe it not, for many false <a href="/en/topic/teachers">teachers</a> will arise and many will be led astray; but you should not be deceived, for I have told you all this beforehand<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup>.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_4_6"><a href="#fn_a1_4_6">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_4_53"><a href="#fn_a1_4_53">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p1_5">176:1.5</a></small></sup>  The apostles sat in silence in the moonlight for a considerable time while these astounding predictions of the Master sank into their bewildered minds. And it was in conformity with this very warning that practically the entire group of believers and disciples fled from <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> upon <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> appearance of the Roman troops, finding a safe shelter in <a href="/en/topic/Pella">Pella</a> to the north.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p1_6">176:1.6</a></small></sup>  Even after this explicit warning, many of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ followers interpreted these predictions as referring to the changes which would obviously occur in Jerusalem when the reappearing of the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a> would result in the establishment of the <a href="/en/topic/New_Jerusalem">New Jerusalem</a> and in the enlargement of the city to become the world’s capital<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b11"><a href="#fn_b11">[11]</a></sup>. In their minds these <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> were determined to connect the destruction of the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> with the “<a href="/en/topic/end_of_the_world">end of the world</a>.” They believed this New Jerusalem would fill all <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a>; that the end of the world would be followed by the immediate appearance of the “new heavens and the new earth<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b12"><a href="#fn_b12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b13"><a href="#fn_b13">[13]</a></sup>.” And so it was not strange that <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> should say: “<a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, we know that all things will pass away when the new heavens and the new earth appear, but how shall we know when you will return to bring all this about?”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b14"><a href="#fn_b14">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p1_7">176:1.7</a></small></sup>  When Jesus heard this, he was thoughtful for some time and then said: “You ever err since you always try to attach the new teaching to the old; you are determined to misunderstand all my teaching; you insist on interpreting the gospel in accordance with your established beliefs. Nevertheless, I will try to enlighten you.”</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. THE MASTER’S SECOND COMING </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_1">176:2.1</a></small></sup>  On several occasions <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had made statements which led his hearers to infer that, while he intended presently to leave this world, he would most certainly return to consummate the work of the heavenly kingdom. As the conviction grew on his followers that he was going to leave them, and after he had departed from this world, it was only natural for all believers to lay fast hold upon these promises to return. The doctrine of the second coming of <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a> thus became early incorporated into the teachings of the Christians, and almost every subsequent generation of disciples has devoutly believed this truth and has confidently looked forward to his sometime coming.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_1_45"><a href="#fn_a2_1_45">[4]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_2"><a href="#fn_s2_1_2">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_1_5"><a href="#fn_s2_1_5">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_2">176:2.2</a></small></sup>  If they were to part with their <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and Teacher, how much more did these first disciples and the apostles grasp at this promise to return, and they lost no time in associating the predicted destruction of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> with this promised second coming. And they continued thus to interpret his words notwithstanding that, throughout this evening of instruction on <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Olivet">Mount Olivet</a>, the Master took particular pains to prevent just such a mistake.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_2_5"><a href="#fn_s2_2_5">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_3">176:2.3</a></small></sup>  In further answer to <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>’s question, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> said: “Why do you still look for the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> to sit upon the throne of <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a> and expect that the material dreams of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> will be fulfilled? Have I not told you all these years that my kingdom is not of this world? The things which you now look down upon are coming to an end, but this will be a new beginning out of which the gospel of the kingdom will go to all the world and this salvation will spread to all peoples<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b15"><a href="#fn_b15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b16"><a href="#fn_b16">[16]</a></sup>. And when the kingdom shall have come to its full fruition, be assured that the Father in heaven will not fail to visit you with an enlarged revelation of truth and an enhanced demonstration of righteousness, even as he has already bestowed upon this world him who became the prince of darkness, and then <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a>, who was followed by <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a>, and in these days, the Son of Man. And so will my Father continue to manifest his mercy and show forth his love, even to this dark and evil world. So also will I, after my Father has invested me with all power and authority, continue to follow your fortunes and to guide in the affairs of the kingdom by the presence of my spirit, who shall shortly be poured out upon all flesh. Even though I shall thus be present with you in spirit, I also promise that I will sometime return to this world, where I have lived this life in the flesh and achieved the experience of simultaneously revealing <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> to man and leading man to God. Very soon must I leave you and take up the work the Father has intrusted to my hands, but be of good courage, for I will sometime return.

This servant came forward, saying, ‘Lord, I knew you and realized that you were a shrewd man in that you expected gains where you had not personally labored; therefore was I afraid to risk aught of that which was intrusted to me. I safely hid your talent in the earth; here it is; you now have what belongs to you.’ But his lord answered: ‘You are an indolent and slothful steward. By your own words you confess that you knew I would require of you an accounting with reasonable profit, such as your diligent fellow servants have this day rendered. Knowing this, you ought, therefore, to have at least put my money into the hands of the bankers that on my return I might have received my own with interest.’ And then to the chief steward this lord said: ‘Take away this one talent from this unprofitable servant and give it to him who has the ten talents.’<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b27"><a href="#fn_b27">[27]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_4_4"><a href="#fn_a3_4_4">[38]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_4_37"><a href="#fn_a3_4_37">[39]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_4_3"><a href="#fn_s3_4_3">[9]</a></sup></p>

On one occasion he intimated that, whereas the eye of flesh had beheld him when he lived here in the flesh, on his return (at least on one of his possible visits) he would be discerned only by the eye of spiritual faith.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_3_0"><a href="#fn_a4_3_0">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p4_4">176:4.4</a></small></sup>  Many of us are inclined to believe that Jesus will return to <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> many times during the ages to come. We do not have his specific promise to make these plural visits, but it seems most probable that he who carries among his universe titles that of <a href="/en/topic/Planetary_Prince_of_Urantia">Planetary Prince of Urantia</a> will many times visit the world whose conquest conferred such a unique title upon him.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_4_9"><a href="#fn_a4_4_9">[9]</a></sup></p>

Will his second advent on earth be timed to occur in connection with the terminal judgment of this present age, either with or without the associated appearance of a Magisterial Son? Will he come in connection with the termination of some subsequent Urantian age? Will he come unannounced and as an isolated event? We do not know. Only one thing we are certain of, that is, when he does return, all the world will likely know about it, for he must come as the supreme ruler of a universe and not as the obscure babe of <a href="/en/topic/Bethlehem_(Judea)">Bethlehem</a>. But if every eye is to behold him, and if only spiritual eyes are to discern his presence, then must his advent be long deferred.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_5_20"><a href="#fn_a4_5_20">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_5_21"><a href="#fn_a4_5_21">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_5_19"><a href="#fn_a4_5_19">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_5_7"><a href="#fn_a4_5_7">[18]</a></sup></p>

We are sure of only one thing: He has promised to come back. We have no idea as to when he will fulfill this promise or in what connection.
