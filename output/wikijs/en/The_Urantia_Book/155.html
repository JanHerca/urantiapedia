<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p2_1">155:2.1</a></small></sup>  On Monday morning, May 23, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> directed <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> to go over to <a href="/en/topic/Chorazin">Chorazin</a> with the twelve evangelists while he, with the eleven, departed for <a href="/en/topic/Caesarea_Philippi">Caesarea-Philippi</a>, going by way of the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> to the Damascus-Capernaum road, thence northeast to the junction with the road to Caesarea-Philippi, and then on into that city, where they tarried and taught for two weeks.

<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p2_2">155:2.2</a></small></sup>  Peter and the evangelists sojourned in Chorazin for two weeks, preaching the gospel of the kingdom to a small but earnest company of believers<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b11"><a href="#fn_b11">[11]</a></sup>. But they were not able to win many new converts. No city of all <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> yielded so few souls for the kingdom as Chorazin. In accordance with Peter’s instructions the twelve evangelists had less to say about healing—things physical—while they preached and taught with increased vigor the spiritual truths of the heavenly kingdom. These two weeks at Chorazin constituted a veritable baptism of adversity for the twelve evangelists in that it was the most difficult and unproductive period in their careers up to this time. Being thus deprived of the satisfaction of winning souls for the kingdom, each of them the more earnestly and honestly took stock of his own soul and its progress in the spiritual paths of the new life.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p2_3">155:2.3</a></small></sup>  When it appeared that no more people were minded to seek entrance into the kingdom, <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, on Tuesday, June 7, called his associates together and departed for <a href="/en/topic/Caesarea_Philippi">Caesarea-Philippi</a> to join <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the apostles. They arrived about noontime on <a href="/en/topic/Wednesday">Wednesday</a> and spent the entire evening in rehearsing their experiences among the unbelievers of <a href="/en/topic/Chorazin">Chorazin</a>. During the discussions of this evening Jesus made further reference to the parable of the <a href="/en/topic/sower">sower</a> and taught them much about the meaning of the apparent failure of life undertakings.</p>

<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p3_1">155:3.1</a></small></sup>  Although <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> did no public work during this two weeks’ sojourn near <a href="/en/topic/Caesarea_Philippi">Caesarea-Philippi</a>, the apostles held numerous quiet evening meetings in the city, and many of the believers came out to the camp to talk with the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>. Very few were added to the group of believers as a result of this visit. Jesus talked with the apostles each day, and they more clearly discerned that a new phase of the work of preaching the <a href="/en/topic/kingdom_of_heaven">kingdom of heaven</a> was now beginning<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b12"><a href="#fn_b12">[12]</a></sup>.

<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p3_2">155:3.2</a></small></sup>  The sojourn at Caesarea-Philippi was a real test to the eleven apostles; it was a difficult two weeks for them to live through. They were well-nigh depressed, and they missed the periodic stimulation of <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>’s enthusiastic personality. In these times it was truly a great and testing adventure to believe in Jesus and go forth to follow after him. Though they made few converts during these two weeks, they did learn much that was highly profitable from their daily conferences with the Master.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p3_3">155:3.3</a></small></sup>  The apostles learned that the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> were spiritually stagnant and dying because they had crystallized <a href="/en/topic/truth">truth</a> into a creed; that when truth becomes formulated as a boundary line of self-righteous exclusiveness instead of serving as signposts of spiritual guidance and progress, such teachings lose their creative and life-giving power and ultimately become merely preservative and fossilizing<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b13"><a href="#fn_b13">[13]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_3_19"><a href="#fn_a3_3_19">[34]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_3_74"><a href="#fn_a3_3_74">[35]</a></sup></p>

They learned that many souls can best be led to <a href="/en/topic/love">love</a> the unseen <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> by being first taught to love their brethren whom they can see. And it was in this connection that new meaning became attached to the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s pronouncement concerning unselfish service for one’s fellows: “Inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of my brethren, you did it to me.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_4_80"><a href="#fn_a3_4_80">[29]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_4_138"><a href="#fn_a3_4_138">[33]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_4_13"><a href="#fn_a3_4_13">[36]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_4_14"><a href="#fn_a3_4_14">[37]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_4_85"><a href="#fn_a3_4_85">[38]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_4_134"><a href="#fn_a3_4_134">[39]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_4_135"><a href="#fn_a3_4_135">[40]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_4_146"><a href="#fn_a3_4_146">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p3_5">155:3.5</a></small></sup>  One of the great lessons of this sojourn at <a href="/en/topic/Caesarea">Caesarea</a> had to do with the origin of religious traditions, with the grave danger of allowing a sense of <a href="/en/topic/sacredness">sacredness</a> to become attached to nonsacred things, common ideas, or everyday events. From one conference they emerged with the teaching that true <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> was man’s heartfelt loyalty to his highest and truest convictions.</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p3_6">155:3.6</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> warned his believers that, if their religious longings were only material, increasing knowledge of nature would, by progressive displacement of the supposed supernatural origin of things, ultimately deprive them of their <a href="/en/topic/faith">faith</a> in <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>.

And he never grew weary of pointing out to the twelve the great danger of accepting religious symbols and ceremonies in the place of religious experience.
