<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p1_1">155:1.1</a></small></sup>  Said <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>: “You should all recall how the Psalmist spoke of these times, saying, ‘Why do the <a href="/en/topic/heathen">heathen</a> rage and the peoples plot in vain?

But you shall not see the remainder of the Psalmist’s prophecy fulfilled, for he entertained erroneous ideas about the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> and his mission on earth. My kingdom is founded on love, proclaimed in mercy, and established by unselfish service. My Father does not sit in heaven laughing in derision at the heathen. He is not wrathful in his great displeasure<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.

Because their outlook is small and narrow, they are able to <a href="/en/topic/concentration">concentrate</a> their energies enthusiastically. Their goal is near and more or less visible; wherefore do they strive with valiant and effective execution. You who have professed entrance into the kingdom of heaven are altogether too vacillating and indefinite in your teaching conduct. The heathen strike directly for their objectives; you are guilty of too much chronic <a href="/en/topic/yearning">yearning</a>. If you desire to enter the kingdom, why do you not take it by spiritual assault even as the heathen take a <a href="/en/topic/cities">city</a> they lay siege to? You are hardly worthy of the kingdom when your service consists so largely in an attitude of regretting the past, whining over the present, and vainly hoping for the future. Why do the heathen rage? Because they know not the truth. Why do you languish in futile yearning? Because you <i>obey</i> not the truth. Cease your useless yearning and go forth bravely doing that which concerns the establishment of the kingdom.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2"><a href="#fn_a2">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p2_1">155:2.1</a></small></sup>  On Monday morning, May 23, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> directed <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> to go over to <a href="/en/topic/Chorazin">Chorazin</a> with the twelve evangelists while he, with the eleven, departed for <a href="/en/topic/Caesarea_Philippi">Caesarea-Philippi</a>, going by way of the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> to the Damascus-Capernaum road, thence northeast to the junction with the road to Caesarea-Philippi, and then on into that city, where they tarried and taught for two weeks. They arrived during the afternoon of Tuesday, May 24.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p2_2">155:2.2</a></small></sup>  Peter and the evangelists sojourned in Chorazin for two weeks, preaching the gospel of the kingdom to a small but earnest company of believers<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b11"><a href="#fn_b11">[11]</a></sup>. But they were not able to win many new converts. No city of all <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> yielded so few souls for the kingdom as Chorazin. In accordance with Peter’s instructions the twelve evangelists had less to say about healing—things physical—while they preached and taught with increased vigor the spiritual truths of the heavenly kingdom. These two weeks at Chorazin constituted a veritable baptism of adversity for the twelve evangelists in that it was the most difficult and unproductive period in their careers up to this time. Being thus deprived of the satisfaction of winning souls for the kingdom, each of them the more earnestly and honestly took stock of his own soul and its progress in the spiritual paths of the new life.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p2_3">155:2.3</a></small></sup>  When it appeared that no more people were minded to seek entrance into the kingdom, <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, on Tuesday, June 7, called his associates together and departed for <a href="/en/topic/Caesarea_Philippi">Caesarea-Philippi</a> to join <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the apostles. They arrived about noontime on <a href="/en/topic/Wednesday">Wednesday</a> and spent the entire evening in rehearsing their experiences among the unbelievers of <a href="/en/topic/Chorazin">Chorazin</a>. During the discussions of this evening Jesus made further reference to the parable of the <a href="/en/topic/sower">sower</a> and taught them much about the meaning of the apparent failure of life undertakings.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. AT CAESAREA-PHILIPPI </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p3_1">155:3.1</a></small></sup>  Although <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> did no public work during this two weeks’ sojourn near <a href="/en/topic/Caesarea_Philippi">Caesarea-Philippi</a>, the apostles held numerous quiet evening meetings in the city, and many of the believers came out to the camp to talk with the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>. Very few were added to the group of believers as a result of this visit. Jesus talked with the apostles each day, and they more clearly discerned that a new phase of the work of preaching the <a href="/en/topic/kingdom_of_heaven">kingdom of heaven</a> was now beginning<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b12"><a href="#fn_b12">[12]</a></sup>. They were commencing to comprehend that the “kingdom of heaven is not meat and drink but the realization of the spiritual joy of the acceptance of divine sonship.”</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p3_2">155:3.2</a></small></sup>  The sojourn at Caesarea-Philippi was a real test to the eleven apostles; it was a difficult two weeks for them to live through. They were well-nigh depressed, and they missed the periodic stimulation of <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>’s enthusiastic personality. In these times it was truly a great and testing adventure to believe in Jesus and go forth to follow after him. Though they made few converts during these two weeks, they did learn much that was highly profitable from their daily conferences with the Master.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p3_3">155:3.3</a></small></sup>  The apostles learned that the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> were spiritually stagnant and dying because they had crystallized <a href="/en/topic/truth">truth</a> into a creed; that when truth becomes formulated as a boundary line of self-righteous exclusiveness instead of serving as signposts of spiritual guidance and progress, such teachings lose their creative and life-giving power and ultimately become merely preservative and fossilizing<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b13"><a href="#fn_b13">[13]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a10"><a href="#fn_a10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a11"><a href="#fn_a11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p3_4">155:3.4</a></small></sup>  Increasingly they learned from <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> to look upon human personalities in terms of their possibilities in time and in eternity. They learned that many souls can best be led to <a href="/en/topic/love">love</a> the unseen <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> by being first taught to love their brethren whom they can see. And it was in this connection that new meaning became attached to the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s pronouncement concerning unselfish service for one’s fellows: “Inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of my brethren, you did it to me.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a12"><a href="#fn_a12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a13"><a href="#fn_a13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a14"><a href="#fn_a14">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p3_5">155:3.5</a></small></sup>  One of the great lessons of this sojourn at <a href="/en/topic/Caesarea">Caesarea</a> had to do with the origin of religious traditions, with the grave danger of allowing a sense of <a href="/en/topic/sacredness">sacredness</a> to become attached to nonsacred things, common ideas, or everyday events. From one conference they emerged with the teaching that true <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> was man’s heartfelt loyalty to his highest and truest convictions.</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p3_6">155:3.6</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> warned his believers that, if their religious longings were only material, increasing knowledge of nature would, by progressive displacement of the supposed supernatural origin of things, ultimately deprive them of their <a href="/en/topic/faith">faith</a> in <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. But that, if their religion were spiritual, never could the progress of physical <a href="/en/topic/science">science</a> disturb their faith in eternal realities and divine values.</p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p3_7">155:3.7</a></small></sup>  They learned that, when <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> is wholly spiritual in motive, it makes all life more worth while, filling it with high purposes, dignifying it with transcendent values, inspiring it with superb motives, all the while comforting the human soul with a sublime and sustaining hope. True religion is designed to lessen the strain of existence; it releases faith and courage for daily living and unselfish serving. Faith promotes spiritual vitality and righteous fruitfulness.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a15"><a href="#fn_a15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a16"><a href="#fn_a16">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p3_8">155:3.8</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> repeatedly taught his apostles that no civilization could long survive the loss of the best in its religion. And he never grew weary of pointing out to the twelve the great danger of accepting religious symbols and ceremonies in the place of religious experience. His whole earth life was consistently devoted to the mission of thawing out the frozen forms of religion into the liquid liberties of enlightened sonship.</p>

<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p4_2">155:4.2</a></small></sup>  While pausing for lunch under the shadow of an overhanging ledge of rock, near Luz, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> delivered one of the most remarkable addresses which his apostles ever listened to throughout all their years of association with him. No sooner had they seated themselves to break bread than <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a> asked Jesus: “<a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, since the Father in heaven knows all things, and since his spirit is our support in the establishment of the kingdom of heaven on earth, why is it that we flee from the threats of our enemies? Why do we refuse to confront the foes of truth?” But before Jesus had begun to answer <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>’s question, Thomas broke in, asking: “Master, I should really like to know just what is wrong with the religion of our enemies at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. What is the real difference between their religion and ours? Why is it we are at such diversity of belief when we all profess to serve the same <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>?” And when Thomas had finished, Jesus said: “While I would not ignore Peter’s question, knowing full well how easy it would be to misunderstand my reasons for avoiding an open clash with the rulers of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> at just this time, still it will prove more helpful to all of you if I choose rather to answer Thomas’s question. And that I will proceed to do when you have finished your lunch.”</p>
<h2 id="p5" class="toc-header"><a href="#p5" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 5. THE DISCOURSE ON TRUE RELIGION </h2>
<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p5_1">155:5.1</a></small></sup>  This memorable discourse on <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a>, summarized and restated in modern phraseology, gave expression to the following truths:</p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p5_2">155:5.2</a></small></sup>  While the religions of the world have a double origin—natural and revelatory—at any one time and among any one people there are to be found three distinct forms of religious devotion. And these three manifestations of the religious urge are:</p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p5_3">155:5.3</a></small></sup>  1. <i>Primitive <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a>.</i> The seminatural and instinctive urge to fear mysterious energies and worship superior forces, chiefly a religion of the physical nature, the religion of fear.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a17"><a href="#fn_a17">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p5_4">155:5.4</a></small></sup>  2. <i>The religion of civilization.</i> The advancing religious concepts and practices of the civilizing races—the religion of the mind—the intellectual theology of the authority of established religious tradition.</p>
<p id="p5_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p5_5">155:5.5</a></small></sup>  3. <i>True <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a>—the religion of revelation.</i> The revelation of supernatural values, a partial insight into eternal realities, a glimpse of the goodness and beauty of the infinite character of the Father in heaven—the religion of the spirit as demonstrated in human experience.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a18"><a href="#fn_a18">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p5_6">155:5.6</a></small></sup>  The religion of the physical senses and the superstitious fears of natural man, the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> refused to belittle, though he deplored the fact that so much of this primitive form of worship should persist in the religious forms of the more intelligent races of mankind. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> made it clear that the great difference between the religion of the mind and the religion of the spirit is that, while the former is upheld by ecclesiastical authority, the latter is wholly based on human experience.</p>
<p id="p5_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p5_7">155:5.7</a></small></sup>  And then the Master, in his hour of teaching, went on to make clear these truths:</p>
<p id="p5_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p5_8">155:5.8</a></small></sup>  Until the races become highly intelligent and more fully civilized, there will persist many of those childlike and superstitious ceremonies which are so characteristic of the evolutionary religious practices of primitive and backward peoples. Until the human race progresses to the level of a higher and more general recognition of the realities of spiritual experience, large numbers of men and women will continue to show a personal preference for those religions of authority which require only intellectual assent, in contrast to the <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> of the spirit, which entails active participation of mind and soul in the faith adventure of grappling with the rigorous realities of progressive human experience.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a19"><a href="#fn_a19">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a20"><a href="#fn_a20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a21"><a href="#fn_a21">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p5_9">155:5.9</a></small></sup>  The acceptance of the traditional religions of authority presents the easy way out for man’s urge to seek satisfaction for the longings of his spiritual nature.
