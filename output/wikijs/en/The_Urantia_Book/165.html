<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p0_1">165:0.1</a></small></sup>  ON TUESDAY, January 3, A.D. 30, <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a>, the former chief of the twelve apostles of <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John the Baptist</a>, a Nazarite and onetime head of the Nazarite school at <a href="/en/topic/Engedi">Engedi</a>, now chief of the seventy <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> of the kingdom, called his associates together and gave them final instructions before sending them on a mission to all of the cities and villages of <a href="/en/topic/Perea">Perea</a>. This Perean mission continued for almost three months and was <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> ministry of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>. From these labors <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> went directly to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> to pass through his final experiences in the flesh. The seventy, supplemented by the periodic labors of Jesus and the twelve apostles, worked in the following cities and towns and some fifty additional villages: <a href="/en/topic/Zaphon">Zaphon</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Gadara">Gadara</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Macad">Macad</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Arbela">Arbela</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Ramath">Ramath</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Edrei">Edrei</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Bosora">Bosora</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Caspin">Caspin</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Mispeh">Mispeh</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Gerasa">Gerasa</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Ragaba">Ragaba</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Succoth">Succoth</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Amathus">Amathus</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Penuel">Penuel</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Capitolias">Capitolias</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Dion">Dion</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Hatita">Hatita</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Gadda">Gadda</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Jogbehah">Jogbehah</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Gilead">Gilead</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Beth-Nimrah">Beth-Nimrah</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Tyrus">Tyrus</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Elealah">Elealah</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Livias">Livias</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Heshbon">Heshbon</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Callirrhoe">Callirrhoe</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Beth-Peor">Beth-Peor</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Shittim">Shittim</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Sibmah">Sibmah</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Medeba">Medeba</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Beth-Meon">Beth-Meon</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Areopolis">Areopolis</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Aroer">Aroer</a>.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p0_2">165:0.2</a></small></sup>  Throughout this tour of Perea the <a href="/en/topic/women’s_corps">women’s corps</a>, now numbering sixty-two, took over most of the work of ministration to the sick. This was the final period of the development of the higher spiritual aspects of the gospel of the kingdom, and there was, accordingly, an absence of miracle working. No other part of <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a> was so thoroughly worked by the apostles and disciples of Jesus, and in no other region did the better classes of citizens so generally accept the Master’s teaching.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p0_3">165:0.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Perea">Perea</a> at this time was about equally gentile and Jewish, the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> having been generally removed from these regions during the times of <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Maccabee">Judas Maccabee</a>. Perea was the most beautiful and picturesque province of all Palestine. It was generally referred to by the <a href="/en/topic/Jews_(ancient_Hebrews)">Jews</a> as “the land beyond the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a>.”</p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p0_4">165:0.4</a></small></sup>  Throughout this period <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> divided his time between the camp at <a href="/en/topic/Pella">Pella</a> and trips with the twelve to assist the seventy in the various cities where they taught and preached. Under <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a>’s instructions the seventy baptized all believers, although Jesus had not so charged them.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. AT THE PELLA CAMP </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p1_1">165:1.1</a></small></sup>  By the middle of January more than twelve hundred persons were gathered together at <a href="/en/topic/Pella">Pella</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> taught this multitude at least once each day when he was in residence at the camp, usually speaking at nine o’clock in the morning if not prevented by rain. <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> and the other apostles taught each afternoon<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. The evenings Jesus reserved for the usual sessions of questions and answers with the twelve and other advanced disciples. The evening groups averaged about fifty.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p1_2">165:1.2</a></small></sup>  By the middle of March, the time when Jesus began his journey toward <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, over four thousand persons composed the large audience which heard Jesus or Peter preach each morning. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> chose to terminate his work on earth when the interest in his message had reached a high point, the highest point attained under this second or nonmiraculous phase of the progress of the kingdom. While three quarters of the multitude were truth seekers, there were also present a large number of <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> from Jerusalem and elsewhere, together with many doubters and cavilers.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p1_3">165:1.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the twelve apostles devoted much of their time to the multitude assembled at the <a href="/en/topic/Pella">Pella</a> camp. The twelve paid little or no attention to the field work, only going out with Jesus to visit <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a>’s associates from time to time. Abner was very familiar with the Perean district since this was the field in which his former master, <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John the Baptist</a>, had done most of his work. After beginning the Perean mission, Abner and the seventy never returned to the Pella camp.</p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p2_1">165:2.1</a></small></sup>  A company of over three hundred Jerusalemites, <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> and others, followed <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> north to <a href="/en/topic/Pella">Pella</a> when he hastened away from the jurisdiction of the Jewish rulers at the ending of the feast of the dedication; and it was in the presence of these Jewish teachers and leaders, as well as in the hearing of the twelve apostles, that Jesus preached the sermon on the “<a href="/en/topic/good_shepherd">Good Shepherd</a>.” After half an hour of informal discussion, speaking to a group of about one hundred, Jesus said:<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_3"><a href="#fn_s2_1_3">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p2_3">165:2.3</a></small></sup>  “Tonight, here before me are men who would be willing to die for me and for this gospel of the kingdom, and some of them will so offer themselves in the years to come; and here also are some of you, slaves of tradition, who have followed me down from <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, and who, with your darkened and deluded leaders, seek to kill the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>.

And when the morning has come, he enters into the fold by the door, and when he calls, the sheep know his voice. Every shepherd who gains entrance to the sheepfold by any other means than by the door is a thief and a robber<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>. The true shepherd enters the fold after the porter has opened the door for him, and his sheep, knowing his voice, come out at his word; and when they that are his are thus brought forth, the true shepherd goes before them; he leads the way and the sheep follow him. His sheep follow him because they know his voice; they will not follow a stranger. They will flee from the stranger because they know not his voice<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>.

Some of you are not of my fold; you know not my voice, and you do not follow me. And because you are false shepherds, the sheep know not your voice and will not follow you.”</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p2_5">165:2.5</a></small></sup>  And when <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had spoken this parable, no one asked him a question. After a time he began again to speak and went on to discuss the parable:</p>

The thief breaks into the fold only to steal, and to kill, and to destroy; but I have come that you all may have life and have it more abundantly.
