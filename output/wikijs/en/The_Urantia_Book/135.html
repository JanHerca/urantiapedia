<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p1_1">135:1.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a> had no school from which to graduate at the age of fourteen, but his parents had selected this as the appropriate year for him to take the formal Nazarite vow. Accordingly, <a href="/en/topic/Zacharias">Zacharias</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Elizabeth_of_Tiberias">Elizabeth</a> took their son to <a href="/en/topic/Engedi">Engedi</a>, down by the <a href="/en/topic/Dead_Sea">Dead Sea</a>. This was the southern headquarters of the <a href="/en/topic/Nazarites">Nazarite brotherhood</a>, and there the lad was duly and solemnly inducted into this order for life. After these ceremonies and the making of the vows to abstain from all intoxicating drinks, to let the hair grow, and to refrain from touching the dead, the family proceeded to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, where, before the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>, <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John</a> completed the making of the offerings which were required of those taking Nazarite vows<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_1_6"><a href="#fn_a1_1_6">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p1_2">135:1.2</a></small></sup>  John took the same life vows that had been administered to his illustrious predecessors, <a href="/en/topic/Samson">Samson</a> and the prophet <a href="/en/topic/Samuel">Samuel</a>. A life Nazarite was looked upon as a sanctified and holy personality. The <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> regarded a Nazarite with almost the respect and veneration accorded the high priest, and this was not strange since Nazarites of lifelong consecration were the only persons, except high priests, who were ever permitted to enter the <a href="/en/topic/holy_of_holies">holy of holies</a> in the <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p1_3">135:1.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a> returned home from <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> to tend his father‚Äôs sheep and grew up to be a strong man with a noble character.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p1_4">135:1.4</a></small></sup>  When sixteen years old, John, as a result of reading about <a href="/en/topic/Elijah_Mark">Elijah</a>, became greatly impressed with the prophet of <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Carmel">Mount Carmel</a> and decided to adopt his style of dress<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>. From that day on John always wore a hairy garment with a leather girdle. At sixteen he was more than six feet tall and almost full grown. With his flowing hair and peculiar mode of dress he was indeed a picturesque youth. And his parents expected great things of this their only son, a child of promise and a <a href="/en/topic/Nazarites">Nazarite</a> for life.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_4_6"><a href="#fn_a1_4_6">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p2_1">135:2.1</a></small></sup>  After an illness of several months <a href="/en/topic/Zacharias">Zacharias</a> died in July, A.D. 12, when <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a> was just past eighteen years of age. This was a time of great embarrassment to <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John</a> since the <a href="/en/topic/Nazarites">Nazarite</a> vow forbade contact with the <a href="/en/topic/dead">dead</a>, even in one‚Äôs own family. Although John had endeavored to comply with the restrictions of his vow regarding <a href="/en/topic/defilement">contamination</a> by the dead, he doubted that he had been wholly obedient to the requirements of the Nazarite order; therefore, after his father‚Äôs burial he went to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, where, in the Nazarite corner of the <a href="/en/topic/court_of_women">women‚Äôs court</a>, he offered the sacrifices required for his cleansing.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p2_2">135:2.2</a></small></sup>  In September of this year <a href="/en/topic/Elizabeth_of_Tiberias">Elizabeth</a> and John made a journey to <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> to visit <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. John had just about made up his mind to launch out in his lifework, but he was admonished, not only by Jesus‚Äô words but also by his example, to return home, take care of his mother, and await the ‚Äúcoming of the Father‚Äôs hour.‚Äù After bidding Jesus and <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Clopas)">Mary</a> good-bye at the end of this enjoyable visit, John did not again see Jesus until the event of his baptism in the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p2_3">135:2.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a> and Elizabeth returned to their home and began to lay plans for the future. Since <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John</a> refused to accept the priest‚Äôs allowance due him from the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> funds, by the end of two years they had all but lost their home; so they decided to go south with the sheep herd. Accordingly, the summer that John was twenty years of age witnessed their removal to <a href="/en/topic/Hebron">Hebron</a>. In the so-called ‚Äú<a href="/en/topic/wilderness_of_Judea">wilderness of Judea</a>‚Äù John tended his sheep along a brook that was tributary to a larger stream which entered the <a href="/en/topic/Dead_Sea">Dead Sea</a> at <a href="/en/topic/Engedi">Engedi</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>. The Engedi colony included not only <a href="/en/topic/Nazarites">Nazarites</a> of lifelong and time-period consecration but numerous other ascetic herdsmen who congregated in this region with their herds and fraternized with the Nazarite brotherhood. They supported themselves by sheep raising and from gifts which wealthy <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> made to the order.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p2_4">135:2.4</a></small></sup>  As time passed, John returned less often to Hebron, while he made more frequent visits to Engedi. He was so entirely different from the majority of the Nazarites that he found it very difficult fully to fraternize with the brotherhood. But he was very fond of <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a>, the acknowledged leader and head of the Engedi colony.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 3. THE LIFE OF A SHEPHERD </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p3_1">135:3.1</a></small></sup>  Along the valley of this little brook <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a> built no less than a dozen stone shelters and night corrals, consisting of piled-up stones, wherein he could watch over and safeguard his herds of sheep and goats. <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John</a>‚Äôs life as a <a href="/en/topic/shepherd">shepherd</a> afforded him a great deal of time for thought. He talked much with <a href="/en/topic/Ezda">Ezda</a>, an orphan lad of <a href="/en/topic/Beth-zur">Beth-zur</a>, whom he had in a way adopted, and who cared for the herds when he made trips to <a href="/en/topic/Hebron">Hebron</a> to see his mother and to sell sheep, as well as when he went down to <a href="/en/topic/Engedi">Engedi</a> for <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> services. John and the lad lived very simply, subsisting on mutton, goat‚Äôs milk, wild honey, and the edible <a href="/en/topic/locusts">locusts</a> of that region<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>. This, their regular diet, was supplemented by provisions brought from Hebron and Engedi from time to time.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p3_2">135:3.2</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Elizabeth_of_Tiberias">Elizabeth</a> kept John posted about Palestinian and world affairs, and his conviction grew deeper and deeper that the time was fast approaching when the old order was to end; that he was to become the herald of the approach of a new age, ‚Äúthe kingdom of heaven.‚Äù This rugged shepherd was very partial to the writings of the Prophet <a href="/en/topic/Daniel">Daniel</a>. He read a thousand times Daniel‚Äôs <a href="/en/topic/Revelations,_Book_of">description</a> of the great image, which <a href="/en/topic/Zacharias">Zacharias</a> had told him represented the history of the great kingdoms of the world, beginning with <a href="/en/topic/Babylon">Babylon</a>, then <a href="/en/topic/Persia">Persia</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Greece">Greece</a>, and finally <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a>. John perceived that already was Rome composed of such polyglot peoples and races that it could never become a strongly cemented and firmly consolidated empire<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b9"><a href="#fn_b9">[9]</a></sup>. He believed that Rome was even then divided, as <a href="/en/topic/Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a>, and other provinces; and then he further read ‚Äúin the days of these kings shall the <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed. And this kingdom shall not be left to other people but shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him.

In Daniel he read: ‚ÄúI saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> came with the clouds of heaven, and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b12"><a href="#fn_b12">[12]</a></sup>.‚Äù But these words of the prophet did not harmonize with what his parents had taught him. Neither did his talk with Jesus, at the time of his visit when he was eighteen years old, correspond with these statements of the Scriptures. Notwithstanding this confusion, throughout all of his perplexity his mother assured him that his distant cousin, Jesus of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, was the true <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a>, that he had come to sit on the throne of <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a>, and that he (<a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John</a>) was to become his advance herald and chief support.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_3_4"><a href="#fn_a3_3_4">[23]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_3_8"><a href="#fn_a3_3_8">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p3_4">135:3.4</a></small></sup>  From all John heard of the vice and wickedness of <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a> and the dissoluteness and moral barrenness of the empire, from what he knew of the evil doings of <a href="/en/topic/Herod_Antipas">Herod Antipas</a> and the governors of <a href="/en/topic/Judea">Judea</a>, he was minded to believe that the end of the age was impending. It seemed to this rugged and noble child of nature that the world was ripe for the end of the age of man and the dawn of the new and divine age‚Äîthe <a href="/en/topic/kingdom_of_heaven">kingdom of heaven</a>. The feeling grew in John‚Äôs heart that he was to be the last of the old prophets and <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> of the new. And he fairly vibrated with the mounting impulse to go forth and proclaim to all men: ‚ÄúRepent! Get right with <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>! Get ready for the end; prepare yourselves for the appearance of the new and eternal order of earth affairs, the kingdom of heaven.‚Äù</p>

<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p4_1">135:4.1</a></small></sup>  On August 17, A.D. 22, when <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a> was twenty-eight years of age, his mother suddenly passed away. <a href="/en/topic/Elizabeth_of_Tiberias">Elizabeth</a>‚Äôs friends, knowing of the <a href="/en/topic/Nazarites">Nazarite</a> restrictions regarding contact with the dead, even in one‚Äôs own family, made all arrangements for the burial of <a href="/en/topic/Elizabeth_(mother_of_John_the_Baptist)">Elizabeth</a> before sending for <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John</a>. When he received word of the death of his mother, he directed <a href="/en/topic/Ezda">Ezda</a> to drive his herds to <a href="/en/topic/Engedi">Engedi</a> and started for <a href="/en/topic/Hebron">Hebron</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p4_2">135:4.2</a></small></sup>  On returning to Engedi from his mother‚Äôs funeral, he presented his flocks to the brotherhood and for a season detached himself from the outside world while he fasted and prayed. John knew only of the old methods of approach to divinity; he knew only of the records of such as <a href="/en/topic/Elijah_Mark">Elijah</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Samuel">Samuel</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Daniel">Daniel</a>. <a href="/en/topic/Elijah_(Prophet)">Elijah</a> was his ideal of a prophet. Elijah was <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> of the teachers of <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a> to be regarded as a prophet, and John truly believed that he was to be the last of this long and illustrious line of the <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> of heaven.</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p4_3">135:4.3</a></small></sup>  For two and a half years <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a> lived at <a href="/en/topic/Engedi">Engedi</a>, and he persuaded most of the brotherhood that ‚Äúthe <a href="/en/topic/end_of_the_world">end of the age</a> was at hand‚Äù; that ‚Äúthe kingdom of heaven was about to appear.‚Äù And all his early teaching was based upon the current Jewish idea and concept of the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a> as the promised <a href="/en/topic/Deliverer">deliverer</a> of the Jewish nation from the domination of their gentile rulers.</p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p4_4">135:4.4</a></small></sup>  Throughout this period John read much in the sacred writings which he found at the Engedi home of the <a href="/en/topic/Nazarites">Nazarites</a>. He was especially impressed by <a href="/en/topic/Isaiah_(first)">Isaiah</a> and by <a href="/en/topic/Malachi">Malachi</a>, the last of the prophets up to that time. He read and reread the last five chapters of <a href="/en/topic/Isaiah_(second)">Isaiah</a>, and he believed these prophecies. Then he would read in Malachi: ‚ÄúBehold, I will send you <a href="/en/topic/Elijah_Mark">Elijah</a> the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord; and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers toward the children and the hearts of the children toward their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b13"><a href="#fn_b13">[13]</a></sup>.‚Äù And it was only this promise of Malachi that <a href="/en/topic/Elijah_(Prophet)">Elijah</a> would return that deterred John from going forth to preach about the coming kingdom and to exhort his fellow <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> to flee from the wrath to come. John was ripe for the proclamation of the message of the coming kingdom, but this expectation of the coming of Elijah held him back for more than two years. He knew he was not Elijah.

<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p5_1">135:5.1</a></small></sup>  In order to understand <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a>‚Äôs message, account should be taken of the status of the Jewish people at the time he appeared upon the stage of action. For almost one hundred years all <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a> had been in a quandary; they were at a loss to explain their continuous subjugation to gentile overlords. Had not <a href="/en/topic/Moses">Moses</a> taught that <a href="/en/topic/righteousness">righteousness</a> was always rewarded with prosperity and power? Were they not <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>‚Äôs chosen people? Why was the throne of <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a> desolate and vacant? In the light of the Mosaic doctrines and the precepts of the prophets the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> found it difficult to explain their long-continued national desolation.</p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p5_2">135:5.2</a></small></sup>  About one hundred years before the days of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and John a new school of religious teachers arose in <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/apocalyptists">apocalyptists</a>. These new teachers evolved a system of belief that accounted for the sufferings and humiliation of the Jews on the ground that they were paying the penalty for the nation‚Äôs sins. They fell back onto the well-known reasons assigned to explain the <a href="/en/topic/Babylon">Babylonian</a> and other captivities of former times. But, so taught the apocalyptists, Israel should take heart; the days of their affliction were almost over; the discipline of God‚Äôs chosen people was about finished; God‚Äôs patience with the gentile foreigners was about exhausted. The end of Roman rule was synonymous with the end of the age and, in a certain sense, with the <a href="/en/topic/end_of_the_world">end of the world</a>. These new teachers leaned heavily on the predictions of <a href="/en/topic/Daniel">Daniel</a>, and they consistently taught that creation was about to pass into its final stage; the kingdoms of this world were about to become the kingdom of God. To the Jewish mind of that day this was the meaning of that phrase‚Äîthe <a href="/en/topic/kingdom_of_heaven">kingdom of heaven</a>‚Äîwhich runs throughout the teachings of both John and Jesus. To the Jews of Palestine the phrase ‚Äúkingdom of heaven‚Äù had but one meaning: an absolutely righteous state in which God (the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a>) would rule the nations of earth in perfection of power just as he ruled in heaven‚Äî‚ÄúYour will be done on earth as in heaven<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b14"><a href="#fn_b14">[14]</a></sup>.‚Äù<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_2_3"><a href="#fn_a5_2_3">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_2_5"><a href="#fn_a5_2_5">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_2_10"><a href="#fn_a5_2_10">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p5_3">135:5.3</a></small></sup>  In the days of <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a> all <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> were expectantly asking, ‚ÄúHow soon will the kingdom come?‚Äù There was a general feeling that the end of the rule of the gentile nations was drawing near. There was present throughout all Jewry a lively hope and a keen expectation that the consummation of the desire of the ages would occur during the lifetime of that generation.</p>
<p id="p5_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p5_4">135:5.4</a></small></sup>  While the Jews differed greatly in their estimates of the nature of the coming kingdom, they were alike in their belief that the event was impending, near at hand, even at the door. Many who read the <a href="/en/topic/Old_Testament">Old Testament</a> literally looked expectantly for a new king in <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a>, for a regenerated Jewish nation delivered from its enemies and presided over by the successor of King <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a> who would quickly be acknowledged as the rightful and righteous ruler of all the world. Another, though smaller, group of devout Jews held a vastly different view of this kingdom of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. They taught that the coming kingdom was not of this world, that the world was approaching its certain end, and that ‚Äúa new heaven and a new earth‚Äù were to usher in the establishment of the kingdom of God; that this kingdom was to be an everlasting dominion, that sin was to be ended, and that the citizens of the new kingdom were to become immortal in their enjoyment of this endless bliss<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b15"><a href="#fn_b15">[15]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_4_3"><a href="#fn_a5_4_3">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_4_24"><a href="#fn_a5_4_24">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p5_5">135:5.5</a></small></sup>  All were agreed that some drastic purging or purifying discipline would of necessity precede the establishment of the new kingdom on earth. The literalists taught that a world-wide war would ensue which would destroy all unbelievers, while the faithful would sweep on to universal and eternal victory. The spiritists taught that the kingdom would be ushered in by the great judgment of God which would relegate the unrighteous to their well-deserved judgment of punishment and final destruction, at the same time elevating the believing saints of the chosen people to high seats of honor and authority with the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>, who would rule over the redeemed nations in God‚Äôs name. And this latter group even believed that many devout gentiles might be admitted to the fellowship of the new kingdom.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_5_9"><a href="#fn_a5_5_9">[6]</a></sup></p>

And that was the only possible meaning the term Messiah could have had in the minds of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews_(ancient_Hebrews)">Jews</a> of the generation of <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. <i>Messiah</i> could not possibly refer to one who merely taught God‚Äôs will or proclaimed the necessity for righteous living. To all such holy persons the Jews gave the title of <i>prophet.</i> The Messiah was to be more than a prophet; the Messiah was to bring in the establishment of the new kingdom, the kingdom of God. No one who failed to do this could be the Messiah in the traditional Jewish sense.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_6_19"><a href="#fn_a5_6_19">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p5_7">135:5.7</a></small></sup>  Who would this Messiah be? Again the Jewish teachers differed. The older ones clung to the doctrine of the son of <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a>. The newer taught that, since the new kingdom was a heavenly kingdom, the new ruler might also be a divine personality, one who had long sat at God‚Äôs right hand in heaven. And strange as it may appear, those who thus conceived of the ruler of the new kingdom looked upon him not as a human Messiah, not as a mere <i>man,</i> but as ‚Äúthe <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>‚Äù‚Äîa <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_God">Son of God</a>‚Äîa heavenly Prince, long held in waiting thus to assume the rulership of the earth made new<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b16"><a href="#fn_b16">[16]</a></sup>.

<p id="p11_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p11_1">135:11.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a> had a lonely and somewhat bitter experience in prison. Few of his followers were permitted to see him. He longed to see <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> but had to be content with hearing of his work through those of his followers who had become believers in the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>. He was often tempted to doubt Jesus and his divine mission. If Jesus were the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a>, why did he do nothing to deliver him from this unbearable imprisonment? For more than a year and a half this rugged man of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>‚Äôs outdoors languished in that despicable prison. And this experience was a great test of his faith in, and loyalty to, Jesus. Indeed, this whole experience was a great test of <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John</a>‚Äôs faith even in God. Many times was he tempted to doubt even the genuineness of his own mission and experience.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a11_1_0"><a href="#fn_a11_1_0">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p11_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p11_2">135:11.2</a></small></sup>  After he had been in prison several months, a group of his disciples came to him and, after reporting concerning the public activities of Jesus, said: ‚ÄúSo you see, Teacher, that he who was with you at the upper <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> prospers and receives all who come to him. He even feasts with publicans and sinners. You bore courageous witness to him, and yet he does nothing to effect your deliverance<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b54"><a href="#fn_b54">[54]</a></sup>.‚Äù But John answered his friends: ‚ÄúThis man can do nothing unless it has been given him by his Father in heaven. You well remember that I said, ‚ÄòI am not the Messiah, but I am one sent on before to prepare the way for him.‚Äô And that I did. He who has the bride is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom who stands near by and hears him rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom‚Äôs voice. This, my joy, therefore is fulfilled. He must increase but I must decrease. I am of this earth and have declared my message. Jesus of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> comes down to the earth from heaven and is above us all. The Son of Man has descended from God, and the words of God he will declare to you. For the Father in heaven gives not the spirit by measure to his own Son. The Father loves his Son and will presently put all things in the hands of this Son. He who believes in the Son has <a href="/en/topic/eternal_life">eternal life</a>. And these words which I speak are true and abiding.‚Äù<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a11_2_7"><a href="#fn_a11_2_7">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a11_2_20"><a href="#fn_a11_2_20">[21]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a11_2_21"><a href="#fn_a11_2_21">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p11_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p11_3">135:11.3</a></small></sup>  These disciples were amazed at <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a>‚Äôs pronouncement, so much so that they departed in silence. <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John</a> was also much agitated, for he perceived that he had uttered a <a href="/en/topic/prophecies">prophecy</a>. Never again did he wholly doubt the mission and divinity of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. But it was a sore disappointment to John that Jesus sent him no word, that he came not to see him, and that he exercised none of his great power to deliver him from prison. But Jesus knew all about this. He had great love for John, but being now cognizant of his divine nature and knowing fully the great things in preparation for John when he departed from this world and also knowing that John‚Äôs work on earth was finished, he constrained himself not to interfere in the natural outworking of the great preacher-prophet‚Äôs career.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a11_3_7"><a href="#fn_a11_3_7">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p11_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p11_4">135:11.4</a></small></sup>  This long suspense in prison was humanly unbearable. Just a few days before his death John again sent trusted <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> to Jesus, inquiring: ‚ÄúIs my work done? Why do I languish in prison? Are you truly the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a>, or shall we look for another?‚Äù And when these two disciples gave this message to Jesus, the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> replied: ‚ÄúGo back to John and tell him that I have not forgotten but to suffer me also this, for it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b55"><a href="#fn_b55">[55]</a></sup>. Tell John what you have seen and heard‚Äîthat the poor have good tidings preached to them‚Äîand, finally, tell the beloved herald of my earth mission that he shall be abundantly blessed in the age to come if he finds no occasion to doubt and stumble over me.‚Äù And this was <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> word John received from Jesus. This message greatly comforted him and did much to stabilize his faith and prepare him for the tragic end of his life in the flesh which followed so soon upon the heels of this memorable occasion.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a11_4_4"><a href="#fn_a11_4_4">[23]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a11_4_8"><a href="#fn_a11_4_8">[24]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s11_4_1"><a href="#fn_s11_4_1">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p12_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p12_1">135:12.1</a></small></sup>  As <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a> was working in southern <a href="/en/topic/Perea">Perea</a> when arrested, he was taken immediately to the prison of the <a href="/en/topic/Machaerus,_fortress_of">fortress of Machaerus</a>, where he was incarcerated until his execution. <a href="/en/topic/Herod_Antipas">Herod</a> ruled over Perea as well as <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>, and he maintained residence at this time at both <a href="/en/topic/Julias">Julias</a> and Machaerus in Perea.

He feared to put him to death lest the multitude riot in the capital, for thousands of Pereans believed that John was a holy man, a prophet. Therefore Herod kept the <a href="/en/topic/Nazarites">Nazarite</a> preacher in prison, not knowing what else to do with him. Several times John had been before Herod, but never would he agree either to leave the domains of Herod or to refrain from all public activities if he were released. And this new agitation concerning <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, which was steadily increasing, admonished Herod that it was no time to turn John loose. Besides, John was also a victim of the intense and bitter hatred of <a href="/en/topic/Herodias">Herodias</a>, Herod‚Äôs unlawful wife.</p>
<p id="p12_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p12_3">135:12.3</a></small></sup>  On numerous occasions <a href="/en/topic/Herod_Antipas">Herod</a> talked with <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a> about the kingdom of heaven, and while sometimes seriously impressed with his message, he was afraid to release him from prison<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b57"><a href="#fn_b57">[57]</a></sup>.</p>

Herod was very much pleased with the damsel‚Äôs performance and, calling her before him, said: ‚ÄúYou are charming. I am much pleased with you. Ask me on this my birthday for whatever you desire, and I will give it to you, even to the half of my kingdom.‚Äù And Herod did all this while well under the influence of his many wines. The young lady drew aside and inquired of her mother what she should ask of Herod. Herodias said, ‚ÄúGo to Herod and ask for the head of John the Baptist.‚Äù And the young woman, returning to the banquet table, said to Herod, ‚ÄúI request that you forthwith give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter.‚Äù</p>
