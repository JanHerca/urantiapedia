Had he remained at Alexandria, his education would have been directed by <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> and along exclusively Jewish lines. At <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> he secured an education and received a training which more acceptably prepared him to understand the gentiles, and which gave him a better and more balanced idea of the relative merits of the Eastern, or <a href="/en/topic/Babylon">Babylonian</a>, and the Western, or Hellenic, views of <a href="/en/topic/Hebrew_language">Hebrew</a> theology.</p>

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_1">124:1.1</a></small></sup>  Though it could hardly be said that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was ever seriously ill, he did have some of the minor ailments of childhood this year, along with his brothers and baby sister.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_1_0"><a href="#fn_s1_1_0">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_2">124:1.2</a></small></sup>  School went on and he was still a favored pupil, having one week each month at liberty, and he continued to divide his time about equally between trips to neighboring cities with his father, sojourns on his uncle’s <a href="/en/topic/farm">farm</a> south of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, and fishing excursions out from <a href="/en/topic/Magdala">Magdala</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_3">124:1.3</a></small></sup>  The most serious trouble as yet to come up at school occurred in late winter when <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> dared to challenge the chazan regarding the teaching that all images, pictures, and drawings were idolatrous in nature. Jesus delighted in drawing landscapes as well as in modeling a great variety of objects in potter’s clay. Everything of that sort was strictly forbidden by Jewish law, but up to this time he had managed to disarm his parents’ objection to such an extent that they had permitted him to continue in these activities.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_4">124:1.4</a></small></sup>  But trouble was again stirred up at school when one of the more backward pupils discovered Jesus drawing a <a href="/en/topic/charcoal_picture">charcoal picture</a> of the teacher on the floor of the schoolroom. There it was, plain as day, and many of the elders had viewed it before the committee went to call on <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> to demand that something be done to suppress the lawlessness of his eldest son. And though this was not <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> time <a href="/en/topic/complaining">complaints</a> had come to <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_(Old_Testament)">Joseph</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> about the doings of their versatile and aggressive child, this was the most serious of all the accusations which had thus far been lodged against him. Jesus listened to the indictment of his artistic efforts for some time, being seated on a large stone just outside the back door. He resented their blaming his father for his alleged misdeeds; so in he marched, fearlessly confronting his accusers. The elders were thrown into confusion. Some were inclined to view the episode humorously, while one or two seemed to think the boy was sacrilegious if not blasphemous. <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_(father_of_Jesus)">Joseph</a> was nonplused, <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Clopas)">Mary</a> indignant, but Jesus insisted on being heard. He had his say, courageously defended his viewpoint, and with consummate self-control announced that he would abide by the decision of his father in this as in all other matters controversial. And the committee of elders departed in silence.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_4_1"><a href="#fn_a1_4_1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_4_12"><a href="#fn_a1_4_12">[2]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_4_0"><a href="#fn_s1_4_0">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_4_1"><a href="#fn_s1_4_1">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_5">124:1.5</a></small></sup>  Mary endeavored to influence Joseph to permit <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> to model in clay at home, provided he promised not to carry on any of these questionable activities at school, but Joseph felt impelled to rule that the rabbinical interpretation of the second commandment should prevail. And so Jesus no more drew or modeled the likeness of anything from that day as long as he lived in his father’s house. But he was unconvinced of the wrong of what he had done, and to give up such a favorite pastime constituted one of the great trials of his young life.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_5_41"><a href="#fn_a1_5_41">[3]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_5_0"><a href="#fn_s1_5_0">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_6">124:1.6</a></small></sup>  In the latter part of June, Jesus, in company with his father, first climbed to the summit of <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Tabor">Mount Tabor</a>. It was a clear day and the view was superb. It seemed to this nine-year-old lad that he had really gazed upon the entire world excepting <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Africa">Africa</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_7">124:1.7</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ second sister, <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(wife_of_Justus)">Martha</a>, was born <a href="/en/topic/Thursday">Thursday</a> night, September 13<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. Three weeks after the coming of <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(sister_of_Jesus)">Martha</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>, who was home for awhile, started the building of an addition to their house, a combined workshop and bedroom. A small workbench was built for Jesus, and for <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> time he possessed tools of his own. At odd times for many years he worked at this bench and became highly expert in the making of yokes.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_7_18"><a href="#fn_a1_7_18">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_7_28"><a href="#fn_a1_7_28">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_7_30"><a href="#fn_a1_7_30">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_8">124:1.8</a></small></sup>  This winter and the next were the coldest in <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> for many decades. Jesus had seen snow on the mountains, and several times it had fallen in Nazareth, remaining on the ground only a short time; but not until this winter had he seen <a href="/en/topic/ice">ice</a>. The fact that <a href="/en/topic/water">water</a> could be had as a solid, a liquid, and a vapor—he had long pondered over the escaping <a href="/en/topic/steam">steam</a> from the boiling pots—caused the lad to think a great deal about the physical world and its constitution; and yet the personality embodied in this growing youth was all this while the actual creator and organizer of all these things throughout a far-flung universe.</p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_9">124:1.9</a></small></sup>  The climate of Nazareth was not severe. January was the coldest month, the temperature averaging around 50° F. During July and August, the hottest months, the temperature would vary from 75° to 90° F. From the mountains to the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Dead_Sea">Dead Sea</a> valley the climate of <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a> ranged from the frigid to the torrid. And so, in a way, the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> were prepared to live in about any and all of the world’s varying climates.</p>
<p id="p1_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_10">124:1.10</a></small></sup>  Even during the warmest summer months a cool sea breeze usually blew from the west from 10:00 A.M. until about 10:00 P.M. But every now and then terrific hot winds from the eastern desert would blow across all Palestine. These hot blasts usually came in February and March, near the end of the rainy season. In those days the rain fell in refreshing showers from November to April, but it did not rain steadily. There were only two seasons in Palestine, summer and winter, the dry and rainy seasons. In January the flowers began to bloom, and by the end of April the whole land was one vast flower <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_11">124:1.11</a></small></sup>  In May of this year, on his uncle’s <a href="/en/topic/farm">farm</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> for <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> time helped with the harvest of the grain. Before he was thirteen, he had managed to find out something about practically everything that men and women worked at around <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> except metal working, and he spent several months in a smith’s shop when older, after the death of his father.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_11_0"><a href="#fn_s1_11_0">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_12">124:1.12</a></small></sup>  When work and caravan travel were slack, Jesus made many trips with his father on pleasure or business to near-by <a href="/en/topic/Cana">Cana</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📘" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d8.svg"><sup id="cite_c1"><a href="#fn_c1">[1]</a></sup>, <a href="/en/topic/Endor">Endor</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Nain">Nain</a>. Even as a lad he frequently visited <a href="/en/topic/Sepphoris">Sepphoris</a>, only a little over three miles from Nazareth to the northwest, and from 4 B.C. to about A.D. 25 the capital of <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> and one of the residences of <a href="/en/topic/Herod_Antipas">Herod Antipas</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_13">124:1.13</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> continued to grow physically, intellectually, socially, and spiritually. His trips away from home did much to give him a better and more generous understanding of his own family, and by this time even his parents were beginning to learn from him as well as to teach him. Jesus was an original thinker and a skillful teacher, even in his youth. He was in constant collision with the so-called “oral law,” but he always sought to adapt himself to the practices of his family. He got along fairly well with the children of his age, but he often grew discouraged with their slow-acting minds. Before he was ten years old, he had become the leader of a group of seven lads who formed themselves into a <a href="/en/topic/clubs">society</a> for promoting the acquirements of manhood—physical, intellectual, and religious. Among these boys Jesus succeeded in introducing many new games and various improved methods of physical <a href="/en/topic/recreation">recreation</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_13_15"><a href="#fn_a1_13_15">[7]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. THE TENTH YEAR (A.D. 4) </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p2_1">124:2.1</a></small></sup>  It was the fifth of July, <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> of the month, when <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, while strolling through the countryside with his father, first gave expression to feelings and ideas which indicated that he was becoming self-conscious of the unusual nature of his life mission. <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> listened attentively to the momentous words of his son but made few comments; he volunteered no information. The next day Jesus had a similar but longer talk with his mother. <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> likewise listened to the pronouncements of the lad, but neither did she volunteer any information. It was almost two years before Jesus again spoke to his parents concerning this increasing revelation within his own consciousness regarding the nature of his personality and the character of his mission on earth.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_1_10"><a href="#fn_a2_1_10">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_1_20"><a href="#fn_a2_1_20">[9]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_0"><a href="#fn_s2_1_0">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p2_2">124:2.2</a></small></sup>  He entered the advanced school of the synagogue in August. At school he was constantly creating trouble by the questions he persisted in asking. Increasingly he kept all <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> in more or less of a hubbub. His parents were loath to forbid his asking these disquieting questions, and his chief teacher was greatly intrigued by the lad’s curiosity, insight, and hunger for knowledge.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_2_0"><a href="#fn_s2_2_0">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p2_3">124:2.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ playmates saw nothing supernatural in his conduct; in most ways he was altogether like themselves. His interest in study was somewhat above the average but not wholly unusual. He did ask more questions at school than others in his class.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p2_4">124:2.4</a></small></sup>  Perhaps his most unusual and outstanding trait was his unwillingness to <a href="/en/topic/fighting">fight</a> for his rights. Since he was such a well-developed lad for his age, it seemed strange to his playfellows that he was disinclined to defend himself even from injustice or when subjected to personal abuse. As it happened, he did not suffer much on account of this trait because of the friendship of <a href="/en/topic/Jacob_of_Crete">Jacob</a>, a neighbor boy, who was one year older. He was the son of the <a href="/en/topic/Aaron_the_stone_mason">stone mason</a>, a business associate of <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>. <a href="/en/topic/Jacob_of_Emmaus">Jacob</a> was a great admirer of Jesus and made it his business to see that no one was permitted to impose upon Jesus because of his aversion to physical combat. Several times older and uncouth youths attacked Jesus, relying upon his reputed docility, but they always suffered swift and certain retribution at the hands of his self-appointed champion and ever-ready defender, <a href="/en/topic/Jacob_the_stone_mason_(son)">Jacob the stone mason</a>’s son.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_4_18"><a href="#fn_a2_4_18">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_4_22"><a href="#fn_a2_4_22">[10]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_4_0"><a href="#fn_s2_4_0">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_4_1"><a href="#fn_s2_4_1">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p2_5">124:2.5</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was the generally accepted leader of the <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> lads who stood for the higher ideals of their day and generation. He was really loved by his youthful associates, not only because he was fair, but also because he possessed a rare and understanding sympathy that betokened love and bordered on discreet compassion.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p2_6">124:2.6</a></small></sup>  This year he began to show a marked preference for the company of older persons. He delighted in talking over things cultural, educational, social, economic, political, and religious with older minds, and his depth of reasoning and keenness of observation so charmed his adult associates that they were always more than willing to visit with him. Until he became responsible for the support of the home, his parents were constantly seeking to influence him to associate with those of his own age, or more nearly his age, rather than with older and better-informed individuals for whom he evinced such a preference.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p2_7">124:2.7</a></small></sup>  Late this year he had a fishing experience of two months with his uncle on the <a href="/en/topic/Sea_of_Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a>, and he was very successful. Before attaining manhood, he had become an expert <a href="/en/topic/fishermen">fisherman</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p2_8">124:2.8</a></small></sup>  His physical development continued; he was an advanced and privileged pupil at school; he got along fairly well at home with his younger brothers and sisters, having the advantage of being three and one-half years older than the oldest of the other children. He was well thought of in <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> except by the parents of some of the duller children, who often spoke of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> as being too pert, as lacking in proper humility and youthful reserve. He manifested a growing tendency to direct the play activities of his youthful associates into more serious and thoughtful channels.

But both of his parents were extraordinarily wise and sagacious in all these matters.

<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p4_1">124:4.1</a></small></sup>  This was an eventful year in <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ life. He continued to make progress at school and was indefatigable in his study of nature, while increasingly he prosecuted his study of the methods whereby men make a living. He began doing regular work in the home carpenter shop and was permitted to manage his own earnings, a very unusual arrangement to obtain in a Jewish family. This year he also learned the wisdom of keeping such matters a secret in the family.

<p id="p6_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p6_4">124:6.4</a></small></sup>  As they rounded the base of Gilboa, the <a href="/en/topic/Havona_pilgrims">pilgrims</a> could see the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> city of <a href="/en/topic/Scythopolis">Scythopolis</a> on the right.

<p id="p6_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p6_5">124:6.5</a></small></sup>  The road now led immediately down into the tropical <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> valley, and soon <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was to have exposed to his wondering gaze the crooked and ever-winding Jordan with its glistening and rippling waters as it flowed down toward the <a href="/en/topic/Dead_Sea">Dead Sea</a>.

A little over three hours’ travel from opposite Scythopolis they came upon a bubbling spring, and here they camped for the night, out under the starlit heavens.</p>

Toward the end of the second day’s journey they camped near the base of the highest mountain overlooking the Jordan valley, <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Sartaba">Mount Sartaba</a>, whose summit was occupied by the Alexandrian fortress where <a href="/en/topic/Herod_Antipas">Herod</a> had imprisoned one of his wives and buried his two strangled sons.</p>
<p id="p6_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p6_7">124:6.7</a></small></sup>  The third day they passed by two villages which had been recently built by Herod and noted their <a href="/en/topic/superior_seraphim">superior</a> architecture and their beautiful palm gardens.

As they neared the top, they could look across the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> to the mountains beyond and south over the sluggish waters of the <a href="/en/topic/Dead_Sea">Dead Sea</a>. About halfway up to Jerusalem, Jesus gained his first view of the <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Olivet">Mount of Olives</a> (the region to be so much a part of his subsequent life), and Joseph pointed out to him that the <a href="/en/topic/Holy_City">Holy City</a> lay just beyond this ridge, and the lad’s heart beat fast with joyous anticipation of soon beholding the city and house of his heavenly Father.</p>
