<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p0_1">124:0.1</a></small></sup>  ALTHOUGH <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> might have enjoyed a better opportunity for schooling at <a href="/en/topic/Alexandria">Alexandria</a> than in <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>, he could not have had such a splendid environment for working out his own life problems with a minimum of educational guidance, at the same time enjoying the great advantage of constantly contacting with such a large number of all classes of men and women hailing from every part of the civilized world. Had he remained at Alexandria, his education would have been directed by <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> and along exclusively Jewish lines. At <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> he secured an education and received a training which more acceptably prepared him to understand the gentiles, and which gave him a better and more balanced idea of the relative merits of the Eastern, or <a href="/en/topic/Babylon">Babylonian</a>, and the Western, or Hellenic, views of <a href="/en/topic/Hebrew_language">Hebrew</a> theology.</p>

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_1">124:1.1</a></small></sup>  Though it could hardly be said that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was ever seriously ill, he did have some of the minor ailments of childhood this year, along with his brothers and baby sister.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_1_0"><a href="#fn_s1_1_0">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_2">124:1.2</a></small></sup>  School went on and he was still a favored pupil, having one week each month at liberty, and he continued to divide his time about equally between trips to neighboring cities with his father, sojourns on his uncle’s <a href="/en/topic/farm">farm</a> south of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, and fishing excursions out from <a href="/en/topic/Magdala">Magdala</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_3">124:1.3</a></small></sup>  The most serious trouble as yet to come up at school occurred in late winter when <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> dared to challenge the chazan regarding the teaching that all images, pictures, and drawings were idolatrous in nature. Jesus delighted in drawing landscapes as well as in modeling a great variety of objects in potter’s clay. Everything of that sort was strictly forbidden by Jewish law, but up to this time he had managed to disarm his parents’ objection to such an extent that they had permitted him to continue in these activities.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_4">124:1.4</a></small></sup>  But trouble was again stirred up at school when one of the more backward pupils discovered Jesus drawing a <a href="/en/topic/charcoal_picture">charcoal picture</a> of the teacher on the floor of the schoolroom. There it was, plain as day, and many of the elders had viewed it before the committee went to call on <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> to demand that something be done to suppress the lawlessness of his eldest son. And though this was not <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> time <a href="/en/topic/complaining">complaints</a> had come to <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_(Old_Testament)">Joseph</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> about the doings of their versatile and aggressive child, this was the most serious of all the accusations which had thus far been lodged against him. Jesus listened to the indictment of his artistic efforts for some time, being seated on a large stone just outside the back door. He resented their blaming his father for his alleged misdeeds; so in he marched, fearlessly confronting his accusers. The elders were thrown into confusion. Some were inclined to view the episode humorously, while one or two seemed to think the boy was sacrilegious if not blasphemous. <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_(father_of_Jesus)">Joseph</a> was nonplused, <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Clopas)">Mary</a> indignant, but Jesus insisted on being heard. He had his say, courageously defended his viewpoint, and with consummate self-control announced that he would abide by the decision of his father in this as in all other matters controversial. And the committee of elders departed in silence.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_4_1"><a href="#fn_a1_4_1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_4_12"><a href="#fn_a1_4_12">[2]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_4_0"><a href="#fn_s1_4_0">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_4_1"><a href="#fn_s1_4_1">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_5">124:1.5</a></small></sup>  Mary endeavored to influence Joseph to permit <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> to model in clay at home, provided he promised not to carry on any of these questionable activities at school, but Joseph felt impelled to rule that the rabbinical interpretation of the second commandment should prevail. And so Jesus no more drew or modeled the likeness of anything from that day as long as he lived in his father’s house. But he was unconvinced of the wrong of what he had done, and to give up such a favorite pastime constituted one of the great trials of his young life.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_5_41"><a href="#fn_a1_5_41">[3]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_5_0"><a href="#fn_s1_5_0">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_6">124:1.6</a></small></sup>  In the latter part of June, Jesus, in company with his father, first climbed to the summit of <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Tabor">Mount Tabor</a>. It was a clear day and the view was superb. It seemed to this nine-year-old lad that he had really gazed upon the entire world excepting <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Africa">Africa</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_7">124:1.7</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ second sister, <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(wife_of_Justus)">Martha</a>, was born <a href="/en/topic/Thursday">Thursday</a> night, September 13<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. Three weeks after the coming of <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(sister_of_Jesus)">Martha</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>, who was home for awhile, started the building of an addition to their house, a combined workshop and bedroom. A small workbench was built for Jesus, and for <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> time he possessed tools of his own. At odd times for many years he worked at this bench and became highly expert in the making of yokes.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_7_18"><a href="#fn_a1_7_18">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_7_28"><a href="#fn_a1_7_28">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_7_30"><a href="#fn_a1_7_30">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_8">124:1.8</a></small></sup>  This winter and the next were the coldest in <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> for many decades. Jesus had seen snow on the mountains, and several times it had fallen in Nazareth, remaining on the ground only a short time; but not until this winter had he seen <a href="/en/topic/ice">ice</a>. The fact that <a href="/en/topic/water">water</a> could be had as a solid, a liquid, and a vapor—he had long pondered over the escaping <a href="/en/topic/steam">steam</a> from the boiling pots—caused the lad to think a great deal about the physical world and its constitution; and yet the personality embodied in this growing youth was all this while the actual creator and organizer of all these things throughout a far-flung universe.</p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_9">124:1.9</a></small></sup>  The climate of Nazareth was not severe. January was the coldest month, the temperature averaging around 50° F. During July and August, the hottest months, the temperature would vary from 75° to 90° F. From the mountains to the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Dead_Sea">Dead Sea</a> valley the climate of <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a> ranged from the frigid to the torrid. And so, in a way, the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> were prepared to live in about any and all of the world’s varying climates.</p>
<p id="p1_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_10">124:1.10</a></small></sup>  Even during the warmest summer months a cool sea breeze usually blew from the west from 10:00 A.M. until about 10:00 P.M. But every now and then terrific hot winds from the eastern desert would blow across all Palestine. These hot blasts usually came in February and March, near the end of the rainy season. In those days the rain fell in refreshing showers from November to April, but it did not rain steadily. There were only two seasons in Palestine, summer and winter, the dry and rainy seasons. In January the flowers began to bloom, and by the end of April the whole land was one vast flower <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_11">124:1.11</a></small></sup>  In May of this year, on his uncle’s <a href="/en/topic/farm">farm</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> for <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> time helped with the harvest of the grain. Before he was thirteen, he had managed to find out something about practically everything that men and women worked at around <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> except metal working, and he spent several months in a smith’s shop when older, after the death of his father.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_11_0"><a href="#fn_s1_11_0">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_12">124:1.12</a></small></sup>  When work and caravan travel were slack, Jesus made many trips with his father on pleasure or business to near-by <a href="/en/topic/Cana">Cana</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Endor">Endor</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Nain">Nain</a>. Even as a lad he frequently visited <a href="/en/topic/Sepphoris">Sepphoris</a>, only a little over three miles from Nazareth to the northwest, and from 4 B.C. to about A.D. 25 the capital of <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> and one of the residences of <a href="/en/topic/Herod_Antipas">Herod Antipas</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_13">124:1.13</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> continued to grow physically, intellectually, socially, and spiritually. His trips away from home did much to give him a better and more generous understanding of his own family, and by this time even his parents were beginning to learn from him as well as to teach him. Jesus was an original thinker and a skillful teacher, even in his youth. He was in constant collision with the so-called “oral law,” but he always sought to adapt himself to the practices of his family. He got along fairly well with the children of his age, but he often grew discouraged with their slow-acting minds. Before he was ten years old, he had become the leader of a group of seven lads who formed themselves into a <a href="/en/topic/clubs">society</a> for promoting the acquirements of manhood—physical, intellectual, and religious. Among these boys Jesus succeeded in introducing many new games and various improved methods of physical <a href="/en/topic/recreation">recreation</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_13_15"><a href="#fn_a1_13_15">[7]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. THE TENTH YEAR (A.D. 4) </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p2_1">124:2.1</a></small></sup>  It was the fifth of July, <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> of the month, when <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, while strolling through the countryside with his father, first gave expression to feelings and ideas which indicated that he was becoming self-conscious of the unusual nature of his life mission. <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> listened attentively to the momentous words of his son but made few comments; he volunteered no information. The next day Jesus had a similar but longer talk with his mother. <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> likewise listened to the pronouncements of the lad, but neither did she volunteer any information. It was almost two years before Jesus again spoke to his parents concerning this increasing revelation within his own consciousness regarding the nature of his personality and the character of his mission on earth.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_1_10"><a href="#fn_a2_1_10">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_1_20"><a href="#fn_a2_1_20">[9]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_0"><a href="#fn_s2_1_0">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p2_2">124:2.2</a></small></sup>  He entered the advanced school of the synagogue in August. At school he was constantly creating trouble by the questions he persisted in asking. Increasingly he kept all <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> in more or less of a hubbub. His parents were loath to forbid his asking these disquieting questions, and his chief teacher was greatly intrigued by the lad’s curiosity, insight, and hunger for knowledge.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_2_0"><a href="#fn_s2_2_0">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p2_3">124:2.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ playmates saw nothing supernatural in his conduct; in most ways he was altogether like themselves. His interest in study was somewhat above the average but not wholly unusual. He did ask more questions at school than others in his class.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p2_4">124:2.4</a></small></sup>  Perhaps his most unusual and outstanding trait was his unwillingness to <a href="/en/topic/fighting">fight</a> for his rights. Since he was such a well-developed lad for his age, it seemed strange to his playfellows that he was disinclined to defend himself even from injustice or when subjected to personal abuse. As it happened, he did not suffer much on account of this trait because of the friendship of <a href="/en/topic/Jacob_of_Crete">Jacob</a>, a neighbor boy, who was one year older. He was the son of the <a href="/en/topic/Aaron_the_stone_mason">stone mason</a>, a business associate of <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>. <a href="/en/topic/Jacob_of_Emmaus">Jacob</a> was a great admirer of Jesus and made it his business to see that no one was permitted to impose upon Jesus because of his aversion to physical combat. Several times older and uncouth youths attacked Jesus, relying upon his reputed docility, but they always suffered swift and certain retribution at the hands of his self-appointed champion and ever-ready defender, <a href="/en/topic/Jacob_the_stone_mason_(son)">Jacob the stone mason</a>’s son.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_4_18"><a href="#fn_a2_4_18">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_4_22"><a href="#fn_a2_4_22">[10]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_4_0"><a href="#fn_s2_4_0">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_4_1"><a href="#fn_s2_4_1">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p2_5">124:2.5</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was the generally accepted leader of the <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> lads who stood for the higher ideals of their day and generation. He was really loved by his youthful associates, not only because he was fair, but also because he possessed a rare and understanding sympathy that betokened love and bordered on discreet compassion.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p2_6">124:2.6</a></small></sup>  This year he began to show a marked preference for the company of older persons. He delighted in talking over things cultural, educational, social, economic, political, and religious with older minds, and his depth of reasoning and keenness of observation so charmed his adult associates that they were always more than willing to visit with him. Until he became responsible for the support of the home, his parents were constantly seeking to influence him to associate with those of his own age, or more nearly his age, rather than with older and better-informed individuals for whom he evinced such a preference.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p2_7">124:2.7</a></small></sup>  Late this year he had a fishing experience of two months with his uncle on the <a href="/en/topic/Sea_of_Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a>, and he was very successful. Before attaining manhood, he had become an expert <a href="/en/topic/fishermen">fisherman</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p2_8">124:2.8</a></small></sup>  His physical development continued; he was an advanced and privileged pupil at school; he got along fairly well at home with his younger brothers and sisters, having the advantage of being three and one-half years older than the oldest of the other children. He was well thought of in <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> except by the parents of some of the duller children, who often spoke of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> as being too pert, as lacking in proper humility and youthful reserve. He manifested a growing tendency to direct the play activities of his youthful associates into more serious and thoughtful channels. He was a born teacher and simply could not refrain from so functioning, even when supposedly engaged in play.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_8_0"><a href="#fn_s2_8_0">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p3_2">124:3.2</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> were often tempted to show some special <a href="/en/topic/favoritism">favoritism</a> for <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> or otherwise to betray their knowledge that he was a child of promise, a son of destiny. But both of his parents were extraordinarily wise and sagacious in all these matters. The few times they did in any manner exhibit any preference for him, even in the slightest degree, the lad was quick to refuse all such special consideration.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p3_3">124:3.3</a></small></sup>  Jesus spent considerable time at the <a href="/en/topic/caravans">caravan</a> supply shop, and by conversing with the travelers from all parts of the world, he acquired a store of information about international affairs that was amazing, considering his age. This was <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> year in which he enjoyed much free play and youthful joyousness.

<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p4_1">124:4.1</a></small></sup>  This was an eventful year in <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ life. He continued to make progress at school and was indefatigable in his study of nature, while increasingly he prosecuted his study of the methods whereby men make a living. He began doing regular work in the home carpenter shop and was permitted to manage his own earnings, a very unusual arrangement to obtain in a Jewish family. This year he also learned the wisdom of keeping such matters a secret in the family.

He pondered much over his parents’ differing opinions, often hearing their discussions when they thought he was sound asleep. More and more he inclined to the view of his father, so that his mother was destined to be hurt by the realization that her son was gradually rejecting her guidance in matters having to do with his life career. And, as the years passed, this breach of understanding widened.

In passing by Jezreel, Jesus’ parents recounted the doings of <a href="/en/topic/Ahab">Ahab</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Jezebel">Jezebel</a> and the exploits of <a href="/en/topic/Jehu">Jehu</a>. In passing around <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Gilboa">Mount Gilboa</a>, they talked much about <a href="/en/topic/Saul_(king)">Saul</a>, who took his life on the slopes of this mountain, King <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a>, and the associations of this historic spot.</p>
<p id="p6_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p6_4">124:6.4</a></small></sup>  As they rounded the base of Gilboa, the <a href="/en/topic/Havona_pilgrims">pilgrims</a> could see the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> city of <a href="/en/topic/Scythopolis">Scythopolis</a> on the right. They gazed upon the marble structures from a distance but went not near the gentile city lest they so defile themselves that they could not participate in the forthcoming solemn and sacred ceremonies of the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> could not understand why neither <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> nor Jesus would speak of Scythopolis. She did not know about their controversy of the previous year as they had never revealed this episode to her.</p>
<p id="p6_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p6_5">124:6.5</a></small></sup>  The road now led immediately down into the tropical <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> valley, and soon <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was to have exposed to his wondering gaze the crooked and ever-winding Jordan with its glistening and rippling waters as it flowed down toward the <a href="/en/topic/Dead_Sea">Dead Sea</a>. They laid aside their outer garments as they journeyed south in this tropical valley, enjoying the luxurious fields of grain and the beautiful oleanders laden with their pink blossoms, while massive snow-capped <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Hermon">Mount Hermon</a> stood far to the north, in majesty looking down on the historic valley. A little over three hours’ travel from opposite Scythopolis they came upon a bubbling spring, and here they camped for the night, out under the starlit heavens.</p>
<p id="p6_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p6_6">124:6.6</a></small></sup>  On their second day’s journey they passed by where the <a href="/en/topic/Jabbok">Jabbok</a>, from the east, flows into the Jordan, and looking east up this river valley, they recounted the days of <a href="/en/topic/Gideon">Gideon</a>, when the <a href="/en/topic/Midianites">Midianites</a> poured into this region to overrun the land. Toward the end of the second day’s journey they camped near the base of the highest mountain overlooking the Jordan valley, <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Sartaba">Mount Sartaba</a>, whose summit was occupied by the Alexandrian fortress where <a href="/en/topic/Herod_Antipas">Herod</a> had imprisoned one of his wives and buried his two strangled sons.</p>
<p id="p6_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p6_7">124:6.7</a></small></sup>  The third day they passed by two villages which had been recently built by Herod and noted their <a href="/en/topic/superior_seraphim">superior</a> architecture and their beautiful palm gardens. By nightfall they reached <a href="/en/topic/Jericho">Jericho</a>, where they remained until the morrow. That evening <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> walked a mile and a half to the site of the ancient Jericho, where <a href="/en/topic/Joshua_(Jesus)">Joshua</a>, for whom Jesus was named, had performed his renowned exploits, according to Jewish tradition.</p>
<p id="p6_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p6_8">124:6.8</a></small></sup>  By the fourth and last day’s journey the road was a continuous procession of <a href="/en/topic/Havona_pilgrims">pilgrims</a>. They now began to climb the hills leading up to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. As they neared the top, they could look across the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> to the mountains beyond and south over the sluggish waters of the <a href="/en/topic/Dead_Sea">Dead Sea</a>. About halfway up to Jerusalem, Jesus gained his first view of the <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Olivet">Mount of Olives</a> (the region to be so much a part of his subsequent life), and Joseph pointed out to him that the <a href="/en/topic/Holy_City">Holy City</a> lay just beyond this ridge, and the lad’s heart beat fast with joyous anticipation of soon beholding the city and house of his heavenly Father.</p>
<p id="p6_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p6_9">124:6.9</a></small></sup>  On the eastern slopes of <a href="/en/topic/Olivet">Olivet</a> they paused for rest in the borders of a little village called <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a>. The hospitable villagers poured forth to minister to the pilgrims, and it happened that <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> and his family had stopped near the house of one <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a>, who had three children about the same age as <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>—<a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(wife_of_Justus)">Martha</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a>. They invited the <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> family in for refreshment, and a lifelong friendship sprang up between the two families. Many times afterward, in his eventful life, Jesus stopped in this home.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a6_9_4"><a href="#fn_a6_9_4">[36]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a6_9_27"><a href="#fn_a6_9_27">[37]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s6_9_0"><a href="#fn_s6_9_0">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s6_9_1"><a href="#fn_s6_9_1">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p6_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p6_10">124:6.10</a></small></sup>  They pressed on, soon standing on the brink of Olivet, and Jesus saw for <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> time (in his memory) the <a href="/en/topic/Holy_City">Holy City</a>, the pretentious palaces, and the inspiring <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a> of his Father. At no time in his life did Jesus ever experience such a purely human thrill as that which at this time so completely enthralled him as he stood there on this April afternoon on the <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Olivet">Mount of Olives</a>, drinking in his first view of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. And in after years, on this same spot he stood and wept over the city which was about to reject another prophet, the last and the greatest of her heavenly teachers.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a6_10_5"><a href="#fn_a6_10_5">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p6_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p6_11">124:6.11</a></small></sup>  But they hurried on to Jerusalem. It was now <a href="/en/topic/Thursday">Thursday</a> afternoon. On reaching the city, they journeyed past the temple, and never had <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> beheld such throngs of human beings. He meditated deeply on how these <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> had assembled here from the uttermost parts of the known world.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a6_11_35"><a href="#fn_a6_11_35">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p6_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p6_12">124:6.12</a></small></sup>  Soon they reached the place prearranged for their accommodation during the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> week, the large home of a well-to-do relative of <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a>’s, one who knew something of the early history of both <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a> and Jesus, through <a href="/en/topic/Zacharias">Zacharias</a>. The following day, the day of preparation, they made ready for the appropriate celebration of the Passover <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a>.</p>
<p id="p6_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p6_13">124:6.13</a></small></sup>  While all <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> was astir in preparation for the Passover, <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> found time to take his son around to visit the academy where it had been arranged for him to resume his education two years later, as soon as he reached the required age of fifteen. <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_(Old_Testament)">Joseph</a> was truly puzzled when he observed how little interest <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> evinced in all these carefully laid plans.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s6_13_0"><a href="#fn_s6_13_0">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p6_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p6_14">124:6.14</a></small></sup>  Jesus was profoundly impressed by the <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a> and all the associated services and other activities. For <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> time since he was four years old, he was too much preoccupied with his own meditations to ask many questions. He did, however, ask his father several embarrassing questions (as he had on previous occasions) as to why the heavenly Father required the slaughter of so many innocent and helpless <a href="/en/topic/animals">animals</a>. And his father well knew from the expression on the lad’s face that his answers and attempts at explanation were unsatisfactory to his deep-thinking and keen-reasoning son.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a6_14_5"><a href="#fn_a6_14_5">[38]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s6_14_0"><a href="#fn_s6_14_0">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s6_14_1"><a href="#fn_s6_14_1">[2]</a></sup></p>

This was one of the most extraordinary days that the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_God">Son of God</a> spent in the flesh; and during the night, for the first time in his earth career, there appeared to him an assigned messenger from <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a>, commissioned by <a href="/en/topic/Immanuel">Immanuel</a>, who said: “The hour has come.

Neither do we nowadays understand how the spirit of this same <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> and the spirit of his <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Father are associated with the souls of mankind. With the passing of time, we could see that his human mind was increasingly discerning that, while he lived his life in the flesh, in spirit on his shoulders rested the responsibility of a universe.</p>
