To live such identical lives as he imposes upon the intelligent beings of his own creation, thus to bestow himself in the likeness of his various orders of created beings, is a part of the price which every Creator Son must pay for the full and supreme <a href="/en/topic/sovereignty">sovereignty</a> of his self-made universe of things and beings<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_1_9"><a href="#fn_a0_1_9">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_1_53"><a href="#fn_a0_1_53">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_1_56"><a href="#fn_a0_1_56">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_1_64"><a href="#fn_a0_1_64">[4]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_1_2"><a href="#fn_s0_1_2">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s0_1_3"><a href="#fn_s0_1_3">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s0_1_4"><a href="#fn_s0_1_4">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s0_1_5"><a href="#fn_s0_1_5">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p0_2">120:0.2</a></small></sup>  Before the events I am about to delineate, Michael of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> had bestowed himself six times after the similitude of six differing orders of his diverse creation of intelligent beings. Then he prepared to descend upon Urantia in the likeness of mortal flesh, the lowest order of his intelligent will creatures, and, as such a human of the material realm, to execute the final act in the drama of the acquirement of universe sovereignty in accordance with the mandates of the divine <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Rulers of the universe of universes.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_2_6"><a href="#fn_s0_2_6">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p0_3">120:0.3</a></small></sup>  In the course of each of these preceding bestowals <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a> not only acquired the finite experience of one group of his created beings, but he also acquired an essential experience in Paradise co-operation which would, in and of itself, further contribute to constituting him the sovereign of his self-made universe. At any moment throughout all past local universe time, <a href="/en/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a> could have asserted personal sovereignty as a <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> and as a Creator Son could have ruled his universe after the manner of his own choosing. In such an event, <a href="/en/topic/Immanuel">Immanuel</a> and the associated Paradise Sons would have taken leave of the universe. But Michael did not wish to rule Nebadon merely in his own isolated right, as a Creator Son. He desired to ascend through actual experience in co-operative subordination to the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Trinity">Paradise Trinity</a> to that high place in universe status where he would become qualified to rule his universe and administer its affairs with that perfection of insight and wisdom of execution which will sometime be characteristic of the exalted rule of the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme">Supreme</a> Being. He aspired not to perfection of rule as a Creator Son but to supremacy of administration as the embodiment of the universe wisdom and the divine experience of the Supreme Being.</p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p0_4">120:0.4</a></small></sup>  Michael, therefore, had a double purpose in the making of these seven bestowals upon the various orders of his universe creatures: First, he was completing the required experience in creature understanding which is demanded of all Creator Sons before they assume complete <a href="/en/topic/sovereignty">sovereignty</a>. At any time a Creator Son may rule his universe in his own right, but he can rule as the supreme representative of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Trinity only after passing through the seven universe-creature bestowals. Second, he was aspiring to the privilege of representing the maximum authority of the Paradise Trinity which can be exercised in the direct and personal administration of a local universe. Accordingly, did Michael, during the experience of each of his universe bestowals, successfully and acceptably voluntarily subordinate himself to the variously constituted wills of the diverse associations of the persons of the Paradise Trinity. That is, on <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> bestowal he was subject to the combined will of the Father, Son, and Spirit; on the second bestowal to the will of the Father and the Son; on the third bestowal to the will of the Father and the Spirit; on the fourth bestowal to the will of the Son and the Spirit; on the fifth bestowal to the will of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>; on the sixth bestowal to the will of the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a>; and during the seventh and final bestowal, on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>, to the will of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_4_9"><a href="#fn_a0_4_9">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_4_56"><a href="#fn_a0_4_56">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_4_1"><a href="#fn_a0_4_1">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_4_10"><a href="#fn_a0_4_10">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_4_11"><a href="#fn_a0_4_11">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_4_43"><a href="#fn_a0_4_43">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_4_46"><a href="#fn_a0_4_46">[9]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_4_4"><a href="#fn_s0_4_4">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s0_4_6"><a href="#fn_s0_4_6">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p0_5">120:0.5</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a>, therefore, combines in his personal sovereignty the divine will of the sevenfold phases of the universal Creators with the understanding experience of his local universe creatures. Thus has his administration become representative of the greatest possible power and authority although divested of all arbitrary assumptions. His power is unlimited since it is derived from experienced association with the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Deities">Paradise Deities</a>; his authority is unquestioned inasmuch as it was acquired through actual experience in the likeness of universe creatures; his sovereignty is supreme since it embodies at one and the same time the sevenfold viewpoint of Paradise <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> with the creature viewpoint of time and space<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_5_6"><a href="#fn_s0_5_6">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p0_6">120:0.6</a></small></sup>  Having determined the time of his final bestowal and having selected the planet whereon this extraordinary event would take place, Michael held the usual prebestowal conference with <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a> and then presented himself before his elder brother and <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> counselor, <a href="/en/topic/Immanuel">Immanuel</a>. All powers of universe administration which had not previously been conferred upon Gabriel, Michael now assigned to the custody of Immanuel. And just before Michael’s departure for the <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> incarnation, Immanuel, in accepting the custody of the universe during the time of the Urantia bestowal, proceeded to impart the bestowal counsel which would serve as the incarnation guide for Michael when he would presently grow up on Urantia as a mortal of the realm.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_6_8"><a href="#fn_a0_6_8">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_6_47"><a href="#fn_a0_6_47">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p0_7">120:0.7</a></small></sup>  In this connection it should be borne in mind that <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a> had elected to execute this bestowal in the likeness of mortal flesh, subject to the will of the Paradise Father. The <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> required instructions from no one in order to effect this incarnation for the sole purpose of achieving universe sovereignty, but he had embarked upon a program of the revelation of the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme">Supreme</a> which involved co-operative functioning with the diverse wills of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Deities">Paradise Deities</a>. Thus his sovereignty, when finally and personally acquired, would actually be all-inclusive of the sevenfold will of <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> as it culminates in the Supreme. He had, therefore, six times previously been instructed by the personal representatives of the various Paradise Deities and associations thereof; and now he was instructed by the Union of Days, ambassador of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Trinity">Paradise Trinity</a> to the local universe of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>, acting on behalf of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_7_62"><a href="#fn_a0_7_62">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_7_63"><a href="#fn_a0_7_63">[13]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_7_6"><a href="#fn_s0_7_6">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p0_8">120:0.8</a></small></sup>  There were immediate advantages and tremendous compensations resultant from the willingness of this mighty Creator Son once more voluntarily to subordinate himself to the will of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Deities, this time to that of the Universal Father. By this decision to effect such associative subordination, Michael would experience in this incarnation, not only the nature of mortal man, but also the will of the Paradise Father of all. And further, he could enter upon this unique bestowal with the complete assurance, not only that <a href="/en/topic/Immanuel">Immanuel</a> would exercise the full authority of the Paradise Father in the administration of his universe during his absence on the <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> bestowal, but also with the comforting knowledge that the <a href="/en/topic/Ancients_of_Days">Ancients of Days</a> of the superuniverse had decreed the safety of his realm throughout the entire bestowal period.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_8_47"><a href="#fn_a0_8_47">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_8_30"><a href="#fn_a0_8_30">[14]</a></sup></p>
