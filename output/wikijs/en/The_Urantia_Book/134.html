He had fully considered and now finally approved the plan which provided that he be born of Jewish parents in <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a>, and he therefore deliberately returned to <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> to await the beginning of his lifework as a public teacher of truth; he began to lay plans for a public career in the land of his father <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>’s people, and he did this of his own free will.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_1_11"><a href="#fn_a0_1_11">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_1_26"><a href="#fn_a0_1_26">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p0_2">134:0.2</a></small></sup>  Jesus had found out through personal and human experience that Palestine was the best place in all the Roman world wherein to set forth the closing chapters, and to enact the final scenes, of his life on earth. For <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> time he became fully satisfied with the program of openly manifesting his true nature and of revealing his divine identity among the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> and gentiles of his native Palestine. He definitely decided to finish his life on earth and to complete his career of mortal existence in the same land in which he entered the human experience as a helpless babe. His <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> career began among the <a href="/en/topic/Jews_(ancient_Hebrews)">Jews</a> in Palestine, and he chose to terminate his life in Palestine and among the Jews.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. THE THIRTIETH YEAR (A.D. 24) </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p1_1">134:1.1</a></small></sup>  After taking leave of <a href="/en/topic/Gonod">Gonod</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Ganid">Ganid</a> at <a href="/en/topic/Charax">Charax</a> (in December of A.D. 23), <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> returned by way of <a href="/en/topic/Ur">Ur</a> to <a href="/en/topic/Babylon">Babylon</a>, where he joined a desert caravan that was on its way to <a href="/en/topic/Damascus">Damascus</a>. From Damascus he went to <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, stopping only a few hours at <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, where he paused to call on <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a>’s family. There he met his brother <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>, who had sometime previously come over to work in his place in Zebedee’s boatshop. After talking with James and <a href="/en/topic/Jude">Jude</a> (who also chanced to be in Capernaum) and after turning over to his brother James the little house which <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John Zebedee</a> had managed to buy, Jesus went on to Nazareth.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p1_2">134:1.2</a></small></sup>  At the end of his <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_region">Mediterranean</a> journey Jesus had received sufficient money to meet his living expenses almost up to the time of the beginning of his public ministry. But aside from Zebedee of Capernaum and the people whom he met on this extraordinary trip, the world never knew that he made this journey. His family always believed that he spent this time in study at <a href="/en/topic/Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. Jesus never confirmed these beliefs, neither did he make open denial of such misunderstandings.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p1_3">134:1.3</a></small></sup>  During his stay of a few weeks at <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> visited with his family and friends, spent some time at the repair shop with his brother <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>, but devoted most of his attention to <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Ruth_(Old_Testament)">Ruth</a>. <a href="/en/topic/Ruth_(sister_of_Jesus)">Ruth</a> was then nearly fifteen years old, and this was Jesus’ first opportunity to have long talks with her since she had become a young woman.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p1_4">134:1.4</a></small></sup>  Both <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Jude">Jude</a> had for some time wanted to get married, but they had disliked to do this without Jesus’ consent; accordingly they had postponed these events, hoping for their eldest brother’s return. Though they all regarded <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> as the head of the family in most matters, when it came to getting married, they wanted the blessing of Jesus. So <a href="/en/topic/Simon_of_Cyrene">Simon</a> and Jude were married at a double wedding in early March of this year, A.D. 24. All the older children were now married; only Ruth, the youngest, remained at home with Mary.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p1_5">134:1.5</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> visited with the individual members of his family quite normally and naturally, but when they were all together, he had so little to say that they remarked about it among themselves. <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> especially was disconcerted by this unusually peculiar behavior of her first-born son.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p1_6">134:1.6</a></small></sup>  About the time Jesus was preparing to leave <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, the conductor of a large caravan which was passing through the city was taken violently ill, and Jesus, being a linguist, volunteered to take his place. Since this trip would necessitate his absence for a year, and inasmuch as all his brothers were married and his mother was living at home with <a href="/en/topic/Ruth_(Old_Testament)">Ruth</a>, Jesus called a family conference at which he proposed that his mother and <a href="/en/topic/Ruth_(sister_of_Jesus)">Ruth</a> go to <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> to live in the home which he had so recently given to <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>. Accordingly, a few days after Jesus left with the caravan, Mary and <a href="/en/topic/Ruth_(daughter_of_Matthew)">Ruth</a> moved to Capernaum, where they lived for the rest of Mary’s life in the home that Jesus had provided. <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> and his family moved into the old Nazareth home.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p1_7">134:1.7</a></small></sup>  This was one of the more unusual years in the inner experience of the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>; great progress was made in effecting working harmony between his human mind and the indwelling Adjuster. The Adjuster had been actively engaged in reorganizing the thinking and in rehearsing the mind for the great events which were in the not then distant future. The personality of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was preparing for his great change in attitude toward the world. These were the in-between times, the transition stage of that being who began life as <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> appearing as man, and who was now making ready to complete his earth career as man appearing as God.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_7_4"><a href="#fn_a1_7_4">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_7_47"><a href="#fn_a1_7_47">[4]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_7_7"><a href="#fn_s1_7_7">[1]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. THE CARAVAN TRIP TO THE CASPIAN </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p2_1">134:2.1</a></small></sup>  It was <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> of April, A.D. 24, when <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> left <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> on the caravan trip to the <a href="/en/topic/Caspian_Sea">Caspian Sea</a> region. The caravan which Jesus joined as its conductor was going from <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> by way of <a href="/en/topic/Damascus">Damascus</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Lake_Urmia">Lake Urmia</a> through <a href="/en/topic/Assyria">Assyria</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Media">Media</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Parthia">Parthia</a> to the southeastern Caspian Sea region. It was a full year before he returned from this journey.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p2_2">134:2.2</a></small></sup>  For Jesus this caravan trip was another adventure of exploration and personal ministry. He had an interesting experience with his caravan family—passengers, <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple_guards">guards</a>, and camel drivers. Scores of men, women, and children residing along the route followed by the caravan lived richer lives as a result of their contact with Jesus, to them, the extraordinary conductor of a commonplace caravan. Not all who enjoyed these occasions of his personal ministry profited thereby, but the vast majority of those who met and talked with him were made better for the remainder of their natural lives.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p2_3">134:2.3</a></small></sup>  Of all his world travels this <a href="/en/topic/Caspian_Sea">Caspian Sea</a> trip carried <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> nearest to the Orient and enabled him to gain a better understanding of the Far-Eastern peoples. He made intimate and personal contact with every one of the surviving <a href="/en/topic/races">races</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> excepting the red. He equally enjoyed his personal ministry to each of these varied races and blended peoples, and all of them were receptive to the living truth which he brought them. The Europeans from the Far West and the Asiatics from the Far East alike gave attention to his words of hope and eternal life and were equally influenced by the life of loving service and spiritual ministry which he so graciously lived among them.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_3_48"><a href="#fn_a2_3_48">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p2_4">134:2.4</a></small></sup>  The caravan trip was successful in every way. This was a most interesting episode in the human life of Jesus, for he functioned during this year in an executive capacity, being responsible for the material intrusted to his charge and for the safe conduct of the travelers making up the caravan party. And he most faithfully, efficiently, and wisely discharged his multiple duties.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p2_5">134:2.5</a></small></sup>  On the return from the Caspian region, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> gave up the direction of the caravan at <a href="/en/topic/Lake_Urmia">Lake Urmia</a>, where he tarried for slightly over two weeks. He returned as a passenger with a later caravan to <a href="/en/topic/Damascus">Damascus</a>, where the owners of the camels besought him to remain in their service. Declining this offer, he journeyed on with the caravan train to <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, arriving <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> of April, A.D. 25. No longer did he regard <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> as his home. Capernaum had become the home of Jesus, <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Ruth_(Old_Testament)">Ruth</a>. But Jesus never again lived with his family; when in Capernaum he made his home with the Zebedees.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_5_9"><a href="#fn_a2_5_9">[6]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. THE URMIA LECTURES </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p3_1">134:3.1</a></small></sup>  On the way to the <a href="/en/topic/Caspian_Sea">Caspian Sea</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had stopped several days for rest and recuperation at the old Persian city of <a href="/en/topic/Urmia">Urmia</a> on the western shores of <a href="/en/topic/Lake_Urmia">Lake Urmia</a>. On the largest of a group of islands situated a short distance offshore near Urmia was located a large building—a lecture <a href="/en/topic/amphitheater">amphitheater</a>—dedicated to the “spirit of religion.” This structure was really a <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> of the philosophy of religions.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_1_13"><a href="#fn_a3_1_13">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p3_2">134:3.2</a></small></sup>  This temple of religion had been built by a wealthy merchant citizen of Urmia and his three sons. This man was <a href="/en/topic/Cymboyton">Cymboyton</a>, and he numbered among his ancestors many diverse peoples.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p3_3">134:3.3</a></small></sup>  The lectures and discussions in this school of religion began at ten o’clock every morning in the week. The afternoon sessions started at three o’clock, and the evening debates opened at eight o’clock. Cymboyton or one of his three sons always presided at these sessions of teaching, discussion, and debate. The founder of this unique school of religions lived and died without ever revealing his personal religious beliefs.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p3_4">134:3.4</a></small></sup>  On several occasions <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> participated in these discussions, and before he left <a href="/en/topic/Urmia">Urmia</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Cymboyton">Cymboyton</a> arranged with Jesus to sojourn with them for two weeks on his return trip and give twenty-four lectures on “The Brotherhood of Men,” and to conduct twelve evening sessions of questions, discussions, and debates on his lectures in particular and on the brotherhood of men in general.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p3_5">134:3.5</a></small></sup>  In accordance with this arrangement, Jesus stopped off on the return trip and delivered these lectures. This was the most systematic and formal of all the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s teaching on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. Never before or after did he say so much on one subject as was contained in these lectures and discussions on the brotherhood of men. In reality these lectures were on the “Kingdom of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>” and the “Kingdoms of Men.”</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p3_6">134:3.6</a></small></sup>  More than thirty religions and religious cults were represented on the faculty of this <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> of religious philosophy. These teachers were chosen, supported, and fully accredited by their respective religious groups. At this time there were about seventy-five teachers on the faculty, and they lived in cottages each accommodating about a dozen persons. Every new moon these groups were changed by the casting of lots. Intolerance, a contentious spirit, or any other disposition to interfere with the smooth running of the community would bring about the prompt and summary dismissal of the offending teacher. He would be unceremoniously dismissed, and his alternate in waiting would be immediately installed in his place.</p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p3_7">134:3.7</a></small></sup>  These teachers of the various religions made a great effort to show how similar their religions were in regard to the fundamental things of this life and the next. There was but one doctrine which had to be accepted in order to gain a seat on this faculty—every teacher must represent a religion which recognized <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>—some sort of supreme <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>. There were five independent teachers on the faculty who did not represent any organized religion, and it was as such an independent teacher that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> appeared before them.</p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p3_8">134:3.8</a></small></sup>  [When we, the <a href="/en/topic/midwayers">midwayers</a>, first prepared the summary of Jesus’ teachings at <a href="/en/topic/Urmia">Urmia</a>, there arose a disagreement between the <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> of the churches and the seraphim of progress as to the wisdom of including these teachings in the <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> Revelation. Conditions of the twentieth century, prevailing in both religion and human governments, are so different from those prevailing in Jesus’ day that it was indeed difficult to adapt the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s teachings at Urmia to the problems of the kingdom of God and the kingdoms of men as these world functions are existent in the twentieth century. We were never able to formulate a statement of the Master’s teachings which was acceptable to both groups of these seraphim of planetary government. Finally, the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> chairman of the revelatory commission appointed a commission of three of our number to prepare our view of the Master’s Urmia teachings as adapted to twentieth-century religious and political conditions on Urantia. Accordingly, we three secondary midwayers completed such an adaptation of Jesus’ teachings, restating his pronouncements as we would apply them to present-day world conditions, and we now present these statements as they stand after having been edited by the Melchizedek chairman of the revelatory commission.]<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_8_11"><a href="#fn_a3_8_11">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_8_21"><a href="#fn_a3_8_21">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_8_39"><a href="#fn_a3_8_39">[10]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_8_2"><a href="#fn_s3_8_2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s3_8_10"><a href="#fn_s3_8_10">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p9_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p9_3">134:9.3</a></small></sup>  Both of them were present at the solemn services of the day of atonement. John was much impressed by the ceremonies of this day of all days in the Jewish religious ritual, but <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> remained a thoughtful and silent spectator. To the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> this performance was pitiful and pathetic. He viewed it all as misrepresentative of the character and attributes of his Father in heaven. He looked upon the doings of this day as a travesty upon the facts of divine justice and the truths of infinite mercy. He burned to give vent to the declaration of the real truth about his Father’s loving character and merciful conduct in the universe, but his faithful Monitor admonished him that his hour had not yet come. But that night, at Bethany, Jesus did drop numerous remarks which greatly disturbed John; and John never fully understood the real significance of what Jesus said in their hearing that evening.</p>
<p id="p9_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p9_4">134:9.4</a></small></sup>  Jesus planned to remain throughout the week of the feast of tabernacles with John. This feast was the annual holiday of all <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a>; it was the Jewish vacation time. Although Jesus did not participate in the merriment of the occasion, it was evident that he derived pleasure and experienced satisfaction as he beheld the lighthearted and joyous abandon of the young and the old.</p>
<p id="p9_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p9_5">134:9.5</a></small></sup>  In the midst of the week of celebration and ere the festivities were finished, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> took leave of John, saying that he desired to retire to the hills where he might the better commune with his <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Father. John would have gone with him, but Jesus insisted that he stay through the festivities, saying: “It is not required of you to bear the burden of the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>; only the watchman must keep vigil while the city sleeps in peace.” Jesus did not return to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. After almost a week alone in the hills near <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a>, he departed for <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>. On the way home he spent a day and a night alone on the slopes of <a href="/en/topic/Gilboa">Gilboa</a>, near where King <a href="/en/topic/Saul_(king)">Saul</a> had taken his life; and when he arrived at Capernaum, he seemed more cheerful than when he had left John in Jerusalem<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b14"><a href="#fn_b14">[14]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p9_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p9_6">134:9.6</a></small></sup>  The next morning Jesus went to the chest containing his personal effects, which had remained in <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a>’s workshop, put on his apron, and presented himself for work, saying, “It behooves me to keep busy while I wait for my hour to come.” And he worked several months, until January of the following year, in the boatshop, by the side of his brother <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>. After this period of working with Jesus, no matter what doubts came up to becloud James’s understanding of the lifework of the Son of Man, he never again really and wholly gave up his faith in the mission of Jesus.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a9_6_45"><a href="#fn_a9_6_45">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p9_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p9_7">134:9.7</a></small></sup>  During this final period of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ work at the boatshop, he spent most of his time on the interior finishing of some of the larger craft. He took great pains with all his handiwork and seemed to experience the satisfaction of human achievement when he had completed a commendable piece of work. Though he wasted little time upon trifles, he was a painstaking workman when it came to the essentials of any given undertaking.</p>
<p id="p9_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p9_8">134:9.8</a></small></sup>  As time passed, rumors came to <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> of one John who was preaching while baptizing penitents in the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a>, and John preached: “The kingdom of heaven is at hand; repent and be baptized<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b15"><a href="#fn_b15">[15]</a></sup>.” Jesus listened to these reports as John slowly worked his way up the Jordan valley from the ford of the river nearest to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b16"><a href="#fn_b16">[16]</a></sup>. But Jesus worked on, making boats, until John had journeyed up the river to a point near <a href="/en/topic/Pella">Pella</a> in the month of January of the next year, A.D. 26, when he laid down his tools, declaring, “My hour has come,” and presently presented himself to John for baptism.</p>
<p id="p9_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p9_9">134:9.9</a></small></sup>  But a great change had been coming over <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. Few of the people who had enjoyed his visits and ministrations as he had gone up and down in the land ever subsequently recognized in the public teacher the same person they had known and loved as a private individual in former years. And there was a reason for this failure of his early beneficiaries to recognize him in his later role of public and authoritative teacher. For long years this transformation of mind and spirit had been in progress, and it was finished during the eventful sojourn on <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Hermon">Mount Hermon</a>.</p>
