On this evening the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> believers had made their first attempt to get together since the resurrection. Assembled here at this time were the eleven apostles, the women’s corps and their associates, and about fifty other leading disciples of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, including a number of the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a>. This company of believers had been visiting informally for more than half an hour when, suddenly, the morontia Master appeared in full view and immediately began to instruct them.

Why, then, did you allow yourselves to become so disconcerted by all this when it came to pass? and why were you so surprised when I rose from the tomb on the third day?

<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 4. CAUSES OF JUDAS’S DOWNFALL </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p4_1">193:4.1</a></small></sup>  It was in <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> part of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s farewell message to his apostles that he alluded to the loss of Judas and held up the tragic fate of their traitorous fellow worker as a solemn warning against the dangers of social and fraternal <a href="/en/topic/isolation">isolation</a>. It may be helpful to believers, in this and in future ages, briefly to review the causes of Judas’s downfall in the light of the Master’s remarks and in view of the accumulated enlightenment of succeeding centuries.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_1_6"><a href="#fn_s4_1_6">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p4_2">193:4.2</a></small></sup>  As we look back upon this tragedy, we conceive that Judas went wrong, primarily, because he was very markedly an isolated personality, a personality shut in and away from ordinary social contacts. He persistently refused to confide in, or freely fraternize with, his fellow apostles. But his being an isolated type of personality would not, in and of itself, have wrought such mischief for Judas had it not been that he also failed to increase in love and grow in spiritual grace. And then, as if to make a bad matter worse, he persistently harbored grudges and fostered such psychologic enemies as <a href="/en/topic/revenge">revenge</a> and the generalized craving to “get even” with somebody for all his disappointments.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_2_23"><a href="#fn_a4_2_23">[63]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p4_3">193:4.3</a></small></sup>  This unfortunate combination of individual peculiarities and mental tendencies conspired to destroy a well-intentioned man who failed to subdue these evils by love, faith, and trust. That Judas need not have gone wrong is well proved by the cases of Thomas and <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a>, both of whom were cursed with this same sort of suspicion and overdevelopment of the individualistic tendency. Even <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> and Matthew had many leanings in this direction; but all these men grew to love <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and their fellow apostles more, and not less, as time passed. They grew in grace and in a knowledge of the truth<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b50"><a href="#fn_b50">[50]</a></sup>. They became increasingly more trustful of their brethren and slowly developed the ability to confide in their fellows. Judas persistently refused to confide in his brethren. When he was impelled, by the accumulation of his emotional conflicts, to seek relief in self-expression, he invariably sought the advice and received the unwise consolation of his unspiritual relatives or those chance acquaintances who were either indifferent, or actually hostile, to the welfare and progress of the spiritual realities of the heavenly kingdom, of which he was one of the twelve consecrated ambassadors on earth.</p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p4_4">193:4.4</a></small></sup>  Judas met defeat in his battles of the earth struggle because of the following factors of personal tendencies and character weakness:<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_4_18"><a href="#fn_a4_4_18">[60]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p4_5">193:4.5</a></small></sup>  1. He was an isolated type of human being. He was highly individualistic and chose to grow into a confirmed “shut-in” and unsociable sort of person.</p>
<p id="p4_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p4_6">193:4.6</a></small></sup>  2. As a child, life had been made too easy for him. He bitterly resented thwarting. He always expected to win; he was a very poor loser.</p>
<p id="p4_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p4_7">193:4.7</a></small></sup>  3. He never acquired a philosophic technique for meeting <a href="/en/topic/disappointment">disappointment</a>. Instead of accepting disappointments as a regular and commonplace feature of human existence, he unfailingly resorted to the practice of <a href="/en/topic/blame">blaming</a> someone in particular, or his associates as a group, for all his personal <a href="/en/topic/difficulties">difficulties</a> and disappointments.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_7_4"><a href="#fn_a4_7_4">[64]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p4_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p4_9">193:4.9</a></small></sup>  5. He did not like to face facts frankly; he was dishonest in his attitude toward life situations.</p>

In mind, he was suspicious and vengeful. In temperament, he was surly and vindictive. Emotionally, he was loveless and unforgiving. Socially, he was unconfiding and almost wholly self-contained. In spirit, he became arrogant and selfishly ambitious.

Among this company was <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> the mother of Jesus. She had returned to Jerusalem with <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John Zebedee</a> when the apostles came back from their recent sojourn in <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>.

This part of the meeting lasted not quite one hour.
