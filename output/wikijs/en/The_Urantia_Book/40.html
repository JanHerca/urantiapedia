<p id="p0_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p0_10">40:0.10</a></small></sup>  These presentations began with a <a href="/en/topic/Revelations,_Book_of">description</a> of the Deities, and group by group, the narrative has descended the universal scale of living beings until it has reached the lowest order of life endowed with the potential of immortality; and now am I dispatched from <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a>—onetime a mortal of origin on an evolutionary world of space—to elaborate and continue the recital of the eternal purpose of the Gods respecting the ascending orders of sonship, more particularly with regard to the mortal creatures of time and space.</p>

<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. EVOLUTIONARY SERAPHIM </h2>

Guardian <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a>, through experience and service with the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortals</a> of time, also achieve the status of ascendant sonship.

<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p1_2">40:1.2</a></small></sup>  To climb to the supernal heights of <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliter</a> sonship with <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> is a masterly achievement for an angel, an accomplishment far transcending your attainment of eternal survival through the plan of the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a> and the ever-present help of the indwelling Adjuster; but the guardian seraphim, and occasionally others, do actually effect such ascensions.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. ASCENDING MATERIAL SONS </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p2_1">40:2.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a> of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> are created in the local universe along with the Melchizedeks and their associates, who are all classified as descending Sons. And indeed, the <a href="/en/topic/Planetary_Adams">Planetary Adams</a>—the Material Sons and Daughters of the evolutionary worlds—are descending Sons, coming down to the inhabited worlds from their spheres of origin, the capitals of the local systems.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p2_2">40:2.2</a></small></sup>  When such an <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> are wholly successful in their joint planetary mission as biologic uplifters, they share the destiny of the inhabitants of their world. When such a world is settled in the advanced stages of light and life, this faithful Material Son and Daughter are permitted to resign all planetary administrative duties, and after being thus liberated from the descending adventure, they are permitted to register themselves as perfected Material Sons on the records of the local universe. Likewise, when planetary assignment is long delayed, may the Material Sons of stationary status—the citizens of the local systems—withdraw from the activities of their status spheres and similarly register as perfected Material Sons. After these formalities such liberated Adams and Eves are accredited as ascending Sons of God and may immediately begin the long journey to <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>, starting at the exact point of their then present status and spiritual attainment.

<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p3_1">40:3.1</a></small></sup>  Although deprived of the immediate benefits of the planetary bestowals of the <a href="/en/topic/descending_Sons_of_God">descending Sons of God</a>, though the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> ascent is long deferred, nevertheless, soon after an evolutionary planet has attained the intermediate epochs of <a href="/en/topic/light_and_life">light and life</a> (if not before), both groups of midway creatures are released from planetary duty. Sometimes the majority of them are translated, along with their human cousins, on the day of the descent of the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> of light and the elevation of the Planetary Prince to the dignity of Planetary Sovereign. Upon being relieved of planetary service, both orders are registered in the local universe as ascending <a href="/en/topic/Sons_of_God">Sons of God</a> and immediately begin the long Paradise ascent by the very routes ordained for the progression of the mortal races of the material worlds. The primary group are destined to various <a href="/en/topic/finaliter_corps">finaliter corps</a>, but the secondary or Adamic <a href="/en/topic/midwayers">midwayers</a> are all routed for enrollment in the <a href="/en/topic/Corps_of_Mortal_Finaliters">Mortal Corps of Finality</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_1_9"><a href="#fn_s3_1_9">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p4_1">40:4.1</a></small></sup>  When the <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of time fail to achieve the eternal survival of their souls in planetary association with the spirit gifts of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>, such failure is never in any way due to neglect of duty, ministry, service, or devotion on the part of the Adjuster. At mortal death, such deserted Monitors return to <a href="/en/topic/Divinington">Divinington</a>, and subsequently, following the adjudication of the nonsurvivor, they may be reassigned to the worlds of time and space. Sometimes, after repeated services of this sort or following some unusual experience, such as functioning as the indwelling Adjuster of an incarnated bestowal Son, these efficient Adjusters are personalized by the Universal Father.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_1_22"><a href="#fn_a4_1_22">[1]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_1_9"><a href="#fn_s4_1_9">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s4_1_14"><a href="#fn_s4_1_14">[14]</a></sup></p>

Originally of existential prepersonal status, they have experientialized by participation in the lives and careers of the lowly mortals of the material worlds. And since the <a href="/en/topic/personality">personality</a> bestowed upon these experienced <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Thought Adjusters</a> takes origin, and has its wellspring, in the Universal Father’s personal and continuing ministry of the bestowals of experiential personality upon his creature creation, these Personalized Adjusters are classified as ascending <a href="/en/topic/Sons_of_God">Sons of God</a>, the highest of all such orders of sonship.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_2_9"><a href="#fn_s4_2_9">[1]</a></sup></p>

But the Father is not deprived of personal contact with his lowly creatures; you are not without the divine presence. Although <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> the Father cannot be with you by direct personality manifestation, he is in you and of you in the identity of the indwelling <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Thought Adjusters</a>, the divine Monitors.

<p id="p5_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p5_9">40:5.9</a></small></sup>  Mortals of series one inhabit the worlds of space during the earlier epochs of the evolution of mankind and embrace the most primitive types of human minds. On many worlds like pre-Adamic <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> great numbers of the higher and more advanced types of primitive men acquire survival capacity but fail to attain <a href="/en/topic/Adjuster_fusion">Adjuster fusion</a>. For ages upon ages, before man’s ascent to the level of higher spiritual volition, the Adjusters occupy the minds of these struggling creatures during their short lives in the flesh, and the moment such will creatures are indwelt by Adjusters, the group <a href="/en/topic/guardian_angels">guardian angels</a> begin to function. While these mortals of <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> series do not have personal guardians, they do have group custodians.</p>
<p id="p5_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p5_10">40:5.10</a></small></sup>  An experiential Adjuster remains with a primitive human being throughout his entire lifetime in the flesh. The Adjusters contribute much to the advancement of primitive men but are unable to form eternal unions with such <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a>. This transient ministry of the Adjusters accomplishes two things: First, they gain valuable and actual experience in the nature and working of the evolutionary intellect, an experience which will be invaluable in connection with later contacts on other worlds with beings of higher development. Second, the transient sojourn of the Adjusters contributes much towards preparing their mortal subjects for possible subsequent Spirit fusion. All God-seeking souls of this type achieve eternal life through the spiritual embrace of the Mother Spirit of the local universe, thus becoming <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortals</a> of the local universe regime. Many persons from pre-Adamic Urantia were thus advanced to the mansion worlds of <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s5_10_9"><a href="#fn_s5_10_9">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s5_10_7"><a href="#fn_s5_10_7">[5]</a></sup></p>

Type classification among the one-, two-, and three-brained races is not a factor in <a href="/en/topic/Adjuster_fusion">Adjuster fusion</a>; all such mortals are akin, but these non-Adjuster-fusion types are a wholly different and markedly modified order of will creatures. Many of the nonbreathers belong to this series, and there are numerous other groups who do not ordinarily fuse with Adjusters.</p>
<p id="p5_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p5_13">40:5.13</a></small></sup>  Like series number one, each member of this group enjoys the ministry of a single Adjuster during lifetime in the flesh. During temporal life these Adjusters do everything for their subjects of temporary indwelling that is done on other worlds where the mortals are of fusion potential. The mortals of this second series are often indwelt by virgin Adjusters, but the higher human types are often in liaison with masterful and experienced Monitors.</p>

<p id="p5_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p5_15">40:5.15</a></small></sup>  When you encounter these modified mortal types on the mansion worlds, you will find no difficulty in communicating with them. There they speak the same system <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a> but by a modified technique. These beings are identical with your order of creature life in spirit and personality manifestations, differing only in certain physical features and in the fact that they are nonfusible with <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Thought Adjusters</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_15_4"><a href="#fn_a5_15_4">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_15_10"><a href="#fn_a5_15_10">[28]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_15_8"><a href="#fn_a5_15_8">[29]</a></sup></p>

Some of us incline to the belief that the <a href="/en/topic/Life_Carriers">Life Carriers</a>, in their efforts to formulate beings capable of maintaining existence in an unusual planetary environment, are confronted with the necessity of making such radical modifications in the universe plan of intelligent will creatures that it becomes inherently impossible to bring about permanent union with the Adjusters. Often have we asked: Is this an intended or an unintended part of the ascension plan? but we have not found the answer.</p>
<p id="p5_17"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p5_17">40:5.17</a></small></sup>  <i>Series three—<a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of Adjuster-fusion potential.</i> All <a href="/en/topic/Father-fused_mortals">Father-fused mortals</a> are of animal origin, just like the <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> races. They embrace mortals of the one-brained, <a href="/en/topic/brains">two-brained</a>, and three-brained types of Adjuster-fusion potential. Urantians are of the intermediate or two-brained type, being in many ways humanly superior to the one-brained groups but definitely limited in comparison with the three-brained orders. These three types of physical-brain endowment are not factors in Adjuster bestowal, in seraphic service, or in any other phase of spirit ministry. The intellectual and spiritual differential between the three brain types characterizes individuals who are otherwise quite alike in mind endowment and spiritual potential, being greatest in the temporal life and tending to diminish as the <a href="/en/topic/mansion_worlds">mansion worlds</a> are traversed one by one.

Son-fused <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascenders</a> likewise rise to the source of spirit endowment, for much as the Truth Spirit of a Creator Son focalizes in the associated Divine Minister, so is his “fusion spirit” implemented in the <a href="/en/topic/Reflective_Spirits">Reflective Spirits</a> of the higher universes. Such spirit relationship between the local and the superuniverse levels of <a href="/en/topic/God_the_Sevenfold">God the Sevenfold</a> may be difficult of explanation but not of discernment, being unmistakably revealed in those children of the Reflective Spirits—the secoraphic <a href="/en/topic/Voices_of_Creator_Sons">Voices of the Creator Sons</a>. The Thought Adjuster, hailing from the Father on <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>, never stops until the mortal son stands face to face with the eternal <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>.</p>

<p id="p10_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p10_4">40:10.4</a></small></sup>  We have analyzed this problem and have reached the undoubted conclusion that the consignment of all <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> to an ultimate <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> <a href="/en/topic/destiny">destiny</a> would be unfair to the time-space universes inasmuch as the courts of the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Sons</a> and of the <a href="/en/topic/Ancients_of_Days">Ancients of Days</a> would then be wholly dependent on the services of those who were in transit to higher realms.
