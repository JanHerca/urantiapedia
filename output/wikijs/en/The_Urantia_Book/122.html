Subsequent to this decision Gabriel made a personal visit to Urantia, and, as a result of his study of human groups and his survey of the spiritual, intellectual, racial, and geographic features of the world and its peoples, he decided that the <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a> possessed those relative advantages which warranted their selection as the bestowal race. Upon Michael’s approval of this decision, Gabriel appointed and dispatched to Urantia the <a href="/en/topic/Family_Commission_of_Twelve">Family Commission of Twelve</a>—selected from among the higher orders of universe personalities—which was intrusted with the task of making an investigation of Jewish family life. When this commission ended its labors, Gabriel was present on Urantia and received the report nominating three prospective unions as being, in the opinion of the commission, equally favorable as bestowal families for Michael’s projected incarnation.</p>

<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p4_4">122:4.4</a></small></sup>  Most of the so-called Messianic prophecies of the <a href="/en/topic/Old_Testament">Old Testament</a> were made to apply to <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> long after his life had been lived on earth. For centuries the Hebrew prophets had proclaimed the coming of a <a href="/en/topic/Deliverer">deliverer</a>, and these promises had been construed by successive generations as referring to a new Jewish ruler who would sit upon the throne of <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a> and, by the reputed miraculous methods of <a href="/en/topic/Moses">Moses</a>, proceed to establish the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> in <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a> as a powerful nation, free from all foreign domination. Again, many figurative passages found throughout the Hebrew scriptures were subsequently misapplied to the life mission of Jesus. Many Old Testament sayings were so distorted as to appear to fit some episode of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s earth life. Jesus himself onetime publicly denied any connection with the royal house of David<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b21"><a href="#fn_b21">[21]</a></sup>.

Many of these lineages contain much of the Master’s ancestry, but on the whole they are not genuine and may not be depended upon as factual. The early followers of Jesus all too often succumbed to the temptation to make all the olden prophetic utterances appear to find fulfillment in the life of their Lord and Master.</p>

As a youth, among his eight brothers and sisters, he had been more cheerful, but in the earlier years of married life (during <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ childhood) he was subject to periods of mild spiritual discouragement. These temperamental manifestations were greatly improved just before his untimely death and after the economic condition of his family had been enhanced by his advancement from the rank of carpenter to the role of a prosperous contractor.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a7"><a href="#fn_a7">[7]</a></sup></p>

In emotional reactions to his adult-life environment, Jesus was at one time like his father, meditative and worshipful, sometimes characterized by apparent sadness; but more often he drove forward in the manner of his mother’s optimistic and determined disposition. All in all, Mary’s temperament tended to dominate the career of the divine Son as he grew up and swung into the momentous strides of his adult life. In some particulars Jesus was a blending of his parents’ traits; in other respects he exhibited the traits of one in contrast with those of the other.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a8"><a href="#fn_a8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a9"><a href="#fn_a9">[9]</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="p6" class="toc-header"><a href="#p6" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 6. THE HOME AT NAZARETH </h2>
<p id="p6_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p6_1">122:6.1</a></small></sup>  The home of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was not far from the high hill in the northerly part of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, some distance from the village spring, which was in the eastern section of the town. Jesus’ family dwelt in the outskirts of the city, and this made it all the easier for him subsequently to enjoy frequent strolls in the country and to make trips up to the top of this near-by highland, the highest of all the hills of southern <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> save the <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Tabor">Mount Tabor</a> range to the east and the hill of <a href="/en/topic/Nain">Nain</a>, which was about the same height. Their home was located a little to the south and east of the southern promontory of this hill and about midway between the base of this elevation and the road leading out of Nazareth toward <a href="/en/topic/Cana">Cana</a>. Aside from climbing the hill, Jesus’ favorite stroll was to follow a narrow trail winding about the base of the hill in a northeasterly direction to a point where it joined the road to <a href="/en/topic/Sepphoris">Sepphoris</a>.</p>
<p id="p6_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p6_2">122:6.2</a></small></sup>  The home of <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> was a one-room stone structure with a flat roof and an adjoining building for housing the animals. The furniture consisted of a low stone table, earthenware and stone dishes and pots, a loom, a lampstand, several small stools, and mats for sleeping on the stone floor. In the back yard, near the animal annex, was the shelter which covered the oven and the mill for grinding grain. It required two persons to operate this type of mill, one to grind and another to feed the grain. As a small boy Jesus often fed grain to this mill while his mother turned the grinder.</p>
<p id="p6_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p6_3">122:6.3</a></small></sup>  In later years, as the family grew in size, they would all squat about the enlarged stone table to enjoy their meals, helping themselves from a common dish, or pot, of food. During the winter, at the evening meal the table would be lighted by a small, flat clay lamp, which was filled with olive oil. After the birth of <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(wife_of_Justus)">Martha</a>, Joseph built an addition to this house, a large room, which was used as a <a href="/en/topic/carpenter_shop">carpenter shop</a> during the day and as a sleeping room at night.</p>

<p id="p7_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p7_1">122:7.1</a></small></sup>  In the month of March, 8 B.C.

The <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> had always been greatly prejudiced against any attempt to “number the people,” and this, in connection with the serious domestic difficulties of Herod, King of <a href="/en/topic/Judea">Judea</a>, had conspired to cause the postponement of the taking of this census in the Jewish kingdom for one year. Throughout all the Roman Empire this census was registered in the year 8 B<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b26"><a href="#fn_b26">[26]</a></sup>.C., except in the Palestinian kingdom of Herod, where it was taken in 7 B.C., one year later.</p>

The building and furnishing of a home had been a great drain on Joseph since he had also to contribute to the support of his parents, as his father had been recently disabled. And so this Jewish couple went forth from their humble home early on the morning of August 18, 7 B.C., on their journey to <a href="/en/topic/Bethlehem_(Judea)">Bethlehem</a>.</p>
