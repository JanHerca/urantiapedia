<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p1_1">81:1.1</a></small></sup>  For about thirty-five thousand years after the days of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a>, the cradle of <a href="/en/topic/civilization">civilization</a> was in southwestern <a href="/en/topic/Asia">Asia</a>, extending from the <a href="/en/topic/Nile_valley">Nile valley</a> eastward and slightly to the north across northern <a href="/en/topic/Arabia">Arabia</a>, through <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, and on into <a href="/en/topic/Turkestan">Turkestan</a>.

The ancients sought a supernatural explanation for all natural phenomena not within the range of their personal comprehension; and many moderns continue to do this. The depersonalization of so-called natural phenomena has required ages, and it is not yet completed.

<p id="p2_17"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p2_17">81:2.17</a></small></sup>  The older river races made their huts by setting tall poles in the ground in a circle; the tops were then brought together, making the skeleton frame for the hut, which was interlaced with transverse reeds, the whole creation resembling a huge inverted <a href="/en/topic/basket_weaving">basket</a>.

The practice of hardening pottery by baking was discovered when one of these clay-covered primitive huts accidentally burned.
