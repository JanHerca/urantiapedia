<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p0_2">84:0.2</a></small></sup>  Mating is purely an act of <a href="/en/topic/self-perpetuation">self-perpetuation</a> associated with varying degrees of <a href="/en/topic/self-gratification">self-gratification</a>; marriage, home building, is largely a matter of <a href="/en/topic/self-maintenance">self-maintenance</a>, and it implies the evolution of society. Society itself is the aggregated structure of family units. Individuals are very temporary as planetary factors—only families are continuing agencies in social evolution. The family is the channel through which the river of culture and knowledge flows from one generation to another.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_2_15"><a href="#fn_a0_2_15">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_2_39"><a href="#fn_a0_2_39">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p0_3">84:0.3</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/home">home</a> is basically a sociologic institution. Marriage grew out of co-operation in self-maintenance and partnership in self-perpetuation, the element of self-gratification being largely incidental. Nevertheless, the home does embrace all three of the essential functions of human existence, while life propagation makes it the fundamental human institution, and sex sets it off from all other social activities.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_3_2"><a href="#fn_s0_3_2">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s0_3_3"><a href="#fn_s0_3_3">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p1_1">84:1.1</a></small></sup>  Marriage was not founded on <a href="/en/topic/sex">sex</a> relations; they were incidental thereto. Marriage was not needed by primitive man, who indulged his sex appetite freely without encumbering himself with the responsibilities of wife, children, and <a href="/en/topic/home">home</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_1_1"><a href="#fn_s1_1_1">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p1_2">84:1.2</a></small></sup>  Woman, because of physical and emotional attachment to her offspring, is dependent on co-operation with the male, and this urges her into the sheltering protection of <a href="/en/topic/marriage">marriage</a>. But no direct biologic urge led man into marriage—much less held him in. It was not love that made marriage attractive to man, but food hunger which first attracted savage man to woman and the primitive shelter shared by her children.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_11"><a href="#fn_a1_2_11">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p1_3">84:1.3</a></small></sup>  Marriage was not even brought about by the conscious realization of the obligations of <a href="/en/topic/sex">sex</a> relations. Primitive man comprehended no connection between sex indulgence and the subsequent birth of a child. It was once universally believed that a virgin could become pregnant. The savage early conceived the idea that babies were made in spiritland; <a href="/en/topic/pregnancy">pregnancy</a> was believed to be the result of a woman’s being entered by a spirit, an evolving ghost. Both diet and the evil eye were also believed to be capable of causing pregnancy in a virgin or unmarried woman, while later beliefs connected the beginnings of life with the breath and with sunlight<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p1_4">84:1.4</a></small></sup>  Many early peoples associated <a href="/en/topic/ghosts">ghosts</a> with the sea; hence <a href="/en/topic/virgins">virgins</a> were greatly restricted in their <a href="/en/topic/bathing">bathing</a> practices; young women were far more afraid of bathing in the sea at high tide than of having sex relations. Deformed or premature babies were regarded as the young of animals which had found their way into a woman’s body as a result of careless bathing or through malevolent spirit activity. Savages, of course, thought nothing of strangling such offspring at birth.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p1_5">84:1.5</a></small></sup>  The first step in enlightenment came with the belief that sex relations opened up the way for the impregnating ghost to enter the female. Man has since discovered that father and mother are equal contributors of the living inheritance factors which initiate offspring. But even in the twentieth century many parents still endeavor to keep their children in more or less ignorance as to the origin of human life.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_5_13"><a href="#fn_a1_5_13">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p1_6">84:1.6</a></small></sup>  A family of some simple sort was insured by the fact that the reproductive function entails the mother-child relationship. Mother <a href="/en/topic/love">love</a> is instinctive; it did not originate in the mores as did <a href="/en/topic/marriage">marriage</a>. All mammalian mother love is the inherent endowment of the <a href="/en/topic/adjutant_mind-spirits">adjutant mind-spirits</a> of the local universe and is in strength and devotion always directly proportional to the length of the helpless infancy of the species.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p1_7">84:1.7</a></small></sup>  The mother and child relation is natural, strong, and instinctive, and one which, therefore, constrained primitive <a href="/en/topic/women">women</a> to submit to many strange conditions and to endure untold hardships. This compelling mother love is the handicapping emotion which has always placed woman at such a tremendous disadvantage in all her struggles with man. Even at that, maternal instinct in the human species is not overpowering; it may be thwarted by <a href="/en/topic/ambitions">ambition</a>, <a href="/en/topic/selfishness">selfishness</a>, and religious conviction.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_7_3"><a href="#fn_s1_7_3">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_7_0"><a href="#fn_s1_7_0">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p1_8">84:1.8</a></small></sup>  While the mother-child association is neither <a href="/en/topic/marriage">marriage</a> nor <a href="/en/topic/home">home</a>, it was the nucleus from which both sprang. The great advance in the evolution of mating came when these temporary partnerships lasted long enough to rear the resultant offspring, for that was homemaking.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_8_1"><a href="#fn_s1_8_1">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p1_9">84:1.9</a></small></sup>  Regardless of the antagonisms of these early pairs, notwithstanding the looseness of the association, the chances for survival were greatly improved by these male-female partnerships. A man and a woman, co-operating, even aside from family and offspring, are vastly superior in most ways to either two men or two women. This pairing of the sexes enhanced survival and was the very beginning of human society. The sex division of labor also made for comfort and increased happiness.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_9_11"><a href="#fn_a1_9_11">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_9_1"><a href="#fn_a1_9_1">[9]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_9_3"><a href="#fn_s1_9_3">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_9_1"><a href="#fn_s1_9_1">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_9_0"><a href="#fn_s1_9_0">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p2_1">84:2.1</a></small></sup>  The woman’s periodic hemorrhage and her further loss of <a href="/en/topic/blood">blood</a> at childbirth early suggested blood as the creator of the child (even as the seat of the soul) and gave origin to the blood-bond concept of human relationships<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>. In early times all descent was reckoned in the female line, that being the only part of <a href="/en/topic/inheritance">inheritance</a> which was at all certain.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_1_2"><a href="#fn_a2_1_2">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_1_18"><a href="#fn_a2_1_18">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p2_2">84:2.2</a></small></sup>  The primitive <a href="/en/topic/family">family</a>, growing out of the instinctive biologic blood bond of mother and child, was inevitably a mother-family; and many tribes long held to this arrangement. The mother-family was the only possible transition from the stage of group <a href="/en/topic/marriage">marriage</a> in the horde to the later and improved <a href="/en/topic/home">home</a> life of the polygamous and monogamous father-families. The mother-family was natural and biologic; the father-family is social, economic, and political. The persistence of the mother-family among the North American red men is one of the chief reasons why the otherwise progressive <a href="/en/topic/Iroquois">Iroquois</a> never became a real state.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p2_3">84:2.3</a></small></sup>  Under the mother-family mores the wife’s mother enjoyed virtually supreme authority in the home; even the wife’s brothers and their sons were more active in family supervision than was the husband. Fathers were often renamed after their own children.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p2_4">84:2.4</a></small></sup>  The earliest races gave little credit to the father, looking upon the child as coming altogether from the mother. They believed that children resembled the father as a result of association, or that they were “marked” in this manner because the mother desired them to look like the father. Later on, when the switch came from the mother-family to the father-family, the father took all credit for the child, and many of the taboos on a pregnant woman were subsequently extended to include her husband. The prospective father ceased work as the time of delivery approached, and at childbirth he went to bed, along with the wife, remaining at rest from three to eight days. The wife might arise the next day and engage in hard labor, but the husband remained in bed to receive congratulations; this was all a part of the early mores designed to establish the father’s right to the child.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p2_5">84:2.5</a></small></sup>  At first, it was the custom for the man to go to his wife’s people, but in later times, after a man had paid or worked out the bride price, he could take his wife and children back to his own people. The transition from the mother-family to the father-family explains the otherwise meaningless prohibitions of some types of cousin marriages while others of equal kinship are approved.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p2_6">84:2.6</a></small></sup>  With the passing of the hunter mores, when herding gave man control of the chief food supply, the mother-family came to a speedy end. It failed simply because it could not successfully compete with the newer father-family. Power lodged with the male relatives of the mother could not compete with power concentrated in the husband-father. Woman was not equal to the combined tasks of childbearing and of exercising continuous authority and increasing domestic power. The oncoming of wife stealing and later wife purchase hastened the passing of the mother-family.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_6_1"><a href="#fn_s2_6_1">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p2_7">84:2.7</a></small></sup>  The stupendous change from the mother-family to the father-family is one of the most radical and complete right-about-face adjustments ever executed by the human race. This change led at once to greater social expression and increased <a href="/en/topic/family">family</a> adventure.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_7_3"><a href="#fn_s2_7_3">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. THE FAMILY UNDER FATHER DOMINANCE </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p3_1">84:3.1</a></small></sup>  It may be that the instinct of motherhood led woman into <a href="/en/topic/marriage">marriage</a>, but it was man’s superior strength, together with the influence of the mores, that virtually compelled her to remain in wedlock. Pastoral living tended to create a new system of mores, the patriarchal type of <a href="/en/topic/family">family</a> life; and the basis of family unity under the herder and early agricultural mores was the unquestioned and arbitrary authority of the father. All society, whether national or familial, passed through the stage of the autocratic authority of a patriarchal order.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_1_11"><a href="#fn_a3_1_11">[7]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_1_1"><a href="#fn_s3_1_1">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p3_2">84:3.2</a></small></sup>  The scant courtesy paid womankind during the <a href="/en/topic/Old_Testament">Old Testament</a> era is a true reflection of the mores of the herdsmen. The Hebrew patriarchs were all herdsmen, as is witnessed by the saying, “The Lord is my Shepherd<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_2_11"><a href="#fn_a3_2_11">[7]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_2_2"><a href="#fn_s3_2_2">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s3_2_3"><a href="#fn_s3_2_3">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p3_3">84:3.3</a></small></sup>  But man was no more to blame for his low opinion of woman during past ages than was woman herself. She failed to get social recognition during primitive times because she did not function in an emergency; she was not a spectacular or <a href="/en/topic/crisis">crisis</a> hero. Maternity was a distinct disability in the existence struggle; mother love handicapped <a href="/en/topic/women">women</a> in the tribal defense.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_3_1"><a href="#fn_s3_3_1">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p3_4">84:3.4</a></small></sup>  Primitive women also unintentionally created their dependence on the male by their admiration and applause for his pugnacity and virility. This exaltation of the warrior elevated the male ego while it equally depressed that of the female and made her more dependent; a <a href="/en/topic/military">military</a> uniform still mightily stirs the feminine emotions.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p3_5">84:3.5</a></small></sup>  Among the more advanced races, <a href="/en/topic/women">women</a> are not so large or so strong as men. Woman, being the weaker, therefore became the more tactful; she early learned to trade upon her sex charms. She became more alert and conservative than man, though slightly less profound. Man was woman’s superior on the battlefield and in the hunt; but at <a href="/en/topic/home">home</a> woman has usually outgeneraled even the most primitive of men.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_5_1"><a href="#fn_s3_5_1">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p3_6">84:3.6</a></small></sup>  The herdsman looked to his flocks for sustenance, but throughout these pastoral ages woman must still provide the vegetable food. Primitive man shunned the soil; it was altogether too peaceful, too unadventuresome. There was also an old superstition that women could raise better <a href="/en/topic/plants">plants</a>; they were mothers. In many backward tribes today, the men cook the meat, the women the vegetables, and when the <a href="/en/topic/aborigines_(Australian)">primitive tribes of Australia</a> are on the march, the women never attack game, while a man would not stoop to dig a root.</p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p3_7">84:3.7</a></small></sup>  Woman has always had to work; at least right up to modern times the female has been a real producer. Man has usually chosen the easier path, and this inequality has existed throughout the entire <a href="/en/topic/history">history</a> of the human race. Woman has always been the burden bearer, carrying the <a href="/en/topic/family">family</a> property and tending the children, thus leaving the man’s hands free for fighting or hunting.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_7_11"><a href="#fn_a3_7_11">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p3_8">84:3.8</a></small></sup>  Woman’s first liberation came when man consented to till the soil, consented to do what had theretofore been regarded as woman’s work. It was a great step forward when male captives were no longer killed but were enslaved as agriculturists. This brought about the liberation of woman so that she could devote more time to homemaking and child culture.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_8_1"><a href="#fn_s3_8_1">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s3_8_0"><a href="#fn_s3_8_0">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p3_9">84:3.9</a></small></sup>  The provision of <a href="/en/topic/milk">milk</a> for the young led to earlier <a href="/en/topic/weaning">weaning</a> of babies, hence to the bearing of more children by the mothers thus relieved of their sometimes temporary barrenness, while the use of cow’s milk and goat’s milk greatly reduced infant mortality. Before the herding stage of society, mothers used to nurse their babies until they were four and five years old.</p>
<p id="p3_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p3_10">84:3.10</a></small></sup>  Decreasing primitive warfare greatly lessened the disparity between the division of labor based on sex. But <a href="/en/topic/women">women</a> still had to do the real work while men did picket duty. No camp or village could be left unguarded day or night, but even this task was alleviated by the domestication of the <a href="/en/topic/dogs">dog</a>. In general, the coming of <a href="/en/topic/agriculture">agriculture</a> has enhanced woman’s prestige and social standing; at least this was true up to the time man himself turned agriculturist. And as soon as man addressed himself to the tilling of the soil, there immediately ensued great improvement in methods of agriculture, extending on down through successive generations. In hunting and war man had learned the value of organization, and he introduced these techniques into industry and later, when taking over much of woman’s work, greatly improved on her loose methods of labor.</p>

<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p4_1">84:4.1</a></small></sup>  Generally speaking, during any age woman’s status is a fair criterion of the evolutionary progress of <a href="/en/topic/marriage">marriage</a> as a social institution, while the progress of marriage itself is a reasonably accurate gauge registering the advances of human civilization.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_1_11"><a href="#fn_a4_1_11">[7]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_1_3"><a href="#fn_s4_1_3">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s4_1_1"><a href="#fn_s4_1_1">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s4_1_0"><a href="#fn_s4_1_0">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p4_2">84:4.2</a></small></sup>  Woman’s status has always been a social paradox; she has always been a shrewd manager of men; she has always capitalized man’s stronger sex urge for her own interests and to her own advancement. By trading subtly upon her sex charms, she has often been able to exercise dominant power over man, even when held by him in abject slavery.</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p4_3">84:4.3</a></small></sup>  Early woman was not to man a friend, sweetheart, lover, and partner but rather a piece of property, a servant or slave and, later on, an economic partner, plaything, and childbearer. Nonetheless, proper and satisfactory <a href="/en/topic/sex">sex</a> relations have always involved the element of choice and co-operation by woman, and this has always given intelligent <a href="/en/topic/women">women</a> considerable influence over their immediate and personal standing, regardless of their social position as a sex. But man’s distrust and suspicion were not helped by the fact that women were all along compelled to resort to shrewdness in the effort to alleviate their bondage.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_3_2"><a href="#fn_s4_3_2">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s4_3_3"><a href="#fn_s4_3_3">[2]</a></sup></p>

They have even believed that women did not have souls; therefore were they denied names. During early times there existed great fear of <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> sex relation with a woman; hence it became the custom for a priest to have initial intercourse with a virgin.

Except among those groups where the husband participated in the <a href="/en/topic/childbirth">lying-in</a>, the expectant mother was shunned, left alone. The ancients even avoided having a child born in the house. Finally, the old women were permitted to attend the mother during labor, and this practice gave origin to the profession of <a href="/en/topic/midwifery">midwifery</a>.

To be thus detected was a grievous <a href="/en/topic/sin">sin</a>, the violation of a taboo. Under the mores of olden times, every woman, from adolescence to the end of the childbearing period, was subjected to complete family and social quarantine one full week each month<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>.

But when a woman passed beyond the childbearing age, she was usually treated more considerately, being accorded more rights and privileges. In view of all this it was not strange that women were looked down upon. Even the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a> held the menstruating woman as one of the three great causes of <a href="/en/topic/defilement">defilement</a>, the other two being pork and garlic.</p>
<p id="p4_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p4_9">84:4.9</a></small></sup>  However foolish these olden notions were, they did some good since they gave overworked females, at least when young, one week each month for welcome rest and profitable meditation.

<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p5_3">84:5.3</a></small></sup>  The modern idea of sex equality is beautiful and worthy of an expanding civilization, but it is not found in nature.

Slowly but surely the mores change so as to provide for those social adjustments which are a part of the persistent evolution of civilization.

<p id="p8_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p8_1">84:8.1</a></small></sup>  The great threat against <a href="/en/topic/family">family</a> life is the menacing rising tide of <a href="/en/topic/self-gratification">self-gratification</a>, the modern pleasure mania. The prime incentive to <a href="/en/topic/marriage">marriage</a> used to be economic; sex attraction was secondary. Marriage, founded on self-maintenance, led to self-perpetuation and concomitantly provided one of the most desirable forms of self-gratification. It is the only institution of human society which embraces all three of the great incentives for living.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a8_1_6"><a href="#fn_a8_1_6">[2]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s8_1_3"><a href="#fn_s8_1_3">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s8_1_1"><a href="#fn_s8_1_1">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s8_1_7"><a href="#fn_s8_1_7">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p8_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p8_2">84:8.2</a></small></sup>  Originally, property was the basic institution of self-maintenance, while marriage functioned as the unique institution of self-perpetuation. Although food satisfaction, play, and humor, along with periodic sex indulgence, were means of self-gratification, it remains a fact that the evolving mores have failed to build any distinct institution of self-gratification. And it is due to this failure to evolve specialized techniques of pleasurable enjoyment that all human institutions are so completely shot through with this pleasure pursuit. Property accumulation is becoming an instrument for augmenting all forms of self-gratification, while marriage is often viewed only as a means of pleasure. And this overindulgence, this widely spread pleasure mania, now constitutes the greatest threat that has ever been leveled at the social evolutionary institution of family life, the <a href="/en/topic/home">home</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a8_2_2"><a href="#fn_a8_2_2">[1]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s8_2_1"><a href="#fn_s8_2_1">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p8_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p8_3">84:8.3</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Adamites">violet race</a> introduced a new and only imperfectly realized characteristic into the experience of humankind—the play instinct coupled with the sense of humor. It was there in measure in the <a href="/en/topic/Sangiks">Sangiks</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Andonites">Andonites</a>, but the Adamic strain elevated this primitive propensity into the <i>potential of pleasure,</i> a new and glorified form of <a href="/en/topic/self-gratification">self-gratification</a>. The basic type of self-gratification, aside from appeasing hunger, is sex gratification, and this form of sensual pleasure was enormously heightened by the blending of the Sangiks and the <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andites</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s8_3_1"><a href="#fn_s8_3_1">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p8_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p8_4">84:8.4</a></small></sup>  There is real danger in the combination of restlessness, curiosity, adventure, and pleasure-abandon characteristic of the post-Andite races. The hunger of the <a href="/en/topic/soul">soul</a> cannot be satisfied with physical <a href="/en/topic/pleasures">pleasures</a>; the love of <a href="/en/topic/home">home</a> and <a href="/en/topic/children">children</a> is not augmented by the unwise pursuit of pleasure.
