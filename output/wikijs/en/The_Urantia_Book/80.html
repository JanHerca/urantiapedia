<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p1_2">80:1.2</a></small></sup>  In the eastern trough of the Mediterranean the Nodites had established one of their most extensive cultures and from these centers had penetrated somewhat into southern Europe but more especially into northern <a href="/en/topic/Africa">Africa</a>. The <a href="/en/topic/broad-heads">broad-headed</a> Nodite-Andonite Syrians very early introduced <a href="/en/topic/pottery">pottery</a> and agriculture in connection with their settlements on the slowly rising <a href="/en/topic/Nile_valley">Nile</a> delta. They also imported <a href="/en/topic/sheep">sheep</a>, <a href="/en/topic/goats">goats</a>, <a href="/en/topic/cattle">cattle</a>, and other domesticated animals and brought in greatly improved methods of <a href="/en/topic/metalworking">metalworking</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Syria">Syria</a> then being the center of that industry.</p>

But the ingress of large numbers of the <a href="/en/topic/Sahara">Sahara</a> peoples greatly deteriorated the early civilization along the Nile so that Egypt reached its lowest cultural level some fifteen thousand years ago.</p>

The Sahara was an open grazing land overspread by herders and agriculturists. These <a href="/en/topic/Saharans">Saharans</a> never engaged in manufacture, nor were they city builders. They were an indigo-black group which carried extensive strains of the extinct <a href="/en/topic/green_race">green</a> and orange races. But they received a very limited amount of the violet inheritance before the upthrust of land and the <a href="/en/topic/climate">shifting water-laden winds</a> dispersed the remnants of this prosperous and peaceful <a href="/en/topic/civilization">civilization</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_4_7"><a href="#fn_a1_4_7">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p1_6">80:1.6</a></small></sup>  The blue men, then dominant in Europe, had no religious practices which were repulsive to the earlier migrating <a href="/en/topic/Adamites">Adamites</a>, and there was great sex attraction between the violet and the blue races. The best of the blue men deemed it a high honor to be permitted to mate with the Adamites. Every blue man entertained the ambition of becoming so skillful and artistic as to win the affection of some Adamite woman, and it was the highest aspiration of a <a href="/en/topic/superior_seraphim">superior</a> blue woman to receive the attentions of an Adamite.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_6_3"><a href="#fn_s1_6_3">[4]</a></sup></p>

The more mixed groups spread out in three directions: The <a href="/en/topic/superior_seraphim">superior</a> tribes to the west migrated to <a href="/en/topic/Spain">Spain</a> and thence to adjacent parts of Europe, forming the nucleus of the later <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_region">Mediterranean</a> <a href="/en/topic/long-heads">long-headed</a> brunet races.

<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p2_3">80:2.3</a></small></sup>  It is this secondary <a href="/en/topic/Sangiks">Sangik</a> substratum that suggests a certain degree of kinship among the modern peoples scattered from the <a href="/en/topic/Deccan">Deccan</a> through <a href="/en/topic/Iran">Iran</a>, Mesopotamia, and along both shores of the <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>.</p>

<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p2_5">80:2.5</a></small></sup>  This engulfment of the Mediterranean basin immediately curtailed the westward movements of the <a href="/en/topic/Adamites">Adamites</a>, while the great influx of <a href="/en/topic/Saharans">Saharans</a> led them to seek outlets for their increasing numbers to the north and east of Eden. As the descendants of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> journeyed northward from the valleys of the <a href="/en/topic/Tigris_River">Tigris</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Euphrates_River">Euphrates</a>, they encountered mountainous barriers and the then expanded <a href="/en/topic/Caspian_Sea">Caspian Sea</a>.

<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p3_2">80:3.2</a></small></sup>  While we speak of the blue man as pervading the European continent, there were scores of racial types.

The blue men were a race of great vigor, but they greatly deteriorated the cultural and spiritual status of the Adamites.

They maintained an efficient system of child culture. Both parents participated in these labors, and the services of the older children were fully utilized. Each child was carefully trained in the care of the caves, in art, and in <a href="/en/topic/flint">flint</a> making. At an early age the women were well versed in the domestic arts and in crude agriculture, while the men were skilled hunters and courageous warriors.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_5_3"><a href="#fn_s3_5_3">[4]</a></sup></p>

This retrogression of culture continued until it received a fresh impetus from the east when the final and en masse invasion of the Mesopotamians swept over Europe, quickly absorbing the Cro-Magnon type and culture and initiating the civilization of the white races.</p>

<p id="p8_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p8_2">80:8.2</a></small></sup>  These descendants of Andon were dispersed through most of the mountainous regions of central and southeastern Europe. They were often reinforced by arrivals from <a href="/en/topic/Asia_Minor">Asia Minor</a>, which region they occupied in considerable strength. The ancient <a href="/en/topic/Hittites">Hittites</a> stemmed directly from the Andonite stock; their pale skins and broad heads were typical of that race. This strain was carried in <a href="/en/topic/Abraham_the_Pharisee">Abraham</a>’s ancestry and contributed much to the characteristic facial appearance of his later Jewish descendants who, while having a culture and religion derived from the Andites, spoke a very different <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a>. Their tongue was distinctly Andonite.</p>
<p id="p8_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p8_3">80:8.3</a></small></sup>  The tribes that dwelt in houses erected on piles or log piers over the lakes of <a href="/en/topic/Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, and southern <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a> were the expanding fringes of the African, Aegean, and, more especially, the Danubian migrations.</p>
<p id="p8_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p8_4">80:8.4</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Danubians">Danubians</a> were <a href="/en/topic/Andonites">Andonites</a>, farmers and herders who had entered Europe through the Balkan peninsula and were moving slowly northward by way of the <a href="/en/topic/Danube">Danube</a> valley. They made <a href="/en/topic/pottery">pottery</a> and tilled the land, preferring to live in the valleys. The most northerly settlement of the Danubians was at <a href="/en/topic/Liege">Liege</a> in <a href="/en/topic/Belgium">Belgium</a>.

<p id="p9_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_2">80:9.2</a></small></sup>  1. <i>The northern white race.</i> This so-called <a href="/en/topic/Nordic_race">Nordic race</a> consisted primarily of the <a href="/en/topic/blue_race">blue man</a> plus the Andite but also contained a considerable amount of <a href="/en/topic/Andonites">Andonite</a> blood, together with smaller amounts of the <a href="/en/topic/red_race">red</a> and yellow <a href="/en/topic/Sangiks">Sangik</a>. The northern white race thus encompassed these four most desirable human stocks. But the largest inheritance was from the blue man. The typical early Nordic was <a href="/en/topic/long-heads">long-headed</a>, tall, and blond. But long ago this race became thoroughly mixed with all of the branches of the white peoples.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a9_2_22"><a href="#fn_a9_2_22">[22]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s9_2_1"><a href="#fn_s9_2_1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p9_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_3">80:9.3</a></small></sup>  The primitive culture of <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a>, which was encountered by the invading Nordics, was that of the retrograding <a href="/en/topic/Danubians">Danubians</a> blended with the blue man. The Nordic-Danish and the Danubian-Andonite cultures met and mingled on the <a href="/en/topic/Rhine_River">Rhine</a> as is witnessed by the existence of two racial groups in <a href="/en/topic/Germany">Germany</a> today.</p>
<p id="p9_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_4">80:9.4</a></small></sup>  The Nordics continued the trade in <a href="/en/topic/amber">amber</a> from the <a href="/en/topic/Baltic">Baltic</a> coast, building up a great <a href="/en/topic/commerce">commerce</a> with the <a href="/en/topic/broad-heads">broadheads</a> of the <a href="/en/topic/Danube">Danube</a> valley via the <a href="/en/topic/Brenner_Pass">Brenner Pass</a>. This extended contact with the Danubians led these northerners into mother worship, and for several thousands of years <a href="/en/topic/cremation">cremation</a> of the dead was almost universal throughout Scandinavia. This explains why remains of the earlier white races, although buried all over Europe, are not to be found—only their ashes in stone and clay urns. These white men also built dwellings; they never lived in <a href="/en/topic/caves">caves</a>. And again this explains why there are so few evidences of the white man’s early culture, although the preceding <a href="/en/topic/Cro-Magnons">Cro-Magnon</a> type is well preserved where it has been securely sealed up in caves and grottoes. As it were, one day in northern Europe there is a primitive culture of the retrogressing Danubians and the blue man and the next that of a suddenly appearing and vastly <a href="/en/topic/superior_seraphim">superior</a> white man.</p>
<p id="p9_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_5">80:9.5</a></small></sup>  2. <i>The central white race.</i> While this group includes strains of <a href="/en/topic/blue_race">blue</a>, yellow, and <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andite</a>, it is predominantly <a href="/en/topic/Andonites">Andonite</a>. These people are broad-headed, swarthy, and stocky. They are driven like a wedge between the Nordic and <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_region">Mediterranean</a> races, with the broad base resting in <a href="/en/topic/Asia">Asia</a> and the apex penetrating eastern <a href="/en/topic/France">France</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s9_5_2"><a href="#fn_s9_5_2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p9_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_6">80:9.6</a></small></sup>  For almost twenty thousand years the Andonites had been pushed farther and farther to the north of central Asia by the Andites. By 3000 B.C. increasing aridity was driving these Andonites back into <a href="/en/topic/Turkestan">Turkestan</a>. This Andonite push southward continued for over a thousand years and, splitting around <a href="/en/topic/Caspian_Sea">the Caspian</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Black_Sea">Black seas</a>, penetrated <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a> by way of both the <a href="/en/topic/Balkans">Balkans</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Ukraine">Ukraine</a>. This invasion included the remaining groups of <a href="/en/topic/Adamson">Adamson</a>’s descendants and, during the latter half of the invasion period, carried with it considerable numbers of the <a href="/en/topic/Iran">Iranian</a> Andites as well as many of the descendants of the Sethite priests.</p>
<p id="p9_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_7">80:9.7</a></small></sup>  By 2500 B.C. the westward thrust of the <a href="/en/topic/Andonites">Andonites</a> reached Europe. And this overrunning of all <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Asia_Minor">Asia Minor</a>, and the <a href="/en/topic/Danube">Danube</a> basin by the barbarians of the hills of Turkestan constituted the most serious and lasting of all cultural setbacks up to that time. These invaders definitely Andonized the character of the central European races, which have ever since remained characteristically Alpine.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a9_7_11"><a href="#fn_a9_7_11">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p9_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_8">80:9.8</a></small></sup>  3. <i>The southern <a href="/en/topic/white_race">white race</a>.</i> This brunet <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_region">Mediterranean</a> race consisted of a blend of the <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andite</a> and the blue man, with a smaller Andonite strain than in the north. This group also absorbed a considerable amount of secondary <a href="/en/topic/Sangiks">Sangik</a> blood through the <a href="/en/topic/Saharans">Saharans</a>. In later times this southern division of the white race was infused by strong Andite elements from the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p id="p9_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_9">80:9.9</a></small></sup>  The Mediterranean coastlands did not, however, become permeated by the Andites until the times of the great nomadic invasions of 2500 B.C. Land traffic and trade were nearly suspended during these centuries when the nomads invaded the eastern Mediterranean districts. This interference with land travel brought about the great expansion of sea traffic and trade; Mediterranean sea-borne <a href="/en/topic/commerce">commerce</a> was in full swing about forty-five hundred years ago. And this development of marine traffic resulted in the sudden expansion of the descendants of the Andites throughout the entire coastal territory of the Mediterranean basin.</p>
<p id="p9_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_10">80:9.10</a></small></sup>  These racial mixtures laid the foundations for the southern <a href="/en/topic/Europe">European</a> race, the most highly mixed of all. And since these days this race has undergone still further admixture, notably with the blue-yellow-Andite peoples of <a href="/en/topic/Arabia">Arabia</a>. This <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_region">Mediterranean</a> race is, in fact, so freely admixed with the surrounding peoples as to be virtually indiscernible as a separate type, but in general its members are short, long-headed, and brunet.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a9_10_3"><a href="#fn_a9_10_3">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p9_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_11">80:9.11</a></small></sup>  In the north the Andites, through warfare and marriage, obliterated the <a href="/en/topic/blue_race">blue men</a>, but in the south they survived in greater numbers. The <a href="/en/topic/Basques">Basques</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Berbers">Berbers</a> represent the survival of two branches of this race, but even these peoples have been thoroughly admixed with the <a href="/en/topic/Saharans">Saharans</a>.</p>

This was the time of the building of the circular and roofless sun temples. The European white races were energetic builders, delighting to set up great stones as tokens to the sun, much as did their later-day descendants at <a href="/en/topic/Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a>.
