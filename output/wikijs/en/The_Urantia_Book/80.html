<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p1_2">80:1.2</a></small></sup>  In the eastern trough of the Mediterranean the Nodites had established one of their most extensive cultures and from these centers had penetrated somewhat into southern Europe but more especially into northern <a href="/en/topic/Africa">Africa</a>. The <a href="/en/topic/broad-heads">broad-headed</a> Nodite-Andonite Syrians very early introduced <a href="/en/topic/pottery">pottery</a> and agriculture in connection with their settlements on the slowly rising <a href="/en/topic/Nile_valley">Nile</a> delta. They also imported <a href="/en/topic/sheep">sheep</a>, <a href="/en/topic/goats">goats</a>, <a href="/en/topic/cattle">cattle</a>, and other domesticated animals and brought in greatly improved methods of <a href="/en/topic/metalworking">metalworking</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Syria">Syria</a> then being the center of that industry.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p1_3">80:1.3</a></small></sup>  For more than thirty thousand years <a href="/en/topic/Egypt">Egypt</a> received a steady stream of Mesopotamians, who brought along their art and culture to enrich that of the Nile valley. But the ingress of large numbers of the <a href="/en/topic/Sahara">Sahara</a> peoples greatly deteriorated the early civilization along the Nile so that Egypt reached its lowest cultural level some fifteen thousand years ago.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p1_4">80:1.4</a></small></sup>  But during earlier times there was little to hinder the westward migration of the <a href="/en/topic/Adamites">Adamites</a>. The Sahara was an open grazing land overspread by herders and agriculturists. These <a href="/en/topic/Saharans">Saharans</a> never engaged in manufacture, nor were they city builders. They were an indigo-black group which carried extensive strains of the extinct <a href="/en/topic/green_race">green</a> and orange races. But they received a very limited amount of the violet inheritance before the upthrust of land and the <a href="/en/topic/climate">shifting water-laden winds</a> dispersed the remnants of this prosperous and peaceful <a href="/en/topic/civilization">civilization</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_4_7"><a href="#fn_a1_4_7">[4]</a></sup></p>

The mixed races of <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a> and the darker peoples of <a href="/en/topic/Africa">Africa</a> were not attractive to the Adamites. They would have mixed freely with the <a href="/en/topic/red_race">red man</a> had he not been far removed in the Americas, and they were kindly disposed toward the <a href="/en/topic/yellow_race">yellow man</a>, but he was likewise difficult of access in faraway <a href="/en/topic/Asia">Asia</a>. Therefore, when actuated by either adventure or altruism, or when driven out of the <a href="/en/topic/Euphrates_River">Euphrates</a> valley, they very naturally chose union with the blue races of <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_5_11"><a href="#fn_a1_5_11">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_5_14"><a href="#fn_a1_5_14">[6]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_5_1"><a href="#fn_s1_5_1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_5_3"><a href="#fn_s1_5_3">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p1_6">80:1.6</a></small></sup>  The blue men, then dominant in Europe, had no religious practices which were repulsive to the earlier migrating <a href="/en/topic/Adamites">Adamites</a>, and there was great sex attraction between the violet and the blue races. The best of the blue men deemed it a high honor to be permitted to mate with the Adamites. Every blue man entertained the ambition of becoming so skillful and artistic as to win the affection of some Adamite woman, and it was the highest aspiration of a <a href="/en/topic/superior_seraphim">superior</a> blue woman to receive the attentions of an Adamite.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_6_3"><a href="#fn_s1_6_3">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p2_1">80:2.1</a></small></sup>  The early expansion of the <a href="/en/topic/Adamites">violet race</a> into <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a> was cut short by certain rather sudden <a href="/en/topic/climate">climatic</a> and geologic changes. With the retreat of the northern ice fields the water-laden winds from the west shifted to the north, gradually turning the great open pasture regions of <a href="/en/topic/Sahara">Sahara</a> into a barren desert.

The more mixed groups spread out in three directions: The <a href="/en/topic/superior_seraphim">superior</a> tribes to the west migrated to <a href="/en/topic/Spain">Spain</a> and thence to adjacent parts of Europe, forming the nucleus of the later <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_region">Mediterranean</a> <a href="/en/topic/long-heads">long-headed</a> brunet races. The least progressive division to the east of the Sahara plateau migrated to <a href="/en/topic/Arabia">Arabia</a> and thence through northern <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a> to faraway <a href="/en/topic/Ceylon">Ceylon</a>. The central group moved north and east to the <a href="/en/topic/Nile_valley">Nile valley</a> and into <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p2_3">80:2.3</a></small></sup>  It is this secondary <a href="/en/topic/Sangiks">Sangik</a> substratum that suggests a certain degree of kinship among the modern peoples scattered from the <a href="/en/topic/Deccan">Deccan</a> through <a href="/en/topic/Iran">Iran</a>, Mesopotamia, and along both shores of the <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>.</p>

Presently the <a href="/en/topic/Sicilian_land_bridge">Sicilian land bridge</a> submerged, creating one sea of the Mediterranean and connecting it with the Atlantic Ocean.

<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p2_5">80:2.5</a></small></sup>  This engulfment of the Mediterranean basin immediately curtailed the westward movements of the <a href="/en/topic/Adamites">Adamites</a>, while the great influx of <a href="/en/topic/Saharans">Saharans</a> led them to seek outlets for their increasing numbers to the north and east of Eden. As the descendants of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> journeyed northward from the valleys of the <a href="/en/topic/Tigris_River">Tigris</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Euphrates_River">Euphrates</a>, they encountered mountainous barriers and the then expanded <a href="/en/topic/Caspian_Sea">Caspian Sea</a>. And for many generations the Adamites hunted, herded, and tilled the soil around their settlements scattered throughout <a href="/en/topic/Turkestan">Turkestan</a>. Slowly this magnificent people extended their territory into <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a>. But now the Adamites enter Europe from the east and find the culture of the blue man thousands of years behind that of <a href="/en/topic/Asia">Asia</a> since this region has been almost entirely out of touch with <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>.</p>

<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p3_2">80:3.2</a></small></sup>  While we speak of the blue man as pervading the European continent, there were scores of racial types. Even thirty-five thousand years ago the European blue races were already a highly blended people carrying strains of both <a href="/en/topic/red_race">red</a> and yellow, while on the <a href="/en/topic/Atlantic_Ocean">Atlantic</a> coastlands and in the regions of present-day <a href="/en/topic/Russia">Russia</a> they had absorbed a considerable amount of <a href="/en/topic/Andonites">Andonite</a> blood and to the south were in contact with the <a href="/en/topic/Saharans">Saharan peoples</a>.

<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p3_3">80:3.3</a></small></sup>  The European civilization of this early post-Adamic period was a unique blend of the vigor and art of the <a href="/en/topic/blue_race">blue men</a> with the creative imagination of the <a href="/en/topic/Adamites">Adamites</a>. The blue men were a race of great vigor, but they greatly deteriorated the cultural and spiritual status of the Adamites. It was very difficult for the latter to impress their religion upon the <a href="/en/topic/Cro-Magnons">Cro-Magnoids</a> because of the tendency of so many to cheat and to debauch the maidens. For ten thousand years religion in <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a> was at a low ebb as compared with the developments in <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Egypt">Egypt</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_3_1"><a href="#fn_s3_3_1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s3_3_2"><a href="#fn_s3_3_2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s3_3_3"><a href="#fn_s3_3_3">[4]</a></sup></p>

They maintained an efficient system of child culture. Both parents participated in these labors, and the services of the older children were fully utilized. Each child was carefully trained in the care of the caves, in art, and in <a href="/en/topic/flint">flint</a> making. At an early age the women were well versed in the domestic arts and in crude agriculture, while the men were skilled hunters and courageous warriors.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_5_3"><a href="#fn_s3_5_3">[4]</a></sup></p>

As the rain winds shifted to the north, the great open grazing lands of <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a> became covered by forests.

<p id="p3_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p3_9">80:3.9</a></small></sup>  These changes, while resulting in cultural advances, produced certain biologic retrogressions. During the previous hunting era the <a href="/en/topic/superior_seraphim">superior</a> tribes had intermarried with the higher types of war captives and had unvaryingly destroyed those whom they deemed inferior. But as they commenced to establish settlements and engage in agriculture and commerce, they began to save many of the mediocre captives as slaves. And it was the progeny of these slaves that subsequently so greatly deteriorated the whole <a href="/en/topic/Cro-Magnons">Cro-Magnon</a> type. This retrogression of culture continued until it received a fresh impetus from the east when the final and en masse invasion of the Mesopotamians swept over Europe, quickly absorbing the Cro-Magnon type and culture and initiating the civilization of the white races.</p>

<p id="p8_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p8_1">80:8.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andite</a> peoples of the <a href="/en/topic/Euphrates_River">Euphrates</a> valley migrated north to <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a> to mingle with the <a href="/en/topic/blue_race">blue men</a> and west into the Mediterranean regions to mix with the remnants of the commingled <a href="/en/topic/Saharans">Saharans</a> and the southern blue men. And these two branches of the white race were, and now are, widely separated by the <a href="/en/topic/broad-heads">broad-headed</a> mountain survivors of the earlier <a href="/en/topic/Andonites">Andonite</a> tribes which had long inhabited these central regions.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s8_1_1"><a href="#fn_s8_1_1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p8_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p8_2">80:8.2</a></small></sup>  These descendants of Andon were dispersed through most of the mountainous regions of central and southeastern Europe. They were often reinforced by arrivals from <a href="/en/topic/Asia_Minor">Asia Minor</a>, which region they occupied in considerable strength. The ancient <a href="/en/topic/Hittites">Hittites</a> stemmed directly from the Andonite stock; their pale skins and broad heads were typical of that race. This strain was carried in <a href="/en/topic/Abraham_the_Pharisee">Abraham</a>’s ancestry and contributed much to the characteristic facial appearance of his later Jewish descendants who, while having a culture and religion derived from the Andites, spoke a very different <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a>. Their tongue was distinctly Andonite.</p>
<p id="p8_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p8_3">80:8.3</a></small></sup>  The tribes that dwelt in houses erected on piles or log piers over the lakes of <a href="/en/topic/Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, and southern <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a> were the expanding fringes of the African, Aegean, and, more especially, the Danubian migrations.</p>
<p id="p8_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p8_4">80:8.4</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Danubians">Danubians</a> were <a href="/en/topic/Andonites">Andonites</a>, farmers and herders who had entered Europe through the Balkan peninsula and were moving slowly northward by way of the <a href="/en/topic/Danube">Danube</a> valley. They made <a href="/en/topic/pottery">pottery</a> and tilled the land, preferring to live in the valleys. The most northerly settlement of the Danubians was at <a href="/en/topic/Liege">Liege</a> in <a href="/en/topic/Belgium">Belgium</a>. These tribes deteriorated rapidly as they moved away from the center and source of their culture. The best pottery is the product of the earlier settlements.</p>
<p id="p8_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p8_5">80:8.5</a></small></sup>  The Danubians became mother worshipers as the result of the work of the missionaries from <a href="/en/topic/Crete">Crete</a>. These tribes later amalgamated with groups of Andonite sailors who came by <a href="/en/topic/boats">boats</a> from the coast of <a href="/en/topic/Asia_Minor">Asia Minor</a>, and who were also mother worshipers. Much of central <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a> was thus early settled by these mixed types of the broad-headed white races which practiced mother worship and the religious rite of <a href="/en/topic/cremation">cremating</a> the dead, for it was the custom of the mother cultists to burn their dead in stone huts.</p>
<h2 id="p9" class="toc-header"><a href="#p9" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 9. THE THREE WHITE RACES </h2>
<p id="p9_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_1">80:9.1</a></small></sup>  The racial blends in <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a> toward the close of the <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andite</a> migrations became generalized into the three white races as follows:<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s9_1_3"><a href="#fn_s9_1_3">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p9_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_2">80:9.2</a></small></sup>  1. <i>The northern white race.</i> This so-called <a href="/en/topic/Nordic_race">Nordic race</a> consisted primarily of the <a href="/en/topic/blue_race">blue man</a> plus the Andite but also contained a considerable amount of <a href="/en/topic/Andonites">Andonite</a> blood, together with smaller amounts of the <a href="/en/topic/red_race">red</a> and yellow <a href="/en/topic/Sangiks">Sangik</a>. The northern white race thus encompassed these four most desirable human stocks. But the largest inheritance was from the blue man. The typical early Nordic was <a href="/en/topic/long-heads">long-headed</a>, tall, and blond. But long ago this race became thoroughly mixed with all of the branches of the white peoples.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a9_2_22"><a href="#fn_a9_2_22">[22]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s9_2_1"><a href="#fn_s9_2_1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p9_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_3">80:9.3</a></small></sup>  The primitive culture of <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a>, which was encountered by the invading Nordics, was that of the retrograding <a href="/en/topic/Danubians">Danubians</a> blended with the blue man. The Nordic-Danish and the Danubian-Andonite cultures met and mingled on the <a href="/en/topic/Rhine_River">Rhine</a> as is witnessed by the existence of two racial groups in <a href="/en/topic/Germany">Germany</a> today.</p>
<p id="p9_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_4">80:9.4</a></small></sup>  The Nordics continued the trade in <a href="/en/topic/amber">amber</a> from the <a href="/en/topic/Baltic">Baltic</a> coast, building up a great <a href="/en/topic/commerce">commerce</a> with the <a href="/en/topic/broad-heads">broadheads</a> of the <a href="/en/topic/Danube">Danube</a> valley via the <a href="/en/topic/Brenner_Pass">Brenner Pass</a>. This extended contact with the Danubians led these northerners into mother worship, and for several thousands of years <a href="/en/topic/cremation">cremation</a> of the dead was almost universal throughout Scandinavia. This explains why remains of the earlier white races, although buried all over Europe, are not to be found—only their ashes in stone and clay urns. These white men also built dwellings; they never lived in <a href="/en/topic/caves">caves</a>. And again this explains why there are so few evidences of the white man’s early culture, although the preceding <a href="/en/topic/Cro-Magnons">Cro-Magnon</a> type is well preserved where it has been securely sealed up in caves and grottoes. As it were, one day in northern Europe there is a primitive culture of the retrogressing Danubians and the blue man and the next that of a suddenly appearing and vastly <a href="/en/topic/superior_seraphim">superior</a> white man.</p>
<p id="p9_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_5">80:9.5</a></small></sup>  2. <i>The central white race.</i> While this group includes strains of <a href="/en/topic/blue_race">blue</a>, yellow, and <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andite</a>, it is predominantly <a href="/en/topic/Andonites">Andonite</a>. These people are broad-headed, swarthy, and stocky. They are driven like a wedge between the Nordic and <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_region">Mediterranean</a> races, with the broad base resting in <a href="/en/topic/Asia">Asia</a> and the apex penetrating eastern <a href="/en/topic/France">France</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s9_5_2"><a href="#fn_s9_5_2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p9_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_6">80:9.6</a></small></sup>  For almost twenty thousand years the Andonites had been pushed farther and farther to the north of central Asia by the Andites. By 3000 B.C. increasing aridity was driving these Andonites back into <a href="/en/topic/Turkestan">Turkestan</a>. This Andonite push southward continued for over a thousand years and, splitting around <a href="/en/topic/Caspian_Sea">the Caspian</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Black_Sea">Black seas</a>, penetrated <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a> by way of both the <a href="/en/topic/Balkans">Balkans</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Ukraine">Ukraine</a>. This invasion included the remaining groups of <a href="/en/topic/Adamson">Adamson</a>’s descendants and, during the latter half of the invasion period, carried with it considerable numbers of the <a href="/en/topic/Iran">Iranian</a> Andites as well as many of the descendants of the Sethite priests.</p>
<p id="p9_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_7">80:9.7</a></small></sup>  By 2500 B.C. the westward thrust of the <a href="/en/topic/Andonites">Andonites</a> reached Europe. And this overrunning of all <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Asia_Minor">Asia Minor</a>, and the <a href="/en/topic/Danube">Danube</a> basin by the barbarians of the hills of Turkestan constituted the most serious and lasting of all cultural setbacks up to that time. These invaders definitely Andonized the character of the central European races, which have ever since remained characteristically Alpine.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a9_7_11"><a href="#fn_a9_7_11">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p9_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_8">80:9.8</a></small></sup>  3. <i>The southern <a href="/en/topic/white_race">white race</a>.</i> This brunet <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_region">Mediterranean</a> race consisted of a blend of the <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andite</a> and the blue man, with a smaller Andonite strain than in the north. This group also absorbed a considerable amount of secondary <a href="/en/topic/Sangiks">Sangik</a> blood through the <a href="/en/topic/Saharans">Saharans</a>. In later times this southern division of the white race was infused by strong Andite elements from the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p id="p9_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_9">80:9.9</a></small></sup>  The Mediterranean coastlands did not, however, become permeated by the Andites until the times of the great nomadic invasions of 2500 B.C. Land traffic and trade were nearly suspended during these centuries when the nomads invaded the eastern Mediterranean districts. This interference with land travel brought about the great expansion of sea traffic and trade; Mediterranean sea-borne <a href="/en/topic/commerce">commerce</a> was in full swing about forty-five hundred years ago. And this development of marine traffic resulted in the sudden expansion of the descendants of the Andites throughout the entire coastal territory of the Mediterranean basin.</p>
<p id="p9_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_10">80:9.10</a></small></sup>  These racial mixtures laid the foundations for the southern <a href="/en/topic/Europe">European</a> race, the most highly mixed of all. And since these days this race has undergone still further admixture, notably with the blue-yellow-Andite peoples of <a href="/en/topic/Arabia">Arabia</a>. This <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_region">Mediterranean</a> race is, in fact, so freely admixed with the surrounding peoples as to be virtually indiscernible as a separate type, but in general its members are short, long-headed, and brunet.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a9_10_3"><a href="#fn_a9_10_3">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p9_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_11">80:9.11</a></small></sup>  In the north the Andites, through warfare and marriage, obliterated the <a href="/en/topic/blue_race">blue men</a>, but in the south they survived in greater numbers. The <a href="/en/topic/Basques">Basques</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Berbers">Berbers</a> represent the survival of two branches of this race, but even these peoples have been thoroughly admixed with the <a href="/en/topic/Saharans">Saharans</a>.</p>
<p id="p9_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_12">80:9.12</a></small></sup>  This was the picture of race mixture presented in central <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a> about 3000 B.C.

<p id="p9_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_13">80:9.13</a></small></sup>  These were the times of the <a href="/en/topic/New_Stone_Age">New Stone Age</a> overlapping the oncoming <a href="/en/topic/Bronze_Age">Bronze Age</a>. In Scandinavia it was the Bronze Age associated with mother worship. In southern <a href="/en/topic/France">France</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Spain">Spain</a> it was the New <a href="/en/topic/Stone_Age_(Old)">Stone Age</a> associated with <a href="/en/topic/sun_(Urantias)">sun</a> worship. This was the time of the building of the circular and roofless sun temples. The European white races were energetic builders, delighting to set up great stones as tokens to the sun, much as did their later-day descendants at <a href="/en/topic/Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a>. The vogue of sun worship indicates that this was a great period of agriculture in southern Europe.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a9_13_5"><a href="#fn_a9_13_5">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p9_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_14">80:9.14</a></small></sup>  The superstitions of this comparatively recent sun-worshiping era even now persist in the folkways of <a href="/en/topic/Brittany">Brittany</a>. Although Christianized for over fifteen hundred years, these <a href="/en/topic/Bretons">Bretons</a> still retain charms of the New Stone Age for warding off the <a href="/en/topic/evil_eye">evil eye</a>.

At one time there was a fairly well-defined division of the <a href="/en/topic/white_race">white race</a> into such classes, but widespread intermingling has since occurred, and it is no longer possible to identify these distinctions with any clarity.
