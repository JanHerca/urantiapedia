<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_1">70:1.1</a></small></sup>  War is the natural state and heritage of evolving man; <a href="/en/topic/peace">peace</a> is the social yardstick measuring <a href="/en/topic/civilization">civilization</a>’s advancement. Before the partial socialization of the advancing races man was exceedingly individualistic, extremely suspicious, and unbelievably quarrelsome. <a href="/en/topic/violence">Violence</a> is the law of <a href="/en/topic/nature">nature</a>, hostility the automatic reaction of the children of nature, while <a href="/en/topic/war">war</a> is but these same activities carried on collectively. And wherever and whenever the fabric of <a href="/en/topic/modern_civilization">civilization</a> becomes stressed by the complications of society’s advancement, there is always an immediate and ruinous reversion to these early methods of violent adjustment of the irritations of human interassociations.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_1_0"><a href="#fn_a1_1_0">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_1_27"><a href="#fn_a1_1_27">[2]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_1_3"><a href="#fn_s1_1_3">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_1_4"><a href="#fn_s1_1_4">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_1_1"><a href="#fn_s1_1_1">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_1_8"><a href="#fn_s1_1_8">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_1_11"><a href="#fn_s1_1_11">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_1_12"><a href="#fn_s1_1_12">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_2">70:1.2</a></small></sup>  War is an animalistic reaction to misunderstandings and irritations; peace attends upon the civilized solution of all such problems and difficulties. The <a href="/en/topic/Sangiks">Sangik</a> <a href="/en/topic/races">races</a>, together with the later deteriorated <a href="/en/topic/Adamites">Adamites</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Nodites">Nodites</a>, were all belligerent. The <a href="/en/topic/Andonites">Andonites</a> were early taught the <a href="/en/topic/golden_rule">golden rule</a>, and, even today, their <a href="/en/topic/Eskimos">Eskimo</a> descendants live very much by that code; custom is strong among them, and they are fairly free from violent antagonisms.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_1"><a href="#fn_a1_2_1">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_2_21"><a href="#fn_a1_2_21">[4]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_2_8"><a href="#fn_s1_2_8">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_2_12"><a href="#fn_s1_2_12">[6]</a></sup></p>

The later Andonites used to settle disputes by holding a public show at which the disputants made fun of and ridiculed each other, while the audience decided the winner by its applause.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_4">70:1.4</a></small></sup>  But there could be no such phenomenon as <a href="/en/topic/war">war</a> until society had evolved sufficiently far to actually experience periods of peace and to sanction warlike practices. The very concept of war implies some degree of organization.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_4_12"><a href="#fn_a1_4_12">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_5">70:1.5</a></small></sup>  With the emergence of social groupings, individual irritations began to be submerged in the group feelings, and this promoted intratribal tranquillity but at the expense of intertribal peace. Peace was thus first enjoyed by the in-group, or tribe, who always disliked and hated the out-group, <a href="/en/topic/strangers">foreigners</a>. Early man regarded it a virtue to shed alien blood.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_5_28"><a href="#fn_a1_5_28">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_6">70:1.6</a></small></sup>  But even this did not work at first. When the early chiefs would try to iron out misunderstandings, they often found it necessary, at least once a year, to permit the tribal <a href="/en/topic/stone">stone</a> fights. The clan would divide up into two groups and engage in an all-day battle. And this for no other reason than just the fun of it; they really enjoyed <a href="/en/topic/fighting">fighting</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_6_3"><a href="#fn_s1_6_3">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_6_4"><a href="#fn_s1_6_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_7">70:1.7</a></small></sup>  Warfare persists because man is human, evolved from an animal, and all <a href="/en/topic/animals">animals</a> are bellicose. Among the early causes of <a href="/en/topic/war">war</a> were:<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_7_1"><a href="#fn_a1_7_1">[3]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_7_3"><a href="#fn_s1_7_3">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_7_4"><a href="#fn_s1_7_4">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_7_0"><a href="#fn_s1_7_0">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_8">70:1.8</a></small></sup>  1. <i><a href="/en/topic/hunger">Hunger</a>,</i> which led to food raids. Scarcity of <a href="/en/topic/land">land</a> has always brought on war, and during these struggles the early peace tribes were practically exterminated.</p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_9">70:1.9</a></small></sup>  2. <i><a href="/en/topic/women">Woman</a> scarcity—</i>an attempt to relieve a shortage of domestic help. Woman stealing has always caused <a href="/en/topic/war">war</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_10">70:1.10</a></small></sup>  3. <i>Vanity—</i>the desire to exhibit tribal prowess. Superior groups would fight to impose their mode of life upon inferior peoples.</p>
<p id="p1_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_11">70:1.11</a></small></sup>  4. <i>Slaves—</i>need of recruits for the labor ranks.</p>
<p id="p1_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_12">70:1.12</a></small></sup>  5. <i><a href="/en/topic/revenge">Revenge</a></i> was the motive for <a href="/en/topic/war">war</a> when one tribe believed that a neighboring tribe had caused the death of a fellow tribesman. Mourning was continued until a head was brought home. The war for vengeance was in good standing right on down to comparatively modern times.</p>
<p id="p1_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_13">70:1.13</a></small></sup>  6. <i>Recreation—</i>war was looked upon as <a href="/en/topic/recreation">recreation</a> by the young men of these early times. If no good and sufficient pretext for war arose, when peace became oppressive, neighboring tribes were accustomed to go out in semifriendly combat to engage in a foray as a holiday, to enjoy a sham battle.</p>
<p id="p1_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_14">70:1.14</a></small></sup>  7. <i>Religion—</i>the desire to make converts to the cult. The primitive religions all sanctioned <a href="/en/topic/war">war</a>. Only in recent times has <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> begun to frown upon war. The early priesthoods were, unfortunately, usually allied with the military power. One of the great peace moves of the ages has been the attempt to separate <a href="/en/topic/churches">church</a> and state.</p>
<p id="p1_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_15">70:1.15</a></small></sup>  Always these olden tribes made war at the bidding of their gods, at the behest of their chiefs or medicine men. The <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a> believed in such a “<a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> of battles”; and the <a href="/en/topic/Urantia_Papers">narrative</a> of their raid on the <a href="/en/topic/Midianites">Midianites</a> is a typical recital of the atrocious cruelty of the ancient tribal wars; this assault, with its slaughter of all the males and the later killing of all male children and all women who were not virgins, would have done honor to the mores of a tribal chieftain of two hundred thousand years ago<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>. And all this was executed in the “name of the <a href="/en/topic/Lord_God_of_Israel">Lord God of Israel</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p1_16"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_16">70:1.16</a></small></sup>  This is a narrative of the evolution of society—the natural outworking of the problems of the races—man working out his own <a href="/en/topic/destiny">destiny</a> on earth. Such atrocities are not instigated by <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>, notwithstanding the tendency of man to place the responsibility on his gods.</p>
<p id="p1_17"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_17">70:1.17</a></small></sup>  Military mercy has been slow in coming to mankind. Even when a woman, <a href="/en/topic/Deborah">Deborah</a>, ruled the <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a>, the same wholesale cruelty persisted. Her general in his victory over the gentiles caused “all the host to fall upon the sword; there was not one left<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p1_18"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_18">70:1.18</a></small></sup>  Very early in the history of the race, poisoned weapons were used. All sorts of mutilations were practiced. <a href="/en/topic/Saul_(king)">Saul</a> did not hesitate to require one hundred Philistine <a href="/en/topic/foreskins">foreskins</a> as the dowry <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a> should pay for his daughter <a href="/en/topic/Michal">Michal</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p1_19"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_19">70:1.19</a></small></sup>  Early wars were fought between tribes as a whole, but in later times, when two individuals in different tribes had a dispute, instead of both tribes fighting, the two disputants engaged in a <a href="/en/topic/dueling">duel</a>. It also became a custom for two armies to stake all on the outcome of a contest between a representative chosen from each side, as in the instance of David and <a href="/en/topic/Goliath">Goliath</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_19_3"><a href="#fn_s1_19_3">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_19_4"><a href="#fn_s1_19_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_20"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_20">70:1.20</a></small></sup>  The first refinement of <a href="/en/topic/war">war</a> was the taking of <a href="/en/topic/prisoners">prisoners</a>. Next, <a href="/en/topic/women">women</a> were exempted from hostilities, and then came the recognition of noncombatants. Military castes and standing armies soon developed to keep pace with the increasing complexity of combat. Such warriors were early prohibited from associating with <a href="/en/topic/mothers">women</a>, and women long ago ceased to fight, though they have always fed and nursed the soldiers and urged them on to battle.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_20_4"><a href="#fn_s1_20_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_21"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_21">70:1.21</a></small></sup>  The practice of declaring war represented great progress. Such declarations of intention to fight betokened the arrival of a sense of fairness, and this was followed by the gradual development of the rules of “civilized” warfare. Very early it became the custom not to fight near religious sites and, still later, not to fight on certain holy days. Next came the general recognition of the right of asylum; political fugitives received protection.</p>
<p id="p1_22"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p1_22">70:1.22</a></small></sup>  Thus did <a href="/en/topic/war">warfare</a> gradually evolve from the primitive man hunt to the somewhat more orderly system of the later-day “civilized” nations. But only slowly does the social attitude of amity displace that of enmity.</p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p2_1">70:2.1</a></small></sup>  In past ages a fierce <a href="/en/topic/war">war</a> would institute social changes and facilitate the adoption of new ideas such as would not have occurred naturally in ten thousand years. The terrible price paid for these certain war advantages was that society was temporarily thrown back into savagery; civilized reason had to abdicate. War is strong medicine, very costly and most dangerous; while often curative of certain social disorders, it sometimes kills the patient, destroys the society.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_3"><a href="#fn_s2_1_3">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_1_1"><a href="#fn_s2_1_1">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_1_12"><a href="#fn_s2_1_12">[6]</a></sup></p>

Olden wars promoted <a href="/en/topic/travel">travel</a> and cultural intercourse; these ends are now better served by modern methods of transport and communication.

Wisdom and experience were early appreciated even by barbaric man, and there ensued a long age of the domination of the elders. This reign of the oligarchy of age gradually grew into the patriarchal idea.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_2_6"><a href="#fn_a5_2_6">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_2_13"><a href="#fn_a5_2_13">[13]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s5_2_4"><a href="#fn_s5_2_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p5_3">70:5.3</a></small></sup>  In the early council of the elders there resided the potential of all governmental functions: executive, legislative, and judicial. When the council interpreted the current mores, it was a court; when establishing new modes of social usage, it was a legislature; to the extent that such decrees and enactments were enforced, it was the executive. The chairman of the council was one of the forerunners of the later tribal chief.</p>

The primitive “<a href="/en/topic/palavers">palavers</a>” were seldom useful. The race early learned that an army commanded by a group of clan heads had no chance against a strong one-man army.

<p id="p5_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p5_6">70:5.6</a></small></sup>  At first the war chiefs were chosen only for military service, and they would relinquish some of their authority during peacetimes, when their duties were of a more social nature. But gradually they began to encroach upon the peace intervals, tending to continue to rule from one war on through to the next.

<p id="p5_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p5_7">70:5.7</a></small></sup>  In later times some chiefs were chosen for other than military service, being selected because of unusual physique or outstanding personal abilities.

The family had a biologic head; the clan, a selected natural leader; the tribe and later state had no natural leader, and this was an additional reason for making the chief-kings hereditary. The idea of royal families and aristocracy was also based on the mores of “<a href="/en/topic/names">name</a> ownership” in the clans.</p>
<p id="p6_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p6_4">70:6.4</a></small></sup>  The succession of <a href="/en/topic/kings">kings</a> was eventually regarded as supernatural, the royal <a href="/en/topic/blood">blood</a> being thought to extend back to the times of the materialized <a href="/en/topic/corporeal_staffs_of_Planetary_Princes">staff</a> of Prince <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia">Caligastia</a>. Thus kings became <a href="/en/topic/fetishes">fetish</a> personalities and were inordinately feared, a special form of speech being adopted for court usage.

<p id="p6_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p6_5">70:6.5</a></small></sup>  The early fetish king was often kept in seclusion; he was regarded as too sacred to be viewed except on feast days and holy days. Ordinarily a representative was chosen to impersonate him, and this is the origin of prime ministers. The first cabinet officer was a food administrator; others shortly followed. Rulers soon appointed representatives to be in charge of commerce and religion; and the development of a cabinet was a direct step toward depersonalization of executive authority. These assistants of the early kings became the accepted <a href="/en/topic/aristocracy">nobility</a>, and the king’s wife gradually rose to the dignity of queen as women came to be held in higher esteem.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s6_5_4"><a href="#fn_s6_5_4">[2]</a></sup></p>

These first appeared as <a href="/en/topic/secret_societies">secret societies</a> and originally were wholly religious; subsequently they became regulative. At first they were men’s clubs; later women’s groups appeared. Presently they became divided into two classes: sociopolitical and religio-mystical.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a7_1_15"><a href="#fn_a7_1_15">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p7_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p7_2">70:7.2</a></small></sup>  There were many reasons for the <a href="/en/topic/secrecy">secrecy</a> of these societies, such as:</p>
<p id="p7_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p7_3">70:7.3</a></small></sup>  1. Fear of incurring the displeasure of the rulers because of the violation of some taboo.</p>

<p id="p7_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p7_5">70:7.5</a></small></sup>  3. For the purpose of preserving valuable “spirit” or trade secrets.</p>
<p id="p7_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p7_6">70:7.6</a></small></sup>  4. For the enjoyment of some special charm or magic.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a7_6_8"><a href="#fn_a7_6_8">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p7_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p7_7">70:7.7</a></small></sup>  The very <a href="/en/topic/secrecy">secrecy</a> of these societies conferred on all members the power of mystery over the rest of the tribe. Secrecy also appeals to <a href="/en/topic/vanity">vanity</a>; the initiates were the social aristocracy of their day. After initiation the boys hunted with the men; whereas before they had gathered vegetables with the women. And it was the supreme <a href="/en/topic/humiliation">humiliation</a>, a tribal disgrace, to fail to pass the <a href="/en/topic/puberty">puberty</a> tests and thus be compelled to remain outside the men’s abode with the women and children, to be considered effeminate. Besides, noninitiates were not allowed to marry.</p>
<p id="p7_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p7_8">70:7.8</a></small></sup>  Primitive people very early taught their adolescent youths <a href="/en/topic/sex">sex</a> control. It became the custom to take boys away from parents from puberty to marriage, their education and training being intrusted to the men’s <a href="/en/topic/secret_societies">secret societies</a>. And one of the chief functions of these clubs was to keep control of adolescent young men, thus preventing <a href="/en/topic/illegitimacy">illegitimate</a> children.</p>
<p id="p7_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p7_9">70:7.9</a></small></sup>  Commercialized <a href="/en/topic/prostitution">prostitution</a> began when these men’s clubs paid money for the use of women from other tribes. But the earlier groups were remarkably free from sex laxity.</p>
<p id="p7_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p7_10">70:7.10</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/puberty">puberty</a> initiation ceremony usually extended over a period of five years. Much <a href="/en/topic/self-torture">self-torture</a> and painful cutting entered into these ceremonies. <a href="/en/topic/circumcision">Circumcision</a> was first practiced as a rite of initiation into one of these secret fraternities. The tribal marks were cut on the body as a part of the puberty initiation; the <a href="/en/topic/tattoo">tattoo</a> originated as such a badge of membership. Such <a href="/en/topic/torture">torture</a>, together with much privation, was designed to harden these youths, to impress them with the reality of life and its inevitable hardships. This purpose is better accomplished by the later appearing <a href="/en/topic/sports">athletic games</a> and physical contests.</p>
<p id="p7_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p7_11">70:7.11</a></small></sup>  But the <a href="/en/topic/secret_societies">secret societies</a> did aim at the improvement of adolescent morals; one of the chief purposes of the puberty ceremonies was to impress upon the boy that he must leave other men’s wives alone.</p>
<p id="p7_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p7_12">70:7.12</a></small></sup>  Following these years of rigorous discipline and training and just before marriage, the young men were usually released for a short period of leisure and freedom, after which they returned to marry and to submit to lifelong subjection to the tribal taboos. And this ancient custom has continued down to modern times as the foolish notion of “<a href="/en/topic/sowing">sowing</a> wild <a href="/en/topic/oats">oats</a>.”</p>
<p id="p7_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p7_13">70:7.13</a></small></sup>  Many later tribes sanctioned the formation of <a href="/en/topic/women">women</a>’s secret clubs, the purpose of which was to prepare adolescent girls for wifehood and motherhood. After initiation girls were eligible for marriage and were permitted to attend the “<a href="/en/topic/brides">bride</a> show,” the coming-out party of those days. Women’s orders pledged against marriage early came into existence.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a7_13_13"><a href="#fn_a7_13_13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p7_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p7_14">70:7.14</a></small></sup>  Presently nonsecret clubs made their appearance when groups of unmarried men and groups of unattached women formed their separate organizations. These associations were really <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> schools. And while men’s and women’s clubs were often given to persecuting each other, some advanced tribes, after contact with the <a href="/en/topic/Dalamatia">Dalamatia</a> teachers, experimented with coeducation, having boarding schools for both sexes.</p>
<p id="p7_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p7_15">70:7.15</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/secret_societies">Secret societies</a> contributed to the building up of social castes chiefly by the mysterious character of their initiations. The members of these societies first wore <a href="/en/topic/masks">masks</a> to frighten the curious away from their mourning rites—<a href="/en/topic/ancestor_worship">ancestor worship</a>. Later this ritual developed into a pseudo <a href="/en/topic/seances">seance</a> at which ghosts were reputed to have appeared. The ancient societies of the “new birth” used signs and employed a special secret <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a>; they also forswore certain foods and drinks. They acted as <a href="/en/topic/night_police">night police</a> and otherwise functioned in a wide range of social activities.</p>
<p id="p7_16"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p7_16">70:7.16</a></small></sup>  All <a href="/en/topic/secrecy">secret</a> associations imposed an <a href="/en/topic/oaths">oath</a>, enjoined confidence, and taught the keeping of secrets. These orders awed and controlled the mobs; they also acted as vigilance societies, thus practicing <a href="/en/topic/lynch_law">lynch law</a>. They were <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> <a href="/en/topic/spies">spies</a> when the tribes were at war and the first secret police during times of peace.

<p id="p7_17"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p7_17">70:7.17</a></small></sup>  These societies gave rise to the first political parties. The first party <a href="/en/topic/government">government</a> was “the strong” <i>vs.</i> “the weak.” In ancient times a change of administration only followed civil <a href="/en/topic/war">war</a>, abundant proof that the weak had become strong.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s7_17_3"><a href="#fn_s7_17_3">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p7_18"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p7_18">70:7.18</a></small></sup>  These clubs were employed by merchants to collect debts and by rulers to <a href="/en/topic/tax_collectors">collect taxes</a>. Taxation has been a long struggle, one of the earliest forms being the <a href="/en/topic/tithing">tithe</a>, one tenth of the hunt or spoils. Taxes were originally levied to keep up the king’s house, but it was found that they were easier to collect when disguised as an offering for the support of the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> service.</p>
<p id="p7_19"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p7_19">70:7.19</a></small></sup>  By and by these <a href="/en/topic/secret_societies">secret associations</a> grew into <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> charitable organizations and later evolved into the earlier religious societies—the forerunners of <a href="/en/topic/churches">churches</a>.

<p id="p12_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p12_1">70:12.1</a></small></sup>  The great struggle in the evolution of <a href="/en/topic/government">government</a> has concerned the concentration of power. The universe administrators have learned from experience that the evolutionary peoples on the inhabited <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_worlds">worlds</a> are best regulated by the representative type of civil government when there is maintained proper balance of power between the well-co-ordinated executive, legislative, and judicial branches.</p>
<p id="p12_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p12_2">70:12.2</a></small></sup>  While primitive authority was based on <a href="/en/topic/might">strength</a>, physical <a href="/en/topic/power">power</a>, the ideal government is the representative system wherein leadership is based on ability, but in the days of barbarism there was entirely too much war to permit representative government to function effectively. In the long struggle between division of authority and unity of command, the <a href="/en/topic/dictators">dictator</a> won. The early and diffuse powers of the primitive <a href="/en/topic/council_of_elders">council of elders</a> were gradually concentrated in the person of the absolute monarch. After the arrival of real kings the groups of elders persisted as quasi-legislative-judicial advisory bodies; later on, <a href="/en/topic/legislatures">legislatures</a> of co-ordinate status made their appearance, and eventually supreme courts of adjudication were established separate from the legislatures.</p>
<p id="p12_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p12_3">70:12.3</a></small></sup>  The king was the executor of the mores, the original or unwritten law. Later he enforced the legislative enactments, the crystallization of <a href="/en/topic/public_opinion">public opinion</a>. A popular assembly as an expression of public opinion, though slow in appearing, marked a great social advance.</p>
<p id="p12_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p12_4">70:12.4</a></small></sup>  The early <a href="/en/topic/kings">kings</a> were greatly restricted by the mores—by tradition or public opinion.

And having done this, they should select their most competent and worthy fellows as chief executives.
