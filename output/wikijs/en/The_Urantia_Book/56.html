There are force, <a href="/en/topic/energy">energy</a>, and power, but they are all one in origin. The seven <a href="/en/topic/superuniverses">superuniverses</a> are seemingly dual; the central <a href="/en/topic/universe">universe</a>, triune; but <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> is of single constitution. And Paradise is the actual source of all material universes—past, present, and future. But this cosmic derivation is an <i>eternity</i> event; at no <i>time—</i>past, present, or future—does either space or the material cosmos come forth from the nuclear Isle of Light. As the cosmic source, Paradise functions prior to space and before time; hence would its derivations seem to be orphaned in time and space did they not emerge through the <a href="/en/topic/Unqualified_Absolute">Unqualified Absolute</a>, their ultimate repository in space and their revealer and regulator in time.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_1_5"><a href="#fn_s1_1_5">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_1_38"><a href="#fn_s1_1_38">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_1_51"><a href="#fn_s1_1_51">[8]</a></sup></p>
