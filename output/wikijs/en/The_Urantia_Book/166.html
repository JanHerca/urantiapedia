<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p0_1">166:0.1</a></small></sup>  FROM February 11 to 20, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the twelve made a tour of all the cities and villages of northern <a href="/en/topic/Perea">Perea</a> where the associates of <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a> and the members of the women’s corps were working. They found these <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> of the gospel meeting with success, and Jesus repeatedly called the attention of his apostles to the fact that the gospel of the kingdom could spread without the accompaniment of <a href="/en/topic/miracles">miracles</a> and wonders.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p0_2">166:0.2</a></small></sup>  This entire mission of three months in Perea was successfully carried on with little help from the twelve apostles, and the <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> from this time on reflected, not so much Jesus’ personality, as his <i>teachings.</i> But his followers did not long follow his instructions, for soon after Jesus’ death and resurrection they departed from his teachings and began to build the early church around the miraculous concepts and the glorified memories of his divine-human personality.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. THE PHARISEES AT RAGABA </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p1_1">166:1.1</a></small></sup>  On <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a>, February 18, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was at <a href="/en/topic/Ragaba">Ragaba</a>, where there lived a wealthy Pharisee named <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a>; and since quite a number of his fellow <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> were following Jesus and the twelve around the country, he made a breakfast on this Sabbath morning for all of them, about twenty in number, and invited Jesus as the guest of honor<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_1_0"><a href="#fn_a1_1_0">[1]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_1_3"><a href="#fn_s1_1_3">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p1_2">166:1.2</a></small></sup>  By the time Jesus arrived at this breakfast, most of the Pharisees, with two or three lawyers, were already there and seated at the table. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> immediately took his seat at the left of Nathaniel without going to the water basins to wash his <a href="/en/topic/hands">hands</a>. Many of the Pharisees, especially those favorable to Jesus’ teachings, knew that he washed his hands only for purposes of cleanliness, that he abhorred these purely <a href="/en/topic/ceremonies">ceremonial</a> performances; so they were not surprised at his coming directly to the table without having twice washed his hands. But Nathaniel was shocked by this failure of the Master to comply with the strict requirements of Pharisaic practice. Neither did Jesus wash his hands, as did the Pharisees, after each course of food nor at the end of the meal<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_0"><a href="#fn_a1_2_0">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p1_3">166:1.3</a></small></sup>  After considerable whispering between <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a> and an unfriendly Pharisee on his right and after much lifting of eyebrows and sneering curling of lips by those who sat opposite the Master, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> finally said: “I had thought that you invited me to this house to break bread with you and perchance to inquire of me concerning the proclamation of the new gospel of the kingdom of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>; but I perceive that you have brought me here to witness an exhibition of ceremonial devotion to your own self-righteousness.

And since no one spoke, Jesus continued: “Many of you <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> are here with me as friends, some are even my disciples, but the majority of the Pharisees are persistent in their refusal to see the light and acknowledge the truth, even when the work of the gospel is brought before them in great power. How carefully you cleanse the outside of the cups and the platters while the spiritual-food vessels are filthy and polluted! You make sure to present a pious and holy appearance to the people, but your inner souls are filled with self-righteousness, <a href="/en/topic/envy">covetousness</a>, extortion, and all manner of spiritual wickedness<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>.

Think not that the <a href="/en/topic/charity">giving of alms</a> and the paying of tithes will cleanse you from unrighteousness and enable you to stand clean in the presence of the Judge of all men<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>. Woe upon you Pharisees who have persisted in rejecting the light of life! You are meticulous in <a href="/en/topic/tithing">tithing</a> and ostentatious in almsgiving, but you knowingly spurn the visitation of God and reject the revelation of his love. Though it is all right for you to give attention to these minor duties, you should not have left these weightier requirements undone. Woe upon all who shun justice, spurn mercy, and reject truth! Woe upon all those who despise the revelation of the Father while they seek the chief seats in the <a href="/en/topic/synagogues">synagogue</a> and crave flattering salutations in the <a href="/en/topic/market_places">market places</a>!”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_4_0"><a href="#fn_a1_4_0">[1]</a></sup></p>

Is there nothing good in the scribes, the Pharisees, or the lawyers?” And Jesus, standing, replied to the lawyer: “You, like the Pharisees, delight in <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> places at the feasts and in wearing long <a href="/en/topic/robes">robes</a> while you put heavy burdens, grievous to be borne, on men’s shoulders. And when the souls of men stagger under these heavy burdens, you will not so much as lift with one of your fingers. Woe upon you who take your greatest delight in building <a href="/en/topic/tombs">tombs</a> for the <a href="/en/topic/prophets">prophets</a> your fathers killed! And that you consent to what your fathers did is made manifest when you now plan to kill those who come in this day doing what the prophets did in their day—proclaiming the righteousness of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and revealing the mercy of the heavenly Father<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b9"><a href="#fn_b9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup>. But of all the generations that are past, the blood of the prophets and the apostles shall be required of this perverse and self-righteous generation.

And of the <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> who heard these words, some became believers in his teaching and entered into the kingdom, but the larger number persisted in the way of darkness, becoming all the more determined to lie in wait for him that they might catch some of his words which could be used to bring him to trial and judgment before the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b13"><a href="#fn_b13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p1_7">166:1.7</a></small></sup>  There were just three things to which the Pharisees paid particular attention:</p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p1_8">166:1.8</a></small></sup>  1. The practice of strict tithing.</p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p2_1">166:2.1</a></small></sup>  The next day <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> went with the twelve over to <a href="/en/topic/Amathus">Amathus</a>, near the border of <a href="/en/topic/Samaria">Samaria</a>, and as they approached the city, they encountered a group of ten <a href="/en/topic/lepers">lepers</a> who sojourned near this place. Nine of this group were <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>, one a Samaritan. Ordinarily these <a href="/en/topic/Jews_(ancient_Hebrews)">Jews</a> would have refrained from all association or contact with this Samaritan, but their common affliction was more than enough to overcome all religious prejudice. They had heard much of Jesus and his earlier miracles of healing, and since the seventy made a practice of announcing the time of Jesus’ expected arrival when the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> was out with the twelve on these tours, the ten lepers had been made aware that he was expected to appear in this vicinity at about this time; and they were, accordingly, posted here on the outskirts of the city where they hoped to attract his attention and ask for healing. When the lepers saw Jesus drawing near them, not daring to approach him, they stood afar off and cried to him: “Master, have mercy on us; cleanse us from our affliction. Heal us as you have healed others.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b14"><a href="#fn_b14">[14]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_1_11"><a href="#fn_a2_1_11">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_1_10"><a href="#fn_a2_1_10">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_1_19"><a href="#fn_a2_1_19">[4]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_4"><a href="#fn_s2_1_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p2_2">166:2.2</a></small></sup>  Jesus had just been explaining to the twelve why the gentiles of <a href="/en/topic/Perea">Perea</a>, together with the less orthodox Jews, were more willing to believe the gospel preached by the seventy than were the more orthodox and tradition-bound Jews of <a href="/en/topic/Judea">Judea</a>. He had called their attention to the fact that their message had likewise been more readily received by the Galileans, and even by the <a href="/en/topic/Samaritans">Samaritans</a>. But the twelve apostles were hardly yet willing to entertain kind feelings for the long-despised Samaritans.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p2_3">166:2.3</a></small></sup>  Accordingly, when <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Zelotes">Simon Zelotes</a> observed the Samaritan among the <a href="/en/topic/lepers">lepers</a>, he sought to induce the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> to pass on into the city without even hesitating to exchange greetings with them. Said <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> to <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a>: “But what if the Samaritan loves <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> as well as the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>? Should we sit in judgment on our fellow men? Who can tell? if we make these ten men whole, perhaps the Samaritan will prove more grateful even than the <a href="/en/topic/Jews_(ancient_Hebrews)">Jews</a>. Do you feel certain about your opinions, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_of_Cyrene">Simon</a>?” And <a href="/en/topic/Simon_the_tanner">Simon</a> quickly replied, “If you cleanse them, you will soon find out.” And Jesus replied: “So shall it be, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_of_Bethphage">Simon</a>, and you will soon know the truth regarding the gratitude of men and the loving mercy of God.”</p>

But when the Samaritan saw that he was being healed, he turned back and, going in quest of Jesus, began to glorify God with a loud voice. And when he had found the Master, he fell on his knees at his feet and gave thanks for his cleansing<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b15"><a href="#fn_b15">[15]</a></sup>. The nine others, the Jews, had also discovered their healing, and while they also were grateful for their cleansing, they continued on their way to show themselves to the priests.</p>

Where, then, are the other nine, the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>? Only one, this alien, has returned to give glory to <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>.” And then he said to the Samaritan, “Arise and go your way; your <a href="/en/topic/faith">faith</a> has made you whole.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b16"><a href="#fn_b16">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p2_8">166:2.8</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> enjoined the twelve to say nothing about the cleansing of the <a href="/en/topic/lepers">lepers</a>, and as they went on into <a href="/en/topic/Amathus">Amathus</a>, he remarked: “You see how it is that the children of the house, even when they are insubordinate to their Father’s will, take their blessings for granted. They think it a small matter if they neglect to give thanks when the Father bestows healing upon them, but the strangers, when they receive gifts from the head of the house, are filled with wonder and are constrained to give thanks in recognition of the good things bestowed upon them.” And still the apostles said nothing in reply to the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s words.</p>

<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p5_1">166:5.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the twelve were on their way to visit <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a> and his associates, who were preaching and teaching in <a href="/en/topic/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. Of all the cities of <a href="/en/topic/Perea">Perea</a>, in Philadelphia the largest group of <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> and gentiles, rich and poor, learned and unlearned, embraced the teachings of the seventy, thereby entering into the kingdom of heaven. The synagogue of Philadelphia had never been subject to the supervision of the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and therefore had never been closed to the teachings of Jesus and his associates. At this very time, Abner was teaching three times a day in the Philadelphia synagogue.</p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p5_2">166:5.2</a></small></sup>  This very synagogue later on became a <a href="/en/topic/Christian_church,_early">Christian church</a> and was the missionary headquarters for the promulgation of the gospel through the regions to the east. It was long a stronghold of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s teachings and stood alone in this region as a center of Christian learning for centuries.</p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p5_3">166:5.3</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> had always had trouble with the <a href="/en/topic/Jews_(ancient_Hebrews)">Jews</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. And after the death and resurrection of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> the Jerusalem church, of which <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James</a> the Lord’s brother was head, began to have serious difficulties with the Philadelphia congregation of believers. <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a> became the head of the Philadelphia church, continuing as such until his death. And this estrangement with Jerusalem explains why nothing is heard of Abner and his work in the Gospel records of the <a href="/en/topic/New_Testament">New Testament</a>. This feud between Jerusalem and Philadelphia lasted throughout the lifetimes of <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> and Abner and continued for some time after the destruction of Jerusalem.

He had dared to defy <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James</a> the Lord’s brother, who was subsequently supported by Peter. Such conduct effectively separated him from all his former associates.

Although he was wholly sympathetic with Paul in his mission to the gentiles, and though he supported him in his contentions with the church at Jerusalem, he bitterly opposed the version of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ teachings which Paul elected to preach.
