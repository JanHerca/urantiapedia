<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p2_1">115:2.1</a></small></sup>  From the existential standpoint, nothing new can happen throughout the galaxies, for the completion of <a href="/en/topic/infinity">infinity</a> inherent in the <a href="/en/topic/I_AM">I AM</a> is eternally present in the seven <a href="/en/topic/Absolutes">Absolutes</a>, is functionally associated in the <a href="/en/topic/triunities">triunities</a>, and is transmitively associated in the <a href="/en/topic/triodities">triodities</a>. But the fact that infinity is thus existentially present in these absolute associations in no way makes it impossible to realize new cosmic experientials. From a finite creature’s viewpoint, infinity contains much that is potential, much that is on the order of a future possibility rather than a present actuality.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a49"><a href="#fn_a49">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p2_2">115:2.2</a></small></sup>  Value is a unique element in universe reality. We do not comprehend how the value of anything infinite and divine could possibly be increased. But we discover that <i><a href="/en/topic/meanings">meanings</a></i> can be modified if not augmented even in the relations of infinite <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>. To the experiential universes even divine values are increased as actualities by enlarged comprehension of reality meanings.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p2_3">115:2.3</a></small></sup>  The entire scheme of universal creation and evolution on all experiencing levels is apparently a matter of the conversion of potentialities into actualities; and this transmutation has to do equally with the realms of space potency, mind potency, and spirit potency.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p2_4">115:2.4</a></small></sup>  The apparent method whereby the possibilities of the cosmos are brought into actual existence varies from level to level, being experiential evolution in the finite and experiential eventuation in the absonite. Existential <a href="/en/topic/infinity">infinity</a> is indeed unqualified in all-inclusiveness, and this very all-inclusiveness must, perforce, encompass even the possibility for evolutionary finite experiencing. And the possibility for such experiential growth becomes a universe actuality through triodity relationships impinging upon and in the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme">Supreme</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. ORIGINAL, ACTUAL, AND POTENTIAL </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_1">115:3.1</a></small></sup>  The absolute cosmos is conceptually without limit; to define the extent and nature of this primal <a href="/en/topic/reality">reality</a> is to place qualifications upon infinity and to attenuate the pure concept of eternity. The idea of the infinite-eternal, the eternal-infinite, is unqualified in extent and absolute in fact. There is no <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a> in the past, present, or future of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> adequate to express the reality of infinity or the infinity of reality. Man, a finite creature in an <a href="/en/topic/cosmos-infinite">infinite cosmos</a>, must content himself with distorted reflections and attenuated conceptions of that limitless, boundless, never-beginning, never-ending existence the comprehension of which is really beyond his ability.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_2">115:3.2</a></small></sup>  Mind can never hope to grasp the concept of an <a href="/en/topic/Absolute">Absolute</a> without attempting first to break the unity of such a reality. Mind is unifying of all <a href="/en/topic/diversity">divergencies</a>, but in the very absence of such divergencies, <a href="/en/topic/mind">mind</a> finds no basis upon which to attempt to formulate understanding <a href="/en/topic/concepts">concepts</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a50"><a href="#fn_a50">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_3">115:3.3</a></small></sup>  The primordial stasis of <a href="/en/topic/infinity">infinity</a> requires segmentation prior to human attempts at comprehension. There is a unity in infinity which has been expressed in these papers as the <a href="/en/topic/I_AM">I AM</a>—the premier postulate of the creature mind. But never can a creature understand how it is that this unity becomes duality, triunity, and diversity while yet remaining an unqualified unity. Man encounters a similar problem when he pauses to contemplate the undivided <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Trinity">Trinity</a> alongside the plural personalization of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_4">115:3.4</a></small></sup>  It is only man’s distance from infinity that causes this concept to be expressed as one word. While infinity is on the one hand UNITY, on the other it is <a href="/en/topic/diversity">DIVERSITY</a> without end or limit. <a href="/en/topic/Infinity">Infinity</a>, as it is observed by finite intelligences, is the maximum <a href="/en/topic/paradox">paradox</a> of creature philosophy and finite metaphysics. Though man’s spiritual nature reaches up in the worship experience to the Father who is infinite, man’s intellectual comprehension capacity is exhausted by the maximum conception of the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme">Supreme</a> Being. Beyond the Supreme, <a href="/en/topic/concepts">concepts</a> are increasingly names; less and less are they true designations of reality; more and more do they become the creature’s projection of finite understanding toward the superfinite.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a51"><a href="#fn_a51">[51]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_5">115:3.5</a></small></sup>  One basic conception of the absolute level involves a postulate of three phases:</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_6">115:3.6</a></small></sup>  1. <i>The <a href="/en/topic/Original">Original</a>.</i> The unqualified concept of the <a href="/en/topic/First_Source_and_Center">First Source and Center</a>, that source manifestation of the <a href="/en/topic/I_AM">I AM</a> from which all <a href="/en/topic/reality">reality</a> takes origin.</p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_7">115:3.7</a></small></sup>  2. <i>The Actual.</i> The union of the three <a href="/en/topic/Absolutes">Absolutes</a> of actuality, the Second, Third, and <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Sources and Centers. This triodity of the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>, and the Paradise Isle constitutes the actual revelation of the originality of the First Source and Center.</p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_8">115:3.8</a></small></sup>  3. <i>The <a href="/en/topic/Potential">Potential</a>.</i> The union of the three Absolutes of potentiality, the <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>, Unqualified, and Universal Absolutes. This triodity of existential potentiality constitutes the potential revelation of the originality of the <a href="/en/topic/First_Source_and_Center">First Source and Center</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_9">115:3.9</a></small></sup>  The interassociation of the <a href="/en/topic/Original">Original</a>, the Actual, and the Potential yields the tensions within infinity which result in the possibility for all universe <a href="/en/topic/growth">growth</a>; and growth is the nature of the <a href="/en/topic/Sevenfold">Sevenfold</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme">Supreme</a>, and the <a href="/en/topic/Ultimate">Ultimate</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_10">115:3.10</a></small></sup>  In the association of the <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>, Universal, and Unqualified <a href="/en/topic/Absolutes">Absolutes</a>, potentiality is absolute while actuality is emergent; in the association of the Second, Third, and <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Sources and Centers, actuality is absolute while potentiality is emergent; in the originality of the <a href="/en/topic/First_Source_and_Center">First Source and Center</a>, we cannot say that either actuality or potentiality is either existent or emergent <i>— the Father is.</i></p>
<p id="p3_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_11">115:3.11</a></small></sup>  From the time viewpoint, the Actual is that which was and is; the <a href="/en/topic/Potential">Potential</a> is that which is becoming and will be; the <a href="/en/topic/Original">Original</a> is that which is. From the <a href="/en/topic/eternity">eternity</a> viewpoint, the differences between the Original, the Actual, and the Potential are not thus apparent. These triune qualities are not so distinguished on Paradise-eternity levels. In eternity all is—only has all not yet been revealed in time and space.</p>
<p id="p3_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_12">115:3.12</a></small></sup>  From a creature’s viewpoint, actuality is substance, potentiality is capacity. Actuality exists centermost and expands therefrom into peripheral infinity; potentiality comes inward from the infinity periphery and converges at the center of all things. Originality is that which first causes and then balances the dual motions of the cycle of reality metamorphosis from potentials to actuals and the potentializing of existing actuals.</p>
<p id="p3_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_13">115:3.13</a></small></sup>  The three <a href="/en/topic/Absolutes">Absolutes</a> of potentiality are operative on the purely eternal level of the cosmos, hence never function as such on subabsolute levels. On the descending levels of reality the triodity of potentiality is manifest with the <a href="/en/topic/Ultimate">Ultimate</a> and upon the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme">Supreme</a>. The potential may fail to time-actualize with respect to a part on some subabsolute level, but never in the aggregate. The <a href="/en/topic/will_of_God">will of God</a> does ultimately prevail, not always concerning the individual but invariably concerning the total.</p>
<p id="p3_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_14">115:3.14</a></small></sup>  It is in the triodity of actuality that the existents of the cosmos have their center; be it spirit, mind, or energy, all center in this association of the Son, the Spirit, and <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>. The personality of the spirit Son is the master <a href="/en/topic/pattern">pattern</a> for all personality throughout all universes. The substance of the Paradise Isle is the master pattern of which <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> is a perfect, and the superuniverses are a perfecting, revelation. The <a href="/en/topic/Conjoint_Actor">Conjoint Actor</a> is at one and the same time the mind activation of cosmic energy, the conceptualization of spirit purpose, and the integration of the mathematical causes and effects of the material levels with the volitional purposes and motives of the spiritual level. In and to a finite universe the Son, Spirit, and Paradise function in and upon the Ultimate as he is conditioned and qualified in the Supreme.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a52"><a href="#fn_a52">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_15">115:3.15</a></small></sup>  Actuality (of <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>) is what man seeks in the Paradise ascent. Potentiality (of human divinity) is what man evolves in that search. The <a href="/en/topic/Original">Original</a> is what makes possible the coexistence and integration of man the actual, man the potential, and man the eternal.</p>
<p id="p3_16"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_16">115:3.16</a></small></sup>  The final dynamics of the cosmos have to do with the continual transfer of reality from potentiality to actuality. In theory, there may be an end to this metamorphosis, but in fact, such is impossible since the <a href="/en/topic/Potential">Potential</a> and the Actual are both encircuited in the Original (the <a href="/en/topic/I_AM">I AM</a>), and this identification makes it forever impossible to place a limit on the developmental progression of the <a href="/en/topic/universe">universe</a>. Whatsoever is identified with the I AM can never find an end to progression since the actuality of the potentials of the I AM is absolute, and the potentiality of the actuals of the I AM is also absolute. Always will actuals be opening up new avenues of the realization of hitherto impossible potentials—every human <a href="/en/topic/decisions">decision</a> not only actualizes a new reality in human experience but also opens up a new capacity for human <a href="/en/topic/growth">growth</a>.

<p id="p3_17"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_17">115:3.17</a></small></sup>  Statics in growth can never appear in the total cosmos since the basis for growth—the absolute actuals—is unqualified, and since the possibilities for growth—the absolute potentials—are unlimited. From a practical viewpoint the philosophers of the universe have come to the conclusion that there is no such thing as an <i><a href="/en/topic/end">end</a>.</i></p>
<p id="p3_18"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_18">115:3.18</a></small></sup>  From a circumscribed view there are, indeed, many ends, many terminations of activities, but from a larger viewpoint on a higher universe level, there are no endings, merely transitions from one phase of development to another. The major chronicity of the master universe is concerned with the several universe ages, the <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a>, the superuniverse, and the outer universe ages. But even these basic divisions of sequence relationships cannot be more than relative landmarks on the unending highway of eternity.</p>
<p id="p3_19"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_19">115:3.19</a></small></sup>  The final penetration of the truth, beauty, and goodness of the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme">Supreme</a> Being could only open up to the progressing creature those absonite qualities of ultimate divinity which lie beyond the concept levels of truth, beauty, and goodness.</p>

Any consideration of the <i>growth</i> of the Supreme must give consideration to the existential <a href="/en/topic/triodities">triodities</a>, for they encompass all absolute actuality and all infinite potentiality (in conjunction with the <a href="/en/topic/First_Source_and_Center">First Source and Center</a>). And the evolutionary Supreme is the culminating and personally volitional focus of the transmutation—the transformation—of potentials to actuals in and on the finite level of existence. The two triodities, actual and potential, encompass the totality of the interrelationships of growth in the universes.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p4_2">115:4.2</a></small></sup>  The source of the Supreme is in the Paradise Trinity—eternal, actual, and undivided Deity. The Supreme is first of all a spirit person, and this spirit person stems from the Trinity.
