The centurion in charge of these twelve soldiers was the same <a href="/en/topic/captain">captain</a> who had led forth the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_soldiers_in_Jerusalem">Roman soldiers</a> the previous night to arrest <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> in <a href="/en/topic/Gethsemane">Gethsemane</a>. It was the Roman custom to assign four soldiers for each person to be crucified. The two brigands were properly scourged before they were taken out to be crucified, but Jesus was given no further physical punishment; the captain undoubtedly thought he had already been sufficiently scourged, even before his condemnation.</p>

They were followed by many who secretly sympathized with Jesus, but most of this group of two hundred or more were either his enemies or curious idlers who merely desired to enjoy the <a href="/en/topic/shock">shock</a> of witnessing the crucifixions. Only a few of the Jewish leaders went out to see Jesus die on the cross<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>. Knowing that he had been turned over to the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_soldiers_in_Jerusalem">Roman soldiers</a> by Pilate, and that he was condemned to die, they busied themselves with their meeting in the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>, whereat they discussed what should be done with his followers.</p>

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p1_1">187:1.1</a></small></sup>  Before leaving the courtyard of the praetorium, the soldiers placed the crossbeam on <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ shoulders<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>. It was the custom to compel the condemned man to carry the crossbeam to the site of the <a href="/en/topic/crucifixion">crucifixion</a>. Such a condemned man did not carry the whole <a href="/en/topic/cross">cross</a>, only this shorter timber. The longer and upright pieces of timber for the three crosses had already been transported to <a href="/en/topic/Golgotha">Golgotha</a> and, by the time of the arrival of the soldiers and their prisoners, had been firmly implanted in the ground.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p1_2">187:1.2</a></small></sup>  According to custom the <a href="/en/topic/captain">captain</a> led the procession, carrying small white boards on which had been written with charcoal the names of the criminals and the nature of the crimes for which they had been condemned. For the two thieves the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_centurion_of_Jerusalem">centurion</a> had notices which gave their names, underneath which was written the one word, “Brigand.” It was the custom, after the victim had been nailed to the crossbeam and hoisted to his place on the upright timber, to nail this notice to the top of the cross, just above the head of the criminal, that all witnesses might know for what crime the condemned man was being crucified. The legend which the centurion carried to put on the cross of Jesus had been written by Pilate himself in <a href="/en/topic/Latin">Latin</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Aramaic">Aramaic</a>, and it read: “Jesus of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>—the King of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p1_3">187:1.3</a></small></sup>  Some of the Jewish authorities who were yet present when Pilate wrote this legend made vigorous protest against calling <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> the “<a href="/en/topic/king_of_the_Jews">king of the Jews</a>.” But Pilate reminded them that such an accusation was part of the charge which led to his condemnation. When the Jews saw they could not prevail upon Pilate to change his mind, they pleaded that at least it be modified to read, “He said, ‘I am the king of the Jews.’” But Pilate was adamant; he would not alter the writing. To all further supplication he only replied, “What I have written, I have written<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>.”</p>

<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p1_5">187:1.5</a></small></sup>  Crucifixion was not a Jewish mode of punishment. Both the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a> learned this method of execution from the <a href="/en/topic/Phoenicians">Phoenicians</a>. Even Herod, with all his cruelty, did not resort to crucifixion. The Romans never crucified a Roman citizen; only slaves and subject peoples were subjected to this dishonorable mode of death. During the siege of Jerusalem, just forty years after the crucifixion of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, all of Golgotha was covered by thousands upon thousands of crosses upon which, from day to day, there perished the flower of the Jewish race. A terrible harvest, indeed, of the seed-sowing of this day.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p1_6">187:1.6</a></small></sup>  As the death procession passed along the narrow streets of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, many of the tenderhearted Jewish women who had heard Jesus’ words of good cheer and compassion, and who knew of his life of loving ministry, could not refrain from weeping when they saw him being led forth to such an ignoble death. As he passed by, many of these women bewailed and lamented. And when some of them even dared to follow along by his side, the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> turned his head toward them and said: “Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but rather weep for yourselves and for your children<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>.

It was permitted the rabble to jeer, mock, and ridicule the condemned, but it was not allowed that any sympathy should be expressed. Though Jesus appreciated the manifestation of sympathy in this dark hour when his friends were in hiding, he did not want these kindhearted women to incur the displeasure of the authorities by daring to show compassion in his behalf. Even at such a time as this Jesus thought little about himself, only of the terrible days of tragedy ahead for Jerusalem and the whole Jewish nation.</p>

Superimposed upon all this was his extreme mental anguish, his acute spiritual tension, and a terrible feeling of human loneliness.</p>

The soldiers shouted at him and kicked him, but he could not arise. When the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_centurion_of_Jerusalem">captain</a> saw this, knowing what Jesus had already endured, he commanded the soldiers to desist.

After the resurrection and before leaving <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, he became a valiant believer in the gospel of the kingdom, and when he returned home, he led his family into the heavenly kingdom.

When they had hoisted this crossbeam up on the post, and after they had nailed it securely to the upright timber of the <a href="/en/topic/cross">cross</a>, they bound and nailed his feet to the wood, using one long nail to penetrate both feet. The upright timber had a large peg, inserted at the proper height, which served as a sort of saddle for supporting the body weight. The cross was not high, the Master’s feet being only about three feet from the ground. He was therefore able to hear all that was said of him in derision and could plainly see the expression on the faces of all those who so thoughtlessly mocked him.

He could have written “Jesus, a rebel.” But he well knew how these <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> Jews detested the very name of Nazareth, and he was determined thus to humiliate them.

His last words of mercy, forgiveness, and admonition had been spoken. His last wish—concerning the care of his mother—had been expressed.

Only a few times did those standing by catch some utterance, such as, “I know the Lord will save his anointed,” “Your hand shall find out all my enemies,” and “My <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, my God, why have you forsaken me?” Jesus did not for one moment entertain the slightest doubt that he had lived in accordance with the Father’s will; and he never doubted that he was now laying down his life in the flesh in accordance with his Father’s will<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b31"><a href="#fn_b31">[31]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b32"><a href="#fn_b32">[32]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b33"><a href="#fn_b33">[33]</a></sup>.
