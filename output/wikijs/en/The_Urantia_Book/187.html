<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p0_1">187:0.1</a></small></sup>  AFTER the two brigands had been made ready, the soldiers, under the direction of a <a href="/en/topic/Roman_centurion_of_Jerusalem">centurion</a>, started for the scene of the <a href="/en/topic/crucifixion">crucifixion</a>. The centurion in charge of these twelve soldiers was the same <a href="/en/topic/captain">captain</a> who had led forth the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_soldiers_in_Jerusalem">Roman soldiers</a> the previous night to arrest <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> in <a href="/en/topic/Gethsemane">Gethsemane</a>. It was the Roman custom to assign four soldiers for each person to be crucified. The two brigands were properly scourged before they were taken out to be crucified, but Jesus was given no further physical punishment; the captain undoubtedly thought he had already been sufficiently scourged, even before his condemnation.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p0_2">187:0.2</a></small></sup>  The two <a href="/en/topic/thieves_crucified_with_Jesus">thieves crucified with Jesus</a> were associates of <a href="/en/topic/Barabbas">Barabbas</a> and would later have been put to death with their leader if he had not been released as the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> pardon of Pilate. Jesus was thus crucified in the place of Barabbas<sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p0_3">187:0.3</a></small></sup>  What <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> is now about to do, submit to death on the cross, he does of his own free will. In foretelling this experience, he said: “The Father loves and sustains me because I am willing to lay down my life<sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup>. But I will take it up again. No one takes my life away from me—I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up. I have received such a commandment from my Father.”</p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p0_4">187:0.4</a></small></sup>  It was just before nine o’clock this morning when the soldiers led Jesus from the <a href="/en/topic/praetorium">praetorium</a> on the way to <a href="/en/topic/Golgotha">Golgotha</a><sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup>. They were followed by many who secretly sympathized with Jesus, but most of this group of two hundred or more were either his enemies or curious idlers who merely desired to enjoy the <a href="/en/topic/shock">shock</a> of witnessing the crucifixions. Only a few of the Jewish leaders went out to see Jesus die on the cross<sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup>. Knowing that he had been turned over to the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_soldiers_in_Jerusalem">Roman soldiers</a> by Pilate, and that he was condemned to die, they busied themselves with their meeting in the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>, whereat they discussed what should be done with his followers.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. ON THE WAY TO GOLGOTHA </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p1_1">187:1.1</a></small></sup>  Before leaving the courtyard of the praetorium, the soldiers placed the crossbeam on <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ shoulders<sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup>. It was the custom to compel the condemned man to carry the crossbeam to the site of the <a href="/en/topic/crucifixion">crucifixion</a>. Such a condemned man did not carry the whole <a href="/en/topic/cross">cross</a>, only this shorter timber. The longer and upright pieces of timber for the three crosses had already been transported to <a href="/en/topic/Golgotha">Golgotha</a> and, by the time of the arrival of the soldiers and their prisoners, had been firmly implanted in the ground.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p1_2">187:1.2</a></small></sup>  According to custom the <a href="/en/topic/captain">captain</a> led the procession, carrying small white boards on which had been written with charcoal the names of the criminals and the nature of the crimes for which they had been condemned. For the two thieves the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_centurion_of_Jerusalem">centurion</a> had notices which gave their names, underneath which was written the one word, “Brigand.” It was the custom, after the victim had been nailed to the crossbeam and hoisted to his place on the upright timber, to nail this notice to the top of the cross, just above the head of the criminal, that all witnesses might know for what crime the condemned man was being crucified. The legend which the centurion carried to put on the cross of Jesus had been written by Pilate himself in <a href="/en/topic/Latin">Latin</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Aramaic">Aramaic</a>, and it read: “Jesus of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>—the King of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a><sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p1_3">187:1.3</a></small></sup>  Some of the Jewish authorities who were yet present when Pilate wrote this legend made vigorous protest against calling <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> the “<a href="/en/topic/king_of_the_Jews">king of the Jews</a>.” But Pilate reminded them that such an accusation was part of the charge which led to his condemnation. When the Jews saw they could not prevail upon Pilate to change his mind, they pleaded that at least it be modified to read, “He said, ‘I am the king of the Jews.’” But Pilate was adamant; he would not alter the writing. To all further supplication he only replied, “What I have written, I have written<sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup>.”</p>

Beyond Golgotha were the villas of the wealthy, and on the other side of the road were the tombs of many well-to-do <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>.</p>

<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p1_5">187:1.5</a></small></sup>  Crucifixion was not a Jewish mode of punishment. Both the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a> learned this method of execution from the <a href="/en/topic/Phoenicians">Phoenicians</a>. Even Herod, with all his cruelty, did not resort to crucifixion. The Romans never crucified a Roman citizen; only slaves and subject peoples were subjected to this dishonorable mode of death. During the siege of Jerusalem, just forty years after the crucifixion of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, all of Golgotha was covered by thousands upon thousands of crosses upon which, from day to day, there perished the flower of the Jewish race. A terrible harvest, indeed, of the seed-sowing of this day.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p1_6">187:1.6</a></small></sup>  As the death procession passed along the narrow streets of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, many of the tenderhearted Jewish women who had heard Jesus’ words of good cheer and compassion, and who knew of his life of loving ministry, could not refrain from weeping when they saw him being led forth to such an ignoble death. As he passed by, many of these women bewailed and lamented. And when some of them even dared to follow along by his side, the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> turned his head toward them and said: “Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but rather weep for yourselves and for your children<sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup>. My work is about done—soon I go to my Father—but the times of terrible trouble for Jerusalem are just beginning. Behold, the days are coming in which you shall say: Blessed are the barren and those whose breasts have never suckled their young. In those days will you pray the rocks of the hills to fall on you in order that you may be delivered from the terrors of your troubles<sup id="cite9"><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup>.”</p>

<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p1_7">187:1.7</a></small></sup>  These women of Jerusalem were indeed courageous to manifest sympathy for <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, for it was strictly against the law to show friendly feelings for one who was being led forth to <a href="/en/topic/crucifixion">crucifixion</a>. It was permitted the rabble to jeer, mock, and ridicule the condemned, but it was not allowed that any sympathy should be expressed. Though Jesus appreciated the manifestation of sympathy in this dark hour when his friends were in hiding, he did not want these kindhearted women to incur the displeasure of the authorities by daring to show compassion in his behalf. Even at such a time as this Jesus thought little about himself, only of the terrible days of tragedy ahead for Jerusalem and the whole Jewish nation.</p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p1_8">187:1.8</a></small></sup>  As the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> trudged along on the way to the crucifixion, he was very weary; he was nearly exhausted. He had had neither food nor water since the <a href="/en/topic/Last_Supper">Last Supper</a> at the home of <a href="/en/topic/Elijah_Mark">Elijah Mark</a>; neither had he been permitted to enjoy one moment of sleep. In addition, there had been one hearing right after another up to the hour of his condemnation, not to mention the abusive scourgings with their accompanying physical suffering and loss of blood. Superimposed upon all this was his extreme mental anguish, his acute spiritual tension, and a terrible feeling of human loneliness.</p>

The soldiers shouted at him and kicked him, but he could not arise. When the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_centurion_of_Jerusalem">captain</a> saw this, knowing what Jesus had already endured, he commanded the soldiers to desist. Then he ordered a passerby, one <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> from <a href="/en/topic/Cyrene">Cyrene</a>, to take the crossbeam from Jesus’ shoulders and compelled him to carry it the rest of the way to <a href="/en/topic/Golgotha">Golgotha</a><sup id="cite10"><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup>.</p>

After the resurrection and before leaving <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, he became a valiant believer in the gospel of the kingdom, and when he returned home, he led his family into the heavenly kingdom.

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p2_1">187:2.1</a></small></sup>  The soldiers first bound the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s arms with cords to the crossbeam, and then they nailed his hands to the wood. When they had hoisted this crossbeam up on the post, and after they had nailed it securely to the upright timber of the <a href="/en/topic/cross">cross</a>, they bound and nailed his feet to the wood, using one long nail to penetrate both feet. The upright timber had a large peg, inserted at the proper height, which served as a sort of saddle for supporting the body weight. The cross was not high, the Master’s feet being only about three feet from the ground. He was therefore able to hear all that was said of him in derision and could plainly see the expression on the faces of all those who so thoughtlessly mocked him. And also could those present easily hear all that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> said during these hours of lingering torture and slow death<sup id="cite13"><a href="#fn13">[13]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p2_2">187:2.2</a></small></sup>  It was the custom to remove all <a href="/en/topic/clothing">clothes</a> from those who were to be <a href="/en/topic/crucifixion">crucified</a>, but since the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> greatly objected to the public exposure of the naked human form, the <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a> always provided a suitable loin cloth for all persons crucified at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. Accordingly, after Jesus’ clothes had been removed, he was thus garbed before he was put upon the cross.</p>

<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p2_3">187:2.3</a></small></sup>  Crucifixion was resorted to in order to provide a cruel and lingering punishment, the victim sometimes not dying for several days. There was considerable sentiment against crucifixion in Jerusalem, and there existed a society of Jewish women who always sent a representative to crucifixions for the purpose of offering drugged <a href="/en/topic/wine">wine</a> to the victim in order to lessen his suffering. But when <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> tasted this narcotized wine, as thirsty as he was, he refused to drink it<sup id="cite14"><a href="#fn14">[14]</a></sup>. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> chose to retain his human consciousness until the very end. He desired to meet death, even in this cruel and inhuman form, and conquer it by voluntary submission to the full human experience.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p2_4">187:2.4</a></small></sup>  Before Jesus was put on his cross, the two brigands had already been placed on their crosses, all the while cursing and spitting upon their <a href="/en/topic/divine_executioners">executioners</a><sup id="cite15"><a href="#fn15">[15]</a></sup>. Jesus’ only words, as they nailed him to the crossbeam, were, “Father, <a href="/en/topic/forgiveness">forgive</a> them, for they know not what they do<sup id="cite16"><a href="#fn16">[16]</a></sup>.” He could not have so mercifully and lovingly interceded for his executioners if such thoughts of affectionate devotion had not been the mainspring of all his life of unselfish service. The ideas, <a href="/en/topic/motives">motives</a>, and longings of a lifetime are openly revealed in a <a href="/en/topic/crisis">crisis</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p2_5">187:2.5</a></small></sup>  After the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> was hoisted on the cross, the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_centurion_of_Jerusalem">captain</a> nailed the title up above his head, and it read in three languages, “<a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>—the King of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a><sup id="cite17"><a href="#fn17">[17]</a></sup>.” The <a href="/en/topic/Jews_(ancient_Hebrews)">Jews</a> were infuriated by this believed insult. But Pilate was chafed by their disrespectful manner; he felt he had been intimidated and humiliated, and he took this method of obtaining petty revenge. He could have written “Jesus, a rebel.” But he well knew how these <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> Jews detested the very name of Nazareth, and he was determined thus to humiliate them. He knew that they would also be cut to the very quick by seeing this executed Galilean called “The King of the Jews.”</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p2_6">187:2.6</a></small></sup>  Many of the Jewish leaders, when they learned how Pilate had sought to deride them by placing this inscription on the cross of Jesus, hastened out to <a href="/en/topic/Golgotha">Golgotha</a>, but they dared not attempt to remove it since the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_soldiers_in_Jerusalem">Roman soldiers</a> were standing on guard. Not being able to remove the title, these leaders mingled with the crowd and did their utmost to incite derision and ridicule, lest any give serious regard to the inscription.</p>

John was the only one of the eleven apostles to witness the <a href="/en/topic/crucifixion">crucifixion</a>, and even he was not present all of the time since he ran into <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> to bring back his mother and her friends soon after he had brought Jesus’ mother to the scene.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p2_8">187:2.8</a></small></sup>  As Jesus saw his mother, with John and his brother and sister, he smiled but said nothing. Meanwhile the four soldiers assigned to the Master’s crucifixion, as was the custom, had divided his <a href="/en/topic/clothing">clothes</a> among them, one taking the <a href="/en/topic/sandals">sandals</a>, one the <a href="/en/topic/turban">turban</a>, one the <a href="/en/topic/girdle">girdle</a>, and the fourth the <a href="/en/topic/cloak">cloak</a><sup id="cite19"><a href="#fn19">[19]</a></sup>. This left the <a href="/en/topic/tunic">tunic</a>, or seamless vestment reaching down to near the knees, to be cut up into four pieces, but when the soldiers saw what an unusual garment it was, they decided to <a href="/en/topic/casting_lots">cast lots</a> for it. Jesus looked down on them while they divided his garments, and the thoughtless crowd jeered at him.</p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p2_9">187:2.9</a></small></sup>  It was well that the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_soldiers_in_Jerusalem">Roman soldiers</a> took possession of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s clothing. Otherwise, if his followers had gained possession of these garments, they would have been tempted to resort to superstitious relic worship. The Master desired that his followers should have nothing material to associate with his life on earth. He wanted to leave mankind only the memory of a human life dedicated to the high spiritual ideal of being consecrated to doing the Father’s will.</p>

If you are the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_God">Son of God</a>, why do you not come down from your cross?” In like manner some of the rulers of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> mocked him, saying, “He saved others, but himself he cannot save.” Others said, “If you are the <a href="/en/topic/king_of_the_Jews">king of the Jews</a>, come down from the cross, and we will believe in you.” And later on they mocked him the more, saying: “He trusted in <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> to deliver him. He even claimed to be the Son of God—look at him now—<a href="/en/topic/crucifixion">crucified</a> between two thieves.” Even the two thieves also railed at him and cast reproach upon him<sup id="cite22"><a href="#fn22">[22]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p3_4">187:3.4</a></small></sup>  Inasmuch as <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> would make no reply to their taunts, and since it was nearing noontime of this special preparation day, by half past eleven o’clock most of the jesting and jeering crowd had gone its way; less than fifty persons remained on the scene.

As they partook of their wine, they derisively offered a toast to Jesus, saying, “Hail and good fortune! to the king of the Jews<sup id="cite23"><a href="#fn23">[23]</a></sup>.” And they were astonished at the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s tolerant regard of their ridicule and mocking.</p>

<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p4_2">187:4.2</a></small></sup>  The Master had time amidst the pangs of mortal death to listen to the faith confession of the believing brigand. When this thief reached out for salvation, he found deliverance. Many times before this he had been constrained to believe in Jesus, but only in these last hours of consciousness did he turn with a whole heart toward the Master’s teaching. When he saw the manner in which Jesus faced death upon the cross, this thief could no longer resist the conviction that this <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> was indeed the Son of God.</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p4_3">187:4.3</a></small></sup>  During this episode of the conversion and reception of the thief into the kingdom by <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, the Apostle John was absent, having gone into the city to bring his mother and her friends to the scene of the <a href="/en/topic/crucifixion">crucifixion</a>. <a href="/en/topic/Luke">Luke</a> subsequently heard this <a href="/en/topic/Genesis,_Book_of">story</a> from the converted <a href="/en/topic/Roman_centurion_of_Jerusalem">Roman captain</a> of the guard.</p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p4_4">187:4.4</a></small></sup>  The Apostle John told about the crucifixion as he remembered the event two thirds of a century after its occurrence. The other records were based upon the recital of the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_centurion_in_Corinth">Roman centurion</a> on duty who, because of what he saw and heard, subsequently believed in Jesus and entered into the full fellowship of the kingdom of heaven on earth.</p>
<p id="p4_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p4_5">187:4.5</a></small></sup>  This young man, the penitent brigand, had been led into a life of violence and wrongdoing by those who extolled such a career of robbery as an effective patriotic protest against political oppression and social injustice. And this sort of teaching, plus the urge for adventure, led many otherwise well-meaning youths to enlist in these daring expeditions of robbery. This young man had looked upon <a href="/en/topic/Barabbas">Barabbas</a> as a hero. Now he saw that he had been mistaken. Here on the cross beside him he saw a really great man, a true hero. Here was a hero who fired his zeal and inspired his highest ideas of moral self-respect and quickened all his ideals of courage, manhood, and bravery. In beholding <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, there sprang up in his heart an overwhelming sense of love, loyalty, and genuine greatness.</p>
<p id="p4_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p4_6">187:4.6</a></small></sup>  And if any other person among the jeering crowd had experienced the birth of faith within his soul and had appealed to the mercy of Jesus, he would have been received with the same loving consideration that was displayed toward the believing brigand.</p>
<p id="p4_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p4_7">187:4.7</a></small></sup>  Just after the repentant thief heard the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s promise that they should sometime meet in <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>, John returned from the city, bringing with him his mother and a company of almost a dozen women believers. John took up his position near <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> the mother of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, supporting her. Her son <a href="/en/topic/Jude">Jude</a> stood on the other side. As Jesus looked down upon this scene, it was noontide, and he said to his mother, “Woman, behold your son!” And speaking to John, he said, “My son, behold your mother!” And then he addressed them both, saying, “I desire that you depart from this place.” And so John and Jude led <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Clopas)">Mary</a> away from <a href="/en/topic/Golgotha">Golgotha</a>. John took the mother of Jesus to the place where he tarried in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and then hastened back to the scene of the <a href="/en/topic/crucifixion">crucifixion</a><sup id="cite28"><a href="#fn28">[28]</a></sup>. After the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)">Mary</a> returned to <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a>, where she lived at John’s home for the rest of her natural life. <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(sister_of_Lazarus)">Mary</a> did not live quite one year after the death of Jesus.</p>
<p id="p4_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p4_8">187:4.8</a></small></sup>  After Mary left, the other women withdrew for a short distance and remained in attendance upon Jesus until he expired on the cross, and they were yet standing by when the body of the Master was taken down for burial.</p>
<h2 id="p5" class="toc-header"><a href="#p5" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 5. LAST HOUR ON THE CROSS </h2>
<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p5_1">187:5.1</a></small></sup>  Although it was early in the season for such a phenomenon, shortly after twelve o’clock the sky darkened by reason of the fine <a href="/en/topic/sand">sand</a> in the air<sup id="cite29"><a href="#fn29">[29]</a></sup>. The people of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> knew that this meant the coming of one of those hot-wind sandstorms from the Arabian Desert. Before one o’clock the sky was so dark the sun was hid, and the remainder of the crowd hastened back to the city. When the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> gave up his life shortly after this hour, less than thirty people were present, only the thirteen <a href="/en/topic/Roman_soldiers_in_Jerusalem">Roman soldiers</a> and a group of about fifteen believers. These believers were all women except two, <a href="/en/topic/Jude">Jude</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ brother, and <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John Zebedee</a>, who returned to the scene just before the Master expired.</p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p5_2">187:5.2</a></small></sup>  Shortly after one o’clock, amidst the increasing darkness of the fierce sandstorm, Jesus began to fail in human consciousness. His last words of mercy, forgiveness, and admonition had been spoken. His last wish—concerning the care of his mother—had been expressed. During this hour of approaching death the human mind of Jesus resorted to the repetition of many passages in the Hebrew scriptures, particularly the <a href="/en/topic/Psalms">Psalms</a><sup id="cite30"><a href="#fn30">[30]</a></sup>. The last conscious thought of the human Jesus was concerned with the repetition in his mind of a portion of the Book of Psalms now known as the twentieth, twenty-first, and twenty-second Psalms. While his lips would often move, he was too weak to utter the words as these passages, which he so well knew by heart, would pass through his mind. Only a few times did those standing by catch some utterance, such as, “I know the Lord will save his anointed,” “Your hand shall find out all my enemies,” and “My <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, my God, why have you forsaken me?” Jesus did not for one moment entertain the slightest doubt that he had lived in accordance with the Father’s will; and he never doubted that he was now laying down his life in the flesh in accordance with his Father’s will<sup id="cite31"><a href="#fn31">[31]</a></sup><sup id="cite32"><a href="#fn32">[32]</a></sup><sup id="cite33"><a href="#fn33">[33]</a></sup>. He did not feel that the Father had forsaken him; he was merely reciting in his vanishing consciousness many Scriptures, among them this twenty-second Psalm, which begins with “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” And this happened to be one of the three passages which were spoken with sufficient clearness to be heard by those standing by.</p>

Still the soldiers and the small group of believers stood by. The soldiers crouched near the cross, huddled together to protect themselves from the cutting <a href="/en/topic/sand">sand</a>. The mother of John and others watched from a distance where they were somewhat sheltered by an overhanging rock. When the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> finally breathed his last, there were present at the foot of his cross <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John Zebedee</a>, his brother <a href="/en/topic/Jude">Jude</a>, his sister <a href="/en/topic/Ruth_(Old_Testament)">Ruth</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Mary_Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Rebecca_(daughter_of_Ezra)">Rebecca</a>, onetime of <a href="/en/topic/Sepphoris">Sepphoris</a><sup id="cite35"><a href="#fn35">[35]</a></sup>.</p>

Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.” And when he had thus spoken, he bowed his head and gave up the life struggle. When the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_centurion_in_Corinth">Roman centurion</a> saw how Jesus died, he smote his breast and said: “This was indeed a righteous man; truly he must have been a <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_God">Son of God</a><sup id="cite36"><a href="#fn36">[36]</a></sup>.” And from that hour he began to believe in Jesus.</p>
<p id="p5_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p5_6">187:5.6</a></small></sup>  Jesus died royally—as he had lived. He freely admitted his kingship and remained master of the situation throughout the tragic day. He went willingly to his ignominious death, after he had provided for the safety of his chosen apostles. He wisely restrained <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>’s trouble-making violence and provided that John might be near him right up to the end of his mortal existence. He revealed his true nature to the murderous <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> and reminded Pilate of the source of his sovereign authority as a Son of God. He started out to <a href="/en/topic/Golgotha">Golgotha</a> bearing his own crossbeam and finished up his loving bestowal by handing over his spirit of mortal acquirement to the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Father.
