<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p0_1">132:0.1</a></small></sup>  SINCE <a href="/en/topic/Gonod">Gonod</a> carried greetings from the princes of <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a> to <a href="/en/topic/Tiberius">Tiberius</a>, the Roman ruler, on the third day after their arrival in <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a> the two <a href="/en/topic/Indians_(American)">Indians</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> appeared before him. The morose emperor was unusually cheerful on this day and chatted long with the trio. And when they had gone from his presence, the emperor, referring to Jesus, remarked to the aide standing on his right, “If I had that fellow’s kingly bearing and gracious manner, I would be a real emperor, eh?”</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p0_2">132:0.2</a></small></sup>  While at Rome, <a href="/en/topic/Ganid">Ganid</a> had regular hours for study and for visiting places of interest about the city. His father had much business to transact, and desiring that his son grow up to become a worthy successor in the management of his vast commercial interests, he thought the time had come to introduce the boy to the business world. There were many citizens of India in Rome, and often one of Gonod’s own employees would accompany him as interpreter so that Jesus would have whole days to himself; this gave him time in which to become thoroughly acquainted with this city of two million inhabitants. He was frequently to be found in the <a href="/en/topic/forum">forum</a>, the center of political, legal, and business life. He often went up to the <a href="/en/topic/Capitolium">Capitolium</a> and pondered the bondage of ignorance in which these <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a> were held as he beheld this magnificent <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a> dedicated to <a href="/en/topic/Jupiter_(god)">Jupiter</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Juno">Juno</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Minerva">Minerva</a>. He also spent much time on Palatine hill, where were located the emperor’s residence, the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Apollo">Apollo</a>, and the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Latin">Latin</a> <a href="/en/topic/libraries">libraries</a>.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p0_3">132:0.3</a></small></sup>  At this time the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_Empire">Roman Empire</a> included all of southern <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Asia_Minor">Asia Minor</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Egypt">Egypt</a>, and northwest <a href="/en/topic/Africa">Africa</a>; and its inhabitants embraced the citizens of every country of the Eastern Hemisphere. His desire to study and mingle with this cosmopolitan aggregation of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> was the chief reason why <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> consented to make this journey.</p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p0_4">132:0.4</a></small></sup>  Jesus learned much about men while in <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a>, but the most valuable of all the manifold experiences of his six months’ sojourn in that city was his contact with, and influence upon, the religious leaders of the empire’s capital. Before the end of <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> week in Rome Jesus had sought out, and had made the acquaintance of, the worth-while leaders of the <a href="/en/topic/Cynics">Cynics</a>, the Stoics, and the mystery cults, in particular the Mithraic group. Whether or not it was apparent to Jesus that the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> were going to reject his mission, he most certainly foresaw that his <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> were presently coming to Rome to proclaim the kingdom of heaven; and he therefore set about, in the most amazing manner, to prepare the way for the better and more certain reception of their message. He selected five of the leading Stoics, eleven of the Cynics, and sixteen of the mystery-cult leaders and spent much of his spare time for almost six months in intimate association with these religious teachers. And this was his method of instruction: Never once did he attack their errors or even mention the flaws in their teachings. In each case he would select the <a href="/en/topic/truth">truth</a> in what they taught and then proceed so to embellish and illuminate this truth in their minds that in a very short time this enhancement of the truth effectively crowded out the associated <a href="/en/topic/error">error</a>; and thus were these Jesus-taught men and women prepared for the subsequent recognition of additional and similar truths in the teachings of the early Christian missionaries. It was this early acceptance of the teachings of the <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> preachers which gave that powerful impetus to the rapid spread of <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a> in Rome and from there throughout the empire.</p>
<p id="p0_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p0_5">132:0.5</a></small></sup>  The significance of this remarkable doing can the better be understood when we record the fact that, out of this group of thirty-two Jesus-taught <a href="/en/topic/religious_leaders_in_Rome">religious leaders in Rome</a>, only two were unfruitful; the thirty became pivotal individuals in the establishment of Christianity in Rome, and certain of them also aided in turning the chief Mithraic <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> into the <a href="/en/topic/Christian_church,_early">first Christian church</a> of that city. We who view human activities from behind the scenes and in the light of nineteen centuries of time recognize just three factors of paramount value in the early setting of the stage for the rapid spread of Christianity throughout <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a>, and they are:</p>
<p id="p0_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p0_6">132:0.6</a></small></sup>  1. The choosing and holding of <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a> as an apostle<sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p0_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p0_7">132:0.7</a></small></sup>  2. The talk in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> with <a href="/en/topic/Stephen">Stephen</a>, whose death led to the winning of <a href="/en/topic/Saul_of_Tarsus">Saul of Tarsus</a><sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p0_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p0_8">132:0.8</a></small></sup>  3. The preliminary preparation of these thirty <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a> for the subsequent leadership of the new religion in <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a> and throughout the empire.</p>
<p id="p0_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p0_9">132:0.9</a></small></sup>  Through all their experiences, neither <a href="/en/topic/Stephen">Stephen</a> nor the thirty chosen ones ever realized that they had once talked with the man whose name became the subject of their religious teaching. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ work in behalf of the original thirty-two was entirely personal. In his labors for these individuals the scribe of <a href="/en/topic/Damascus">Damascus</a> never met more than three of them at one time, seldom more than two, while most often he taught them singly. And he could do this great work of religious training because these men and women were not tradition bound; they were not victims of a settled preconception as to all future religious developments.</p>
<p id="p0_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p0_10">132:0.10</a></small></sup>  Many were the times in the years so soon to follow that <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Paul">Paul</a>, and the other Christian teachers in <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a> heard about this <a href="/en/topic/scribe_of_Damascus">scribe of Damascus</a> who had preceded them, and who had so obviously (and as they supposed unwittingly) prepared the way for their coming with the new gospel. Though Paul never really surmised the identity of this scribe of Damascus, he did, a short time before his death, because of the similarity of personal descriptions, reach the conclusion that the “<a href="/en/topic/tentmaker">tentmaker</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Antioch">Antioch</a>” was also the “scribe of Damascus.” On one occasion, while preaching in Rome, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a>, on listening to a <a href="/en/topic/Revelations,_Book_of">description</a> of the Damascus scribe, surmised that this individual might have been Jesus but quickly dismissed the idea, knowing full well (so he thought) that the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> had never been in Rome.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. TRUE VALUES </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p1_1">132:1.1</a></small></sup>  It was with <a href="/en/topic/Angamon">Angamon</a>, the leader of the Stoics, that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had an all-night talk early during his sojourn in <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a>. This man subsequently became a great friend of <a href="/en/topic/Paul">Paul</a> and proved to be one of the strong supporters of the Christian church at Rome. In substance, and restated in modern phraseology, Jesus taught Angamon:</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p1_2">132:1.2</a></small></sup>  The standard of true <a href="/en/topic/values">values</a> must be looked for in the spiritual world and on divine levels of eternal reality. To an <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortal</a> all lower and material standards must be recognized as transient, partial, and inferior. The scientist, as such, is limited to the discovery of the relatedness of material facts. Technically, he has no right to assert that he is either materialist or idealist, for in so doing he has assumed to forsake the attitude of a true scientist since any and all such assertions of attitude are the very essence of philosophy.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p1_3">132:1.3</a></small></sup>  Unless the moral insight and the spiritual attainment of mankind are proportionately augmented, the unlimited advancement of a purely materialistic culture may eventually become a menace to civilization. A purely materialistic <a href="/en/topic/science">science</a> harbors within itself the potential seed of the destruction of all scientific striving, for this very attitude presages the ultimate collapse of a civilization which has abandoned its sense of moral values and has repudiated its spiritual goal of attainment.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p1_4">132:1.4</a></small></sup>  The materialistic scientist and the extreme idealist are destined always to be at loggerheads. This is not true of those <a href="/en/topic/scientists">scientists</a> and idealists who are in possession of a common standard of high moral <a href="/en/topic/values">values</a> and spiritual test levels. In every age scientists and religionists must recognize that they are on trial before the bar of human need. They must eschew all warfare between themselves while they strive valiantly to justify their continued survival by enhanced devotion to the service of human progress. If the so-called science or <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> of any age is false, then must it either purify its activities or pass away before the emergence of a material science or spiritual religion of a truer and more worthy order.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. GOOD AND EVIL </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p2_1">132:2.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Mardus">Mardus</a> was the acknowledged leader of the <a href="/en/topic/Cynics">Cynics</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a>, and he became a great friend of the scribe of <a href="/en/topic/Damascus">Damascus</a>. Day after day he conversed with <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, and night upon night he listened to his supernal teaching. Among the more important discussions with Mardus was the one designed to answer this sincere Cynic’s question about <a href="/en/topic/good">good</a> and <a href="/en/topic/evil">evil</a>. In substance, and in twentieth-century phraseology, Jesus said:</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p2_2">132:2.2</a></small></sup>  My brother, good and evil are merely words symbolizing relative levels of human comprehension of the observable universe. If you are ethically lazy and socially indifferent, you can take as your standard of good the current social usages. If you are spiritually indolent and morally unprogressive, you may take as your standards of good the religious practices and traditions of your contemporaries. But the soul that survives time and emerges into eternity must make a living and personal choice between good and evil as they are determined by the true values of the spiritual standards established by the divine spirit which the Father in heaven has sent to dwell within the heart of man. This indwelling spirit is the standard of personality <a href="/en/topic/survival_(of_mortal_death)">survival</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p2_3">132:2.3</a></small></sup>  Goodness, like <a href="/en/topic/truth">truth</a>, is always relative and unfailingly evil-contrasted. It is the perception of these qualities of <a href="/en/topic/goodness">goodness</a> and truth that enables the evolving souls of men to make those personal decisions of choice which are essential to eternal survival.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p2_4">132:2.4</a></small></sup>  The spiritually blind individual who logically follows scientific dictation, social usage, and religious dogma stands in grave danger of sacrificing his moral freedom and losing his spiritual liberty. Such a soul is destined to become an intellectual parrot, a social automaton, and a slave to religious authority.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p2_5">132:2.5</a></small></sup>  Goodness is always growing toward new levels of the increasing liberty of moral self-realization and spiritual <a href="/en/topic/personality">personality</a> attainment—the discovery of, and identification with, the indwelling Adjuster. An <a href="/en/topic/experience">experience</a> is <a href="/en/topic/good">good</a> when it heightens the appreciation of beauty, augments the moral will, enhances the discernment of truth, enlarges the capacity to love and serve one’s fellows, exalts the spiritual ideals, and unifies the supreme human motives of time with the eternal plans of the indwelling Adjuster, all of which lead directly to an increased desire to do the Father’s will, thereby fostering the divine passion to find <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and to be more like him.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p2_6">132:2.6</a></small></sup>  As you ascend the universe scale of creature development, you will find increasing goodness and diminishing <a href="/en/topic/evil">evil</a> in perfect accordance with your capacity for goodness-experience and truth-discernment. The ability to entertain <a href="/en/topic/error">error</a> or experience evil will not be fully lost until the ascending human soul achieves final spirit levels.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p2_7">132:2.7</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/goodness">Goodness</a> is living, relative, always progressing, invariably a personal experience, and everlastingly correlated with the discernment of truth and beauty. Goodness is found in the recognition of the positive truth-values of the spiritual level, which must, in human experience, be contrasted with the negative counterpart—the shadows of potential evil.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p2_8">132:2.8</a></small></sup>  Until you attain <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> levels, goodness will always be more of a quest than a possession, more of a goal than an experience of attainment. But even as you hunger and thirst for righteousness, you experience increasing satisfaction in the partial attainment of goodness. The presence of goodness and <a href="/en/topic/evil">evil</a> in the world is in itself positive proof of the existence and reality of man’s moral will, the personality, which thus identifies these values and is also able to choose between them.</p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p2_9">132:2.9</a></small></sup>  By the time of the attainment of Paradise the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortal</a>’s capacity for identifying the self with true spirit values has become so enlarged as to result in the attainment of the perfection of the possession of the light of life<sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup>. Such a perfected spirit personality becomes so wholly, divinely, and spiritually unified with the positive and supreme qualities of <a href="/en/topic/goodness">goodness</a>, beauty, and truth that there remains no possibility that such a righteous spirit would cast any negative shadow of potential evil when exposed to the searching luminosity of the divine light of the infinite Rulers of Paradise. In all such spirit personalities, goodness is no longer partial, contrastive, and comparative; it has become divinely complete and spiritually replete; it approaches the purity and perfection of the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme">Supreme</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p2_10">132:2.10</a></small></sup>  The <i>possibility</i> of <a href="/en/topic/evil">evil</a> is necessary to moral choosing, but not the actuality thereof. A shadow is only relatively real. Actual evil is not necessary as a personal experience. <a href="/en/topic/Potential">Potential</a> evil acts equally well as a decision stimulus in the realms of moral progress on the lower levels of spiritual development. Evil becomes a reality of personal experience only when a moral mind makes evil its choice.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. TRUTH AND FAITH </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p3_1">132:3.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Nabon">Nabon</a> was a <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> Jew and foremost among the leaders of the chief mystery cult in <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a>, the Mithraic. While this high priest of <a href="/en/topic/Mithraism">Mithraism</a> held many conferences with the <a href="/en/topic/Damascus">Damascus</a> scribe, he was most permanently influenced by their discussion of <a href="/en/topic/truth">truth</a> and <a href="/en/topic/faith">faith</a> one evening. Nabon had thought to make a convert of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and had even suggested that he return to <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a> as a Mithraic teacher. He little realized that Jesus was preparing him to become one of the early converts to the gospel of the kingdom. Restated in modern phraseology, the substance of Jesus’ teaching was:</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p3_2">132:3.2</a></small></sup>  Truth cannot be defined with words, only by living. Truth is always more than knowledge. Knowledge pertains to things observed, but truth transcends such purely material levels in that it consorts with wisdom and embraces such imponderables as human experience, even spiritual and living realities. Knowledge originates in science; wisdom, in true philosophy; truth, in the religious experience of spiritual living. Knowledge deals with facts; wisdom, with relationships; truth, with reality values.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p3_3">132:3.3</a></small></sup>  Man tends to crystallize science, formulate philosophy, and dogmatize <a href="/en/topic/truth">truth</a> because he is mentally lazy in adjusting to the progressive struggles of living, while he is also terribly afraid of the <a href="/en/topic/unknown">unknown</a>. Natural man is slow to initiate changes in his habits of thinking and in his techniques of living.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p3_4">132:3.4</a></small></sup>  Revealed truth, personally discovered truth, is the supreme delight of the human <a href="/en/topic/soul">soul</a>; it is the joint creation of the material mind and the indwelling spirit. The eternal salvation of this truth-discerning and beauty-loving soul is assured by that hunger and thirst for goodness which leads this mortal to develop a singleness of purpose to do the Father’s will, to find <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and to become like him. There is never conflict between true knowledge and truth. There may be conflict between knowledge and human beliefs, beliefs colored with prejudice, distorted by fear, and dominated by the dread of facing new facts of material discovery or spiritual progress.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p3_5">132:3.5</a></small></sup>  But <a href="/en/topic/truth">truth</a> can never become man’s possession without the exercise of <a href="/en/topic/faith">faith</a>. This is true because man’s thoughts, wisdom, ethics, and ideals will never rise higher than his faith, his sublime hope. And all such true faith is predicated on profound reflection, sincere self-criticism, and uncompromising moral consciousness. Faith is the inspiration of the spiritized creative imagination.</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p3_6">132:3.6</a></small></sup>  Faith acts to release the superhuman activities of the divine spark, the immortal germ, that lives within the mind of man, and which is the potential of eternal <a href="/en/topic/survival_(of_mortal_death)">survival</a>. Plants and animals survive in time by the technique of passing on from one generation to another identical particles of themselves. The human soul (personality) of man survives mortal death by identity association with this indwelling spark of divinity, which is immortal, and which functions to perpetuate the human personality upon a continuing and higher level of progressive universe existence. The concealed seed of the human soul is an immortal spirit. The second generation of the soul is <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> of a succession of personality manifestations of spiritual and progressing existences, terminating only when this divine entity attains the source of its existence, the personal source of all existence, <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p3_7">132:3.7</a></small></sup>  Human life continues—survives—because it has a universe function, the task of finding God. The faith-activated soul of man cannot stop short of the attainment of this <a href="/en/topic/goals">goal</a> of destiny; and when it does once achieve this divine goal, it can never end because it has become like God—eternal.</p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p3_8">132:3.8</a></small></sup>  Spiritual evolution is an experience of the increasing and voluntary choice of goodness attended by an equal and progressive diminution of the possibility of evil. With the attainment of finality of choice for goodness and of completed capacity for <a href="/en/topic/truth">truth</a> appreciation, there comes into existence a perfection of beauty and holiness whose righteousness eternally inhibits the possibility of the emergence of even the concept of potential evil. Such a God-knowing soul casts no shadow of doubting evil when functioning on such a high spirit level of divine goodness.</p>
<p id="p3_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p3_9">132:3.9</a></small></sup>  The presence of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> spirit in the mind of man constitutes the revelation promise and the <a href="/en/topic/faith">faith</a> pledge of an eternal existence of divine progression for every soul seeking to achieve identity with this immortal and indwelling spirit fragment of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p3_10">132:3.10</a></small></sup>  Universe <a href="/en/topic/progress">progress</a> is characterized by increasing personality freedom because it is associated with the progressive attainment of higher and higher levels of self-understanding and consequent voluntary self-restraint. The attainment of <a href="/en/topic/perfection">perfection</a> of spiritual self-restraint equals completeness of universe freedom and personal <a href="/en/topic/liberty">liberty</a>. Faith fosters and maintains man’s soul in the midst of the confusion of his early orientation in such a vast universe, whereas <a href="/en/topic/prayer">prayer</a> becomes the great unifier of the various inspirations of the creative imagination and the faith urges of a soul trying to identify itself with the spirit ideals of the indwelling and associated divine presence.</p>
<p id="p3_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p3_11">132:3.11</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Nabon">Nabon</a> was greatly impressed by these words, as he was by each of his talks with <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. These truths continued to burn within his heart, and he was of great assistance to the later arriving preachers of Jesus’ gospel.</p>
<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 4. PERSONAL MINISTRY </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p4_1">132:4.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> did not devote all his leisure while in <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a> to this work of preparing men and women to become future disciples in the oncoming kingdom. He spent much time gaining an intimate knowledge of all races and classes of men who lived in this, the largest and most cosmopolitan city of the world. In each of these numerous human contacts Jesus had a double purpose: He desired to learn their reactions to the life they were living in the flesh, and he was also minded to say or do something to make that life richer and more worth while. His religious teachings during these weeks were no different than those which characterized his later life as teacher of the twelve and preacher to the multitudes.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p4_2">132:4.2</a></small></sup>  Always the burden of his message was: the fact of the heavenly Father’s love and the truth of his mercy, coupled with the good news that man is a faith-son of this same <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> of love. Jesus’ usual technique of social contact was to draw people out and into talking with him by asking them questions. The interview would usually begin by his asking them questions and end by their asking him questions. He was equally adept in teaching by either asking or answering questions. As a rule, to those he taught the most, he said the least. Those who derived most benefit from his personal ministry were overburdened, anxious, and dejected <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> who gained much relief because of the opportunity to unburden their souls to a sympathetic and understanding listener, and he was all that and more. And when these maladjusted human beings had told Jesus about their troubles, always was he able to offer practical and immediately helpful suggestions looking toward the correction of their real difficulties, albeit he did not neglect to speak words of present comfort and immediate consolation. And invariably would he tell these distressed mortals about the love of God and impart the information, by various and sundry methods, that they were the children of this loving Father in heaven.</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p4_3">132:4.3</a></small></sup>  In this manner, during the sojourn in <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> personally came into affectionate and uplifting contact with upward of five hundred mortals of the realm. He thus gained a knowledge of the different races of mankind which he could never have acquired in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and hardly even in <a href="/en/topic/Alexandria">Alexandria</a>.

<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p4_4">132:4.4</a></small></sup>  As might have been expected, such a versatile and aggressive man could not thus function for six months in the world’s metropolis without being approached by numerous persons who desired to secure his services in connection with some business or, more often, for some project of teaching, social reform, or religious movement. More than a dozen such proffers were made, and he utilized each one as an opportunity for imparting some thought of spiritual ennoblement by well-chosen words or by some obliging service. Jesus was very fond of doing things—even little things—for all sorts of people.</p>
<p id="p4_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p4_5">132:4.5</a></small></sup>  He talked with a <a href="/en/topic/Roman_senator">Roman senator</a> on politics and statesmanship, and this one contact with <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> made such an impression on this legislator that he spent the rest of his life vainly trying to induce his colleagues to change the course of the ruling policy from the idea of the government supporting and feeding the people to that of the people supporting the government. Jesus spent one evening with a wealthy slaveholder, talked about man as a son of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, and the next day this man, <a href="/en/topic/Claudius">Claudius</a>, gave freedom to one hundred and seventeen <a href="/en/topic/slaves">slaves</a>. He visited at dinner with a <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> physician, telling him that his patients had minds and souls as well as bodies, and thus led this able doctor to attempt a more far-reaching ministry to his fellow men. He talked with all sorts of people in every walk of life. The only place in <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a> he did not visit was the <a href="/en/topic/public_baths">public baths</a>. He refused to accompany his friends to the <a href="/en/topic/bathing">baths</a> because of the <a href="/en/topic/sex">sex</a> promiscuity which there prevailed.</p>

Dare to do justice and be big enough to show mercy. Compel your lower nature to obey your higher nature as you obey your superiors. Revere goodness and exalt truth. Choose the beautiful in place of the ugly. Love your fellows and reach out for God with a whole heart, for God is your Father in heaven.”</p>
<p id="p4_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p4_7">132:4.7</a></small></sup>  To the speaker at the forum he said: “Your eloquence is pleasing, your logic is admirable, your voice is pleasant, but your teaching is hardly true. If you could only enjoy the inspiring satisfaction of knowing <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> as your spiritual Father, then you might employ your powers of speech to liberate your fellows from the bondage of darkness and from the slavery of ignorance.” This was the <a href="/en/topic/Marcus">Marcus</a> who heard <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> preach in <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a> and became his successor<sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup>. When they crucified <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a>, it was this man who defied the Roman persecutors and boldly continued to preach the new gospel.</p>

Woe upon any nation when only those who possess money and influence can secure ready justice before its <a href="/en/topic/courts">courts</a>! It is the sacred duty of a magistrate to acquit the innocent as well as to punish the guilty. Upon the impartiality, fairness, and integrity of its courts the endurance of a nation depends. Civil <a href="/en/topic/government">government</a> is founded on justice, even as true religion is founded on mercy.” The judge reopened the case, and when the evidence had been sifted, he discharged the prisoner. Of all Jesus’ activities during these days of personal ministry, this came the nearest to being a public appearance.</p>

<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_1">132:5.1</a></small></sup>  A certain rich man, a Roman citizen and a Stoic, became greatly interested in <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ teaching, having been introduced by <a href="/en/topic/Angamon">Angamon</a>. After many intimate conferences this wealthy citizen asked Jesus what he would do with <a href="/en/topic/wealth">wealth</a> if he had it, and Jesus answered him: “I would bestow material wealth for the enhancement of material life, even as I would minister knowledge, wisdom, and spiritual service for the enrichment of the intellectual life, the ennoblement of the social life, and the advancement of the spiritual life. I would administer material wealth as a wise and effective trustee of the resources of one generation for the benefit and ennoblement of the next and succeeding generations.”</p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_2">132:5.2</a></small></sup>  But the rich man was not fully satisfied with Jesus’ answer. He made bold to ask again: “But what do you think a man in my position should do with his wealth? Should I keep it, or should I give it away?” And when Jesus perceived that he really desired to know more of the truth about his loyalty to <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and his duty to men, he further answered: “My good friend, I discern that you are a sincere seeker after wisdom and an honest lover of truth; therefore am I minded to lay before you my view of the solution of your problems having to do with the responsibilities of wealth. I do this because you have <i>asked</i> for my <a href="/en/topic/counsel">counsel</a>, and in giving you this <a href="/en/topic/advice">advice</a>, I am not concerned with the wealth of any other rich man; I am offering advice only to you and for your personal guidance. If you honestly desire to regard your wealth as a trust, if you really wish to become a wise and efficient steward of your accumulated wealth, then would I counsel you to make the following analysis of the sources of your riches: Ask yourself, and do your best to find the honest answer, whence came this wealth? And as a help in the study of the sources of your great fortune, I would suggest that you bear in mind the following ten different methods of amassing material wealth:</p>

You are under moral obligation to represent the past generation in the honest transmittal of legitimate wealth to succeeding generations after subtracting a fair toll for the benefit of the present generation. But you are not obligated to perpetuate any dishonesty or injustice involved in the unfair accumulation of wealth by your ancestors. Any portion of your inherited wealth which turns out to have been derived through fraud or unfairness, you may disburse in accordance with your convictions of justice, generosity, and restitution. The remainder of your legitimate inherited wealth you may use in equity and transmit in security as the trustee of one generation for another.

While the discoverer should not be denied all reward for efforts of discovery, neither should he selfishly presume to lay claim to all of the advantages and blessings to be derived from the uncovering of nature’s hoarded resources.</p>

The honest trader should not hesitate to take the same profit which he would gladly accord his fellow trader in a similar transaction.

He and <a href="/en/topic/Ganid">Ganid</a> were on their way to the libraries, but they devoted themselves to getting the child back home. Ganid never forgot Jesus’ comment: “You know, Ganid, most human beings are like the lost child. They spend much of their time crying in fear and suffering in sorrow when, in very truth, they are but a short distance from safety and security, even as this child was only a little way from home. And all those who know the way of truth and enjoy the assurance of knowing <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> should esteem it a privilege, not a duty, to offer guidance to their fellows in their efforts to find the satisfactions of living. Did we not supremely enjoy this ministry of restoring the child to his mother? So do those who lead men to God experience the supreme satisfaction of human service.” And from that day forward, for the remainder of his natural life, Ganid was continually on the lookout for lost children whom he might restore to their homes.</p>

On their visit to the northern Italian lakes Jesus had the long talk with Ganid concerning the impossibility of teaching a man about <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> if the man does not desire to know God. They had casually met a <a href="/en/topic/thoughtless_pagan">thoughtless pagan</a> while on their journey up to the lakes, and Ganid was surprised that Jesus did not follow out his usual practice of enlisting the man in conversation which would naturally lead up to the discussion of spiritual questions. When Ganid asked his teacher why he evinced so little interest in this pagan, Jesus answered:</p>
<p id="p7_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p7_2">132:7.2</a></small></sup>  “Ganid, the man was not hungry for truth. He was not dissatisfied with himself.

Or, if we could have him live with us, we might by our lives show him the Father in heaven, and thus would he become so attracted by our lives as sons of God that he would be constrained to inquire about our Father. You cannot reveal God to those who do not seek for him; you cannot lead unwilling souls into the joys of salvation. Man must become hungry for truth as a result of the experiences of living, or he must desire to know God as the result of contact with the lives of those who are acquainted with the divine Father before another human being can act as the means of leading such a fellow mortal to the Father in heaven. If we know God, our real business on earth is so to live as to permit the Father to reveal himself in our lives, and thus will all God-seeking persons see the Father and ask for our help in finding out more about the God who in this manner finds expression in our lives.”</p>

<p id="p7_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p7_4">132:7.4</a></small></sup>  “Your Buddha was much better than your Buddhism. Buddha was a great man, even a prophet to his people, but he was an orphan prophet; by that I mean that he early lost sight of his spiritual Father, the Father in heaven. His experience was tragic. He tried to live and teach as a messenger of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, but without God. Buddha guided his ship of salvation right up to the safe harbor, right up to the entrance to the haven of mortal salvation, and there, because of faulty charts of navigation, the good ship ran aground. There it has rested these many generations, motionless and almost hopelessly stranded. And thereon have many of your people remained all these years. They live within hailing distance of the safe waters of rest, but they refuse to enter because the noble craft of the good Buddha met the misfortune of grounding just outside the harbor. And the Buddhist peoples never will enter this harbor unless they abandon the philosophic craft of their prophet and seize upon his noble spirit. Had your people remained true to the spirit of Buddha, you would have long since entered your haven of spirit tranquillity, soul rest, and assurance of salvation.</p>

Buddha, failing to envision God as a spirit and as a Father, failed to provide in his teaching the moral energy and the spiritual driving power which a religion must possess if it is to change a race and exalt a nation.”</p>
<p id="p7_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p7_6">132:7.6</a></small></sup>  Then exclaimed <a href="/en/topic/Ganid">Ganid</a>: “Teacher, let’s you and I make a new religion, one good enough for <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a> and big enough for <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a>, and maybe we can trade it to the Jews for <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a>.” And <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> replied: “Ganid, religions are not made. The religions of men grow up over long periods of time, while the revelations of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> flash upon earth in the lives of the men who reveal God to their fellows.” But they did not comprehend the meaning of these prophetic words.</p>
<p id="p7_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p7_7">132:7.7</a></small></sup>  That night after they had retired, Ganid could not sleep. He talked a long time with his father and finally said, “You know, father, I sometimes think <a href="/en/topic/Joshua_(Jesus)">Joshua</a> is a prophet.” And his father only sleepily replied, “My son, there are others —”</p>
<p id="p7_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p7_8">132:7.8</a></small></sup>  From this day, for the remainder of his natural life, <a href="/en/topic/Ganid">Ganid</a> continued to evolve a religion of his own. He was mightily moved in his own mind by <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ broadmindedness, fairness, and tolerance. In all their discussions of philosophy and religion this youth never experienced feelings of resentment or reactions of antagonism.</p>
<p id="p7_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p7_9">132:7.9</a></small></sup>  What a scene for the celestial intelligences to behold, this spectacle of the Indian lad proposing to the Creator of a universe that they make a new religion! And though the young man did not know it, they were making a new and everlasting religion right then and there—this new way of salvation, the revelation of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> to man through, and in, Jesus. That which the lad wanted most to do he was unconsciously actually doing. And it was, and is, ever thus. That which the enlightened and reflective human imagination of spiritual teaching and leading wholeheartedly and unselfishly wants to do and be, becomes measurably creative in accordance with the degree of mortal dedication to the divine doing of the Father’s will. When man goes in <a href="/en/topic/partnership">partnership</a> with God, great things may, and do, happen.</p>
