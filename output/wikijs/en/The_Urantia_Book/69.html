They include industry, property, <a href="/en/topic/war">war</a> for gain, and all the regulative machinery of society. Sooner or later the <a href="/en/topic/fear">fear</a> instinct fosters the establishment of these institutions of survival by means of taboo, convention, and religious sanction.

But civilization has never evolved distinctive institutions of self-gratification.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p1_6">69:1.6</a></small></sup>  These three groups of social practices are intimately interrelated and minutely interdependent the one upon the other.

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p2_1">69:2.1</a></small></sup>  Primitive <a href="/en/topic/industry">industry</a> slowly grew up as an <a href="/en/topic/insurance">insurance</a> against the terrors of famine. Early in his existence man began to draw lessons from some of the animals that, during a harvest of plenty, store up food against the days of scarcity.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_1"><a href="#fn_s2_1_1">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p2_2">69:2.2</a></small></sup>  Before the dawn of early frugality and primitive industry the lot of the average tribe was one of destitution and real <a href="/en/topic/suffering">suffering</a>. Early man had to compete with the whole animal world for his food. <a href="/en/topic/competition">Competition-gravity</a> ever pulls man down toward the beast level; <a href="/en/topic/poverty">poverty</a> is his natural and tyrannical estate. Wealth is not a natural gift; it results from labor, knowledge, and organization.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_2_1"><a href="#fn_s2_2_1">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p2_3">69:2.3</a></small></sup>  Primitive man was not slow to recognize the advantages of association. Association led to organization, and <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> result of organization was division of <a href="/en/topic/labor">labor</a>, with its immediate saving of time and materials. These specializations of labor arose by adaptation to pressure—pursuing the paths of lessened <a href="/en/topic/resistance">resistance</a>. Primitive savages never did any real work cheerfully or willingly. With them conformity was due to the coercion of necessity.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p2_4">69:2.4</a></small></sup>  Primitive man disliked hard work, and he would not <a href="/en/topic/haste">hurry</a> unless confronted by grave danger. The time element in labor, the idea of doing a given task within a certain time limit, is entirely a modern notion. The ancients were never rushed. It was the double demands of the intense struggle for existence and of the ever-advancing standards of living that drove the naturally inactive races of early man into avenues of <a href="/en/topic/industry">industry</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p2_5">69:2.5</a></small></sup>  Labor, the efforts of design, distinguishes man from the beast, whose exertions are largely instinctive. The necessity for <a href="/en/topic/labor">labor</a> is man’s paramount blessing. The <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia_one_hundred">Prince’s staff</a> all worked; they did much to ennoble physical labor on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> was a gardener; the <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> of the <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a> labored—he was the creator and upholder of all things. The Hebrews were <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> tribe to put a supreme premium on industry; they were the first people to decree that “he who does not work shall not eat<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>.” But many of the religions of the world reverted to the early ideal of idleness. <a href="/en/topic/Jupiter_(god)">Jupiter</a> was a reveler, and <a href="/en/topic/Buddha">Buddha</a> became a reflective devotee of leisure.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_5_8"><a href="#fn_a2_5_8">[3]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_5_2"><a href="#fn_s2_5_2">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_5_7"><a href="#fn_s2_5_7">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p2_6">69:2.6</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Sangiks">Sangik</a> tribes were fairly industrious when residing away from the tropics. But there was a long, long struggle between the lazy devotees of <a href="/en/topic/magic">magic</a> and the apostles of work—those who exercised foresight.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_6_19"><a href="#fn_a2_6_19">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p2_7">69:2.7</a></small></sup>  The first human foresight was directed toward the preservation of fire, water, and food. But primitive man was a natural-born <a href="/en/topic/gambling">gambler</a>; he always wanted to get something for nothing, and all too often during these early times the success which accrued from patient practice was attributed to <a href="/en/topic/charms">charms</a>. Magic was slow to give way before foresight, self-denial, and <a href="/en/topic/industry">industry</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_7_1"><a href="#fn_s2_7_1">[4]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. THE SPECIALIZATION OF LABOR </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p3_1">69:3.1</a></small></sup>  The divisions of <a href="/en/topic/labor">labor</a> in primitive society were determined first by natural, and then by social, circumstances. The early order of specialization in labor was:</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p3_2">69:3.2</a></small></sup>  1. <i>Specialization based on sex.</i> Woman’s work was derived from the selective presence of the <a href="/en/topic/children">child</a>; <a href="/en/topic/women">women</a> naturally love <a href="/en/topic/babies">babies</a> more than men do. Thus woman became the routine worker, while man became the hunter and fighter, engaging in accentuated periods of work and rest.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_2_21"><a href="#fn_a3_2_21">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p3_3">69:3.3</a></small></sup>  All down through the ages the taboos have operated to keep woman strictly in her own field. Man has most selfishly chosen the more agreeable work, leaving the routine <a href="/en/topic/drudgery">drudgery</a> to woman. Man has always been ashamed to do woman’s work, but woman has never shown any reluctance to doing man’s work. But strange to record, both men and women have always worked together in building and furnishing the home.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p3_4">69:3.4</a></small></sup>  2. <i>Modification consequent upon age and disease.</i> These differences determined the next division of <a href="/en/topic/labor">labor</a>. The old men and cripples were early set to work making <a href="/en/topic/tools">tools</a> and <a href="/en/topic/weapons">weapons</a>. They were later assigned to building irrigation works.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p3_5">69:3.5</a></small></sup>  3. <i>Differentiation based on religion.</i> The medicine men were <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> human beings to be exempted from physical toil; they were the pioneer professional class. The smiths were a small group who competed with the medicine men as magicians. Their skill in working with metals made the people afraid of them. The “white smiths” and the “<a href="/en/topic/black_smiths">black smiths</a>” gave origin to the early beliefs in white and black magic. And this belief later became involved in the superstition of good and bad ghosts, good and bad spirits.</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p3_6">69:3.6</a></small></sup>  Smiths were the first nonreligious group to enjoy special privileges. They were regarded as neutrals during war, and this extra leisure led to their becoming, as a class, the politicians of primitive society. But through gross abuse of these privileges the smiths became universally hated, and the medicine men lost no time in fostering hatred for their competitors. In this first contest between science and religion, religion (superstition) won. After being driven out of the villages, the smiths maintained the first <a href="/en/topic/inns">inns</a>, public lodginghouses, on the outskirts of the settlements.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_6_13"><a href="#fn_a3_6_13">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p3_7">69:3.7</a></small></sup>  4. <i><a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and slave.</i> The next differentiation of <a href="/en/topic/labor">labor</a> grew out of the relations of the conqueror to the conquered, and that meant the beginning of human <a href="/en/topic/slavery">slavery</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p3_8">69:3.8</a></small></sup>  5. <i>Differentiation based on diverse physical and mental endowments.</i> Further divisions of labor were favored by the inherent differences in men; all human beings are not born <a href="/en/topic/equality">equal</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_8_2"><a href="#fn_a3_8_2">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_8_1"><a href="#fn_a3_8_1">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p3_9">69:3.9</a></small></sup>  The early specialists in industry were the <a href="/en/topic/flint">flint</a> flakers and <a href="/en/topic/stone_masons">stone masons</a>; next came the smiths. Subsequently group specialization developed; whole families and clans dedicated themselves to certain sorts of <a href="/en/topic/labor">labor</a>. The origin of one of the earliest castes of priests, apart from the tribal medicine men, was due to the superstitious exaltation of a family of expert <a href="/en/topic/black_smiths">swordmakers</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p3_10">69:3.10</a></small></sup>  The first group specialists in industry were rock <a href="/en/topic/salt">salt</a> exporters and <a href="/en/topic/potters">potters</a>. Women made the plain pottery and men the fancy. Among some tribes sewing and weaving were done by women, in others by the men.</p>
<p id="p3_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p3_11">69:3.11</a></small></sup>  The early traders were <a href="/en/topic/women">women</a>; they were employed as <a href="/en/topic/spies">spies</a>, carrying on <a href="/en/topic/commerce">commerce</a> as a side line. Presently trade expanded, the <a href="/en/topic/mothers">women</a> acting as intermediaries—jobbers. Then came the merchant class, charging a commission, <a href="/en/topic/profit">profit</a>, for their services. Growth of group barter developed into commerce; and following the exchange of commodities came the exchange of skilled <a href="/en/topic/labor">labor</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_11_1"><a href="#fn_a3_11_1">[8]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 4. THE BEGINNINGS OF TRADE </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p4_1">69:4.1</a></small></sup>  Just as <a href="/en/topic/marriage">marriage</a> by contract followed marriage by capture, so <a href="/en/topic/commerce">trade</a> by <a href="/en/topic/barter">barter</a> followed seizure by raids. But a long period of piracy intervened between the early practices of silent barter and the later trade by modern exchange methods.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p4_2">69:4.2</a></small></sup>  The first barter was conducted by armed traders who would leave their goods on a neutral spot. <a href="/en/topic/women">Women</a> held <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> markets; they were the earliest traders, and this was because they were the burden bearers; the men were warriors. Very early the trading counter was developed, a wall wide enough to prevent the traders reaching each other with weapons.</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p4_3">69:4.3</a></small></sup>  A <a href="/en/topic/fetishes">fetish</a> was used to stand guard over the deposits of goods for silent <a href="/en/topic/barter">barter</a>. Such <a href="/en/topic/market_places">market places</a> were secure against theft; nothing would be removed except by barter or purchase; with a fetish on guard the goods were always safe. The early traders were scrupulously honest within their own tribes but regarded it as all right to cheat distant strangers. Even the early <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a> recognized a separate code of ethics in their dealings with the gentiles.</p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p4_4">69:4.4</a></small></sup>  For ages silent barter continued before men would meet, unarmed, on the sacred market place. These same market squares became <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> places of <a href="/en/topic/sanctuary">sanctuary</a> and in some countries were later known as “<a href="/en/topic/cities">cities</a> of refuge<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.” Any fugitive reaching the market place was safe and secure against attack.</p>
<p id="p4_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p4_5">69:4.5</a></small></sup>  The first <a href="/en/topic/weights">weights</a> were grains of <a href="/en/topic/wheat">wheat</a> and other cereals. The first medium of exchange was a <a href="/en/topic/fish">fish</a> or a <a href="/en/topic/goats">goat</a>. Later the <a href="/en/topic/cattle">cow</a> became a unit of barter.</p>
<p id="p4_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p4_6">69:4.6</a></small></sup>  Modern <a href="/en/topic/writing">writing</a> originated in the early <a href="/en/topic/commerce">trade</a> records; <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> literature of man was a trade-promotion document, a <a href="/en/topic/salt">salt</a> advertisement. Many of the earlier wars were fought over <a href="/en/topic/natural_resources">natural deposits</a>, such as <a href="/en/topic/flint">flint</a>, salt, and metals. The first formal tribal <a href="/en/topic/treaties">treaty</a> concerned the intertribalizing of a salt deposit. These treaty spots afforded opportunity for friendly and peaceful interchange of ideas and the intermingling of various tribes.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_6_2"><a href="#fn_s4_6_2">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s4_6_7"><a href="#fn_s4_6_7">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p4_7">69:4.7</a></small></sup>  Writing progressed up through the stages of the “<a href="/en/topic/message_stick">message stick</a>,” <a href="/en/topic/cords,_knotted">knotted cords</a>, picture writing, <a href="/en/topic/hieroglyphics">hieroglyphics</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/wampum_belts">wampum belts</a>, to the early symbolic alphabets. Message sending evolved from the primitive <a href="/en/topic/smoke_signals">smoke signal</a> up through runners, animal riders, railroads, and airplanes, as well as telegraph, telephone, and wireless communication.</p>
<p id="p4_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p4_8">69:4.8</a></small></sup>  New ideas and better methods were carried around the inhabited world by the ancient traders. <a href="/en/topic/commerce">Commerce</a>, linked with adventure, led to <a href="/en/topic/exploration">exploration</a> and <a href="/en/topic/discoveries">discovery</a>.

<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p5_1">69:5.1</a></small></sup>  Capital is labor applied as a renunciation of the present in favor of the future. Savings represent a form of maintenance and survival insurance. Food hoarding developed <a href="/en/topic/self-control">self-control</a> and created <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> problems of <a href="/en/topic/capital">capital</a> and labor. The man who had <a href="/en/topic/food">food</a>, provided he could protect it from robbers, had a distinct advantage over the man who had no food.</p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p5_2">69:5.2</a></small></sup>  The early <a href="/en/topic/banking">banker</a> was the valorous man of the tribe. He held the group treasures on deposit, while the entire clan would defend his hut in event of attack.

<p id="p9_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_1">69:9.1</a></small></sup>  While primitive society was virtually communal, primitive man did not adhere to the modern doctrines of <a href="/en/topic/communism">communism</a>. The communism of these early times was not a mere theory or social doctrine; it was a simple and practical automatic adjustment. Communism prevented pauperism and want; <a href="/en/topic/begging">begging</a> and <a href="/en/topic/prostitution">prostitution</a> were almost unknown among these ancient tribes.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s9_1_1"><a href="#fn_s9_1_1">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p9_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_2">69:9.2</a></small></sup>  Primitive communism did not especially level men down, nor did it exalt mediocrity, but it did put a premium on inactivity and idleness, and it did stifle industry and destroy ambition. Communism was indispensable <a href="/en/topic/scaffolding">scaffolding</a> in the growth of primitive society, but it gave way to the evolution of a higher social order because it ran counter to four strong human proclivities:<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s9_2_0"><a href="#fn_s9_2_0">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s9_2_6"><a href="#fn_s9_2_6">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p9_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_3">69:9.3</a></small></sup>  1. <i>The <a href="/en/topic/family">family</a>.</i> Man not only craves to accumulate property; he desires to bequeath his <a href="/en/topic/capital">capital</a> goods to his progeny. But in early communal society a man’s capital was either immediately consumed or distributed among the group at his death. There was no <a href="/en/topic/inheritance">inheritance</a> of property—the inheritance <a href="/en/topic/taxation">tax</a> was one hundred per cent. The later capital-accumulation and property-inheritance mores were a distinct social advance. And this is true notwithstanding the subsequent gross abuses attendant upon the misuse of capital.</p>
<p id="p9_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_4">69:9.4</a></small></sup>  2. <i>Religious tendencies.</i> Primitive man also wanted to save up property as a nucleus for starting life in the next existence. This motive explains why it was so long the custom to bury a man’s personal belongings with him. The ancients believed that only the rich survived death with any immediate pleasure and dignity. The teachers of revealed <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a>, more especially the Christian teachers, were <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> to proclaim that the poor could have salvation on equal terms with the rich.</p>
<p id="p9_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_5">69:9.5</a></small></sup>  3. <i>The desire for liberty and leisure.</i> In the earlier days of social evolution the apportionment of individual earnings among the group was virtually a form of slavery; the worker was made slave to the idler. This was the suicidal weakness of <a href="/en/topic/communism">communism</a>: The improvident habitually lived off the thrifty. Even in modern times the improvident depend on the state (thrifty <a href="/en/topic/taxpayers">taxpayers</a>) to take care of them. Those who have no capital still expect those who have to feed them.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a9_5_12"><a href="#fn_a9_5_12">[19]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s9_5_4"><a href="#fn_s9_5_4">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p9_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_6">69:9.6</a></small></sup>  4. <i>The urge for security and power.</i> Communism was finally destroyed by the deceptive practices of progressive and successful individuals who resorted to diverse subterfuges in an effort to escape enslavement to the shiftless idlers of their tribes. But at first all hoarding was secret; primitive insecurity prevented the outward accumulation of capital. And even at a later time it was most dangerous to amass too much <a href="/en/topic/wealth">wealth</a>; the king would be sure to trump up some charge for confiscating a rich man’s property, and when a wealthy man died, the <a href="/en/topic/funerals">funeral</a> was held up until the family donated a large sum to public welfare or to the king, an inheritance <a href="/en/topic/taxation">tax</a>.</p>
<p id="p9_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_7">69:9.7</a></small></sup>  In earliest times <a href="/en/topic/women">women</a> were the property of the community, and the mother dominated the <a href="/en/topic/family">family</a>. The early chiefs owned all the land and were proprietors of all the <a href="/en/topic/mothers">women</a>; <a href="/en/topic/marriage">marriage</a> required the consent of the tribal ruler. With the passing of communism, women were held individually, and the father gradually assumed domestic control. Thus the home had its beginning, and the prevailing polygamous customs were gradually displaced by monogamy. (Polygamy is the survival of the female-slavery element in marriage. Monogamy is the slave-free ideal of the matchless association of one man and one woman in the exquisite enterprise of home building, offspring rearing, mutual culture, and self-improvement.)<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a9_7_9"><a href="#fn_a9_7_9">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a9_7_25"><a href="#fn_a9_7_25">[23]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s9_7_9"><a href="#fn_s9_7_9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s9_7_8"><a href="#fn_s9_7_8">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p9_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_8">69:9.8</a></small></sup>  At first, all property, including tools and weapons, was the common possession of the tribe. <a href="/en/topic/private_property">Private property</a> first consisted of all things personally touched. If a stranger drank from a cup, the cup was henceforth his. Next, any place where <a href="/en/topic/blood">blood</a> was shed became the property of the injured person or group.</p>
<p id="p9_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_9">69:9.9</a></small></sup>  Private property was thus originally respected because it was supposed to be charged with some part of the owner’s personality. Property <a href="/en/topic/honesty">honesty</a> rested safely on this type of superstition; no police were needed to guard personal belongings. There was no stealing within the group, though men did not hesitate to appropriate the goods of other tribes. Property relations did not end with death; early, personal effects were burned, then buried with the dead, and later, inherited by the surviving family or by the tribe.</p>
<p id="p9_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_10">69:9.10</a></small></sup>  The ornamental type of personal effects originated in the wearing of <a href="/en/topic/charms">charms</a>. Vanity plus ghost fear led early man to resist all attempts to relieve him of his favorite charms, such property being valued above necessities.</p>
<p id="p9_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_11">69:9.11</a></small></sup>  Sleeping space was one of man’s earliest properties. Later, homesites were assigned by the tribal chiefs, who held all real estate in trust for the group. Presently a fire site conferred ownership; and still later, a well constituted title to the adjacent land<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b13"><a href="#fn_b13">[13]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p9_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_12">69:9.12</a></small></sup>  Water holes and <a href="/en/topic/wells">wells</a> were among <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> private possessions. The whole <a href="/en/topic/fetishes">fetish</a> practice was utilized to guard <a href="/en/topic/water">water</a> holes, wells, trees, crops, and honey. Following the loss of faith in the fetish, laws were evolved to protect private belongings. But game laws, the right to hunt, long preceded land laws. The American <a href="/en/topic/red_race">red man</a> never understood <a href="/en/topic/private_property">private ownership</a> of land; he could not comprehend the white man’s view.</p>
<p id="p9_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_13">69:9.13</a></small></sup>  Private property was early marked by family insignia, and this is the early origin of <a href="/en/topic/family_crests">family crests</a>. Real estate could also be put under the watchcare of spirits. The priests would “consecrate” a piece of <a href="/en/topic/land">land</a>, and it would then rest under the protection of the magic <a href="/en/topic/taboos">taboos</a> erected thereon. Owners thereof were said to have a “<a href="/en/topic/priest’s_title">priest’s title</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b14"><a href="#fn_b14">[14]</a></sup>.” The <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a> had great respect for these family landmarks: “Cursed be he who removes his neighbor’s landmark<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b15"><a href="#fn_b15">[15]</a></sup>.” These stone markers bore the priest’s initials. Even trees, when initialed, became private property.</p>
<p id="p9_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_14">69:9.14</a></small></sup>  In early days only the crops were private, but successive crops conferred title; <a href="/en/topic/agriculture">agriculture</a> was thus the genesis of the <a href="/en/topic/private_property">private ownership</a> of land. Individuals were first given only a life tenureship; at death land reverted to the tribe. The very first land titles granted by tribes to individuals were <a href="/en/topic/graves">graves</a>—family burying grounds. In later times land belonged to those who fenced it. But the <a href="/en/topic/cities">cities</a> always reserved certain lands for public pasturage and for use in case of siege; these “commons” represent the survival of the earlier form of collective ownership.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a9_14_6"><a href="#fn_a9_14_6">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a9_14_20"><a href="#fn_a9_14_20">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p9_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/69#p9_15">69:9.15</a></small></sup>  Eventually the state assigned property to the individual, reserving the right of taxation. Having made secure their titles, landlords could collect rents, and <a href="/en/topic/land">land</a> became a source of income—capital. Finally land became truly negotiable, with sales, transfers, mortgages, and foreclosures.</p>
