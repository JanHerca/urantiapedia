<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p0_1">97:0.1</a></small></sup>  THE spiritual leaders of the <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a> did what no others before them had ever succeeded in doing—they deanthropomorphized their <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> concept without converting it into an abstraction of <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> comprehensible only to philosophers. Even common people were able to regard the matured concept of <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a> as a Father, if not of the individual, at least of the race.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p0_2">97:0.2</a></small></sup>  The concept of the <a href="/en/topic/personality">personality</a> of God, while clearly taught at <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> in the days of <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a>, was vague and hazy at the time of the flight from <a href="/en/topic/Egypt">Egypt</a> and only gradually evolved in the Hebraic mind from generation to generation in response to the teaching of the spiritual leaders. The perception of Yahweh’s personality was much more continuous in its progressive evolution than was that of many other of the Deity attributes. From <a href="/en/topic/Moses">Moses</a> to <a href="/en/topic/Malachi">Malachi</a> there occurred an almost unbroken ideational growth of the personality of God in the Hebrew mind, and this concept was eventually heightened and glorified by the teachings of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> about the Father in heaven.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. SAMUEL—FIRST OF THE HEBREW PROPHETS </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p1_1">97:1.1</a></small></sup>  Hostile pressure of the surrounding peoples in <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a> soon taught the Hebrew sheiks they could not hope to survive unless they confederated their tribal organizations into a centralized government. And this centralization of administrative authority afforded a better opportunity for <a href="/en/topic/Samuel">Samuel</a> to function as a teacher and reformer<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p1_2">97:1.2</a></small></sup>  Samuel sprang from a long line of the <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> teachers who had persisted in maintaining the truths of <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> as a part of their worship forms. This teacher was a virile and resolute man. Only his great devotion, coupled with his extraordinary determination, enabled him to withstand the almost universal opposition which he encountered when he started out to turn all <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a> back to the worship of the supreme <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a> of Mosaic times. And even then he was only partially successful; he won back to the service of the higher concept of Yahweh only the more intelligent half of the <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a>; the other half continued in the worship of the tribal gods of the country and in the baser conception of Yahweh.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p1_3">97:1.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Samuel">Samuel</a> was a rough-and-ready type of man, a practical reformer who could go out in one day with his associates and overthrow a score of <a href="/en/topic/Baal">Baal</a> sites<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>. The progress he made was by sheer force of compulsion; he did little preaching, less teaching, but he did act. One day he was mocking the priest of Baal; the next, chopping in pieces a captive king<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>. He devotedly believed in the one <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, and he had a clear concept of that one God as creator of heaven and earth: “The pillars of the earth are the Lord’s, and he has set the world upon them<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p1_4">97:1.4</a></small></sup>  But the great contribution which Samuel made to the development of the concept of <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> was his ringing pronouncement that <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a> was <i>changeless,</i> forever the same embodiment of unerring perfection and divinity. In these times Yahweh was conceived to be a fitful God of jealous whims, always regretting that he had done thus and so; but now, for <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> time since the <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a> sallied forth from <a href="/en/topic/Egypt">Egypt</a>, they heard these startling words, “The Strength of <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a> will not lie nor repent, for he is not a man, that he should repent.” Stability in dealing with Divinity was proclaimed<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>. Samuel reiterated the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> covenant with <a href="/en/topic/Abraham_(Old_Testament)">Abraham</a> and declared that the <a href="/en/topic/Lord_God_of_Israel">Lord God of Israel</a> was the source of all truth, stability, and constancy. Always had the Hebrews looked upon their God as a man, a superman, an exalted spirit of unknown origin; but now they heard the onetime spirit of <a href="/en/topic/Horeb">Horeb</a> exalted as an unchanging God of creator perfection. Samuel was aiding the evolving God concept to ascend to heights above the changing state of men’s minds and the vicissitudes of mortal existence. Under his teaching, the God of the Hebrews was beginning the ascent from an idea on the order of the tribal gods to the ideal of an all-powerful and changeless Creator and <i>Supervisor</i> of all creation.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p1_5">97:1.5</a></small></sup>  And he preached anew the <a href="/en/topic/Genesis,_Book_of">story</a> of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>’s sincerity, his covenant-keeping reliability. Said <a href="/en/topic/Samuel">Samuel</a>: “The Lord will not forsake his people<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>.” “He has made with us an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and sure<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>.” And so, throughout all <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a> there sounded the call back to the worship of the supreme Yahweh. Ever this energetic teacher proclaimed, “You are great, O Lord God, for there is none like you, neither is there any God beside you<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p1_6">97:1.6</a></small></sup>  Theretofore the <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a> had regarded the favor of <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a> mainly in terms of material prosperity. It was a great shock to <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a>, and almost cost Samuel his life, when he dared to proclaim: “The Lord enriches and impoverishes; he debases and exalts. He raises the poor out of the dust and lifts up the beggars to set them among princes to make them inherit the throne of glory<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b9"><a href="#fn_b9">[9]</a></sup>.” Not since <a href="/en/topic/Moses">Moses</a> had such comforting promises for the humble and the less fortunate been proclaimed, and thousands of despairing among the poor began to take hope that they could improve their spiritual status.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p1_7">97:1.7</a></small></sup>  But <a href="/en/topic/Samuel">Samuel</a> did not progress very far beyond the concept of a tribal god. He proclaimed a Yahweh who made all men but was occupied chiefly with the Hebrews, his <a href="/en/topic/chosen_people">chosen people</a>. Even so, as in the days of Moses, once more the <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> concept portrayed a <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> who is holy and upright. “There is none as holy as the Lord. Who can be compared to this holy Lord God?”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p1_8">97:1.8</a></small></sup>  As the years passed, the grizzled old leader progressed in the understanding of God, for he declared: “The Lord is a God of knowledge, and actions are weighed by him. The Lord will <a href="/en/topic/Roman_magistrate_in_Rome">judge</a> the ends of the earth, showing mercy to the merciful, and with the upright man he will also be upright<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b11"><a href="#fn_b11">[11]</a></sup>.” Even here is the dawn of mercy, albeit it is limited to those who are merciful. Later he went one step further when, in their adversity, he exhorted his people: “Let us fall now into the hands of the Lord, for his mercies are great<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b12"><a href="#fn_b12">[12]</a></sup>.” “There is no restraint upon the Lord to save many or few<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b13"><a href="#fn_b13">[13]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p1_9">97:1.9</a></small></sup>  And this gradual development of the concept of the character of <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a> continued under the ministry of <a href="/en/topic/Samuel">Samuel</a>’s successors. They attempted to present Yahweh as a covenant-keeping <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> but hardly maintained the pace set by Samuel; they failed to develop the idea of the mercy of God as Samuel had later conceived it. There was a steady drift back toward the recognition of other gods, despite the maintenance that Yahweh was above all. “Yours is the kingdom, O Lord, and you are exalted as head above all<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b14"><a href="#fn_b14">[14]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p1_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p1_10">97:1.10</a></small></sup>  The keynote of this era was divine power; the prophets of this age preached a <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> designed to foster the king upon the Hebrew throne. “Yours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty. In your hand is power and might, and you are able to make great and to give strength to all<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b15"><a href="#fn_b15">[15]</a></sup>.” And this was the status of the God concept during the time of Samuel and his immediate successors.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. ELIJAH AND ELISHA </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p2_1">97:2.1</a></small></sup>  In the tenth century before <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a> the Hebrew nation became divided into two kingdoms. In both of these political divisions many truth teachers endeavored to stem the reactionary tide of spiritual decadence that had set in, and which continued disastrously after the war of separation. But these efforts to advance the Hebraic <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> did not prosper until that determined and fearless warrior for righteousness, <a href="/en/topic/Elijah_(Prophet)">Elijah</a>, began his teaching<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b16"><a href="#fn_b16">[16]</a></sup>. Elijah restored to the northern kingdom a concept of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> comparable with that held in the days of <a href="/en/topic/Samuel">Samuel</a>. Elijah had little opportunity to present an advanced concept of God; he was kept busy, as Samuel had been before him, overthrowing the altars of <a href="/en/topic/Baal">Baal</a> and demolishing the idols of false gods<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b17"><a href="#fn_b17">[17]</a></sup>. And he carried forward his reforms in the face of the opposition of an idolatrous monarch; his task was even more gigantic and difficult than that which Samuel had faced<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b18"><a href="#fn_b18">[18]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p2_2">97:2.2</a></small></sup>  When Elijah was called away, <a href="/en/topic/Elisha">Elisha</a>, his faithful associate, took up his work and, with the invaluable assistance of the little-known <a href="/en/topic/Micaiah">Micaiah</a>, kept the light of truth alive in <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b19"><a href="#fn_b19">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b20"><a href="#fn_b20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b21"><a href="#fn_b21">[21]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p2_3">97:2.3</a></small></sup>  But these were not times of progress in the concept of <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>. Not yet had the <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a> ascended even to the Mosaic ideal. The era of <a href="/en/topic/Elijah_(Prophet)">Elijah</a> and Elisha closed with the better classes returning to the worship of the supreme <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a> and witnessed the restoration of the idea of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Creator">Universal Creator</a> to about that place where <a href="/en/topic/Samuel">Samuel</a> had left it.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. YAHWEH AND BAAL </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p3_1">97:3.1</a></small></sup>  The long-drawn-out controversy between the believers in <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a> and the followers of <a href="/en/topic/Baal">Baal</a> was a socioeconomic clash of ideologies rather than a difference in religious beliefs.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p3_2">97:3.2</a></small></sup>  The inhabitants of <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a> differed in their attitude toward private ownership of land. The southern or wandering Arabian tribes (the <a href="/en/topic/Yahwehites">Yahwehites</a>) looked upon land as an inalienable—as a gift of <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> to the clan. They held that land could not be sold or mortgaged. “Yahweh spoke, saying, ‘The land shall not be sold, for the land is mine<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b22"><a href="#fn_b22">[22]</a></sup>.’”</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p3_3">97:3.3</a></small></sup>  The northern and more settled <a href="/en/topic/Canaanites">Canaanites</a> (the <a href="/en/topic/Baalites">Baalites</a>) freely bought, sold, and mortgaged their lands. The word <a href="/en/topic/Baal">Baal</a> means owner. The Baal cult was founded on two major doctrines: First, the validation of property exchange, contracts, and covenants—the right to buy and sell land. Second, Baal was supposed to send rain—he was a god of fertility of the soil. Good crops depended on the favor of Baal. The cult was largely concerned with <i>land,</i> its ownership and fertility.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p3_4">97:3.4</a></small></sup>  In general, the Baalites owned houses, lands, and slaves. They were the aristocratic landlords and lived in the cities. Each Baal had a sacred place, a priesthood, and the “holy women,” the ritual prostitutes.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p3_5">97:3.5</a></small></sup>  Out of this basic difference in the regard for land, there evolved the bitter antagonisms of social, economic, moral, and religious attitudes exhibited by the <a href="/en/topic/Canaanites">Canaanites</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a>. This socioeconomic controversy did not become a definite religious issue until the times of <a href="/en/topic/Elijah_(Prophet)">Elijah</a>. From the days of this aggressive prophet the issue was fought out on more strictly religious lines—<a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a> <i>vs<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b23"><a href="#fn_b23">[23]</a></sup>.</i> <a href="/en/topic/Baal">Baal</a>—and it ended in the triumph of Yahweh and the subsequent drive toward monotheism.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1"><a href="#fn_a1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p3_6">97:3.6</a></small></sup>  Elijah shifted the Yahweh-Baal controversy from the land issue to the religious aspect of Hebrew and Canaanite ideologies. When <a href="/en/topic/Ahab">Ahab</a> murdered the <a href="/en/topic/Naboths">Naboths</a> in the intrigue to get possession of their land, Elijah made a moral issue out of the olden land mores and launched his vigorous campaign against the <a href="/en/topic/Baalites">Baalites</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b24"><a href="#fn_b24">[24]</a></sup>. This was also a fight of the country folk against domination by the cities. It was chiefly under Elijah that Yahweh became <a href="/en/topic/Elohim">Elohim</a>. The prophet began as an agrarian reformer and ended up by exalting <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>. Baals were many, Yahweh was <i>one—</i>monotheism won over polytheism.</p>
<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 4. AMOS AND HOSEA </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p4_1">97:4.1</a></small></sup>  A great step in the transition of the tribal god—the god who had so long been served with sacrifices and ceremonies, the <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a> of the earlier <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a>—to a <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> who would punish crime and immorality among even his own people, was taken by <a href="/en/topic/Amos_(Prophet)">Amos</a>, who appeared from among the southern hills to denounce the criminality, drunkenness, oppression, and immorality of the northern tribes. Not since the times of <a href="/en/topic/Moses">Moses</a> had such ringing truths been proclaimed in <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p4_2">97:4.2</a></small></sup>  Amos was not merely a restorer or reformer; he was a discoverer of new concepts of <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>. He proclaimed much about God that had been announced by his predecessors and courageously attacked the belief in a Divine Being who would countenance sin among his so-called <a href="/en/topic/chosen_people">chosen people</a>. For <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> time since the days of <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> the ears of man heard the denunciation of the double standard of national justice and morality. For the first time in their <a href="/en/topic/history">history</a> Hebrew ears heard that their own God, Yahweh, would no more tolerate crime and sin in their lives than he would among any other people. Amos envisioned the stern and just God of <a href="/en/topic/Samuel">Samuel</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Elijah_(Prophet)">Elijah</a>, but he also saw a God who thought no differently of the Hebrews than of any other nation when it came to the punishment of wrongdoing. This was a direct attack on the egoistic doctrine of the “chosen people,” and many Hebrews of those days bitterly resented it<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b25"><a href="#fn_b25">[25]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p4_3">97:4.3</a></small></sup>  Said <a href="/en/topic/Amos_(Prophet)">Amos</a>: “He who formed the mountains and created the wind, seek him who formed the seven stars and Orion, who turns the shadow of death into the morning and makes the day dark as night<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b26"><a href="#fn_b26">[26]</a></sup>.” And in denouncing his half-religious, timeserving, and sometimes immoral fellows, he sought to portray the inexorable justice of an unchanging <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a> when he said of the evildoers: “Though they dig into hell, thence shall I take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b27"><a href="#fn_b27">[27]</a></sup>.” “And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I direct the sword of justice, and it shall slay them<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b28"><a href="#fn_b28">[28]</a></sup>.” <a href="/en/topic/Amos_(Kheresa_lunatic)">Amos</a> further startled his hearers when, pointing a reproving and accusing finger at them, he declared in the name of Yahweh: “Surely I will never forget any of your works<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b29"><a href="#fn_b29">[29]</a></sup>.” “And I will sift the house of <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a> among all nations as <a href="/en/topic/wheat">wheat</a> is sifted in a sieve<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b30"><a href="#fn_b30">[30]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p4_4">97:4.4</a></small></sup>  Amos proclaimed Yahweh the “<a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> of all nations” and warned the <a href="/en/topic/Israelites">Israelites</a> that ritual must not take the place of righteousness<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b31"><a href="#fn_b31">[31]</a></sup>.

<p id="p7_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p7_1">97:7.1</a></small></sup>  The destruction of the Hebrew nation and their captivity in <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> would have proved of great benefit to their expanding theology had it not been for the determined action of their priesthood. Their nation had fallen before the armies of <a href="/en/topic/Babylon">Babylon</a>, and their nationalistic <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a> had suffered from the international preachments of the spiritual leaders. It was resentment of the loss of their national god that led the Jewish priests to go to such lengths in the invention of fables and the multiplication of miraculous appearing events in Hebrew <a href="/en/topic/history">history</a> in an effort to restore the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> as the <a href="/en/topic/chosen_people">chosen people</a> of even the new and expanded idea of an internationalized <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> of all nations.</p>
<p id="p7_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p7_2">97:7.2</a></small></sup>  During the captivity the Jews were much influenced by Babylonian traditions and legends, although it should be noted that they unfailingly improved the moral tone and spiritual significance of the <a href="/en/topic/Chaldeans">Chaldean</a> stories which they adopted, notwithstanding that they invariably distorted these legends to reflect honor and glory upon the ancestry and history of <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a>.</p>
<p id="p7_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p7_3">97:7.3</a></small></sup>  These Hebrew priests and scribes had a single idea in their minds, and that was the rehabilitation of the Jewish nation, the glorification of Hebrew traditions, and the exaltation of their racial <a href="/en/topic/history">history</a>. If there is resentment of the fact that these priests have fastened their erroneous ideas upon such a large part of the Occidental world, it should be remembered that they did not intentionally do this; they did not claim to be writing by inspiration; they made no profession to be writing a sacred book. They were merely preparing a textbook designed to bolster up the dwindling courage of their fellows in captivity. They were definitely aiming at improving the national spirit and morale of their compatriots. It remained for later-day men to assemble these and other writings into a guide book of supposedly infallible teachings.</p>
<p id="p7_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p7_4">97:7.4</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Jewish_priesthood">Jewish priesthood</a> made liberal use of these writings subsequent to the captivity, but they were greatly hindered in their influence over their fellow captives by the presence of a young and indomitable prophet, <a href="/en/topic/Isaiah_(first)">Isaiah</a> the second, who was a full convert to the elder <a href="/en/topic/Isaiah_(second)">Isaiah</a>’s <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> of justice, love, righteousness, and mercy. He also believed with <a href="/en/topic/Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a> that <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a> had become the God of all nations. He preached these theories of the nature of God with such telling effect that he made converts equally among the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> and their captors. And this young preacher left on record his teachings, which the hostile and unforgiving priests sought to divorce from all association with him, although sheer respect for their beauty and grandeur led to their incorporation among the writings of the earlier Isaiah.
