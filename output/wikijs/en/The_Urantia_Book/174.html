<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. DIVINE FORGIVENESS </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p1_1">174:1.1</a></small></sup>  For several days <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> and <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> had been engaged in discussing their differences of opinion about the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s teaching regarding the <a href="/en/topic/forgiveness">forgiveness</a> of sin. They had both agreed to lay the matter before <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, and Peter embraced this occasion as a fitting opportunity for securing the Master’s counsel. Accordingly, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a> broke in on the conversation dealing with the differences between praise and worship, by asking: “Master, James and I are not in accord regarding your teachings having to do with the forgiveness of sin. James claims you teach that the Father forgives us even before we ask him, and I maintain that repentance and confession must precede the forgiveness. Which of us is right? what do you say?”</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p1_2">174:1.2</a></small></sup>  After a short silence Jesus looked significantly at all four and answered: “My brethren, you err in your opinions because you do not comprehend the nature of those intimate and loving relations between the creature and the Creator, between man and <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. You fail to grasp that understanding sympathy which the wise parent entertains for his immature and sometimes erring <a href="/en/topic/children">child</a>. It is indeed doubtful whether intelligent and affectionate <a href="/en/topic/parents">parents</a> are ever called upon to forgive an average and normal child. Understanding relationships associated with attitudes of <a href="/en/topic/love">love</a> effectively prevent all those estrangements which later necessitate the readjustment of <a href="/en/topic/repentance">repentance</a> by the child with forgiveness by the parent.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p1_3">174:1.3</a></small></sup>  “A part of every father lives in the child. The father enjoys priority and superiority of understanding in all matters connected with the child-parent relationship. The parent is able to view the immaturity of the child in the light of the more advanced parental maturity, the riper experience of the older partner. With the earthly child and the heavenly Father, the divine parent possesses infinity and divinity of sympathy and capacity for loving understanding. Divine <a href="/en/topic/forgiveness">forgiveness</a> is inevitable; it is inherent and inalienable in God’s infinite understanding, in his perfect knowledge of all that concerns the mistaken judgment and erroneous choosing of the child. Divine justice is so eternally fair that it unfailingly embodies understanding mercy.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_3_1"><a href="#fn_s1_3_1">[2]</a></sup></p>

And when you love your brother, you have already forgiven him. This capacity to understand man’s nature and forgive his apparent wrongdoing is Godlike. If you are wise parents, this is the way you will love and understand your children, even forgive them when transient misunderstanding has apparently separated you. The child, being immature and lacking in the fuller understanding of the depth of the child-father relationship, must frequently feel a sense of guilty separation from a father’s full approval, but the true father is never conscious of any such separation. <a href="/en/topic/Sin_(god)">Sin</a> is an experience of creature consciousness; it is not a part of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>’s consciousness.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_4_12"><a href="#fn_a1_4_12">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_4_16"><a href="#fn_a1_4_16">[6]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_4_2"><a href="#fn_s1_4_2">[3]</a></sup></p>

You hold grudges and nurse vengefulness in direct proportion to your ignorance of the inner nature and true longings of your children and your fellow beings.

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p2_1">174:2.1</a></small></sup>  On Monday evening there had been held a council between the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> and some fifty additional leaders selected from among the scribes, <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a>, and the <a href="/en/topic/Sadducees">Sadducees</a>. It was the consensus of this meeting that it would be dangerous to arrest <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> in public because of his hold upon the affections of the common people. It was also the opinion of the majority that a determined effort should be made to discredit him in the eyes of the multitude before he should be arrested and brought to trial<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b20"><a href="#fn_b20">[20]</a></sup>. Accordingly, several groups of learned men were designated to be on hand the next morning in the <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a> to undertake to entrap him with difficult questions and otherwise to seek to embarrass him before the people. At last, the Pharisees, Sadducees, and even the <a href="/en/topic/Herodians">Herodians</a> were all united in this effort to discredit Jesus in the eyes of the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> multitudes.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_1_3"><a href="#fn_a2_1_3">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p2_2">174:2.2</a></small></sup>  Tuesday morning, when Jesus arrived in the temple court and began to teach, he had uttered but few words when a group of the younger students from the academies, who had been rehearsed for this purpose, came forward and by their spokesman addressed Jesus: “<a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, we know you are a righteous teacher, and we know that you proclaim the ways of truth, and that you serve only <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, for you fear no man, and that you are no respecter of persons<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b21"><a href="#fn_b21">[21]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b22"><a href="#fn_b22">[22]</a></sup>. We are only students, and we would know the truth about a matter which troubles us; our difficulty is this: Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar? Shall we give or shall we not give?” Jesus, perceiving their hypocrisy and craftiness, said to them: “Why do you thus come to tempt me? Show me the <a href="/en/topic/tribute_money">tribute money</a>, and I will answer you.” And when they handed him a <a href="/en/topic/denarii">denarius</a>, he looked at it and said, “Whose image and superscription does this coin bear?” And when they answered him, “Caesar’s,” Jesus said, “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s and render to God the things that are God’s.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b23"><a href="#fn_b23">[23]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_2_5"><a href="#fn_a2_2_5">[12]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_2_0"><a href="#fn_s2_2_0">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p2_3">174:2.3</a></small></sup>  When he had thus answered these young scribes and their Herodian accomplices, they withdrew from his presence, and the people, even the <a href="/en/topic/Sadducees">Sadducees</a>, enjoyed their discomfiture<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b24"><a href="#fn_b24">[24]</a></sup>. Even the youths who had endeavored to entrap him marveled greatly at the unexpected sagacity of the Master’s answer.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p2_4">174:2.4</a></small></sup>  The previous day the rulers had sought to trip him before the multitude on matters of ecclesiastical authority, and having failed, they now sought to involve him in a damaging discussion of civil authority. Both Pilate and Herod were in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> at this time, and <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ enemies conjectured that, if he would dare to advise against the payment of tribute to Caesar, they could go at once before the Roman authorities and charge him with sedition. On the other hand, if he should advise the payment of tribute in so many words, they rightly calculated that such a pronouncement would greatly wound the national pride of his Jewish hearers, thereby alienating the good will and affection of the multitude.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_4_0"><a href="#fn_s2_4_0">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p2_5">174:2.5</a></small></sup>  In all this the enemies of Jesus were defeated since it was a well-known ruling of the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a>, made for the guidance of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> dispersed among the gentile nations, that the “right of <a href="/en/topic/coinage">coinage</a> carried with it the right to levy taxes.” In this manner Jesus avoided their trap. To have answered “No” to their question would have been equivalent to inciting rebellion; to have answered “Yes” would have shocked the deep-rooted nationalist sentiments of that day. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> did not evade the question; he merely employed the wisdom of making a double reply. Jesus was never evasive, but he was always wise in his dealings with those who sought to harass and destroy him.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_5_0"><a href="#fn_s2_5_0">[6]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. THE SADDUCEES AND THE RESURRECTION </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p3_1">174:3.1</a></small></sup>  Before <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> could get started with his teaching, another group came forward to question him, this time a company of the learned and crafty <a href="/en/topic/Sadducees">Sadducees</a>. Their spokesman, drawing near to him, said: “<a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Moses">Moses</a> said that if a married man should die, leaving no children, his brother should take the wife and raise up seed for the deceased brother<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b25"><a href="#fn_b25">[25]</a></sup>. Now there occurred a case where a certain man who had six brothers died childless; his next brother took his wife but also soon died, leaving no children. Likewise did the second brother take the wife, but he also died leaving no offspring. And so on until all six of the brothers had had her, and all six of them passed on without leaving children. And then, after them all, the woman herself died. Now, what we would like to ask you is this: In the <a href="/en/topic/resurrection">resurrection</a> whose wife will she be since all seven of these brothers had her?”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b26"><a href="#fn_b26">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p3_2">174:3.2</a></small></sup>  Jesus knew, and so did the people, that these Sadducees were not sincere in asking this question because it was not likely that such a case would really occur; and besides, this practice of the brothers of a dead man seeking to beget children for him was practically a dead letter at this time among the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>. Nevertheless, Jesus condescended to reply to their mischievous question. He said: “You all do err in asking such questions because you know neither the Scriptures nor the living power of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b27"><a href="#fn_b27">[27]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b28"><a href="#fn_b28">[28]</a></sup>. You know that the sons of this world can marry and are given in <a href="/en/topic/marriage">marriage</a>, but you do not seem to understand that they who are accounted worthy to attain the worlds to come, through the resurrection of the righteous, neither marry nor are given in marriage. Those who experience the resurrection from the dead are more like the <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a> of heaven, and they never die. These resurrected ones are eternally the sons of God; they are the children of light resurrected into the progress of eternal <a href="/en/topic/life">life</a>. And even your Father Moses understood this, for, in connection with his experiences at the burning bush, he heard the Father say, ‘I <i>am</i> the God of <a href="/en/topic/Abraham_(Old_Testament)">Abraham</a>, the God of <a href="/en/topic/Isaac_(Old_Testament)">Isaac</a>, and the God of <a href="/en/topic/Jacob_of_Crete">Jacob</a>.’ And so, along with Moses, do I declare that my Father is not the God of the dead but of the living. In him you all do live, reproduce, and possess your mortal existence<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b29"><a href="#fn_b29">[29]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b30"><a href="#fn_b30">[30]</a></sup>.”</p>
