Solitary Messengers are encountered from <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> outward: through the Havona circuits to the superuniverse capitals and thence out through the sectors and local universes, with their subdivisions, and even to the inhabited worlds. Although Solitary Messengers belong to the <a href="/en/topic/Higher_Personalities_of_the_Infinite_Spirit">Higher Personalities of the Infinite Spirit</a>, their origin, nature, and service have been discussed in the preceding <a href="/en/topic/Urantia_Papers">paper</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. THE UNIVERSE CIRCUIT SUPERVISORS </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/24#p1_1">24:1.1</a></small></sup>  The vast power currents of space and the circuits of <a href="/en/topic/spirit">spirit</a> <a href="/en/topic/energy">energy</a> may seem to operate automatically; they may appear to function without let or hindrance, but such is not the case. All these stupendous systems of energy are under control; they are subject to intelligent supervision. <a href="/en/topic/Universe_Circuit_Supervisors">Universe Circuit Supervisors</a> are concerned, not with the realms of purely physical or <a href="/en/topic/material_energy">material energy</a>—the domain of the <a href="/en/topic/Universe_Power_Directors">Universe Power Directors</a>—but with the circuits of relative spiritual energy and with those modified circuits which are essential to the maintenance of both the highly developed spiritual beings and the <a href="/en/topic/morontia">morontia</a> or transition type of intelligent creatures. The supervisors do not give origin to circuits of energy and superessence of divinity, but in general they have to do with all higher spirit circuits of time and eternity and with all relative spirit circuits concerned in the administration of the component parts of the grand universe. They direct and manipulate all such spirit-energy circuits outside the <a href="/en/topic/Isle_of_Paradise">Isle of Paradise</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/24#p1_2">24:1.2</a></small></sup>  Universe Circuit Supervisors are the exclusive creation of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>, and they function solely as the agents of the <a href="/en/topic/Conjoint_Actor">Conjoint Actor</a>. They are personalized for service in the following four orders:<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_2_4"><a href="#fn_s1_2_4">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/24#p1_7">24:1.7</a></small></sup>  The supreme supervisors of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> and the associate supervisors of the seven superuniverses are of completed numbers; no more of these orders are being created. The supreme supervisors are seven in number and are stationed on the pilot <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_worlds">worlds</a> of the seven Havona circuits. The circuits of the seven superuniverses are in the charge of a marvelous group of seven associate supervisors, who maintain headquarters on the seven <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> spheres of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>, the worlds of the <a href="/en/topic/Seven_Supreme_Executives">Seven Supreme Executives</a>. From here they supervise and direct the circuits of the superuniverses of space.</p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/24#p1_8">24:1.8</a></small></sup>  On these Paradise spheres of the Spirit the seven <a href="/en/topic/Associate_Circuit_Supervisors">associate circuit supervisors</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> order of the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme_Power_Centers">Supreme Power Centers</a> effect a liaison which, under the direction of the Supreme Executives, results in the sub-Paradise co-ordination of all material and spiritual circuits passing out to the seven superuniverses.</p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/24#p1_9">24:1.9</a></small></sup>  On the headquarters <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_worlds">worlds</a> of each <a href="/en/topic/superuniverses">superuniverse</a> are stationed the <a href="/en/topic/Secondary_Circuit_Supervisors">secondary supervisors</a> for the local universes of time and space. The major and minor sectors are administrative divisions of the supergovernments but are not concerned in these matters of spirit-energy supervision. I do not know how many secondary circuit supervisors there are in the grand universe, but on <a href="/en/topic/Uversa">Uversa</a> there are 84,691 of these beings. Secondary supervisors are being created right along; from time to time they appear in groups of seventy on the worlds of the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme_Executives">Supreme Executives</a>. We obtain them on requisition as we arrange for the establishment of separate circuits of spirit energy and liaison power to the newly evolving universes of our jurisdiction.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_9_8"><a href="#fn_a1_9_8">[1]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_9_9"><a href="#fn_s1_9_9">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/24#p1_10">24:1.10</a></small></sup>  A tertiary circuit supervisor functions on the headquarters world of every local universe. This order, like the secondary supervisors, is of continuous creation, being created in groups of seven hundred. They are assigned to the <a href="/en/topic/local_universes">local universes</a> by the <a href="/en/topic/Ancients_of_Days">Ancients of Days</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/24#p1_11">24:1.11</a></small></sup>  Circuit supervisors are created for their specific tasks, and they eternally serve in the groups of their original assignment. They are not rotated in service and hence make an agelong study of the problems found in the realms of their original assignment. For example: <a href="/en/topic/Andovontia">Tertiary circuit supervisor</a> number 572,842 has functioned on <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> since the early concept of your local universe<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📘" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d8.svg"><sup id="cite_c1"><a href="#fn_c1">[1]</a></sup>, and he is a member of the personal <a href="/en/topic/corporeal_staffs_of_Planetary_Princes">staff</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael of Nebadon</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_11_9"><a href="#fn_s1_11_9">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/24#p1_12">24:1.12</a></small></sup>  Whether acting in the local or higher universes, circuit supervisors direct all concerned as to the proper circuits to employ for the transmission of all spirit messages and for the transit of all personalities. In their work of circuit supervision these efficient beings utilize all agencies, forces, and personalities in the universe of universes. They employ the unrevealed “<a href="/en/topic/high_spirit_personalities_of_circuit_control_(unrevealed)">high spirit personalities of circuit control</a>” and are ably assisted by numerous staffs composed of personalities of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>. It is they who would isolate an evolutionary world if its Planetary Prince should rebel against the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a> and his vicegerent Son. They are able to throw any world out of certain universe circuits of the higher spiritual order, but they cannot annul the material currents of the power directors.</p>
<p id="p1_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/24#p1_13">24:1.13</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Universe_Circuit_Supervisors">Universe Circuit Supervisors</a> have something of the same relationship to spirit circuits that the <a href="/en/topic/Universe_Power_Directors">Universe Power Directors</a> have to material circuits. The two orders are complemental, together having the oversight of all spirit and all material circuits that are controllable and manipulatable by creatures.</p>
<p id="p1_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/24#p1_14">24:1.14</a></small></sup>  The circuit supervisors exercise certain oversight of those mind circuits which are spirit associated much as the power directors have certain jurisdiction over those phases of mind which are physical-energy associated—mechanical mind. In general the functions of each order are expanded by liaison with the other, but the circuits of pure mind are subject to the supervision of neither. Neither are the two orders co-ordinate; in all their manifold labors the Universe Circuit Supervisors are subject to the Seven <a href="/en/topic/Supreme_Power_Directors">Supreme Power Directors</a> and their subordinates.</p>
<p id="p1_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/24#p1_15">24:1.15</a></small></sup>  While the circuit supervisors are entirely alike within their respective orders, they are all distinct individuals. They are truly personal beings, but they possess a type of other-than-Father-endowed personality not encountered in any other type of creature in all universal existence.</p>
<p id="p1_16"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/24#p1_16">24:1.16</a></small></sup>  Although you will recognize and know them as you journey inward towards <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>, you will have no personal relations with them. They are circuit supervisors, and they attend strictly and efficiently to their business. They deal solely with those personalities and entities having the oversight of those activities which are concerned with the circuits subject to their supervision.</p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/24#p2_1">24:2.1</a></small></sup>  Notwithstanding that the cosmic mind of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Universal Intelligence</a> is cognizant of the presence and whereabouts of all <i>thinking</i> creatures, there is operative in the universe of universes an independent method of keeping count of all <i>will</i> creatures.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_1_9"><a href="#fn_a2_1_9">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_1_12"><a href="#fn_a2_1_12">[3]</a></sup></p>

They are so created as to be able to maintain perfect synchrony with the <a href="/en/topic/reflectivity">reflectivity</a> technique of the superuniverses, while at the same time they are personally sensitive and responsive to intelligent <i>will.</i> These directors, by a not-fully-understood technique, are made immediately aware of the birth of will in any part of the grand universe. They are, therefore, always competent to give us the number, nature, and whereabouts of all will creatures in any part of the central creation and the seven superuniverses. But they do not function on <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>; there is no need for them there. On Paradise <a href="/en/topic/knowledge">knowledge</a> is inherent; the <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deities</a> know all things.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_2_9"><a href="#fn_a2_2_9">[2]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_2_4"><a href="#fn_s2_2_4">[2]</a></sup></p>

Excepting these seven and the reserves of the order on the Paradise <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_worlds">worlds</a> of the Spirit, all Census Directors function under the jurisdiction of the <a href="/en/topic/Ancients_of_Days">Ancients of Days</a>.</p>

All personalities of this order are equal excepting those on the Havona pilot worlds and the seven superuniverse chiefs.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/24#p2_5">24:2.5</a></small></sup>  In the seventh superuniverse there are one hundred thousand Census Directors.

Usatia, like the other superuniverse chiefs, is not directly attuned to the registration of intelligent will. He is solely attuned to his subordinates stationed in the <a href="/en/topic/Orvonton_(Paradise_satellite)">Orvonton</a> universes; thus he acts as a magnificent totaling personality for their reports coming in from the capitals of the local creations.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_5_13"><a href="#fn_a2_5_13">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_5_15"><a href="#fn_a2_5_15">[5]</a></sup></p>

The partial emergence of will observed in the reactions of certain of the higher animals does not belong to the domain of the Census Directors. They keep count of nothing but bona fide will creatures, and they are responsive to nothing but <i>will function.</i> Exactly how they register the function of will, we do not know.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_8_9"><a href="#fn_a2_8_9">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_8_11"><a href="#fn_a2_8_11">[7]</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. PERSONAL AIDS OF THE INFINITE SPIRIT </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/24#p3_1">24:3.1</a></small></sup>  We have no authentic knowledge as to the time or manner of the creation of the Personal Aids. Their number must be legion, but it is not of record on <a href="/en/topic/Uversa">Uversa</a>. From conservative deductions based on our knowledge of their work, I venture to estimate that their number extends high into the trillions. We hold the opinion that the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a> is not limited as to numbers in the creation of these Personal Aids.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_1_4"><a href="#fn_s3_1_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/24#p3_2">24:3.2</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Personal_Aids_of_the_Infinite_Spirit">Personal Aids of the Infinite Spirit</a> exist for the exclusive assistance of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> presence of the <a href="/en/topic/Third_Person_of_Deity">Third Person of Deity</a>. Although attached directly to the Infinite Spirit and located on Paradise, they flash to and fro to the uttermost parts of creation. Wherever the circuits of the <a href="/en/topic/Conjoint_Creator">Conjoint Creator</a> extend, there these Personal Aids may appear for the purpose of executing the bidding of the Infinite Spirit. They traverse space much as do the <a href="/en/topic/Solitary_Messengers">Solitary Messengers</a> but are not persons in the sense that the <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> are.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/24#p3_3">24:3.3</a></small></sup>  The Personal Aids are all equal and identical; they disclose no differentiation of individuality. Though the <a href="/en/topic/Conjoint_Actor">Conjoint Actor</a> looks upon them as true personalities, it is difficult for others to regard them as real persons; they do not manifest a spirit presence to other spirit beings.
