<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p1_1">114:1.1</a></small></sup>  The original sovereignty of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> was held in trust by the sovereign of the <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> system. It was first delegated by him to a joint commission of <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_Sons">Melchizedeks</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Life_Carriers">Life Carriers</a>, and this group functioned on Urantia until the arrival of a regularly constituted Planetary Prince. Subsequent to the downfall of Prince <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia">Caligastia</a>, at the time of the <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">Lucifer rebellion</a>, Urantia had no sure and settled relationship with the local universe and its administrative divisions until the completion of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a>’s bestowal in the flesh, when he was proclaimed, by the Union of Days, <a href="/en/topic/Planetary_Prince_of_Urantia">Planetary Prince of Urantia</a>. Such a proclamation in surety and in principle forever settled the status of your world, but in practice the Sovereign <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> made no gesture of personal administration of the planet aside from the establishment of the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> <a href="/en/topic/four_and_twenty_counselors">commission of twenty-four</a> former Urantians with authority to represent him in the government of Urantia and all other quarantined planets in the system<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.

<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p1_2">114:1.2</a></small></sup>  Vicegerent authority to act for Michael as Planetary Prince has been recently vested in <a href="/en/topic/Machiventa_Melchizedek">Machiventa Melchizedek</a>, but this Son of the local universe has made not the slightest move toward modifying the present planetary regime of the successive administrations of the resident governors general.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_42"><a href="#fn_a1_2_42">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p1_3">114:1.3</a></small></sup>  There is little likelihood that any marked change will be made in the government of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> during the present dispensation unless the vicegerent Planetary Prince should arrive to assume his titular responsibilities. It appears to certain of our associates that at some time in the near future the plan of sending one of the twenty-four counselors to Urantia to act as governor general will be superseded by the formal arrival of Machiventa Melchizedek with the vicegerent mandate of the sovereignty of Urantia. As acting Planetary Prince he would undoubtedly continue in charge of the planet until the final adjudication of the <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">Lucifer rebellion</a> and probably on into the distant future of planetary settlement in light and life.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_3_22"><a href="#fn_a1_3_22">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p1_4">114:1.4</a></small></sup>  Some believe that Machiventa will not come to take personal direction of Urantian affairs until the end of the current dispensation. Others hold that the vicegerent Prince may not come, as such, until <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a> sometime returns to Urantia as he promised when still in the flesh. Still others, including this narrator, look for <a href="/en/topic/Machiventa_Melchizedek">Melchizedek</a>’s appearance any day or hour.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_4_44"><a href="#fn_a1_4_44">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_4_55"><a href="#fn_a1_4_55">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_4_65"><a href="#fn_a1_4_65">[17]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_4_0"><a href="#fn_s1_4_0">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p2_1">114:2.1</a></small></sup>  Since the times of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a>’s bestowal on your world the general management of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> has been intrusted to a special group on <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> of twenty-four onetime Urantians. Qualification for membership on this commission is unknown to us, but we have observed that those who have been thus commissioned have all been contributors to the enlarging sovereignty of the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme">Supreme</a> in the system of <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a>. By nature they were all real leaders when they functioned on Urantia, and (excepting <a href="/en/topic/Machiventa_Melchizedek">Machiventa Melchizedek</a>) these qualities of leadership have been further augmented by mansion world experience and supplemented by the training of Jerusem citizenship. Members are nominated to the twenty-four by the cabinet of <a href="/en/topic/Lanaforge">Lanaforge</a>, seconded by the <a href="/en/topic/Most_Highs_of_Norlatiadek">Most Highs of Edentia</a>, approved by the <a href="/en/topic/Assigned_Sentinels">Assigned Sentinel</a> of Jerusem, and appointed by <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> in accordance with the mandate of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a>. The temporary appointees function just as fully as do the permanent members of this commission of special supervisors.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p2_2">114:2.2</a></small></sup>  This board of planetary directors is especially concerned with the supervision of those activities on this world which result from the fact that Michael here experienced his terminal bestowal. They are kept in close and immediate touch with Michael by the liaison activities of a certain <a href="/en/topic/Brilliant_Evening_Stars">Brilliant Evening Star</a>, the identical being who attended upon <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> throughout the mortal bestowal.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_2_25"><a href="#fn_a2_2_25">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p2_3">114:2.3</a></small></sup>  At the present time one <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a>, known to you as “the Baptist,” is chairman of this council when it is in session on <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a>. But the ex officio head of this council is the <a href="/en/topic/Assigned_Sentinel_of_Satania">Assigned Sentinel of Satania</a>, the direct and personal representative of the Associate Inspector on <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> and of the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme_Executive_#7_(of_Orvonton)">Supreme Executive of Orvonton</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_3_59"><a href="#fn_a2_3_59">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p2_4">114:2.4</a></small></sup>  The members of this same commission of former Urantians also act as advisory supervisors of the thirty-six other rebellion-isolated <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_worlds">worlds</a> of the system; they perform a very valuable service in keeping <a href="/en/topic/Lanaforge">Lanaforge</a>, the System Sovereign, in close and sympathetic touch with the affairs of these planets, which still remain more or less under the overcontrol of the <a href="/en/topic/Constellation_Fathers">Constellation Fathers</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Norlatiadek">Norlatiadek</a>. These <a href="/en/topic/four_and_twenty_counselors">twenty-four counselors</a> make frequent trips as individuals to each of the quarantined planets, especially to <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p2_5">114:2.5</a></small></sup>  Each of the other isolated worlds is advised by similar and varying sized commissions of its onetime inhabitants, but these other commissions are subordinate to the Urantian group of twenty-four. While the members of the latter commission are thus actively interested in every phase of human progress on each quarantined world in <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a>, they are especially and particularly concerned with the welfare and advancement of the mortal races of Urantia, for they immediately and directly supervise the affairs of none of the planets except Urantia, and even here their authority is not complete excepting in certain domains concerned with mortal survival.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p2_6">114:2.6</a></small></sup>  No one knows how long these twenty-four <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> counselors will continue in their present status, detached from the regular program of universe activities. They will no doubt continue to serve in their present capacities until some change in planetary status ensues, such as the end of a dispensation, the assumption of full authority by <a href="/en/topic/Machiventa_Melchizedek">Machiventa Melchizedek</a>, the final adjudication of the <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">Lucifer rebellion</a>, or the reappearance of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a> on the world of his final bestowal. The present resident governor general of Urantia seems inclined to the opinion that all but Machiventa may be released for <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> ascension the moment the system of Satania is restored to the constellation circuits. But other opinions are also current.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_6_0"><a href="#fn_s2_6_0">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p3_3">114:3.3</a></small></sup>  Although the governor general does not possess actual and personal authority on the planet, he hands down scores of rulings and decisions each day which are accepted as final by all personalities concerned. He is much more of a fatherly adviser than a technical ruler. In certain ways he functions as would a Planetary Prince, but his administration much more closely resembles that of the <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a>.</p>

<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p3_5">114:3.5</a></small></sup>  The supermaterial government of Urantia does not maintain a very close organic relationship with the higher units of the local universe.
