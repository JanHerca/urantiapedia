<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p0_1">104:0.1</a></small></sup>  THE <a href="/en/topic/Trinity">Trinity</a> concept of revealed religion must not be confused with the <a href="/en/topic/triad_beliefs">triad beliefs</a> of evolutionary religions. The ideas of triads arose from many suggestive relationships but chiefly because of the three joints of the fingers, because three legs were the fewest which could stabilize a stool, because three support points could keep up a tent; furthermore, primitive man, for a long time, could not count beyond three.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_1_10"><a href="#fn_a0_1_10">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p0_2">104:0.2</a></small></sup>  Aside from certain natural couplets, such as past and present, day and night, hot and cold, and male and female, man generally tends to think in triads: yesterday, today, and tomorrow; sunrise, noon, and sunset; father, mother, and child. Three cheers are given the victor. The dead are buried on the third day, and the ghost is placated by three ablutions of water.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p0_3">104:0.3</a></small></sup>  As a consequence of these natural associations in human experience, the triad made its appearance in religion, and this long before the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Trinity">Paradise Trinity</a> of Deities, or even any of their representatives, had been revealed to mankind. Later on, the <a href="/en/topic/Persians">Persians</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Hindus">Hindus</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a>, Egyptians, <a href="/en/topic/Babylonians">Babylonians</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Scandinavians">Scandinavians</a> all had triad gods, but these were still not true trinities. Triad deities all had a natural origin and have appeared at one time or another among most of the intelligent peoples of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. Sometimes the concept of an evolutionary triad has become mixed with that of a revealed <a href="/en/topic/Trinity">Trinity</a>; in these instances it is often impossible to distinguish one from the other.</p>

Most of his disciples thought that the Trinity consisted of the three <a href="/en/topic/Most_Highs_of_Norlatiadek">Most Highs of Norlatiadek</a>; a few conceived of the Trinity as the System Sovereign, the <a href="/en/topic/Constellation_Fathers">Constellation Father</a>, and the local universe Creator <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>; still fewer even remotely grasped the idea of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> association of the Father, Son, and Spirit.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_3_8"><a href="#fn_a1_3_8">[2]</a></sup></p>

It is often difficult to distinguish between the triads and the trinities in the later <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andite</a> and the post-Melchizedek ages, when both concepts to a certain extent intermingled and coalesced.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_4_8"><a href="#fn_a1_4_8">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p1_5">104:1.5</a></small></sup>  Among the <a href="/en/topic/Hindus">Hindus</a> the trinitarian concept took root as Being, Intelligence, and Joy. (A later Indian conception was <a href="/en/topic/Brahma">Brahma</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Siva">Siva</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Vishnu">Vishnu</a>.) While the earlier <a href="/en/topic/Trinity">Trinity</a> portrayals were brought to <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a> by the Sethite priests, the later ideas of the Trinity were imported by the <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> missionaries and were developed by the native intellects of India through a compounding of these doctrines with the evolutionary triad conceptions.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_5_8"><a href="#fn_a1_5_8">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p1_6">104:1.6</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Buddhism">Buddhist faith</a> developed two doctrines of a trinitarian nature: The earlier was Teacher, Law, and Brotherhood; that was the presentation made by <a href="/en/topic/Gautama_Siddhartha">Gautama Siddhartha</a>. The later idea, developing among the northern branch of the followers of <a href="/en/topic/Buddha">Buddha</a>, embraced <a href="/en/topic/Supreme">Supreme</a> Lord, <a href="/en/topic/Holy_Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>, and Incarnate Savior.</p>

The Hebrew mind could not reconcile the trinitarian concept with the monotheistic belief in the One Lord, the God of <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_8_8"><a href="#fn_a1_8_8">[2]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_8_6"><a href="#fn_s1_8_6">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p1_9">104:1.9</a></small></sup>  The followers of the Islamic faith likewise failed to grasp the idea of the Trinity. It is always difficult for an emerging monotheism to tolerate trinitarianism when confronted by polytheism. The trinity idea takes best hold of those religions which have a firm monotheistic tradition coupled with doctrinal elasticity. The great monotheists, the Hebrews and Mohammedans, found it difficult to distinguish between worshiping three gods, polytheism, and trinitarianism, the worship of one <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> existing in a triune manifestation of divinity and personality.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_9_8"><a href="#fn_a1_9_8">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_9_9"><a href="#fn_a1_9_9">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p2_1">104:2.1</a></small></sup>  Monotheism arose as a philosophic protest against the inconsistency of polytheism.

<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p2_2">104:2.2</a></small></sup>  Trinitarianism grows out of the experiential protest against the impossibility of conceiving the oneness of a deanthropomorphized solitary <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> of unrelated universe significance. Given a sufficient time, philosophy tends to abstract the personal qualities from the Deity concept of pure <a href="/en/topic/monotheism">monotheism</a>, thus reducing this idea of an unrelated God to the status of a pantheistic <a href="/en/topic/Absolute">Absolute</a>.
