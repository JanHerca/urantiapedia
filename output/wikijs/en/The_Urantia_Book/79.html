<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p1_1">79:1.1</a></small></sup>  For over twenty-five thousand years, on down to nearly 2000 B.C., the heart of Eurasia was predominantly, though diminishingly, Andite. In the lowlands of <a href="/en/topic/Turkestan">Turkestan</a> the <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andites</a> made the westward turning around the inland lakes into <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a>, while from the highlands of this region they infiltrated eastward. Eastern Turkestan (<a href="/en/topic/Sinkiang">Sinkiang</a>) and, to a lesser extent, <a href="/en/topic/Tibet">Tibet</a> were the ancient gateways through which these peoples of <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> penetrated the mountains to the northern lands of the yellow men. The Andite infiltration of <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a> proceeded from the Turkestan highlands into the <a href="/en/topic/Punjab">Punjab</a> and from the <a href="/en/topic/Iran">Iranian</a> grazing lands through <a href="/en/topic/Baluchistan">Baluchistan</a>. These earlier migrations were in no sense conquests; they were, rather, the continual drifting of the Andite tribes into western India and <a href="/en/topic/China">China</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_1_7"><a href="#fn_a1_1_7">[1]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_1_0"><a href="#fn_s1_1_0">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p1_2">79:1.2</a></small></sup>  For almost fifteen thousand years centers of mixed Andite culture persisted in the basin of the Tarim River in Sinkiang and to the south in the highland regions of Tibet, where the Andites and <a href="/en/topic/Andonites">Andonites</a> had extensively mingled. The Tarim valley was the easternmost outpost of the true Andite culture. Here they built their settlements and entered into trade relations with the progressive <a href="/en/topic/Chinese">Chinese</a> to the east and with the Andonites to the north. In those days the Tarim region was a fertile land; the rainfall was plentiful. To the east the <a href="/en/topic/Gobi">Gobi</a> was an open grassland where the herders were gradually turning to agriculture. This civilization perished when the rain winds shifted to the southeast, but in its day it rivaled Mesopotamia itself.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_16"><a href="#fn_a1_2_16">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p1_3">79:1.3</a></small></sup>  By 8000 B.C. the slowly increasing aridity of the highland regions of central <a href="/en/topic/Asia">Asia</a> began to drive the <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andites</a> to the river bottoms and the seashores. This increasing <a href="/en/topic/drought">drought</a> not only drove them to the valleys of the Nile, <a href="/en/topic/Euphrates_River">Euphrates</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Indus">Indus</a>, and Yellow rivers, but it produced a new development in Andite civilization. A new class of men, the traders, began to appear in large numbers.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_3_0"><a href="#fn_s1_3_0">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p1_4">79:1.4</a></small></sup>  When climatic conditions made hunting unprofitable for the migrating Andites, they did not follow the evolutionary course of the older races by becoming herders. Commerce and urban life made their appearance. From <a href="/en/topic/Egypt">Egypt</a> through <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Turkestan">Turkestan</a> to the rivers of <a href="/en/topic/China">China</a> and <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a>, the more highly civilized tribes began to assemble in <a href="/en/topic/cities">cities</a> devoted to manufacture and <a href="/en/topic/commerce">trade</a>. <a href="/en/topic/Adonia">Adonia</a> became the central Asian commercial metropolis, being located near the present city of <a href="/en/topic/Ashkhabad">Ashkhabad</a>. Commerce in <a href="/en/topic/stone">stone</a>, metal, <a href="/en/topic/wood">wood</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/pottery">pottery</a> was accelerated on both land and water.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_4_7"><a href="#fn_a1_4_7">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p1_5">79:1.5</a></small></sup>  But ever-increasing <a href="/en/topic/drought">drought</a> gradually brought about the great <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andite</a> exodus from the lands south and east of the <a href="/en/topic/Caspian_Sea">Caspian Sea</a>. The tide of migration began to veer from northward to southward, and the <a href="/en/topic/Babylon">Babylonian</a> cavalrymen began to push into Mesopotamia.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p1_6">79:1.6</a></small></sup>  Increasing aridity in central <a href="/en/topic/Asia">Asia</a> further operated to reduce <a href="/en/topic/population">population</a> and to render these people less warlike; and when the diminishing rainfall to the north forced the nomadic <a href="/en/topic/Andonites">Andonites</a> southward, there was a tremendous exodus of Andites from <a href="/en/topic/Turkestan">Turkestan</a>. This is the terminal movement of the so-called <a href="/en/topic/Aryans">Aryans</a> into the <a href="/en/topic/Levant">Levant</a> and <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a>. It culminated that long dispersal of the mixed descendants of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> during which every Asiatic and most of the island peoples of the Pacific were to some extent improved by these superior races.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p1_7">79:1.7</a></small></sup>  Thus, while they dispersed over the Eastern Hemisphere, the <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andites</a> were dispossessed of their homelands in <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and Turkestan, for it was this extensive southward movement of Andonites that diluted the Andites in central Asia nearly to the vanishing point.</p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p1_8">79:1.8</a></small></sup>  But even in the twentieth century after <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a> there are traces of Andite blood among the Turanian and Tibetan peoples, as is witnessed by the blond types occasionally found in these regions. The early <a href="/en/topic/Chinese">Chinese</a> annals record the presence of the red-haired nomads to the north of the peaceful settlements of the <a href="/en/topic/Yellow_River">Yellow River</a>, and there still remain paintings which faithfully record the presence of both the blond-Andite and the brunet-Mongolian types in the <a href="/en/topic/Tarim_basin">Tarim basin</a> of long ago.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_8_16"><a href="#fn_a1_8_16">[2]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_8_0"><a href="#fn_s1_8_0">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p1_9">79:1.9</a></small></sup>  The last great manifestation of the submerged military genius of the central Asiatic <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andites</a> was in A.D. 1200, when the Mongols under <a href="/en/topic/Genghis_Khan">Genghis Khan</a> began the conquest of the greater portion of the Asiatic continent. And like the Andites of old, these warriors proclaimed the existence of “one <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> in heaven.” The early breakup of their empire long delayed cultural intercourse between Occident and Orient and greatly handicapped the growth of the monotheistic concept in <a href="/en/topic/Asia">Asia</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p2_1">79:2.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a> is the only locality where all the <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> races were blended, the <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andite</a> invasion adding <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> stock. In the highlands northwest of India the Sangik races came into existence, and without exception members of each penetrated the subcontinent of India in their early days, leaving behind them the most heterogeneous race mixture ever to exist on Urantia. Ancient India acted as a catch basin for the migrating races. The base of the peninsula was formerly somewhat narrower than now, much of the deltas of the <a href="/en/topic/Ganges">Ganges</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Indus">Indus</a> being the work of the last fifty thousand years.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_0"><a href="#fn_s2_1_0">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p2_2">79:2.2</a></small></sup>  The earliest race mixtures in India were a blending of the migrating red and yellow races with the aboriginal <a href="/en/topic/Andonites">Andonites</a>. This group was later weakened by absorbing the greater portion of the extinct eastern <a href="/en/topic/green_race">green</a> peoples as well as large numbers of the <a href="/en/topic/orange_race">orange race</a>, was slightly improved through limited admixture with the <a href="/en/topic/blue_race">blue man</a>, but suffered exceedingly through assimilation of large numbers of the <a href="/en/topic/indigo_race">indigo race</a>. But the so-called <a href="/en/topic/aborigines_(Indian)">aborigines</a> of India are hardly representative of these early people; they are rather the most inferior southern and eastern fringe, which was never fully absorbed by either the early Andites or their later appearing <a href="/en/topic/Aryans">Aryan</a> cousins.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p2_3">79:2.3</a></small></sup>  By 20,000 B.C. the population of western <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a> had already become tinged with the Adamic blood, and never in the history of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> did any one people combine so many different races. But it was unfortunate that the secondary Sangik strains predominated, and it was a real calamity that both the blue and the red man were so largely missing from this racial melting pot of long ago; more of the primary Sangik strains would have contributed very much toward the enhancement of what might have been an even greater civilization. As it developed, the red man was destroying himself in the Americas, the blue man was disporting himself in <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a>, and the early descendants of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> (and most of the later ones) exhibited little desire to admix with the darker colored peoples, whether in India, <a href="/en/topic/Africa">Africa</a>, or elsewhere.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p2_4">79:2.4</a></small></sup>  About 15,000 B.C. increasing population pressure throughout <a href="/en/topic/Turkestan">Turkestan</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Iran">Iran</a> occasioned <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> really extensive <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andite</a> movement toward India. For over fifteen centuries these superior peoples poured in through the highlands of <a href="/en/topic/Baluchistan">Baluchistan</a>, spreading out over the valleys of the <a href="/en/topic/Indus">Indus</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Ganges">Ganges</a> and slowly moving southward into the <a href="/en/topic/Deccan">Deccan</a>. This Andite pressure from the northwest drove many of the southern and eastern inferiors into <a href="/en/topic/Burma">Burma</a> and southern <a href="/en/topic/China">China</a> but not sufficiently to save the invaders from racial obliteration.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_4_7"><a href="#fn_a2_4_7">[1]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_4_0"><a href="#fn_s2_4_0">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p2_5">79:2.5</a></small></sup>  The failure of <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a> to achieve the hegemony of Eurasia was largely a matter of <a href="/en/topic/geography">topography</a>; population pressure from the north only crowded the majority of the people southward into the decreasing territory of the Deccan, surrounded on all sides by the sea. Had there been adjacent lands for emigration, then would the inferiors have been crowded out in all directions, and the superior stocks would have achieved a higher civilization.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p2_6">79:2.6</a></small></sup>  As it was, these earlier Andite conquerors made a desperate attempt to preserve their identity and stem the tide of racial engulfment by the establishment of rigid restrictions regarding intermarriage. Nonetheless, the <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andites</a> had become submerged by 10,000 B.C., but the whole mass of the people had been markedly improved by this absorption.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_6_7"><a href="#fn_a2_6_7">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p2_7">79:2.7</a></small></sup>  Race mixture is always advantageous in that it favors versatility of culture and makes for a progressive <a href="/en/topic/civilization">civilization</a>, but if the inferior elements of racial stocks predominate, such achievements will be short-lived. A polyglot culture can be preserved only if the superior stocks reproduce themselves in a safe margin over the inferior. Unrestrained multiplication of <a href="/en/topic/inferiors">inferiors</a>, with decreasing reproduction of superiors, is unfailingly suicidal of cultural civilization.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_7_4"><a href="#fn_a2_7_4">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_7_5"><a href="#fn_a2_7_5">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_7_10"><a href="#fn_a2_7_10">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_7_19"><a href="#fn_a2_7_19">[6]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_7_4"><a href="#fn_s2_7_4">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p3_1">79:3.1</a></small></sup>  The blending of the <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andite</a> conquerors of <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a> with the native stock eventually resulted in that mixed people which has been called Dravidian. The earlier and purer <a href="/en/topic/Dravidians">Dravidians</a> possessed a great capacity for cultural achievement, which was continuously weakened as their Andite inheritance became progressively attenuated. And this is what doomed the budding civilization of India almost twelve thousand years ago. But the infusion of even this small amount of the blood of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> produced a marked acceleration in social development. This composite stock immediately produced the most versatile civilization then on earth.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_1_7"><a href="#fn_a3_1_7">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_1_21"><a href="#fn_a3_1_21">[7]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_1_0"><a href="#fn_s3_1_0">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p3_3">79:3.3</a></small></sup>  The superior culture and religious leanings of the peoples of <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a> date from the early times of <a href="/en/topic/Dravidians">Dravidian</a> domination and are due, in part, to the fact that so many of the Sethite priesthood entered India, both in the earlier <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andite</a> and in the later <a href="/en/topic/Aryans">Aryan</a> invasions. The thread of monotheism running through the religious history of India thus stems from the teachings of the <a href="/en/topic/Adamites">Adamites</a> in the second <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_3_7"><a href="#fn_a3_3_7">[1]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_3_0"><a href="#fn_s3_3_0">[1]</a></sup></p>

But their religion did not persist. Within five thousand years their doctrines of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Trinity">Paradise Trinity</a> had degenerated into the triune symbol of the <a href="/en/topic/Agni">fire god</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p3_8">79:3.8</a></small></sup>  These commercial relationships greatly contributed to the further diversification of a cosmopolitan culture, resulting in the early appearance of many of the refinements and even luxuries of urban life. When the later appearing <a href="/en/topic/Aryans">Aryans</a> entered <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a>, they did not recognize in the <a href="/en/topic/Dravidians">Dravidians</a> their <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andite</a> cousins submerged in the Sangik races, but they did find a well-advanced civilization. Despite biologic limitations, the Dravidians founded a superior civilization.

<p id="p8_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p8_1">79:8.1</a></small></sup>  While the red man suffered from too much warfare, it is not altogether amiss to say that the development of statehood among the <a href="/en/topic/Chinese">Chinese</a> was delayed by the thoroughness of their conquest of <a href="/en/topic/Asia">Asia</a>. They had a great potential of racial solidarity, but it failed properly to develop because the continuous driving stimulus of the ever-present danger of external aggression was lacking.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s8_1_0"><a href="#fn_s8_1_0">[1]</a></sup></p>

Of the epic struggle with the red race there persisted only the hazy tradition of an ancient contest with the archer peoples. The Chinese early turned to agricultural pursuits, which contributed further to their pacific tendencies, while a <a href="/en/topic/population">population</a> well below the land-man ratio for <a href="/en/topic/agriculture">agriculture</a> still further contributed to the growing peacefulness of the country.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a8_2_17"><a href="#fn_a8_2_17">[29]</a></sup></p>

A very similar attitude prevailed among the white races in <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a> for some five hundred years following the <a href="/en/topic/Reformation">disruption</a> of Greco-Roman civilization.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a8_3_17"><a href="#fn_a8_3_17">[29]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p8_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p8_5">79:8.5</a></small></sup>  Between 4000 and 500 B.C. the political reunification of the yellow race was consummated, but the cultural union of the <a href="/en/topic/Yangtze_River">Yangtze</a> and Yellow river centers had already been effected. This political reunification of the later tribal groups was not without conflict, but the societal opinion of <a href="/en/topic/war">war</a> remained low; ancestor worship, increasing dialects, and no call for military action for thousands upon thousands of years had rendered this people ultrapeaceful.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a8_5_15"><a href="#fn_a8_5_15">[32]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s8_5_0"><a href="#fn_s8_5_0">[1]</a></sup></p>
