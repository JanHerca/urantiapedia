<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_1">195:0.1</a></small></sup>  THE results of <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>’s preaching on the day of <a href="/en/topic/Pentecost_(bestowal_of_Spirit_of_Truth)">Pentecost</a> were such as to decide the future policies, and to determine the plans, of the majority of the apostles in their efforts to proclaim the gospel of the kingdom. <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Peter</a> was the real founder of the Christian church; <a href="/en/topic/Paul">Paul</a> carried the Christian message to the gentiles, and the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> believers carried it to the whole <a href="/en/topic/Roman_Empire">Roman Empire</a>.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_2">195:0.2</a></small></sup>  Although the tradition-bound and priest-ridden <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a>, as a people, refused to accept either <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ gospel of the fatherhood of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and the brotherhood of man or Peter’s and Paul’s proclamation of the resurrection and ascension of <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a> (subsequent <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a>), the rest of the Roman Empire was found to be receptive to the evolving Christian teachings<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. <a href="/en/topic/Western_civilization">Western civilization</a> was at this time intellectual, war weary, and thoroughly skeptical of all existing religions and universe philosophies. The peoples of the Western world, the beneficiaries of Greek culture, had a revered tradition of a great past. They could contemplate the inheritance of great accomplishments in philosophy, art, literature, and political progress. But with all these achievements they had no soul-satisfying religion. Their spiritual longings remained unsatisfied.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_3">195:0.3</a></small></sup>  Upon such a stage of human society the teachings of Jesus, embraced in the Christian message, were suddenly thrust. A new order of living was thus presented to the hungry hearts of these Western peoples. This situation meant immediate conflict between the older religious practices and the new Christianized version of Jesus’ message to the world. Such a conflict must result in either decided victory for the new or for the old or in some degree of <i>compromise.</i> History shows that the struggle ended in compromise. Christianity presumed to embrace too much for any one people to assimilate in one or two generations. It was not a simple spiritual appeal, such as Jesus had presented to the souls of men; it early struck a decided attitude on religious rituals, education, magic, medicine, art, literature, law, government, morals, sex regulation, polygamy, and, in limited degree, even slavery. Christianity came not merely as a new religion—something all the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_Empire">Roman Empire</a> and all the Orient were waiting for—but as a <i>new order of human society.</i> And as such a pretension it quickly precipitated the social-moral clash of the ages. The ideals of Jesus, as they were reinterpreted by <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> philosophy and socialized in Christianity, now boldly challenged the traditions of the human race embodied in the ethics, morality, and religions of Western civilization.</p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_4">195:0.4</a></small></sup>  At first, <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a> won as converts only the lower social and economic strata. But by the beginning of the second century the very best of Greco-Roman culture was increasingly turning to this new order of Christian belief, this new concept of the purpose of living and the goal of existence.</p>
<p id="p0_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_5">195:0.5</a></small></sup>  How did this new message of Jewish origin, which had almost failed in the land of its birth, so quickly and effectively capture the very best minds of the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_Empire">Roman Empire</a>? The triumph of Christianity over the philosophic religions and the mystery cults was due to:</p>
<p id="p0_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_6">195:0.6</a></small></sup>  1. Organization. <a href="/en/topic/Paul">Paul</a> was a great organizer and his successors kept up the pace he set.</p>
<p id="p0_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_7">195:0.7</a></small></sup>  2. <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a> was thoroughly Hellenized. It embraced the best in <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> philosophy as well as the cream of Hebrew theology.</p>
<p id="p0_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_8">195:0.8</a></small></sup>  3. But best of all, it contained a new and great <i>ideal,</i> the echo of the life bestowal of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the reflection of his message of salvation for all mankind.</p>
<p id="p0_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_9">195:0.9</a></small></sup>  4. The Christian leaders were willing to make such compromises with <a href="/en/topic/Mithraism">Mithraism</a> that the better half of its adherents were won over to the <a href="/en/topic/Antioch">Antioch</a> cult.</p>
<p id="p0_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_10">195:0.10</a></small></sup>  5. Likewise did the next and later generations of Christian leaders make such further compromises with paganism that even the Roman emperor <a href="/en/topic/Constantine">Constantine</a> was won to the new religion.</p>
<p id="p0_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_11">195:0.11</a></small></sup>  But the Christians made a shrewd bargain with the pagans in that they adopted the ritualistic pageantry of the pagan while compelling the pagan to accept the Hellenized version of <a href="/en/topic/Christian_church,_early">Pauline Christianity</a>. They made a better bargain with the pagans than they did with the Mithraic cult, but even in that earlier compromise they came off more than conquerors in that they succeeded in eliminating the gross immoralities and also numerous other reprehensible practices of the Persian mystery.</p>
<p id="p0_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_12">195:0.12</a></small></sup>  Wisely or unwisely, these early leaders of Christianity deliberately compromised the <i>ideals</i> of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> in an effort to save and further many of his <i>ideas.</i> And they were eminently successful. But mistake not! these compromised ideals of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> are still latent in his gospel, and they will eventually assert their full power upon the world.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1"><a href="#fn_a1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_13">195:0.13</a></small></sup>  By this <a href="/en/topic/Christian_church,_early">paganization of Christianity</a> the old order won many minor victories of a ritualistic nature, but the Christians gained the ascendancy in that:</p>
<p id="p0_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_14">195:0.14</a></small></sup>  1. A new and enormously higher note in human morals was struck.</p>
<p id="p0_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_15">195:0.15</a></small></sup>  2. A new and greatly enlarged concept of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> was given to the world.</p>
<p id="p0_16"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_16">195:0.16</a></small></sup>  3. The hope of immortality became a part of the assurance of a recognized religion.</p>
<p id="p0_17"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_17">195:0.17</a></small></sup>  4. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> was given to man’s hungry soul.</p>
<p id="p0_18"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_18">195:0.18</a></small></sup>  Many of the great truths taught by Jesus were almost lost in these early compromises, but they yet slumber in this religion of <a href="/en/topic/Christian_church,_early">paganized Christianity</a>, which was in turn the Pauline version of the life and teachings of the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>. And <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a>, even before it was paganized, was first thoroughly Hellenized. Christianity owes much, very much, to the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a>. It was a Greek, from <a href="/en/topic/Egypt">Egypt</a>, who so bravely stood up at <a href="/en/topic/Nicaea">Nicaea</a> and so fearlessly challenged this assembly that it dared not so obscure the concept of the nature of Jesus that the real truth of his bestowal might have been in danger of being lost to the world. This Greek’s name was <a href="/en/topic/Athanasius">Athanasius</a>, and but for the eloquence and the logic of this believer, the persuasions of <a href="/en/topic/Arius">Arius</a> would have triumphed.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. INFLUENCE OF THE GREEKS </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_1">195:1.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Christian_church,_early">Hellenization of Christianity</a> started in earnest on that eventful day when the Apostle <a href="/en/topic/Paul">Paul</a> stood before the council of the <a href="/en/topic/Areopagus">Areopagus</a> in <a href="/en/topic/Athens">Athens</a> and told the Athenians about “the Unknown <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.” There, under the shadow of the <a href="/en/topic/Acropolis">Acropolis</a>, this Roman citizen proclaimed to these <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a> his version of the new religion which had taken origin in the Jewish land of <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>. And there was something strangely alike in Greek philosophy and many of the teachings of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. They had a common goal—both aimed at the <i>emergence of the <a href="/en/topic/individual">individual</a>.</i> The Greek, at social and political emergence; Jesus, at moral and spiritual emergence. The Greek taught intellectual liberalism leading to political freedom; Jesus taught spiritual liberalism leading to religious <a href="/en/topic/liberty">liberty</a>. These two ideas put together constituted a new and mighty charter for human freedom; they presaged man’s social, political, and spiritual liberty.</p>

<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_2">195:1.2</a></small></sup>  Christianity came into existence and triumphed over all contending religions primarily because of two things:</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_3">195:1.3</a></small></sup>  1. The <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> mind was willing to borrow new and good ideas even from the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_4">195:1.4</a></small></sup>  2. <a href="/en/topic/Paul">Paul</a> and his successors were willing but shrewd and sagacious compromisers; they were keen theologic traders.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_5">195:1.5</a></small></sup>  At the time Paul stood up in <a href="/en/topic/Athens">Athens</a> preaching “<a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a> and Him Crucified,” the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a> were spiritually hungry; they were inquiring, interested, and actually looking for spiritual truth<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>. Never forget that at first the <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a> fought <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a>, while the Greeks embraced it, and that it was the Greeks who literally forced the Romans subsequently to accept this new religion, as then modified, as a part of Greek culture.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_6">195:1.6</a></small></sup>  The Greek revered beauty, the Jew holiness, but both peoples loved truth. For centuries the Greek had seriously thought and earnestly debated about all human problems—social, economic, political, and philosophic—except religion. Few Greeks had paid much attention to religion; they did not take even their own religion very seriously. For centuries the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> had neglected these other fields of thought while they devoted their minds to religion. They took their religion very seriously, too seriously. As illuminated by the content of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ message, the united product of the centuries of the thought of these two peoples now became the driving power of a new order of human society and, to a certain extent, of a new order of human religious belief and practice.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_7">195:1.7</a></small></sup>  The influence of Greek culture had already penetrated the lands of the western <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_region">Mediterranean</a> when <a href="/en/topic/Alexander_of_Cyrene">Alexander</a> spread Hellenistic civilization over the near-Eastern world. The <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a> did very well with their religion and their politics as long as they lived in small city-states, but when the Macedonian king dared to expand <a href="/en/topic/Greece">Greece</a> into an empire, stretching from the Adriatic to the <a href="/en/topic/Indus">Indus</a>, trouble began. The art and philosophy of Greece were fully equal to the task of imperial expansion, but not so with Greek political administration or religion. After the city-states of Greece had expanded into empire, their rather parochial gods seemed a little queer. The Greeks were really searching for <i>one <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>,</i> a greater and better God, when the Christianized version of the older <a href="/en/topic/Jewish_religion">Jewish religion</a> came to them.</p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_8">195:1.8</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Hellenistic_Empire">Hellenistic Empire</a>, as such, could not endure. Its cultural sway continued on, but it endured only after securing from the West the Roman political genius for empire administration and after obtaining from the East a religion whose one God possessed empire dignity.</p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_9">195:1.9</a></small></sup>  In <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> century after <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a>, Hellenistic culture had already attained its highest levels; its retrogression had begun; learning was advancing but genius was declining. It was at this very time that the ideas and ideals of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, which were partially embodied in <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a>, became a part of the salvage of <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> culture and learning.</p>
<p id="p1_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_10">195:1.10</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Alexander_of_Cyrene">Alexander</a> had charged on the East with the cultural gift of the civilization of <a href="/en/topic/Greece">Greece</a>; <a href="/en/topic/Paul">Paul</a> assaulted the West with the Christian version of the gospel of Jesus. And wherever the Greek culture prevailed throughout the West, there Hellenized Christianity took root.</p>
<p id="p1_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_11">195:1.11</a></small></sup>  The Eastern version of the message of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, notwithstanding that it remained more true to his teachings, continued to follow the uncompromising attitude of <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a>. It never progressed as did the Hellenized version and was eventually lost in the Islamic movement.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2"><a href="#fn_a2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. THE ROMAN INFLUENCE </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p2_1">195:2.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a> bodily took over <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> culture, putting representative government in the place of government <a href="/en/topic/casting_lots">by lot</a>. And presently this change favored <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a> in that <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a> brought into the whole Western world a new tolerance for strange languages, peoples, and even religions.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p2_2">195:2.2</a></small></sup>  Much of the early <a href="/en/topic/persecution">persecution</a> of Christians in Rome was due solely to their unfortunate use of the term “kingdom” in their preaching. The Romans were tolerant of any and all religions but very resentful of anything that savored of political rivalry. And so, when these early persecutions, due so largely to misunderstanding, died out, the field for religious propaganda was wide open. The Roman was interested in political administration; he cared little for either art or religion, but he was unusually tolerant of both.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p2_3">195:2.3</a></small></sup>  Oriental <a href="/en/topic/law">law</a> was stern and arbitrary; <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> law was fluid and artistic; Roman law was dignified and respect-breeding. Roman education bred an unheard-of and stolid <a href="/en/topic/loyalty">loyalty</a>. The early <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a> were politically devoted and sublimely consecrated individuals. They were honest, zealous, and dedicated to their ideals, but without a religion worthy of the name. Small wonder that their Greek teachers were able to persuade them to accept <a href="/en/topic/Christian_church,_early">Paul’s Christianity</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p2_4">195:2.4</a></small></sup>  And these Romans were a great people. They could govern the Occident because they did govern themselves. Such unparalleled honesty, devotion, and stalwart self-control was ideal soil for the reception and growth of Christianity.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p2_5">195:2.5</a></small></sup>  It was easy for these Greco-Romans to become just as spiritually devoted to an institutional church as they were politically devoted to the state. The <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a> fought the church only when they feared it as a competitor of the state. <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a>, having little national philosophy or native culture, took over <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> culture for its own and boldly adopted <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a> as its moral philosophy. <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a> became the moral culture of Rome but hardly its religion in the sense of being the individual experience in spiritual growth of those who embraced the new religion in such a wholesale manner. True, indeed, many individuals did penetrate beneath the surface of all this state religion and found for the nourishment of their souls the real values of the hidden meanings held within the latent truths of Hellenized and <a href="/en/topic/Christian_church,_early">paganized Christianity</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p2_6">195:2.6</a></small></sup>  The Stoic and his sturdy appeal to “nature and conscience” had only the better prepared all Rome to receive Christ, at least in an intellectual sense. The Roman was by nature and training a lawyer; he revered even the laws of nature. And now, in Christianity, he discerned in the laws of nature the laws of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. A people that could produce <a href="/en/topic/Cicero">Cicero</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Vergil">Vergil</a> were ripe for <a href="/en/topic/Paul">Paul</a>’s Hellenized Christianity.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p2_7">195:2.7</a></small></sup>  And so did these Romanized <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a> force both <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> and Christians to philosophize their religion, to co-ordinate its ideas and systematize its ideals, to adapt religious practices to the existing current of life. And all this was enormously helped by translation of the Hebrew scriptures into Greek and by the later recording of the <a href="/en/topic/New_Testament">New Testament</a> in the Greek tongue.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p2_8">195:2.8</a></small></sup>  The Greeks, in contrast with the Jews and many other peoples, had long provisionally believed in immortality, some sort of survival after death, and since this was the very heart of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ teaching, it was certain that <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a> would make a strong appeal to them.</p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p2_9">195:2.9</a></small></sup>  A succession of Greek-cultural and Roman-political victories had consolidated the <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_region">Mediterranean</a> lands into one empire, with one <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a> and one culture, and had made the Western world ready for one <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. <a href="/en/topic/Judaism">Judaism</a> provided this God, but Judaism was not acceptable as a religion to these Romanized <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a>. Philo helped some to mitigate their objections, but Christianity revealed to them an even better concept of one God, and they embraced it readily.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. UNDER THE ROMAN EMPIRE </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p3_1">195:3.1</a></small></sup>  After the consolidation of Roman political rule and after the dissemination of <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a>, the Christians found themselves with one <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, a great religious concept, but without empire. The Greco-Romans found themselves with a great empire but without a God to serve as the suitable religious concept for empire worship and spiritual unification. The Christians accepted the empire; the empire adopted Christianity. The Roman provided a unity of political rule; the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a>, a unity of culture and learning; Christianity, a unity of religious thought and practice.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p3_2">195:3.2</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a> overcame the tradition of <a href="/en/topic/nationalism">nationalism</a> by imperial universalism and for <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> time in <a href="/en/topic/history">history</a> made it possible for different races and nations at least nominally to accept <a href="/en/topic/Roman_Catholic_Church">one religion</a>.</p>
