The peoples of the Western world, the beneficiaries of Greek culture, had a revered tradition of a great past. They could contemplate the inheritance of great accomplishments in philosophy, art, literature, and political progress. But with all these achievements they had no soul-satisfying religion. Their spiritual longings remained unsatisfied.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p0_3">195:0.3</a></small></sup>  Upon such a stage of human society the teachings of Jesus, embraced in the Christian message, were suddenly thrust. A new order of living was thus presented to the hungry hearts of these Western peoples. This situation meant immediate conflict between the older religious practices and the new Christianized version of Jesus’ message to the world. Such a conflict must result in either decided victory for the new or for the old or in some degree of <i>compromise.</i> <a href="/en/topic/history">History</a> shows that the struggle ended in compromise. Christianity presumed to embrace too much for any one people to assimilate in one or two generations. It was not a simple spiritual appeal, such as Jesus had presented to the souls of men; it early struck a decided attitude on religious rituals, education, magic, medicine, art, literature, law, government, morals, sex regulation, polygamy, and, in limited degree, even slavery. Christianity came not merely as a new religion—something all the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_Empire">Roman Empire</a> and all the Orient were waiting for—but as a <i>new order of human society.</i> And as such a pretension it quickly precipitated the social-moral clash of the ages. The ideals of Jesus, as they were reinterpreted by <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> philosophy and socialized in Christianity, now boldly challenged the traditions of the human race embodied in the ethics, morality, and religions of Western civilization.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_3_30"><a href="#fn_a0_3_30">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_3_264"><a href="#fn_a0_3_264">[2]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_3_16"><a href="#fn_s0_3_16">[2]</a></sup></p>

They made a better bargain with the pagans than they did with the <a href="/en/topic/Mithraism">Mithraic cult</a>, but even in that earlier compromise they came off more than conquerors in that they succeeded in eliminating the gross immoralities and also numerous other reprehensible practices of the Persian mystery.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_11_312"><a href="#fn_a0_11_312">[3]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_11_9"><a href="#fn_s0_11_9">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s0_11_16"><a href="#fn_s0_11_16">[2]</a></sup></p>
