This was <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> week of Jesus’ sojourn there, and he was very active in teaching the multitude and instructing the apostles. He preached every afternoon to the crowds and each night answered questions for the apostles and certain of the more advanced disciples residing at the camp.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_1_2"><a href="#fn_a0_1_2">[1]</a></sup></p>

And thus it was at the very height of the second phase of the public ministry of the kingdom that Jesus planned to teach this one short week at Pella and then to begin the tour of southern <a href="/en/topic/Perea">Perea</a> which led right up to the final and tragic experiences of the last week in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>.</p>

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/169#p1_1">169:1.1</a></small></sup>  On <a href="/en/topic/Thursday">Thursday</a> afternoon <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> talked to the multitude about the “Grace of Salvation.” In the course of this sermon he retold the <a href="/en/topic/Genesis,_Book_of">story</a> of the lost sheep and the lost coin and then added his favorite parable of the prodigal son. Said Jesus:<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_1_1"><a href="#fn_s1_1_1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/169#p1_2">169:1.2</a></small></sup>  “You have been admonished by the prophets from <a href="/en/topic/Samuel">Samuel</a> to John that you should seek for <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>—search for truth<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>. Always have they said, ‘Seek the Lord while he may be found.’ And all such teaching should be taken to heart. But I have come to show you that, while you are seeking to find God, God is likewise seeking to find you. Many times have I told you the story of the good shepherd who left the ninety and nine sheep in the fold while he went forth searching for the one that was <a href="/en/topic/lost">lost</a>, and how, when he had found the straying sheep, he laid it over his shoulder and tenderly carried it back to the fold. And when the lost sheep had been restored to the fold, you remember that the good shepherd called in his friends and bade them rejoice with him over the finding of the sheep that had been lost. Again I say there is more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over the ninety and nine just persons who need no repentance. The fact that souls are <i>lost</i> only increases the interest of the heavenly Father. I have come to this world to do my Father’s bidding, and it has truly been said of the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> that he is a friend of publicans and <a href="/en/topic/sinners">sinners</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>.</p>

You are all like sheep which have gone astray, and I have come to seek and to save those who are lost<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b9"><a href="#fn_b9">[9]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/169#p1_4">169:1.4</a></small></sup>  “And you should also remember the <a href="/en/topic/Genesis,_Book_of">story</a> of the woman who, having had ten pieces of silver made into a necklace of adornment, <a href="/en/topic/lost">lost</a> one piece, and how she lit the lamp and diligently swept the house and kept up the search until she found the lost piece of silver. And as soon as she found the coin that was lost, she called together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece that was lost.’ So again I say, there is always joy in the presence of the <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a> of heaven over one sinner who repents and returns to the Father’s fold<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b11"><a href="#fn_b11">[11]</a></sup>. And I tell you this story to impress upon you that the Father and his Son go forth to <i>search</i> for those who are lost, and in this search we employ all influences capable of rendering assistance in our diligent efforts to find those who are lost, those who stand in need of salvation. And so, while the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> goes out in the wilderness to seek for the sheep gone astray, he also searches for the coin which is lost in the house. The sheep wanders away, unintentionally; the coin is covered by the dust of time and obscured by the accumulation of the things of men.</p>

Now these two brothers did not get along well together; they were always quarreling and bickering. The younger lad was cheerful and vivacious, but indolent and unreliable; the older son was steady and industrious, at the same time self-centered, surly, and conceited. The younger son enjoyed play but shunned work; the older devoted himself to work but seldom played. This association became so disagreeable that the younger son came to his father and said: ‘Father, give me the third portion of your possessions which would fall to me and allow me to go out into the world to seek my own fortune.’ And when the father heard this request, knowing how unhappy the young man was at home and with his older brother, he divided his property, giving the youth his share<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b12"><a href="#fn_b12">[12]</a></sup>.</p>
