<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p0_2">72:0.2</a></small></sup>  Of all the Satania worlds which became isolated because of participation in the <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">Lucifer rebellion</a>, this planet has experienced a history most like that of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. The similarity of the two spheres undoubtedly explains why permission to make this extraordinary presentation was granted, for it is most unusual for the system rulers to consent to the narration on one planet of the affairs of another.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_2_28"><a href="#fn_a0_2_28">[3]</a></sup></p>

It received a Material Son shortly after <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> came to Urantia, and this Son also defaulted, leaving the sphere isolated, since a Magisterial Son has never been bestowed upon its mortal races.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_3_5"><a href="#fn_a0_3_5">[4]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. THE CONTINENTAL NATION </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p1_1">72:1.1</a></small></sup>  Notwithstanding all these planetary handicaps a very superior civilization is evolving on an isolated continent about the size of <a href="/en/topic/Australia">Australia</a>. This <a href="/en/topic/continental_nation">nation</a> numbers about 140 million. Its people are a mixed race, predominantly blue and yellow, having a slightly greater proportion of violet than the so-called white race of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. These different races are not yet fully blended, but they fraternize and socialize very acceptably. The average length of life on this continent is now ninety years, fifteen per cent higher than that of any other people on the planet.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_1_24"><a href="#fn_a1_1_24">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p1_2">72:1.2</a></small></sup>  The industrial mechanism of this nation enjoys a certain great advantage derived from the unique topography of the continent. The high mountains, on which heavy rains fall eight months in the year, are situated at the very center of the country. This natural arrangement favors the utilization of water power and greatly facilitates the irrigation of the more arid western quarter of the continent.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p1_3">72:1.3</a></small></sup>  These people are self-sustaining, that is, they can live indefinitely without importing anything from the surrounding nations. Their natural resources are replete, and by scientific techniques they have learned how to compensate for their deficiencies in the essentials of life. They enjoy a brisk domestic commerce but have little foreign trade owing to the universal hostility of their less progressive neighbors.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p1_4">72:1.4</a></small></sup>  This <a href="/en/topic/continental_nation">continental nation</a>, in general, followed the evolutionary trend of the planet: The development from the tribal stage to the appearance of strong rulers and kings occupied thousands of years. The unconditional monarchs were succeeded by many different orders of <a href="/en/topic/government">government</a>—abortive republics, communal states, and dictators came and went in endless profusion. This growth continued until about five hundred years ago when, during a politically fermenting period, one of the nation’s powerful dictator-triumvirs had a change of heart. He volunteered to abdicate upon condition that one of the other rulers, the baser of the remaining two, also vacate his dictatorship. Thus was the sovereignty of the continent placed in the hands of one ruler. The unified state progressed under strong monarchial rule for over one hundred years, during which there evolved a masterful charter of liberty.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p1_5">72:1.5</a></small></sup>  The subsequent transition from monarchy to a representative form of government was gradual, the kings remaining as mere social or sentimental figureheads, finally disappearing when the male line of descent ran out. The present republic has now been in existence just two hundred years, during which time there has been a continuous progression toward the governmental techniques about to be narrated, <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> developments in industrial and political realms having been made within the past decade.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. POLITICAL ORGANIZATION </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p2_1">72:2.1</a></small></sup>  This <a href="/en/topic/continental_nation">continental nation</a> now has a representative <a href="/en/topic/government">government</a> with a centrally located national capital. The central government consists of a strong federation of one hundred comparatively free states. These states elect their governors and legislators for ten years, and none are eligible for re-election. State <a href="/en/topic/judges">judges</a> are appointed for life by the governors and confirmed by their legislatures, which consist of one representative for each one hundred thousand citizens.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p2_2">72:2.2</a></small></sup>  There are five different types of metropolitan government, depending on the size of the city, but no city is permitted to have more than one million inhabitants. On the whole, these municipal governing schemes are very simple, direct, and economical. The few offices of city administration are keenly sought by the highest types of citizens.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_2_26"><a href="#fn_a2_2_26">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p2_3">72:2.3</a></small></sup>  The federal <a href="/en/topic/government">government</a> embraces three co-ordinate divisions: executive, legislative, and judicial. The federal chief executive is elected every six years by universal territorial suffrage. He is not eligible for re-election except upon the petition of at least seventy-five state legislatures concurred in by the respective state governors, and then but for one term. He is advised by a supercabinet composed of all living ex-chief executives.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p2_4">72:2.4</a></small></sup>  The legislative division embraces three houses:<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_4_0"><a href="#fn_s2_4_0">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p2_5">72:2.5</a></small></sup>  1. The <i>upper house</i> is elected by industrial, professional, agricultural, and other groups of workers, balloting in accordance with economic function.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p2_6">72:2.6</a></small></sup>  2. The <i>lower house</i> is elected by certain organizations of society embracing the social, political, and philosophic groups not included in industry or the professions. All citizens in good standing participate in the election of both classes of representatives, but they are differently grouped, depending on whether the election pertains to the upper or lower house.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p2_7">72:2.7</a></small></sup>  3. The <i>third house—</i>the elder statesmen—embraces the veterans of civic service and includes many distinguished persons nominated by the chief executive, by the regional (subfederal) executives, by the chief of the supreme tribunal, and by the presiding officers of either of the other legislative houses. This group is limited to one hundred, and its members are elected by the majority action of the elder statesmen themselves. Membership is for life, and when vacancies occur, the person receiving the largest ballot among the list of nominees is thereby duly elected. The scope of this body is purely advisory, but it is a mighty regulator of public opinion and exerts a powerful influence upon all branches of the <a href="/en/topic/government">government</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p2_8">72:2.8</a></small></sup>  Very much of the federal administrative work is carried on by the ten regional (subfederal) authorities, each consisting of the association of ten states. These regional divisions are wholly executive and administrative, having neither legislative nor judicial functions. The ten regional executives are the personal appointees of the federal chief executive, and their term of office is concurrent with his—six years. The federal supreme tribunal approves the appointment of these ten regional executives, and while they may not be reappointed, the retiring executive automatically becomes the associate and adviser of his successor. Otherwise, these regional chiefs choose their own cabinets of administrative officials.</p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p2_9">72:2.9</a></small></sup>  This <a href="/en/topic/continental_nation">nation</a> is adjudicated by two major court systems—the law courts and the socioeconomic courts. The law courts function on the following three levels:</p>
<p id="p2_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p2_10">72:2.10</a></small></sup>  1. <i>Minor courts</i> of municipal and local jurisdiction, whose decisions may be appealed to the high state tribunals.</p>
<p id="p2_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p2_11">72:2.11</a></small></sup>  2. <i>State supreme courts,</i> whose decisions are final in all matters not involving the federal <a href="/en/topic/government">government</a> or jeopardy of citizenship rights and liberties. The regional executives are empowered to bring any case at once to the bar of the federal supreme court.</p>
<p id="p2_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p2_12">72:2.12</a></small></sup>  3. <i>Federal supreme court—</i>the high tribunal for the adjudication of national contentions and the appellate cases coming up from the state courts. This supreme tribunal consists of twelve men over forty and under seventy-five years of age who have served two or more years on some state tribunal, and who have been appointed to this high position by the chief executive with the majority approval of the supercabinet and the third house of the legislative assembly. All decisions of this supreme judicial body are by at least a two-thirds vote.</p>
<p id="p2_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p2_13">72:2.13</a></small></sup>  The socioeconomic courts function in the following three divisions:</p>
<p id="p2_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p2_14">72:2.14</a></small></sup>  1. <i>Parental courts,</i> associated with the legislative and executive divisions of the home and social system.</p>
<p id="p2_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p2_15">72:2.15</a></small></sup>  2. <i>Educational courts—</i>the juridical bodies connected with the state and regional school systems and associated with the executive and legislative branches of the educational administrative mechanism.</p>
<p id="p2_16"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p2_16">72:2.16</a></small></sup>  3. <i><a href="/en/topic/industry">Industrial</a> <a href="/en/topic/courts">courts</a>—</i>the jurisdictional tribunals vested with full authority for the settlement of all economic misunderstandings.</p>
<p id="p2_17"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p2_17">72:2.17</a></small></sup>  The federal supreme court does not pass upon socioeconomic cases except upon the three-quarters vote of the third legislative branch of the national <a href="/en/topic/government">government</a>, the house of elder statesmen. Otherwise, all decisions of the parental, educational, and industrial high courts are final.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. THE HOME LIFE </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p3_1">72:3.1</a></small></sup>  On this <a href="/en/topic/continental_nation">continent</a> it is against the law for two families to live under the same roof. And since group dwellings have been outlawed, most of the tenement type of buildings have been demolished. But the unmarried still live in clubs, hotels, and other group dwellings. The smallest homesite permitted must provide fifty thousand square feet of land. All land and other property used for <a href="/en/topic/home">home</a> purposes are free from <a href="/en/topic/taxation">taxation</a> up to ten times the minimum homesite allotment.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_1_24"><a href="#fn_a3_1_24">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_1_15"><a href="#fn_a3_1_15">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p3_2">72:3.2</a></small></sup>  The home life of this people has greatly improved during <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> century. Attendance of parents, both fathers and mothers, at the parental schools of <a href="/en/topic/child-rearing">child culture</a> is compulsory. Even the agriculturists who reside in small country settlements carry on this work by correspondence, going to the near-by centers for oral instruction once in ten days—every two weeks, for they maintain a five-day week.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_2_29"><a href="#fn_a3_2_29">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p3_3">72:3.3</a></small></sup>  The average number of children in each family is five, and they are under the full control of their parents or, in case of the demise of one or both, under that of the guardians designated by the parental courts. It is considered a great honor for any family to be awarded the guardianship of a full orphan. Competitive examinations are held among parents, and the orphan is awarded to the <a href="/en/topic/home">home</a> of those displaying the best parental qualifications.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_3_24"><a href="#fn_a3_3_24">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p3_4">72:3.4</a></small></sup>  These people regard the home as the basic institution of their civilization. It is expected that the most valuable part of a child’s <a href="/en/topic/education">education</a> and character training will be secured from his parents and at home, and fathers devote almost as much attention to <a href="/en/topic/child-rearing">child culture</a> as do mothers.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_4_3"><a href="#fn_a3_4_3">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_4_4"><a href="#fn_a3_4_4">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_4_22"><a href="#fn_a3_4_22">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_4_23"><a href="#fn_a3_4_23">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_4_7"><a href="#fn_a3_4_7">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_4_26"><a href="#fn_a3_4_26">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p3_5">72:3.5</a></small></sup>  All <a href="/en/topic/sex">sex</a> instruction is administered in the <a href="/en/topic/home">home</a> by parents or by legal guardians. Moral instruction is offered by teachers during the rest periods in the school shops, but not so with religious training, which is deemed to be the exclusive privilege of parents, <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> being looked upon as an integral part of home life. Purely religious instruction is given publicly only in the temples of philosophy, no such exclusively religious institutions as the <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> churches having developed among this people. In their philosophy, religion is the striving to know <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and to manifest love for one’s fellows through service for them, but this is not typical of the religious status of the other nations on this planet. Religion is so entirely a family matter among these people that there are no public places devoted exclusively to religious assembly. Politically, church and state, as Urantians are wont to say, are entirely separate, but there is a strange overlapping of religion and philosophy.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_5_18"><a href="#fn_a3_5_18">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_5_20"><a href="#fn_a3_5_20">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p3_6">72:3.6</a></small></sup>  Until twenty years ago the spiritual teachers (comparable to Urantia pastors), who visit each family periodically to examine the children to ascertain if they have been properly instructed by their parents, were under governmental supervision. These spiritual advisers and examiners are now under the direction of the newly created <a href="/en/topic/Foundation_of_Spiritual_Progress">Foundation of Spiritual Progress</a>, an institution supported by voluntary contributions. Possibly this institution may not further evolve until after the arrival of a <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Magisterial Son.</p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p3_7">72:3.7</a></small></sup>  Children remain legally subject to their parents until they are fifteen, when <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> initiation into civic responsibility is held. Thereafter, every five years for five successive periods similar public exercises are held for such age groups at which their obligations to parents are lessened, while new civic and social responsibilities to the state are assumed. Suffrage is conferred at twenty, the right to marry without parental consent is not bestowed until twenty-five, and children must leave <a href="/en/topic/home">home</a> on reaching the age of thirty.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_7_30"><a href="#fn_a3_7_30">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p3_8">72:3.8</a></small></sup>  Marriage and <a href="/en/topic/divorce">divorce</a> laws are uniform throughout the <a href="/en/topic/continental_nation">nation</a>. Marriage before twenty—the age of civil enfranchisement—is not permitted. Permission to marry is only granted after one year’s notice of intention, and after both bride and groom present certificates showing that they have been duly instructed in the parental schools regarding the responsibilities of married life.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_8_23"><a href="#fn_a3_8_23">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_8_7"><a href="#fn_a3_8_7">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_8_29"><a href="#fn_a3_8_29">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p3_9">72:3.9</a></small></sup>  Divorce regulations are somewhat lax, but decrees of separation, issued by the parental courts, may not be had until one year after application therefor has been recorded, and the year on this planet is considerably longer than on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. Notwithstanding their easy divorce laws, the present rate of divorces is only one tenth that of the civilized races of Urantia.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_9_0"><a href="#fn_a3_9_0">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p4_1">72:4.1</a></small></sup>  The educational system of this <a href="/en/topic/continental_nation">nation</a> is compulsory and coeducational in the precollege schools that the student attends from the ages of five to eighteen. These schools are vastly different from those of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. There are no classrooms, only one study is pursued at a time, and after <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> three years all pupils become <a href="/en/topic/assistant_teachers">assistant teachers</a>, instructing those below them. Books are used only to secure information that will assist in solving the problems arising in the school shops and on the school farms. Much of the furniture used on the continent and the many mechanical contrivances—this is a great age of invention and mechanization—are produced in these shops. Adjacent to each shop is a working library where the student may consult the necessary reference books. Agriculture and horticulture are also taught throughout the entire educational period on the extensive farms adjoining every local school.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_1_22"><a href="#fn_a4_1_22">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_1_15"><a href="#fn_a4_1_15">[18]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p4_3">72:4.3</a></small></sup>  Everyone takes one month’s vacation each year. The precollege schools are conducted for nine months out of the year of ten, the vacation being spent with parents or friends in travel. This travel is a part of the adult-education program and is continued throughout a lifetime, the funds for meeting such expenses being accumulated by the same methods as those employed in old-age insurance.</p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p4_4">72:4.4</a></small></sup>  One quarter of the school time is devoted to play—competitive athletics—the pupils progressing in these contests from the local, through the state and regional, and on to the national trials of skill and prowess.

<h2 id="p9" class="toc-header"><a href="#p9" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 9. THE PLAN OF UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE </h2>
<p id="p9_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p9_1">72:9.1</a></small></sup>  Although candidates for all public offices are restricted to graduates of the state, regional, or federal schools of statesmanship, the progressive leaders of this <a href="/en/topic/continental_nation">nation</a> discovered a serious weakness in their plan of universal suffrage and about fifty years ago made constitutional provision for a modified scheme of voting which embraces the following features:</p>
<p id="p9_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p9_2">72:9.2</a></small></sup>  1. Every man and woman of twenty years and over has one vote. Upon attaining this age, all citizens must accept membership in two voting groups: They will join <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> in accordance with their economic function—industrial, professional, agricultural, or trade; they will enter the second group according to their political, philosophic, and social inclinations. All workers thus belong to some economic franchise group, and these guilds, like the noneconomic associations, are regulated much as is the national <a href="/en/topic/government">government</a> with its threefold division of powers. Registration in these groups cannot be changed for twelve years.</p>
<p id="p9_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p9_3">72:9.3</a></small></sup>  2. Upon nomination by the state governors or by the regional executives and by the mandate of the regional supreme councils, individuals who have rendered great service to society, or who have demonstrated extraordinary wisdom in government service, may have additional votes conferred upon them not oftener than every five years and not to exceed nine such superfranchises. The maximum <a href="/en/topic/suffrage">suffrage</a> of any multiple voter is ten. Scientists, inventors, teachers, philosophers, and spiritual leaders are also thus recognized and honored with augmented political power. These advanced civic privileges are conferred by the state and regional supreme councils much as degrees are bestowed by the special colleges, and the recipients are proud to attach the symbols of such civic <a href="/en/topic/recognition">recognition</a>, along with their other degrees, to their lists of personal achievements.</p>
<p id="p9_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p9_4">72:9.4</a></small></sup>  3. All individuals sentenced to compulsory labor in the mines and all governmental servants supported by tax funds are, for the periods of such services, disenfranchised. This does not apply to aged persons who may be retired on pensions at sixty-five.</p>
<p id="p9_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p9_5">72:9.5</a></small></sup>  4. There are five brackets of suffrage reflecting the average yearly taxes paid for each half-decade period. Heavy <a href="/en/topic/taxpayers">taxpayers</a> are permitted extra votes up to five. This grant is independent of all other recognition, but in no case can any person cast over ten ballots.</p>
<p id="p9_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p9_6">72:9.6</a></small></sup>  5. At the time this franchise plan was adopted, the territorial method of voting was abandoned in favor of the economic or functional system. All citizens now vote as members of industrial, social, or professional groups, regardless of their residence. Thus the electorate consists of solidified, unified, and intelligent groups who elect only their best members to positions of governmental trust and responsibility. There is one exception to this scheme of functional or group suffrage: The election of a federal chief executive every six years is by nation-wide ballot, and no citizen casts over one vote.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a9_6_28"><a href="#fn_a9_6_28">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p9_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p9_7">72:9.7</a></small></sup>  Thus, except in the election of the chief executive, <a href="/en/topic/suffrage">suffrage</a> is exercised by economic, professional, intellectual, and social groupings of the citizenry. The ideal state is organic, and every free and intelligent group of citizens represents a vital and functioning organ within the larger governmental organism.</p>
