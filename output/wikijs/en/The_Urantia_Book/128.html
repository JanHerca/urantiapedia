The self-realization of divinity was a slow and, from the human standpoint, a natural evolutionary revelation. This revelation and self-realization of divinity began in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> when he was not quite thirteen years old with <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> supernatural occurrence of his human existence; and this experience of effecting the self-realization of his divine nature was completed at the time of his second supernatural experience while in the flesh, the episode attendant upon his baptism by <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a> in the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a>, which event marked the beginning of his public career of ministry and teaching.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_8_11"><a href="#fn_a1_8_11">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_8_8"><a href="#fn_a1_8_8">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_8_15"><a href="#fn_a1_8_15">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_8_16"><a href="#fn_a1_8_16">[7]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_8_2"><a href="#fn_s1_8_2">[1]</a></sup></p>

Notwithstanding this, the babe of <a href="/en/topic/Bethlehem_(Judea)">Bethlehem</a>, the lad, youth, and man of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, was in reality the incarnated Creator of a universe; but he never once used aught of this power, nor did he utilize the guidance of celestial personalities, aside from that of his <a href="/en/topic/guardian_angels">guardian seraphim</a>, in the living of his human life up to the day of his baptism by John.

<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p2_4">128:2.4</a></small></sup>  Before taking up his new employment at Sepphoris, Jesus held one of his periodic <a href="/en/topic/family">family</a> conferences and solemnly installed James, then just past eighteen years old, as acting head of the family. He promised his brother hearty support and full co-operation and exacted formal promises of obedience to James from each member of the family. From this day James assumed full financial responsibility for the family, Jesus making his weekly payments to his brother. Never again did Jesus take the reins out of James‚Äôs hands. While working at Sepphoris he could have walked home every night if necessary, but he purposely remained away, assigning weather and other reasons, but his true motive was to train James and Joseph in the bearing of the family responsibility. He had begun the slow process of weaning his family. Each <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> Jesus returned to Nazareth, and sometimes during the week when occasion required, to observe the working of the new plan, to give advice and offer helpful suggestions.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_4_6"><a href="#fn_a2_4_6">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_4_25"><a href="#fn_a2_4_25">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p2_5">128:2.5</a></small></sup>  Living much of the time in <a href="/en/topic/Sepphoris">Sepphoris</a> for six months afforded <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> a new opportunity to become better acquainted with the gentile viewpoint of life. He worked with gentiles, lived with gentiles, and in every possible manner did he make a close and painstaking study of their habits of living and of the gentile mind.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p2_6">128:2.6</a></small></sup>  The moral standards of this home city of <a href="/en/topic/Herod_Antipas">Herod Antipas</a> were so far below those of even the caravan city of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> that after six months‚Äô sojourn at Sepphoris Jesus was not averse to finding an excuse for returning to Nazareth. The group he worked for were to become engaged on public work in both Sepphoris and the new city of <a href="/en/topic/Tiberias">Tiberias</a>, and Jesus was disinclined to have anything to do with any sort of employment under the supervision of <a href="/en/topic/Herod_the_Great">Herod</a> Antipas. And there were still other reasons which made it wise, in the opinion of Jesus, for him to go back to Nazareth. When he returned to the repair shop, he did not again assume the personal direction of family affairs. He worked in association with <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James</a> at the shop and as far as possible permitted him to continue oversight of the home. <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>‚Äôs management of family expenditures and his administration of the home budget were undisturbed.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p2_7">128:2.7</a></small></sup>  It was by just such wise and thoughtful planning that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> prepared the way for his eventual withdrawal from active participation in the affairs of his family. When James had had two years‚Äô experience as acting head of the family‚Äîand two full years before he (James) was to be married‚Äî<a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> was placed in charge of the household funds and intrusted with the general management of the home.</p>

<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p3_1">128:3.1</a></small></sup>  This year the financial pressure was slightly relaxed as four were at work. <a href="/en/topic/Miriam_(Old_Testament)">Miriam</a> earned considerable by the sale of <a href="/en/topic/milk">milk</a> and butter; <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(wife_of_Justus)">Martha</a> had become an expert weaver.

<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p3_3">128:3.3</a></small></sup>  At Philadelphia <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> became acquainted with a <a href="/en/topic/merchant_of_Damascus">merchant from Damascus</a> who developed such a great liking for the Nazareth couple that he insisted they stop with him at his <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> headquarters. While <a href="/en/topic/Simon_of_Cyrene">Simon</a> gave attendance at the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>, Jesus spent much of his time talking with this well-educated and much-traveled man of world affairs. This merchant owned over four thousand caravan camels; he had interests all over the Roman world and was now on his way to <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a>. He proposed that Jesus come to <a href="/en/topic/Damascus">Damascus</a> to enter his Oriental import business, but Jesus explained that he did not feel justified in going so far away from his family just then. But on the way back home he thought much about these distant cities and the even more remote countries of the Far West and the Far East, countries he had so frequently heard spoken of by the caravan passengers and conductors.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p3_4">128:3.4</a></small></sup>  Simon greatly enjoyed his visit to Jerusalem.

While Simon attended the Passover ceremonies, Jesus mingled with the throngs of visitors and engaged in many interesting personal conferences with numerous gentile proselytes.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p3_5">128:3.5</a></small></sup>  Perhaps the most notable of all these contacts was the one with a young Hellenist named <a href="/en/topic/Stephen">Stephen</a>. This young man was on his first visit to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and chanced to meet <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> on <a href="/en/topic/Thursday">Thursday</a> afternoon of Passover week. While they both strolled about viewing the <a href="/en/topic/Asmonean_palace">Asmonean palace</a>, Jesus began the casual conversation that resulted in their becoming interested in each other, and which led to a four-hour discussion of the way of life and the true <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and his worship.

Some of Stephen‚Äôs extraordinary boldness in proclaiming his view of the new gospel was the direct result of this earlier interview with Jesus. But Stephen never even faintly surmised that the Galilean he had talked with some fifteen years previously was the very same person whom he later proclaimed the world‚Äôs Savior, and for whom he was so soon to die, thus becoming <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> martyr of the newly evolving Christian faith. When Stephen yielded up his life as the price of his attack upon the Jewish <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> and its traditional practices, there stood by one named <a href="/en/topic/Saul_(king)">Saul</a>, a citizen of <a href="/en/topic/Tarsus">Tarsus</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b32"><a href="#fn_b32">[32]</a></sup>.

She was slowly giving up the idea that Jesus was to fulfill any divine mission on earth, yet at times her faith was revived when she paused to recall the <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a> visitation before the child was born.</p>
<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 4. THE DAMASCUS EPISODE </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p4_1">128:4.1</a></small></sup>  The last four months of this year <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> spent in <a href="/en/topic/Damascus">Damascus</a> as the guest of the merchant whom he first met at <a href="/en/topic/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> when on his way to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. A representative of this merchant had sought out Jesus when passing through <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> and escorted him to Damascus. This part-Jewish merchant proposed to devote an extraordinary sum of money to the establishment of a school of religious philosophy at Damascus. He planned to create a center of learning which would out-rival <a href="/en/topic/Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. And he proposed that Jesus should immediately begin a long tour of the world‚Äôs educational centers preparatory to becoming the head of this new project. This was one of the greatest <a href="/en/topic/temptation">temptations</a> that Jesus ever faced in the course of his purely human career.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p4_2">128:4.2</a></small></sup>  Presently this merchant brought before Jesus a group of twelve merchants and bankers who agreed to support this newly projected school. Jesus manifested deep interest in the proposed school, helped them plan for its organization, but always expressed the fear that his other and unstated but prior obligations would prevent his accepting the direction of such a pretentious enterprise. His would-be benefactor was persistent, and he profitably employed Jesus at his home doing some translating while he, <a href="/en/topic/Claudia_Procula">his wife</a>, and their sons and daughters sought to prevail upon Jesus to accept the proffered honor. But he would not consent. He well knew that his mission on earth was not to be supported by institutions of learning; he knew that he must not obligate himself in the least to be directed by the ‚Äúcouncils of men,‚Äù no matter how well-intentioned.</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p4_3">128:4.3</a></small></sup>  He who was rejected by the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> religious leaders, even after he had demonstrated his leadership, was recognized and hailed as a master teacher by the businessmen and bankers of <a href="/en/topic/Damascus">Damascus</a>, and all this when he was an obscure and unknown carpenter of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_3_30"><a href="#fn_a4_3_30">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p4_4">128:4.4</a></small></sup>  He never spoke about this offer to his family, and the end of this year found him back in Nazareth going about his daily duties just as if he had never been tempted by the flattering propositions of his Damascus friends. Neither did these men of Damascus ever associate the later citizen of <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> who turned all Jewry upside down with the former carpenter of Nazareth who had dared to refuse the honor which their combined wealth might have procured.</p>
<p id="p4_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p4_5">128:4.5</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> most cleverly and intentionally contrived to detach various episodes of his life so that they never became, in the eyes of the world, associated together as the doings of a single individual. Many times in subsequent years he listened to the recital of this very story of the strange Galilean who declined the opportunity of founding a school in <a href="/en/topic/Damascus">Damascus</a> to compete with <a href="/en/topic/Alexandria">Alexandria</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p4_6">128:4.6</a></small></sup>  One purpose which Jesus had in mind, when he sought to segregate certain features of his earthly experience, was to prevent the building up of such a versatile and spectacular career as would cause subsequent generations to venerate the teacher in place of obeying the truth which he had lived and taught. Jesus did not want to build up such a human record of achievement as would attract attention from his teaching. Very early he recognized that his followers would be tempted to formulate a <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> <i>about</i> him which might become a competitor of the gospel of the kingdom that he intended to proclaim to the world. Accordingly, he consistently sought to suppress everything during his eventful career which he thought might be made to serve this natural human tendency to exalt the teacher in place of proclaiming his teachings.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_6_2"><a href="#fn_s4_6_2">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s4_6_0"><a href="#fn_s4_6_0">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p4_7">128:4.7</a></small></sup>  This same motive also explains why he permitted himself to be known by different titles during various epochs of his diversified life on earth. Again, he did not want to bring any undue influence to bear upon his family or others which would lead them to believe in him against their honest convictions. He always refused to take undue or unfair advantage of the human mind. He did not want men to believe in him unless their hearts were responsive to the spiritual realities revealed in his teachings.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_7_2"><a href="#fn_a4_7_2">[23]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_7_3"><a href="#fn_a4_7_3">[24]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p4_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p4_9">128:4.9</a></small></sup>  As the years passed, it became more difficult to realize that this man was a <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_God">Son of God</a> on earth.
