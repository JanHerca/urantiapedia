The former high priest desired to maintain his prestige as the chief ecclesiastical authority of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>. He also had another purpose in detaining Jesus at his house for several hours, and that was to allow time for legally calling together the court of the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a>. It was not lawful to convene the Sanhedrin court before the time of the offering of the morning sacrifice in the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>, and this sacrifice was offered about three o’clock in the morning.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_1_15"><a href="#fn_a0_1_15">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_1_18"><a href="#fn_a0_1_18">[2]</a></sup></p>

Some thirty members of the Sanhedrin had gathered at the home of the high priest by midnight so that they would be ready to sit in judgment on Jesus when he might be brought before them. Only those members were assembled who were strongly and openly opposed to Jesus and his teaching since it required only twenty-three to constitute a trial court.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p0_3">184:0.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> spent about three hours at the palace of <a href="/en/topic/Annas">Annas</a> on <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Olivet">Mount Olivet</a>, not far from the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Gethsemane">Gethsemane</a>, where they arrested him. <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John Zebedee</a> was free and safe in the palace of Annas not only because of the word of the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_centurion_of_Jerusalem">Roman captain</a>, but also because he and his brother <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James</a> were well known to the older servants, having many times been guests at the palace as the former high priest was a distant relative of their mother, <a href="/en/topic/Salome_(wife_of_Zebedee)">Salome</a>.</p>

He was a suave and politic planner and plotter. He desired to direct the matter of disposing of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>; he feared to trust such an important undertaking wholly to his brusque and aggressive son-in-law. Annas wanted to make sure that the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s trial was kept in the hands of the <a href="/en/topic/Sadducees">Sadducees</a>; he feared the possible sympathy of some of the <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a>, seeing that practically all of those members of the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> who had espoused the cause of Jesus were Pharisees.</p>

<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p1_2">184:1.2</a></small></sup>  Annas had not seen Jesus for several years, not since the time when the Master called at his house and immediately left upon observing his coldness and reserve in receiving him. Annas had thought to presume on this early acquaintance and thereby attempt to persuade Jesus to abandon his claims and leave <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a>. He was reluctant to participate in the murder of a good man and had reasoned that Jesus might choose to leave the country rather than to suffer death. But when Annas stood before the stalwart and determined Galilean, he knew at once that it would be useless to make such proposals. Jesus was even more majestic and well poised than Annas remembered him.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p1_3">184:1.3</a></small></sup>  When <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was young, <a href="/en/topic/Annas">Annas</a> had taken a great interest in him, but now his revenues were threatened by what Jesus had so recently done in driving the money-changers and other commercial traders out of the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>. This act had aroused the enmity of the former high priest far more than had Jesus’ teachings.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_3_5"><a href="#fn_a1_3_5">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p1_4">184:1.4</a></small></sup>  Annas entered his spacious audience chamber, seated himself in a large chair, and commanded that Jesus be brought before him. After a few moments spent in silently surveying the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, he said: “You realize that something must be done about your teaching since you are disturbing the peace and order of our country.” As Annas looked inquiringly at Jesus, the Master looked full into his eyes but made no reply. Again Annas spoke, “What are the names of your disciples, besides <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Zelotes">Simon Zelotes</a>, the agitator?” Again Jesus looked down upon him, but he did not answer.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p1_5">184:1.5</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Annas">Annas</a> was considerably disturbed by <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ refusal to answer his questions, so much so that he said to him: “Do you have no care as to whether I am friendly to you or not? Do you have no regard for the power I have in determining the issues of your coming trial?” When Jesus heard this, he said: “Annas, you know that you could have no power over me unless it were permitted by my Father. Some would destroy the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> because they are ignorant; they know no better, but you, friend, know what you are doing. How can you, therefore, reject the light of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>?”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_5_3"><a href="#fn_s1_5_3">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p1_6">184:1.6</a></small></sup>  The kindly manner in which Jesus spoke to Annas almost bewildered him. But he had already determined in his mind that Jesus must either leave <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a> or die; so he summoned up his courage and asked: “Just what is it you are trying to teach the people? What do you claim to be?” Jesus answered: “You know full well that I have spoken openly to the world. I have taught in the synagogues and many times in the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>, where all the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> and many of the gentiles have heard me. In secret I have spoken nothing; why, then, do you ask me about my teaching? Why do you not summon those who have heard me and inquire of them? Behold, all <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> has heard that which I have spoken even if you have not yourself heard these teachings.” But before Annas could make reply, the chief steward of the palace, who was standing near, struck Jesus in the face with his hand, saying, “How dare you answer the high priest with such words?” Annas spoke no words of rebuke to his steward, but Jesus addressed him, saying, “My friend, if I have spoken evil, bear witness against the evil; but if I have spoken the truth, why, then, should you smite me?”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p1_7">184:1.7</a></small></sup>  Although <a href="/en/topic/Annas">Annas</a> regretted that his steward had struck <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, he was too proud to take notice of the matter. In his confusion he went into another room, leaving Jesus alone with the household attendants and the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple_guards">temple guards</a> for almost an hour.</p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p1_8">184:1.8</a></small></sup>  When he returned, going up to the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s side, he said, “Do you claim to be the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Deliverer">deliverer</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a>?” Said Jesus: “Annas, you have known me from the times of my youth. You know that I claim to be nothing except that which my Father has appointed, and that I have been sent to all men, gentile as well as Jew.” Then said Annas: “I have been told that you have claimed to be the Messiah; is that true?” Jesus looked upon Annas but only replied, “So you have said.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p1_9">184:1.9</a></small></sup>  About this time <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> arrived from the palace of <a href="/en/topic/Caiaphas">Caiaphas</a> to inquire what time <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> would be brought before the court of the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a>, and since it was nearing the break of day, <a href="/en/topic/Annas">Annas</a> thought best to send Jesus bound and in the custody of the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple_guards">temple guards</a> to Caiaphas<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>.

<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. PETER IN THE COURTYARD </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p2_1">184:2.1</a></small></sup>  As the band of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple_guards">guards</a> and soldiers approached the entrance to the palace of <a href="/en/topic/Annas">Annas</a>, <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John Zebedee</a> was marching by the side of the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_centurion_of_Jerusalem">captain of the Roman</a> soldiers. <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas</a> had dropped some distance behind, and <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a> followed afar off. After <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John</a> had entered the palace courtyard with <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the guards, Judas came up to the gate but, seeing Jesus and John, went on over to the home of <a href="/en/topic/Caiaphas">Caiaphas</a>, where he knew the real trial of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> would later take place. Soon after Judas had left, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> arrived, and as he stood before the gate, John saw him just as they were about to take Jesus into the palace. The portress who kept the gate knew John, and when he spoke to her, requesting that she let Peter in, she gladly assented.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p2_2">184:2.2</a></small></sup>  Peter, upon entering the courtyard, went over to the charcoal <a href="/en/topic/fire">fire</a> and sought to warm himself, for the night was chilly<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>. He felt very much out of place here among the enemies of Jesus, and indeed he was out of place. The Master had not instructed him to keep near at hand as he had admonished John. Peter belonged with the other <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a>, who had been specifically warned not to endanger their lives during these times of the trial and crucifixion of their Master.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_2_20"><a href="#fn_a2_2_20">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p2_3">184:2.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> threw away his sword shortly before he came up to the palace gate so that he entered the courtyard of <a href="/en/topic/Annas">Annas</a> unarmed. His mind was in a whirl of confusion; he could scarcely realize that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had been arrested. He could not grasp the reality of the situation—that he was here in the courtyard of Annas, warming himself beside the servants of the high priest. He wondered what the other apostles were doing and, in turning over in his mind as to how <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a> came to be admitted to the palace, concluded that it was because he was known to the servants, since he had bidden the gate-keeper admit him.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p2_4">184:2.4</a></small></sup>  Shortly after the portress let Peter in, and while he was warming himself by the <a href="/en/topic/fire">fire</a>, she went over to him and mischievously said, “Are you not also one of this man’s disciples?” Now Peter should not have been surprised at this recognition, for it was John who had requested that the girl let him pass through the palace gates; but he was in such a tense nervous state that this identification as a disciple threw him off his balance, and with only one thought uppermost in his mind—the thought of escaping with his life—he promptly answered the maid’s question by saying, “I am not<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>.”</p>

<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p2_5">184:2.5</a></small></sup>  Very soon another servant came up to <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> and asked: “Did I not see you in the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a> when they arrested this fellow? Are you not also one of his followers?” <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Peter</a> was now thoroughly alarmed; he saw no way of safely escaping from these accusers; so he vehemently denied all connection with <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, saying, “I know not this man, neither am I one of his followers<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p2_6">184:2.6</a></small></sup>  About this time the portress of the gate drew Peter to one side and said: “I am sure you are a disciple of this Jesus, not only because one of his followers bade me let you in the courtyard, but my sister here has seen you in the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> with this man. Why do you deny this?” When Peter heard the maid accuse him, he denied all knowledge of Jesus with much <a href="/en/topic/cursing">cursing</a> and swearing, again saying, “I am not this man’s follower; I do not even know him; I never heard of him before<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p2_7">184:2.7</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> left the fireside for a time while he walked about the courtyard. He would have liked to have escaped, but he feared to attract attention to himself. Getting cold, he returned to the fireside, and one of the men standing near him said: “Surely you are one of this man’s disciples. This <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> is a Galilean, and your speech betrays you, for you also speak as a Galilean.” And again <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Peter</a> denied all connection with his <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p2_8">184:2.8</a></small></sup>  Peter was so perturbed that he sought to escape contact with his accusers by going away from the fire and remaining by himself on the porch. After more than an hour of this isolation, the gate-keeper and her sister chanced to meet him, and both of them again teasingly charged him with being a follower of Jesus. And again he denied the accusation. Just as he had once more denied all connection with Jesus, the cock crowed, and Peter remembered the words of warning spoken to him by his Master earlier that same night<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b9"><a href="#fn_b9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup>. As he stood there, heavy of heart and crushed with the sense of <a href="/en/topic/guilt">guilt</a>, the palace doors opened, and the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple_guards">guards</a> led Jesus past on the way to <a href="/en/topic/Caiaphas">Caiaphas</a>. As the Master passed Peter, he saw, by the light of the torches, the look of despair on the face of his former self-confident and superficially brave apostle, and he turned and looked upon Peter<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b11"><a href="#fn_b11">[11]</a></sup>.

For the time being, he had only considered that these servants had no moral or legal right thus to question him, and he really congratulated himself over the manner in which he thought he had avoided being identified and possibly subjected to arrest and imprisonment.

Jesus stood there, looking down benignly upon these perjurers, and his very countenance disconcerted the lying witnesses.

<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p3_7">184:3.7</a></small></sup>  The first time any two of their witnesses approached even the semblance of an agreement was when two men testified that they had heard <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> say in the course of one of his <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a> discourses that he would “destroy this <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> made with hands and in three days make another temple without hands<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b16"><a href="#fn_b16">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b17"><a href="#fn_b17">[17]</a></sup>.” That was not exactly what Jesus said, regardless of the fact that he pointed to his own body when he made the remark referred to.</p>

<p id="p3_17"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p3_17">184:3.17</a></small></sup>  Annas desired that the trial proceed further, and that charges of a definite nature regarding <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ relation to the Roman law and Roman institutions be formulated for subsequent presentation to Pilate. The councilors were anxious to carry these matters to a speedy termination, not only because it was the preparation day for the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> and no secular work should be done after noon, but also because they feared Pilate might any time return to the Roman capital of <a href="/en/topic/Judea">Judea</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Caesarea">Caesarea</a>, since he was in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> only for the Passover celebration.</p>

The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> well knew that, if he permitted his apostle to remain in the room to witness these indignities, John’s resentment would be so aroused as to produce such an outbreak of protesting indignation as would probably result in his death.</p>
