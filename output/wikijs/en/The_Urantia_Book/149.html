After due deliberation it was decided that <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James Zebedee</a> should administer the charge. At the conclusion of <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>’s remarks Jesus said to the evangelists: “Go now forth to do the work as you have been charged, and later on, when you have shown yourselves competent and faithful, I will ordain you to preach the gospel of the kingdom.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_2_9"><a href="#fn_a0_2_9">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p0_3">149:0.3</a></small></sup>  On this tour only James and John traveled with <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. Peter and the other apostles each took with them about one dozen of the evangelists and maintained close contact with them while they carried on their work of preaching and teaching. As fast as believers were ready to enter the kingdom, the apostles would administer <a href="/en/topic/baptism">baptism</a>. Jesus and his two companions traveled extensively during these three months, often visiting two cities in one day to observe the work of the evangelists and to encourage them in their efforts to establish the kingdom. This entire second preaching tour was principally an effort to afford practical experience for this corps of 117 newly trained evangelists.</p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p0_4">149:0.4</a></small></sup>  Throughout this period and subsequently, up to the time of the final departure of Jesus and the twelve for <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="/en/topic/David_Zebedee">David Zebedee</a> maintained a permanent headquarters for the work of the kingdom in his father’s house at <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a>. This was the clearinghouse for Jesus’ work on earth and the relay station for the messenger service which <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a> carried on between the workers in various parts of <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a> and adjacent regions. He did all of this on his own initiative but with the approval of <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a>. David employed forty to fifty <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> in this intelligence division of the rapidly enlarging and extending work of the kingdom. While thus employed, he partially supported himself by spending some of his time at his old work of fishing.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_4_3"><a href="#fn_s0_4_3">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p1_1">149:1.1</a></small></sup>  By the time the camp at <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a> had been broken up, the fame of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, particularly as a healer, had spread to all parts of <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a> and through all of <a href="/en/topic/Syria">Syria</a> and the surrounding countries. For weeks after they left Bethsaida, the sick continued to arrive, and when they did not find the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, on learning from <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a> where he was, they would go in search of him. On this tour Jesus did not deliberately perform any so-called miracles of healing. Nevertheless, scores of afflicted found restoration of health and happiness as a result of the reconstructive power of the intense <a href="/en/topic/faith">faith</a> which impelled them to seek for healing.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_1_31"><a href="#fn_a1_1_31">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p1_2">149:1.2</a></small></sup>  There began to appear about the time of this mission—and continued throughout the remainder of Jesus’ life on earth—a peculiar and unexplained series of healing phenomena<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. In the course of this three months’ tour more than one hundred men, women, and children from <a href="/en/topic/Judea">Judea</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Idumea">Idumea</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>, Syria, <a href="/en/topic/Tyre">Tyre</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Sidon">Sidon</a>, and from beyond the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> were beneficiaries of this unconscious healing by Jesus and, returning to their homes, added to the enlargement of Jesus’ fame. And they did this notwithstanding that Jesus would, every time he observed one of these cases of spontaneous healing, directly charge the beneficiary to “tell no man<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_14"><a href="#fn_a1_2_14">[3]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_2_10"><a href="#fn_s1_2_10">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p1_3">149:1.3</a></small></sup>  It was never revealed to us just what occurred in these cases of spontaneous or unconscious healing. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> never explained to his apostles how these healings were effected, other than that on several occasions he merely said, “I perceive that power has gone forth from me<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>.” On one occasion he remarked when touched by an ailing child, “I perceive that life has gone forth from me.”</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p1_4">149:1.4</a></small></sup>  In the absence of direct word from the Master regarding the nature of these cases of spontaneous healing, it would be presuming on our part to undertake to explain how they were accomplished, but it will be permissible to record our opinion of all such healing phenomena. We believe that many of these apparent miracles of healing, as they occurred in the course of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ earth ministry, were the result of the coexistence of the following three powerful, potent, and associated influences:</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p1_5">149:1.5</a></small></sup>  1. The presence of strong, dominant, and living faith in the heart of the human being who persistently sought healing, together with the fact that such healing was desired for its spiritual benefits rather than for purely physical restoration.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p1_6">149:1.6</a></small></sup>  2. The existence, concomitant with such human faith, of the great sympathy and compassion of the incarnated and mercy-dominated <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, who actually possessed in his person almost unlimited and timeless creative healing powers and prerogatives.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p1_7">149:1.7</a></small></sup>  3. Along with the faith of the creature and the life of the Creator it should also be noted that this God-man was the personified expression of the Father’s will. If, in the contact of the human need and the divine power to meet it, the Father did not will otherwise, the two became one, and the healing occurred unconsciously to the human <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> but was immediately recognized by his divine nature. The explanation, then, of many of these cases of healing must be found in a great law which has long been known to us, namely, What the Creator Son desires and the eternal Father wills IS.</p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p1_8">149:1.8</a></small></sup>  It is, then, our opinion that, in the personal presence of Jesus, certain forms of profound human <a href="/en/topic/faith">faith</a> were literally and truly <i>compelling</i> in the manifestation of healing by certain creative forces and personalities of the universe who were at that time so intimately associated with the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>. It therefore becomes a fact of record that Jesus did frequently suffer men to heal themselves in his presence by their powerful, personal faith.</p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p1_9">149:1.9</a></small></sup>  Many others sought healing for wholly selfish purposes. A <a href="/en/topic/rich_widow_of_Tyre">rich widow of Tyre</a>, with her retinue, came seeking to be healed of her infirmities, which were many; and as she followed <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> about through <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>, she continued to offer more and more money, as if the power of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> were something to be purchased by the highest bidder. But never would she become interested in the gospel of the kingdom; it was only the cure of her physical ailments that she sought.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_9_14"><a href="#fn_a1_9_14">[3]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_9_1"><a href="#fn_s1_9_1">[3]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. ATTITUDE OF THE PEOPLE </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p2_1">149:2.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> understood the minds of men. He knew what was in the heart of man, and had his teachings been left as he presented them, the only commentary being the inspired interpretation afforded by his earth life, all nations and all religions of the world would speedily have embraced the <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> of the kingdom. The well-meant efforts of Jesus’ early followers to restate his teachings so as to make them the more acceptable to certain nations, races, and religions, only resulted in making such teachings the less acceptable to all other nations, races, and religions.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_0"><a href="#fn_s2_1_0">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p2_2">149:2.2</a></small></sup>  The Apostle <a href="/en/topic/Paul">Paul</a>, in his efforts to bring the teachings of Jesus to the favorable notice of certain groups in his day, wrote many letters of instruction and admonition. Other teachers of Jesus’ gospel did likewise, but none of them realized that some of these writings would subsequently be brought together by those who would set them forth as the embodiment of the teachings of Jesus. And so, while so-called <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a> does contain more of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s gospel than any other religion, it does also contain much that Jesus did not teach. Aside from the incorporation of many teachings from the Persian mysteries and much of the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> philosophy into <a href="/en/topic/Christian_church,_early">early Christianity</a>, two great mistakes were made:</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p2_3">149:2.3</a></small></sup>  1. The effort to connect the gospel teaching directly onto the Jewish theology, as illustrated by the Christian doctrines of the atonement—the teaching that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was the sacrificed Son who would satisfy the Father’s stern justice and appease the divine wrath. These teachings originated in a praiseworthy effort to make the gospel of the kingdom more acceptable to disbelieving <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>. Though these efforts failed as far as winning the <a href="/en/topic/Jews_(ancient_Hebrews)">Jews</a> was concerned, they did not fail to confuse and alienate many honest souls in all subsequent generations.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_3_2"><a href="#fn_s2_3_2">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_3_12"><a href="#fn_s2_3_12">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p2_4">149:2.4</a></small></sup>  2. The second great blunder of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s early followers, and one which all subsequent generations have persisted in perpetuating, was to organize the Christian teaching so completely about the <i>person</i> of Jesus. This overemphasis of the personality of Jesus in the theology of <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a> has worked to obscure his teachings, and all of this has made it increasingly difficult for Jews, Mohammedans, <a href="/en/topic/Hindus">Hindus</a>, and other Eastern religionists to accept the teachings of Jesus. We would not belittle the place of the person of Jesus in a religion which might bear his name, but we would not permit such consideration to eclipse his inspired life or to supplant his saving message: the fatherhood of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and the brotherhood of man.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_4_8"><a href="#fn_a2_4_8">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_4_19"><a href="#fn_a2_4_19">[6]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_4_0"><a href="#fn_s2_4_0">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_4_2"><a href="#fn_s2_4_2">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p2_5">149:2.5</a></small></sup>  The teachers of the <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> should approach other religions with the recognition of the truths which are held in common (many of which come directly or indirectly from Jesus’ message) while they refrain from placing so much emphasis on the differences.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_5_19"><a href="#fn_a2_5_19">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_5_7"><a href="#fn_a2_5_7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_5_28"><a href="#fn_a2_5_28">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p2_6">149:2.6</a></small></sup>  While, at that particular time, the fame of Jesus rested chiefly upon his reputation as a healer, it does not follow that it continued so to rest. As time passed, more and more he was sought for spiritual help. But it was the physical cures that made the most direct and immediate appeal to the common people. Jesus was increasingly sought by the victims of moral enslavement and mental harassments, and he invariably taught them the way of deliverance. Fathers sought his advice regarding the management of their sons, and mothers came for help in the guidance of their daughters. Those who sat in darkness came to him, and he revealed to them the light of life<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>. His ear was ever open to the sorrows of mankind, and he always helped those who sought his ministry.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_6_29"><a href="#fn_a2_6_29">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_6_34"><a href="#fn_a2_6_34">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p2_7">149:2.7</a></small></sup>  When the Creator himself was on earth, incarnated in the likeness of mortal flesh, it was inevitable that some extraordinary things should happen. But you should never approach <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> through these so-called miraculous occurrences. Learn to approach the miracle through Jesus, but do not make the mistake of approaching Jesus through the miracle. And this admonition is warranted, notwithstanding that Jesus of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> is the only founder of a <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> who performed supermaterial acts on earth.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_7_31"><a href="#fn_a2_7_31">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p2_8">149:2.8</a></small></sup>  The most astonishing and the most revolutionary feature of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a>’s mission on earth was his attitude toward <a href="/en/topic/women">women</a>. In a day and generation when a man was not supposed to salute even his own wife in a public place, Jesus dared to take women along as teachers of the gospel in connection with his third tour of <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>. And he had the consummate courage to do this in the face of the rabbinic teaching which declared that it was “better that the words of the law should be burned than delivered to women.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_8_15"><a href="#fn_s2_8_15">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p2_9">149:2.9</a></small></sup>  In one generation <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> lifted women out of the disrespectful oblivion and the slavish drudgery of the ages. And it is the one shameful thing about the religion that presumed to take Jesus’ name that it lacked the moral courage to follow this noble example in its subsequent attitude toward women.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_9_17"><a href="#fn_a2_9_17">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_9_16"><a href="#fn_a2_9_16">[12]</a></sup></p>

While he complied with the good in the religion of his fathers, he did not hesitate to disregard man-made <a href="/en/topic/traditions">traditions</a> of <a href="/en/topic/superstition">superstition</a> and bondage. He dared to teach that catastrophes of nature, <a href="/en/topic/accidents">accidents</a> of time, and other calamitous happenings are not visitations of divine judgments or mysterious dispensations of Providence<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>.

He put reality in the place of tradition and swept aside all pretensions of vanity and hypocrisy. And yet this fearless man of God did not give vent to destructive criticism or manifest an utter disregard of the religious, social, economic, and political usages of his day. He was not a militant revolutionist; he was a progressive evolutionist. He engaged in the destruction of that which <i>was</i> only when he simultaneously offered his fellows the superior thing which <i>ought to be.</i><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_11_9"><a href="#fn_a2_11_9">[1]</a></sup></p>
