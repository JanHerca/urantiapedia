<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p0_1">99:0.1</a></small></sup>  RELIGION achieves its highest social ministry when it has least connection with the secular institutions of society. In past ages, since social reforms were largely confined to the moral realms, <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> did not have to adjust its attitude to extensive changes in economic and political systems. The chief problem of religion was the endeavor to replace evil with good within the existing social order of political and economic culture. Religion has thus indirectly tended to perpetuate the established order of society, to foster the maintenance of the existent type of civilization.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p0_2">99:0.2</a></small></sup>  But religion should not be directly concerned either with the creation of new social orders or with the preservation of old ones. True religion does oppose <a href="/en/topic/violence">violence</a> as a technique of social evolution, but it does not oppose the intelligent efforts of society to adapt its usages and adjust its institutions to new economic conditions and cultural requirements.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1"><a href="#fn_a1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2"><a href="#fn_a2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p0_3">99:0.3</a></small></sup>  Religion did approve the occasional social reforms of past centuries, but in the twentieth century it is of necessity called upon to face adjustment to extensive and continuing social reconstruction. Conditions of living alter so rapidly that institutional modifications must be greatly accelerated, and <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> must accordingly quicken its adaptation to this new and ever-changing social order.</p>

The social ship has steamed out of the sheltered bays of established tradition and has begun its cruise upon the high seas of evolutionary destiny; and the soul of man, as never before in the world’s history, needs carefully to scrutinize its charts of morality and painstakingly to observe the compass of religious guidance. The paramount mission of <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> as a social influence is to stabilize the ideals of mankind during these dangerous times of <a href="/en/topic/transition">transition</a> from one phase of <a href="/en/topic/civilization">civilization</a> to another, from one level of culture to another.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a17"><a href="#fn_a17">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a18"><a href="#fn_a18">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a19"><a href="#fn_a19">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a20"><a href="#fn_a20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a21"><a href="#fn_a21">[21]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a22"><a href="#fn_a22">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a23"><a href="#fn_a23">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p1_4">99:1.4</a></small></sup>  Religion has no new duties to perform, but it is urgently called upon to function as a wise guide and experienced counselor in all of these new and rapidly changing human situations. Society is becoming more mechanical, more compact, more complex, and more critically interdependent. Religion must function to prevent these new and intimate interassociations from becoming mutually retrogressive or even destructive. Religion must act as the cosmic salt which prevents the ferments of progression from destroying the cultural savor of civilization. These new social relations and economic upheavals can result in lasting brotherhood only by the ministry of religion.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a24"><a href="#fn_a24">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p1_5">99:1.5</a></small></sup>  A godless humanitarianism is, humanly speaking, a noble gesture, but true <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> is the only power which can lastingly increase the responsiveness of one social group to the needs and sufferings of other groups. In the past, institutional religion could remain passive while the upper strata of society turned a deaf ear to the sufferings and oppression of the helpless lower strata, but in modern times these lower social orders are no longer so abjectly ignorant nor so politically helpless.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a25"><a href="#fn_a25">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p1_6">99:1.6</a></small></sup>  Religion must not become organically involved in the secular work of social reconstruction and economic reorganization. But it must actively keep pace with all these advances in civilization by making clear-cut and vigorous restatements of its moral mandates and spiritual precepts, its progressive philosophy of human living and transcendent survival. The spirit of religion is eternal, but the form of its expression must be restated every time the dictionary of human <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a> is revised.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a26"><a href="#fn_a26">[26]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a27"><a href="#fn_a27">[27]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a28"><a href="#fn_a28">[28]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a29"><a href="#fn_a29">[29]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a30"><a href="#fn_a30">[30]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a31"><a href="#fn_a31">[31]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p2_1">99:2.1</a></small></sup>  Institutional <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> cannot afford inspiration and provide leadership in this impending world-wide social reconstruction and economic reorganization because it has unfortunately become more or less of an organic part of the social order and the economic system which is destined to undergo reconstruction.

<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p2_2">99:2.2</a></small></sup>  Institutional religion is now caught in the stalemate of a vicious circle. It cannot reconstruct society without first reconstructing itself; and being so much an integral part of the established order, it cannot reconstruct itself until society has been radically reconstructed.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p2_3">99:2.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/religionists">Religionists</a> must function in society, in industry, and in politics as individuals, not as groups, parties, or institutions.

<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p2_5">99:2.5</a></small></sup>  The institutionalized church may have appeared to serve society in the past by glorifying the established political and economic orders, but it must speedily cease such action if it is to survive. Its only proper attitude consists in the teaching of nonviolence, the doctrine of peaceful <a href="/en/topic/evolution">evolution</a> in the place of violent <a href="/en/topic/revolution_(motion)">revolution</a>—peace on earth and good will among all men.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a42"><a href="#fn_a42">[42]</a></sup></p>

The religion of living experience finds no difficulty in keeping ahead of all these social developments and economic upheavals, amid which it ever functions as a moral stabilizer, social guide, and spiritual pilot.

<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p3_1">99:3.1</a></small></sup>  Early <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a> was entirely free from all civil entanglements, social commitments, and economic alliances. Only did later institutionalized Christianity become an organic part of the political and social structure of Occidental civilization.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p3_2">99:3.2</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/kingdom_of_heaven">kingdom of heaven</a> is neither a social nor economic order; it is an exclusively spiritual brotherhood of God-knowing individuals.

<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p3_3">99:3.3</a></small></sup>  The religionist is not unsympathetic with social suffering, not unmindful of civil injustice, not insulated from economic thinking, neither insensible to political tyranny. Religion influences social reconstruction directly because it spiritualizes and idealizes the individual citizen. Indirectly, cultural civilization is influenced by the attitude of these individual religionists as they become active and influential members of various social, moral, economic, and political groups.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p3_4">99:3.4</a></small></sup>  The attainment of a high cultural <a href="/en/topic/civilization">civilization</a> demands, first, the ideal type of citizen and, then, ideal and adequate social mechanisms wherewith such a citizenry may control the economic and political institutions of such an advanced human society.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a45"><a href="#fn_a45">[45]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p3_5">99:3.5</a></small></sup>  The church, because of overmuch false <a href="/en/topic/sentiment">sentiment</a>, has long ministered to the underprivileged and the unfortunate, and this has all been well, but this same sentiment has led to the unwise perpetuation of racially degenerate stocks which have tremendously retarded the progress of civilization.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a46"><a href="#fn_a46">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p3_6">99:3.6</a></small></sup>  Many individual social reconstructionists, while vehemently repudiating institutionalized <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a>, are, after all, zealously religious in the propagation of their social reforms. And so it is that religious motivation, personal and more or less unrecognized, is playing a great part in the present-day program of social reconstruction.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a47"><a href="#fn_a47">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p3_7">99:3.7</a></small></sup>  The great weakness of all this unrecognized and unconscious type of religious activity is that it is unable to profit from open religious <a href="/en/topic/criticism">criticism</a> and thereby attain to profitable levels of self-correction. It is a fact that religion does not grow unless it is disciplined by constructive criticism, amplified by philosophy, purified by <a href="/en/topic/science">science</a>, and nourished by loyal fellowship.</p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p3_8">99:3.8</a></small></sup>  There is always the great danger that <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> will become distorted and perverted into the pursuit of false goals, as when in times of <a href="/en/topic/war">war</a> each contending nation prostitutes its religion into military propaganda. Loveless zeal is always harmful to religion, while <a href="/en/topic/persecution">persecution</a> diverts the activities of religion into the achievement of some sociologic or theologic drive.</p>

<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p4_1">99:4.1</a></small></sup>  Genuine <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> renders the religionist socially fragrant and creates insights into human fellowship. But the formalization of religious groups many times destroys the very values for the promotion of which the group was organized. Human friendship and divine religion are mutually helpful and significantly illuminating if the growth in each is equalized and harmonized. Religion puts new meaning into all group associations—families, schools, and clubs. It imparts new values to play and exalts all true <a href="/en/topic/humor">humor</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p4_2">99:4.2</a></small></sup>  Social leadership is transformed by <a href="/en/topic/spiritual_insight">spiritual insight</a>; religion prevents all collective movements from losing sight of their true objectives. Together with <a href="/en/topic/children">children</a>, religion is the great unifier of <a href="/en/topic/family">family</a> life, provided it is a living and growing faith. Family life cannot be had without children; it can be lived without religion, but such a handicap enormously multiplies the difficulties of this intimate human association. During the early decades of the twentieth century, family life, next to personal religious experience, suffers most from the decadence consequent upon the <a href="/en/topic/transition">transition</a> from old religious loyalties to the emerging new meanings and values.</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p4_3">99:4.3</a></small></sup>  True <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> is a meaningful way of living dynamically face to face with the commonplace realities of everyday life. But if religion is to stimulate individual development of character and augment integration of personality, it must not be standardized. If it is to stimulate evaluation of experience and serve as a value-lure, it must not be stereotyped. If religion is to promote supreme loyalties, it must not be formalized.</p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p4_4">99:4.4</a></small></sup>  No matter what upheavals may attend the social and economic growth of civilization, religion is genuine and worth while if it fosters in the individual an experience in which the sovereignty of truth, beauty, and goodness prevails, for such is the true spiritual concept of supreme <a href="/en/topic/reality">reality</a>. And through love and worship this becomes meaningful as fellowship with man and sonship with <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p4_5">99:4.5</a></small></sup>  After all, it is what one believes rather than what one knows that determines conduct and dominates personal <a href="/en/topic/action">performances</a>.

<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p5_1">99:5.1</a></small></sup>  While <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> is exclusively a personal spiritual experience—knowing <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> as a Father—the corollary of this experience—knowing man as a brother—entails the adjustment of the self to other selves, and that involves the social or group aspect of religious life. Religion is first an inner or personal adjustment, and then it becomes a matter of social service or group adjustment. The fact of man’s gregariousness perforce determines that religious groups will come into existence. What happens to these religious groups depends very much on intelligent <a href="/en/topic/leadership">leadership</a>. In primitive society the religious group is not always very different from economic or political groups. Religion has always been a conservator of morals and a stabilizer of society. And this is still true, notwithstanding the contrary teaching of many modern socialists and humanists.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a53"><a href="#fn_a53">[53]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a54"><a href="#fn_a54">[54]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a55"><a href="#fn_a55">[55]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p5_2">99:5.2</a></small></sup>  Always keep in mind: True religion is to know God as your Father and man as your brother. Religion is not a slavish belief in threats of punishment or magical promises of future mystical rewards.</p>

Future <a href="/en/topic/religionists">religionists</a> must live out their religion, dedicate themselves to the wholehearted service of the brotherhood of man.
