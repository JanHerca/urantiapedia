<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p0_2">172:0.2</a></small></sup>  That evening, Jesus received many visitors, and the common folks of Bethany and <a href="/en/topic/Bethphage">Bethpage</a> did their best to make him feel welcome.

Jesus knew about all this, but he was majestically calm; his friends had never seen him more composed and congenial; even the apostles were astounded that he should be so unconcerned when the Sanhedrin had called upon all Jewry to deliver him into their hands. While the Master slept that night, the apostles watched over him by twos, and many of them were girded with <a href="/en/topic/swords">swords</a>.

To you who murmur and say that this ointment should have been sold and the money given to the <a href="/en/topic/poor">poor</a>, let me say that you have the poor always with you so that you may minister to them at any time it seems good to you; but I shall not always be with you; I go soon to my Father. This woman has long saved this ointment for my body at its burial, and now that it has seemed good to her to make this anointing in anticipation of my death, she shall not be denied such satisfaction. In the doing of this, Mary has reproved all of you in that by this act she evinces faith in what I have said about my death and ascension to my Father in heaven. This woman shall not be reproved for that which she has this night done; rather do I say to you that in the ages to come, wherever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, what she has done will be spoken of in memory of her.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_6_3"><a href="#fn_a1_6_3">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_6_5"><a href="#fn_a1_6_5">[3]</a></sup></p>

Many times had he entertained such ideas subconsciously, but now he dared to think such wicked thoughts in his open and conscious mind.

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p2_1">172:2.1</a></small></sup>  On this <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a> morning, in <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a>’s beautiful <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> called his twelve apostles around him and gave them their final instructions preparatory to entering <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. He told them that he would probably deliver many addresses and teach many lessons before returning to the Father but advised the apostles to refrain from doing any public work during this <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> sojourn in Jerusalem. He instructed them to remain near him and to “watch and pray.” <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> knew that many of his apostles and immediate followers even then carried <a href="/en/topic/swords">swords</a> concealed on their persons, but he made no reference to this fact.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p2_2">172:2.2</a></small></sup>  This morning’s instructions embraced a brief review of their ministry from the day of their ordination near <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> down to this day when they were preparing to enter Jerusalem. The apostles listened in silence; they asked no questions.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p2_3">172:2.3</a></small></sup>  Early that morning <a href="/en/topic/David_Zebedee">David Zebedee</a> had turned over to Judas the funds realized from the sale of the equipment of the <a href="/en/topic/Pella">Pella</a> encampment, and Judas, in turn, had placed the greater part of this money in the hands of <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a>, their host, for safekeeping in anticipation of the exigencies of their entry into <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p2_4">172:2.4</a></small></sup>  After the conference with the apostles <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> held converse with <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a> and instructed him to avoid the sacrifice of his life to the vengefulness of the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a>. It was in obedience to this admonition that <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Nazarite_parable)">Lazarus</a>, a few days later, fled to <a href="/en/topic/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> when the officers of the Sanhedrin sent men to arrest him.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p2_5">172:2.5</a></small></sup>  In a way, all of Jesus’ followers sensed the impending crisis, but they were prevented from fully realizing its seriousness by the unusual cheerfulness and exceptional good humor of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>.</p>

<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p3_1">172:3.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a> was about two miles from the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>, and it was half past one that <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a> afternoon when <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> made ready to start for <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. He had feelings of profound affection for Bethany and its simple people. <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, and Jerusalem had rejected him, but Bethany had accepted him, had believed in him. And it was in this small village, where almost every man, woman, and child were believers, that he chose to perform the mightiest work of his earth bestowal, the resurrection of <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a>. He did not raise <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Nazarite_parable)">Lazarus</a> that the villagers might believe, but rather because they already believed.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p3_2">172:3.2</a></small></sup>  All morning Jesus had thought about his entry into Jerusalem. Heretofore he had always endeavored to suppress all public acclaim of him as the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a>, but it was different now; he was nearing the end of his career in the flesh, his death had been decreed by the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a>, and no harm could come from allowing his disciples to give free expression to their feelings, just as might occur if he elected to make a formal and public entry into the city.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p3_3">172:3.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> did not decide to make this public entrance into <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> as a last bid for popular favor nor as a final grasp for power. Neither did he do it altogether to satisfy the human longings of his disciples and apostles. Jesus entertained none of the illusions of a fantastic dreamer; he well knew what was to be the outcome of this visit.</p>

<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p3_4">172:3.4</a></small></sup>  Having decided upon making a public entrance into Jerusalem, the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> was confronted with the necessity of choosing a proper method of executing such a resolve. Jesus thought over all of the many more or less contradictory so-called Messianic prophecies, but there seemed to be only one which was at all appropriate for him to follow<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup>. Most of these prophetic utterances depicted a king, the son and successor of <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a>, a bold and aggressive temporal <a href="/en/topic/Deliverer">deliverer</a> of all <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a> from the yoke of foreign domination. But there was one Scripture that had sometimes been associated with the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a> by those who held more to the spiritual concept of his mission, which Jesus thought might consistently be taken as a guide for his projected entry into Jerusalem. This Scripture was found in <a href="/en/topic/Zechariah">Zechariah</a>, and it said: “Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem. Behold, your king comes to you. He is just and he brings salvation. He comes as the lowly one, riding upon an <a href="/en/topic/donkeys">ass</a>, upon a colt, the foal of an ass<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b11"><a href="#fn_b11">[11]</a></sup>.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_4_8"><a href="#fn_a3_4_8">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p3_5">172:3.5</a></small></sup>  A warrior king always entered a city riding upon a horse; a king on a mission of peace and friendship always entered riding upon an ass. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> would not enter <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> as a man on horseback, but he was willing to enter peacefully and with good will as the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> on a donkey.</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p3_6">172:3.6</a></small></sup>  Jesus had long tried by direct teaching to impress upon his apostles and his disciples that his kingdom was not of this world, that it was a purely spiritual matter; but he had not succeeded in this effort. Now, what he had failed to do by plain and personal teaching, he would attempt to accomplish by a symbolic appeal. Accordingly, right after the noon lunch, Jesus called <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> and John, and after directing them to go over to <a href="/en/topic/Bethphage">Bethpage</a>, a neighboring village a little off the main road and a short distance northwest of <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a>, he further said: “Go to Bethpage, and when you come to the junction of the roads, you will find the colt of an ass tied there. Loose the colt and bring it back with you. If anyone asks you why you do this, merely say, ‘The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> has need of him.’” And when the two apostles had gone into Bethpage as the Master had directed, they found the colt tied near his mother in the open street and close to a house on the corner. As <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Peter</a> began to untie the colt, the owner came over and asked why they did this, and when Peter answered him as Jesus had directed, the man said: “If your Master is Jesus from <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>, let him have the colt<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b12"><a href="#fn_b12">[12]</a></sup>.” And so they returned bringing the colt with them.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b13"><a href="#fn_b13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p3_7">172:3.7</a></small></sup>  By this time several hundred pilgrims had gathered around <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and his apostles. Since midforenoon the visitors passing by on their way to the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> had tarried.

He was the one apostle who did not seriously undertake to evaluate the popular outburst of acclaim. He was too preoccupied with the thought of his responsibility as chief of the apostolic corps to give serious consideration to the meaning or significance of the loud hosannas of the multitude. Andrew was busy watching some of his associates who he feared might be led away by their emotions during the excitement, particularly <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>, John, and <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Zelotes">Simon Zelotes</a>. Throughout this day and those which immediately followed, Andrew was troubled with serious doubts, but he never expressed any of these misgivings to his apostolic associates. He was concerned about the attitude of some of the twelve who he knew were armed with <a href="/en/topic/swords">swords</a>; but he did not know that his own brother, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Peter</a>, was carrying such a weapon. And so the procession into <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> made a comparatively superficial impression upon Andrew; he was too busy with the responsibilities of his office to be otherwise affected.</p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p5_3">172:5.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> Peter was at first almost swept off his feet by this popular manifestation of enthusiasm; but he was considerably sobered by the time they returned to <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a> that night. Peter simply could not figure out what the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> was about. He was terribly disappointed that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> did not follow up this wave of popular favor with some kind of a pronouncement. Peter could not understand why Jesus did not speak to the multitude when they arrived at the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>, or at least permit one of the apostles to address the crowd. Peter was a great preacher, and he disliked to see such a large, receptive, and enthusiastic audience go to waste. He would so much have liked to preach the gospel of the kingdom to that throng right there in the temple; but the Master had specifically charged them that they were to do no teaching or preaching while in Jerusalem this <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> week. The reaction from the spectacular procession into the city was disastrous to <a href="/en/topic/Simon_of_Cyrene">Simon</a> Peter; by night he was sobered and inexpressibly saddened.</p>

As the procession moved down <a href="/en/topic/Olivet">Olivet</a> toward <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, more especially when they were met by the thousands of pilgrims who poured forth to welcome the Master, <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> was cruelly torn by his conflicting emotions of elation and gratification at what he saw and by his profound feeling of fear as to what would happen when they reached the temple. And then was he downcast and overcome by disappointment when Jesus climbed off the donkey and proceeded to walk leisurely about the temple courts. James could not understand the reason for throwing away such a magnificent opportunity to proclaim the kingdom. By night, his mind was held firmly in the grip of a distressing and dreadful uncertainty.</p>

As the multitude moved on toward the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>, and as John beheld his <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> sitting there astride the colt, he recalled hearing Jesus onetime quote the passage of Scripture, the utterance of <a href="/en/topic/Zechariah">Zechariah</a>, which described the coming of the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a> as a man of peace and riding into Jerusalem on an <a href="/en/topic/donkeys">ass</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b25"><a href="#fn_b25">[25]</a></sup>.

At least, he grasped enough of the meaning of this Scripture to enable him somewhat to enjoy the episode and to prevent his becoming overmuch depressed by the apparent purposeless ending of the triumphal procession. John had a type of mind which naturally tended to think and feel in symbols.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_5_4"><a href="#fn_a5_5_4">[7]</a></sup></p>

He could not collect his thoughts sufficiently while on the way down <a href="/en/topic/Olivet">Olivet</a> to arrive at any settled notion as to what all the demonstration was about. In a way, he enjoyed the performance because his Master was being honored. By the time they reached the temple, he was perturbed by the thought that Jesus might possibly ask him to feed the multitude, so that the conduct of Jesus in turning leisurely away from the crowds, which so sorely disappointed the majority of the apostles, was a great relief to <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Tetrarch)">Philip</a>. Multitudes had sometimes been a great trial to the steward of the twelve. After he was relieved of these personal fears regarding the material needs of the crowds, Philip joined with <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> in the expression of disappointment that nothing was done to teach the multitude. That night Philip got to thinking over these experiences and was tempted to doubt the whole idea of the kingdom; he honestly wondered what all these things could mean, but he expressed his doubts to no one; he loved Jesus too much. He had great personal faith in the Master.</p>
<p id="p5_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p5_7">172:5.7</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a>, aside from the symbolic and prophetic aspects, came the nearest to understanding the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s reason for enlisting the popular support of the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> pilgrims. He reasoned it out, before they reached the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>, that without such a demonstrative entry into <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> would have been arrested by the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> officials and cast into prison the moment he presumed to enter the city. He was not, therefore, in the least surprised that the Master made no further use of the cheering crowds when he had once got inside the walls of the city and had thus so forcibly impressed the Jewish leaders that they would refrain from placing him under immediate arrest. Understanding the real reason for the Master’s entering the city in this manner, <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_the_Pharisee">Nathaniel</a> naturally followed along with more poise and was less perturbed and disappointed by Jesus’ subsequent conduct than were the other apostles. Nathaniel had great confidence in Jesus’ understanding of men as well as in his sagacity and cleverness in handling difficult situations.</p>
<p id="p5_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p5_8">172:5.8</a></small></sup>  Matthew was at first nonplused by this pageant performance. He did not grasp the meaning of what his eyes were seeing until he also recalled the Scripture in <a href="/en/topic/Zechariah">Zechariah</a> where the prophet had alluded to the rejoicing of Jerusalem because her king had come bringing salvation and riding upon the colt of an <a href="/en/topic/donkeys">ass</a>. As the procession moved in the direction of the city and then drew on toward the temple, Matthew became ecstatic; he was certain that something extraordinary would happen when the Master arrived at the temple at the head of this shouting multitude. When one of the <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> mocked Jesus, saying, “Look, everybody, see who comes here, the king of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> riding on an ass!” Matthew kept his hands off of him only by exercising great restraint. None of the twelve was more depressed on the way back to <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a> that evening. Next to <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Zelotes">Simon Zelotes</a>, he experienced the highest nervous tension and was in a state of exhaustion by night. But by morning Matthew was much cheered; he was, after all, a cheerful loser.</p>
<p id="p5_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p5_9">172:5.9</a></small></sup>  Thomas was the most bewildered and puzzled man of all the twelve. Most of the time he just followed along, gazing at the spectacle and honestly wondering what could be the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s motive for participating in such a peculiar demonstration. Down deep in his heart he regarded the whole performance as a little childish, if not downright foolish. He had never seen <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> do anything like this and was at a loss to account for his strange conduct on this <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a> afternoon. By the time they reached the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>, Thomas had deduced that the purpose of this popular demonstration was so to frighten the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> that they would not dare immediately to arrest the Master. On the way back to Bethany Thomas thought much but said nothing. By bedtime the Master’s cleverness in staging the tumultuous entry into <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> had begun to make a somewhat humorous appeal, and he was much cheered up by this reaction.</p>
<p id="p5_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p5_10">172:5.10</a></small></sup>  This Sunday started off as a great day for <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Zelotes">Simon Zelotes</a>. He saw visions of wonderful doings in Jerusalem the next few days, and in that he was right, but <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> dreamed of the establishment of the new national rule of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>, with Jesus on the throne of <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a>. <a href="/en/topic/Simon_of_Cyrene">Simon</a> saw the nationalists springing into action as soon as the kingdom was announced, and himself in supreme command of the assembling military forces of the new kingdom. On the way down <a href="/en/topic/Olivet">Olivet</a> he even envisaged the Sanhedrin and all of their sympathizers dead before sunset of that day. He really believed something great was going to happen. He was the noisiest man in the whole multitude. By five o’clock that afternoon he was a silent, crushed, and disillusioned apostle. He never fully recovered from the depression which settled down on him as a result of this day’s shock; at least not until long after the Master’s resurrection.</p>
<p id="p5_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p5_11">172:5.11</a></small></sup>  To the <a href="/en/topic/Alpheus_twins">Alpheus twins</a> this was a perfect day. They really enjoyed it all the way through, and not being present during the time of quiet visitation about the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>, they escaped much of the anticlimax of the popular upheaval. They could not possibly understand the downcast behavior of the apostles when they came back to <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a> that evening. In the memory of the twins this was always their day of being nearest heaven on earth. This day was the satisfying climax of their whole career as apostles. And the memory of the elation of this <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a> afternoon carried them on through all of the tragedy of this eventful week, right up to the hour of the crucifixion. It was the most befitting entry of the king the twins could conceive; they enjoyed every moment of the whole pageant. They fully approved of all they saw and long cherished the memory.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_11_1"><a href="#fn_a5_11_1">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p5_12">172:5.12</a></small></sup>  Of all the apostles, <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a> was the most adversely affected by this processional entry into <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. His mind was in a disagreeable ferment because of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s rebuke the preceding day in connection with <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a>’s anointing at the feast in <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a>’s house. Judas was disgusted with the whole spectacle. To him it seemed childish, if not indeed ridiculous. As this vengeful apostle looked upon the proceedings of this Sunday afternoon, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> seemed to him more to resemble a clown than a king. He heartily resented the whole performance. He shared the views of the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a>, who looked down upon anyone who would consent to ride upon an <a href="/en/topic/donkeys">ass</a> or the colt of an ass. By the time the triumphal procession had entered the city, Judas had about made up his mind to abandon the whole idea of such a kingdom; he was almost resolved to forsake all such farcical attempts to establish the kingdom of heaven. And then he thought of the resurrection of <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a>, and many other things, and decided to stay on with the twelve, at least for another day. Besides, he carried the bag, and he would not desert with the apostolic funds in his possession. On the way back to Bethany that night his conduct did not seem strange since all of the apostles were equally downcast and silent.</p>
<p id="p5_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p5_13">172:5.13</a></small></sup>  Judas was tremendously influenced by the <a href="/en/topic/ridicule">ridicule</a> of his Sadducean friends. No other single factor exerted such a powerful influence on him, in his final determination to forsake Jesus and his fellow apostles, as a certain episode which occurred just as Jesus reached the gate of the city: A prominent Sadducee (a friend of Judas’s family) rushed up to him in a spirit of gleeful ridicule and, slapping him on the back, said: “Why so troubled of countenance, my good friend; cheer up and join us all while we acclaim this Jesus of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> the king of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> as he rides through the gates of Jerusalem seated on an ass.” Judas had never shrunk from persecution, but he could not stand this sort of ridicule. With the long-nourished emotion of revenge there was now blended this fatal fear of ridicule, that terrible and fearful feeling of being ashamed of his Master and his fellow apostles. At heart, this ordained ambassador of the kingdom was already a deserter; it only remained for him to find some plausible excuse for an open break with the Master.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_13_2"><a href="#fn_a5_13_2">[9]</a></sup></p>
