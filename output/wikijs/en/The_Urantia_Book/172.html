Peter was a great preacher, and he disliked to see such a large, receptive, and enthusiastic audience go to waste. He would so much have liked to preach the gospel of the kingdom to that throng right there in the temple; but the Master had specifically charged them that they were to do no teaching or preaching while in Jerusalem this <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> week.

<p id="p5_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p5_6">172:5.6</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a> was entirely unsettled by the suddenness and spontaneity of the outburst. He could not collect his thoughts sufficiently while on the way down <a href="/en/topic/Olivet">Olivet</a> to arrive at any settled notion as to what all the demonstration was about. In a way, he enjoyed the performance because his Master was being honored. By the time they reached the temple, he was perturbed by the thought that Jesus might possibly ask him to feed the multitude, so that the conduct of Jesus in turning leisurely away from the crowds, which so sorely disappointed the majority of the <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a>, was a great relief to <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Tetrarch)">Philip</a>. Multitudes had sometimes been a great trial to the steward of the twelve. After he was relieved of these personal fears regarding the material needs of the crowds, Philip joined with <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> in the expression of disappointment that nothing was done to teach the multitude. That night Philip got to thinking over these experiences and was tempted to doubt the whole idea of the kingdom; he honestly wondered what all these things could mean, but he expressed his doubts to no one; he loved Jesus too much. He had great personal faith in the Master.</p>
<p id="p5_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p5_7">172:5.7</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a>, aside from the symbolic and prophetic aspects, came the nearest to understanding the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>‚Äôs reason for enlisting the popular support of the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> <a href="/en/topic/Havona_pilgrims">pilgrims</a>. He reasoned it out, before they reached the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>, that without such a demonstrative entry into <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> would have been arrested by the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> officials and cast into prison the moment he presumed to enter the city. He was not, therefore, in the least surprised that the Master made no further use of the cheering crowds when he had once got inside the walls of the city and had thus so forcibly impressed the Jewish leaders that they would refrain from placing him under immediate arrest. Understanding the real reason for the Master‚Äôs entering the city in this manner, <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_the_Pharisee">Nathaniel</a> naturally followed along with more poise and was less perturbed and disappointed by Jesus‚Äô subsequent conduct than were the other apostles. Nathaniel had great confidence in Jesus‚Äô understanding of men as well as in his sagacity and cleverness in handling difficult situations.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_7_7"><a href="#fn_a5_7_7">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_7_8"><a href="#fn_a5_7_8">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p5_8">172:5.8</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Matthew_Levi">Matthew</a> was at first nonplused by this pageant performance. He did not grasp the meaning of what his eyes were seeing until he also recalled the Scripture in <a href="/en/topic/Zechariah">Zechariah</a> where the prophet had alluded to the rejoicing of Jerusalem because her king had come bringing salvation and riding upon the colt of an <a href="/en/topic/donkeys">ass</a>. As the procession moved in the direction of the city and then drew on toward the temple, Matthew became ecstatic; he was certain that something extraordinary would happen when the Master arrived at the temple at the head of this shouting multitude. When one of the <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> mocked Jesus, saying, ‚ÄúLook, everybody, see who comes here, the king of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> riding on an ass!‚Äù Matthew kept his hands off of him only by exercising great restraint. None of <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">the twelve</a> was more depressed on the way back to <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a> that evening. Next to <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Zelotes">Simon Zelotes</a>, he experienced the highest nervous tension and was in a state of exhaustion by night. But by morning Matthew was much cheered; he was, after all, a cheerful loser.</p>
<p id="p5_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p5_9">172:5.9</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Thomas_Didymus">Thomas</a> was the most bewildered and puzzled man of all the twelve. Most of the time he just followed along, gazing at the spectacle and honestly wondering what could be the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>‚Äôs motive for participating in such a peculiar demonstration. Down deep in his heart he regarded the whole performance as a little childish, if not downright foolish. He had never seen <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> do anything like this and was at a loss to account for his strange conduct on this <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a> afternoon. By the time they reached the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>, Thomas had deduced that the purpose of this popular demonstration was so to frighten the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> that they would not dare immediately to arrest the Master. On the way back to Bethany Thomas thought much but said nothing. By bedtime the Master‚Äôs cleverness in staging the tumultuous entry into <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> had begun to make a somewhat humorous appeal, and he was much cheered up by this reaction.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_9_5"><a href="#fn_a5_9_5">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p5_10">172:5.10</a></small></sup>  This Sunday started off as a great day for <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Zelotes">Simon Zelotes</a>. He saw visions of wonderful doings in Jerusalem the next few days, and in that he was right, but <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> dreamed of the establishment of the new national rule of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>, with Jesus on the throne of <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a>. <a href="/en/topic/Simon_of_Cyrene">Simon</a> saw the nationalists springing into action as soon as the kingdom was announced, and himself in supreme command of the assembling military forces of the new kingdom. On the way down <a href="/en/topic/Olivet">Olivet</a> he even envisaged the Sanhedrin and all of their sympathizers dead before sunset of that day. He really believed something great was going to happen. He was the noisiest man in the whole multitude. By five o‚Äôclock that afternoon he was a silent, crushed, and disillusioned <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostle</a>. He never fully recovered from the depression which settled down on him as a result of this day‚Äôs shock; at least not until long after the Master‚Äôs resurrection.</p>
<p id="p5_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p5_11">172:5.11</a></small></sup>  To the <a href="/en/topic/Alpheus_twins">Alpheus twins</a> this was a perfect day. They really enjoyed it all the way through, and not being present during the time of quiet visitation about the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>, they escaped much of the anticlimax of the popular upheaval. They could not possibly understand the downcast behavior of the apostles when they came back to <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a> that evening. In the memory of the twins this was always their day of being nearest heaven on earth. This day was the satisfying climax of their whole career as apostles. And the memory of the elation of this <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a> afternoon carried them on through all of the tragedy of this eventful week, right up to the hour of the crucifixion. It was the most befitting entry of the king the twins could conceive; they enjoyed every moment of the whole pageant. They fully approved of all they saw and long cherished the memory.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_11_1"><a href="#fn_a5_11_1">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p5_12">172:5.12</a></small></sup>  Of all the <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a> was the most adversely affected by this processional entry into <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. His mind was in a disagreeable ferment because of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>‚Äôs rebuke the preceding day in connection with <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a>‚Äôs anointing at the feast in <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a>‚Äôs house. Judas was disgusted with the whole spectacle. To him it seemed childish, if not indeed ridiculous. As this vengeful apostle looked upon the proceedings of this Sunday afternoon, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> seemed to him more to resemble a clown than a king. He heartily resented the whole performance. He shared the views of the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a>, who looked down upon anyone who would consent to ride upon an <a href="/en/topic/donkeys">ass</a> or the colt of an ass. By the time the triumphal procession had entered the city, Judas had about made up his mind to abandon the whole idea of such a kingdom; he was almost resolved to forsake all such farcical attempts to establish the kingdom of heaven. And then he thought of the resurrection of <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a>, and many other things, and decided to stay on with the twelve, at least for another day. Besides, he carried the bag, and he would not desert with the apostolic funds in his possession. On the way back to Bethany that night his conduct did not seem strange since all of the apostles were equally downcast and silent.</p>
<p id="p5_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p5_13">172:5.13</a></small></sup>  Judas was tremendously influenced by the <a href="/en/topic/ridicule">ridicule</a> of his Sadducean friends. No other single factor exerted such a powerful influence on him, in his final determination to forsake Jesus and his fellow apostles, as a certain episode which occurred just as Jesus reached the gate of the city: A prominent Sadducee (a friend of Judas‚Äôs family) rushed up to him in a spirit of gleeful ridicule and, slapping him on the back, said: ‚ÄúWhy so troubled of countenance, my good friend; cheer up and join us all while we acclaim this Jesus of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> the king of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> as he rides through the gates of Jerusalem seated on an ass.‚Äù Judas had never shrunk from persecution, but he could not stand this sort of ridicule. With the long-nourished emotion of revenge there was now blended this fatal fear of ridicule, that terrible and fearful feeling of being ashamed of his Master and his fellow apostles. At heart, this ordained ambassador of the kingdom was already a deserter; it only remained for him to find some plausible excuse for an open break with the Master.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_13_2"><a href="#fn_a5_13_2">[21]</a></sup></p>
