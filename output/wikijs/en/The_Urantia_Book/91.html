<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p0_1">91:0.1</a></small></sup>  PRAYER, as an agency of <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a>, evolved from previous nonreligious monologue and dialogue expressions. With the attainment of self-consciousness by primitive man there occurred the inevitable corollary of other-consciousness, the dual potential of social response and <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> recognition.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_1_0"><a href="#fn_a0_1_0">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p0_2">91:0.2</a></small></sup>  The earliest <a href="/en/topic/prayer">prayer</a> forms were not addressed to <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>. These expressions were much like what you would say to a friend as you entered upon some important undertaking, “Wish me <a href="/en/topic/luck">luck</a>.” Primitive man was enslaved to <a href="/en/topic/magic">magic</a>; luck, good and bad, entered into all the affairs of life. At first, these luck petitions were monologues—just a kind of thinking out loud by the magic server. Next, these believers in luck would enlist the support of their friends and families, and presently some form of ceremony would be performed which included the whole clan or tribe.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_2_5"><a href="#fn_s0_2_5">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s0_2_6"><a href="#fn_s0_2_6">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p0_3">91:0.3</a></small></sup>  When the concepts of ghosts and spirits evolved, these petitions became superhuman in address, and with the consciousness of gods, such expressions attained to the levels of genuine prayer. As an illustration of this, among certain <a href="/en/topic/aborigines_(Australian)">Australian tribes</a> primitive religious prayers antedated their belief in spirits and superhuman personalities.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_3_5"><a href="#fn_s0_3_5">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s0_3_6"><a href="#fn_s0_3_6">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p0_4">91:0.4</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Toda_tribe">Toda tribe</a> of <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a> now observes this practice of praying to no one in particular, just as did the early peoples before the times of religious consciousness. Only, among the Todas, this represents a regression of their degenerating <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> to this primitive level. The present-day rituals of the dairymen priests of the Todas do not represent a religious ceremony since these impersonal prayers do not contribute anything to the conservation or enhancement of any social, moral, or spiritual values.</p>
<p id="p0_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p0_5">91:0.5</a></small></sup>  Prereligious praying was part of the mana practices of the <a href="/en/topic/Melanesians">Melanesians</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/oudah">oudah</a> beliefs of the African <a href="/en/topic/Pygmies">Pygmies</a>, and the <a href="/en/topic/manitou_superstitions">manitou superstitions</a> of the North American <a href="/en/topic/Indians_(American)">Indians</a>. The <a href="/en/topic/Baganda_tribes">Baganda tribes</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Africa">Africa</a> have only recently emerged from the mana level of <a href="/en/topic/prayer">prayer</a>. In this early evolutionary confusion men pray to gods—local and national—to fetishes, amulets, ghosts, rulers, and to ordinary people.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. PRIMITIVE PRAYER </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p1_1">91:1.1</a></small></sup>  The function of early evolutionary <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> is to conserve and augment the essential social, moral, and spiritual values which are slowly taking form. This mission of religion is not consciously observed by mankind, but it is chiefly effected by the function of <a href="/en/topic/prayer">prayer</a>. The practice of prayer represents the unintended, but nonetheless personal and collective, effort of any group to secure (to actualize) this conservation of higher values. But for the safeguarding of prayer, all holy days would speedily revert to the status of mere <a href="/en/topic/holidays">holidays</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p1_2">91:1.2</a></small></sup>  Religion and its agencies, the chief of which is prayer, are allied only with those values which have general social recognition, group approval. Therefore, when primitive man attempted to gratify his baser emotions or to achieve unmitigated selfish ambitions, he was deprived of the consolation of religion and the assistance of prayer. If the individual sought to accomplish anything antisocial, he was obliged to seek the aid of nonreligious magic, resort to sorcerers, and thus be deprived of the assistance of prayer. Prayer, therefore, very early became a mighty promoter of social evolution, moral progress, and spiritual attainment.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_48"><a href="#fn_a1_2_48">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p1_3">91:1.3</a></small></sup>  But the primitive mind was neither logical nor consistent. Early men did not perceive that material things were not the province of <a href="/en/topic/prayer">prayer</a>. These simple-minded souls reasoned that food, shelter, rain, game, and other material goods enhanced the social welfare, and therefore they began to pray for these physical blessings. While this constituted a perversion of prayer, it encouraged the effort to realize these material objectives by social and ethical actions. Such a prostitution of prayer, while debasing the spiritual values of a people, nevertheless directly elevated their economic, social, and ethical mores.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p1_4">91:1.4</a></small></sup>  Prayer is only monologuous in the most primitive type of mind. It early becomes a dialogue and rapidly expands to the level of group worship. Prayer signifies that the premagical incantations of primitive <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> have evolved to that level where the human mind recognizes the reality of beneficent powers or beings who are able to enhance social values and to augment moral ideals, and further, that these influences are superhuman and distinct from the ego of the self-conscious human and his fellow <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a>. True prayer does not, therefore, appear until the agency of religious ministry is visualized as <i>personal.</i><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_4_14"><a href="#fn_a1_4_14">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p1_5">91:1.5</a></small></sup>  Prayer is little associated with <a href="/en/topic/animism">animism</a>, but such beliefs may exist alongside emerging religious sentiments. Many times, religion and animism have had entirely separate origins.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p1_6">91:1.6</a></small></sup>  With those <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> who have not been delivered from the primitive bondage of fear, there is a real danger that all <a href="/en/topic/prayer">prayer</a> may lead to a morbid sense of sin, unjustified convictions of guilt, real or fancied. But in modern times it is not likely that many will spend sufficient time at prayer to lead to this harmful brooding over their unworthiness or sinfulness. The dangers attendant upon the distortion and perversion of prayer consist in ignorance, superstition, crystallization, devitalization, materialism, and fanaticism.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_6_6"><a href="#fn_s1_6_6">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. EVOLVING PRAYER </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p2_1">91:2.1</a></small></sup>  The first prayers were merely verbalized wishes, the expression of sincere desires. Prayer next became a technique of achieving spirit co-operation. And then it attained to the higher function of assisting <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> in the conservation of all worth-while values.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_6"><a href="#fn_s2_1_6">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p2_2">91:2.2</a></small></sup>  Both <a href="/en/topic/prayer">prayer</a> and <a href="/en/topic/magic">magic</a> arose as a result of man’s adjustive reactions to Urantian environment. But aside from this generalized relationship, they have little in common. Prayer has always indicated positive action by the praying ego; it has been always psychic and sometimes spiritual. Magic has usually signified an attempt to manipulate reality without affecting the ego of the manipulator, the practitioner of magic. Despite their independent origins, magic and prayer often have been interrelated in their later stages of development. Magic has sometimes ascended by goal elevation from formulas through rituals and incantations to the threshold of true prayer. Prayer has sometimes become so materialistic that it has degenerated into a pseudomagical technique of avoiding the expenditure of that effort which is requisite for the solution of Urantian problems.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_2_1"><a href="#fn_a2_2_1">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p2_3">91:2.3</a></small></sup>  When man learned that prayer could not coerce the gods, then it became more of a petition, favor seeking. But the truest prayer is in reality a communion between man and his Maker.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_3_16"><a href="#fn_a2_3_16">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_3_55"><a href="#fn_a2_3_55">[6]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_3_6"><a href="#fn_s2_3_6">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_3_3"><a href="#fn_s2_3_3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_3_8"><a href="#fn_s2_3_8">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p2_4">91:2.4</a></small></sup>  The appearance of the <a href="/en/topic/sacrifice">sacrifice</a> idea in any <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> unfailingly detracts from the higher efficacy of true <a href="/en/topic/prayer">prayer</a> in that men seek to substitute the offerings of material possessions for the offering of their own consecrated wills to the doing of the will of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p2_5">91:2.5</a></small></sup>  When religion is divested of a personal God, its prayers translate to the levels of theology and philosophy. When the highest God concept of a religion is that of an impersonal <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>, such as in pantheistic idealism, although affording the basis for certain forms of mystic communion, it proves fatal to the potency of true prayer, which always stands for man’s communion with a personal and superior being.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_5_5"><a href="#fn_s2_5_5">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_5_0"><a href="#fn_s2_5_0">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p2_6">91:2.6</a></small></sup>  During the earlier times of racial evolution and even at the present time, in the day-by-day experience of the average mortal, <a href="/en/topic/prayer">prayer</a> is very much a phenomenon of man’s intercourse with his own subconscious. But there is also a domain of prayer wherein the intellectually alert and spiritually progressing individual attains more or less contact with the superconscious levels of the human mind, the domain of the indwelling Thought Adjuster. In addition, there is a definite spiritual phase of true prayer which concerns its reception and recognition by the spiritual forces of the universe, and which is entirely distinct from all human and intellectual association.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_6_4"><a href="#fn_a2_6_4">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_6_22"><a href="#fn_a2_6_22">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_6_27"><a href="#fn_a2_6_27">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_6_32"><a href="#fn_a2_6_32">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_6_36"><a href="#fn_a2_6_36">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_6_40"><a href="#fn_a2_6_40">[12]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_6_6"><a href="#fn_s2_6_6">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p2_7">91:2.7</a></small></sup>  Prayer contributes greatly to the development of the religious sentiment of an evolving human mind. It is a mighty influence working to prevent <a href="/en/topic/isolation">isolation</a> of personality.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p2_8">91:2.8</a></small></sup>  Prayer represents one technique associated with the natural religions of racial evolution which also forms a part of the experiential values of the higher religions of ethical excellence, the religions of revelation.</p>

<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p3_1">91:3.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/children">Children</a>, when first learning to make use of <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a>, are prone to think out loud, to express their thoughts in words, even if no one is present to hear them. With the dawn of creative imagination they evince a tendency to converse with imaginary companions. In this way a budding ego seeks to hold communion with a fictitious <i><a href="/en/topic/alter_ego">alter ego</a>.</i> By this technique the child early learns to convert his monologue conversations into pseudo dialogues in which this alter ego makes replies to his verbal thinking and wish expression. Very much of an adult’s thinking is mentally carried on in conversational form.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_1_4"><a href="#fn_a3_1_4">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_1_36"><a href="#fn_a3_1_36">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_1_5"><a href="#fn_a3_1_5">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_1_17"><a href="#fn_a3_1_17">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_1_18"><a href="#fn_a3_1_18">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_1_35"><a href="#fn_a3_1_35">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_1_37"><a href="#fn_a3_1_37">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_1_38"><a href="#fn_a3_1_38">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_1_50"><a href="#fn_a3_1_50">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_1_70"><a href="#fn_a3_1_70">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p3_2">91:3.2</a></small></sup>  The early and primitive form of <a href="/en/topic/prayer">prayer</a> was much like the semimagical recitations of the present-day <a href="/en/topic/Toda_tribe">Toda tribe</a>, prayers that were not addressed to anyone in particular. But such techniques of praying tend to evolve into the dialogue type of communication by the emergence of the idea of an alter ego. In time the alter-ego concept is exalted to a superior status of divine dignity, and prayer as an agency of <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> has appeared. Through many phases and during long ages this primitive type of praying is destined to evolve before attaining the level of intelligent and truly ethical prayer.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_2_18"><a href="#fn_a3_2_18">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p3_3">91:3.3</a></small></sup>  As it is conceived by successive generations of praying <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/alter_ego">alter ego</a> evolves up through ghosts, fetishes, and spirits to polytheistic gods, and eventually to the <a href="/en/topic/One_God">One God</a>, a divine being embodying the highest ideals and the loftiest aspirations of the praying ego. And thus does prayer function as the most potent agency of religion in the conservation of the highest values and ideals of those who pray. From the moment of the conceiving of an alter ego to the appearance of the concept of a divine and heavenly Father, prayer is always a socializing, moralizing, and spiritualizing practice.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_3_5"><a href="#fn_a3_3_5">[14]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_3_6"><a href="#fn_s3_3_6">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s3_3_8"><a href="#fn_s3_3_8">[4]</a></sup></p>

Prayer induces the human ego to look both ways for help: for material aid to the subconscious reservoir of mortal experience, for inspiration and guidance to the superconscious borders of the contact of the material with the spiritual, with the Mystery Monitor.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_5_38"><a href="#fn_a3_5_38">[19]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_5_6"><a href="#fn_s3_5_6">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s3_5_1"><a href="#fn_s3_5_1">[6]</a></sup></p>
