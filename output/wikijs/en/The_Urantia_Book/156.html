<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p0_1">156:0.1</a></small></sup>  ON FRIDAY afternoon, June 10, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and his associates arrived in the environs of <a href="/en/topic/Sidon">Sidon</a>, where they stopped at the home of a well-to-do woman who had been a patient in the <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a> hospital during the times when Jesus was at the height of his popular favor<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. The evangelists and the apostles were lodged with her friends in the immediate neighborhood, and they rested over the <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> day amid these refreshing surroundings. They spent almost two and one-half weeks in Sidon and vicinity before they prepared to visit the coast cities to the north.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p0_2">156:0.2</a></small></sup>  This June Sabbath day was one of great quiet. The evangelists and apostles were altogether absorbed in their meditations regarding the discourses of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> on religion to which they had listened en route to Sidon. They were all able to appreciate something of what he had told them, but none of them fully grasped the import of his teaching.</p>

While they had obeyed their Master’s instructions, the servant of Karuska had gone over to the house of this Syrian woman, <a href="/en/topic/Norana">Norana</a>, to inform her that Jesus lodged at the home of her mistress and had urged this anxious mother to bring her afflicted daughter for healing. This mother, of course, believed that her child was possessed by a demon, an unclean spirit.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p1_3">156:1.3</a></small></sup>  When Norana arrived with her daughter, the <a href="/en/topic/Alpheus_twins">Alpheus twins</a> explained through an interpreter that the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> was resting and could not be disturbed; whereupon Norana replied that she and the child would remain right there until the Master had finished his rest. <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> also endeavored to reason with her and to persuade her to go home. He explained that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was weary with much teaching and healing, and that he had come to Phoenicia for a period of quiet and rest. But it was futile; Norana would not leave. To <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Peter</a>’s entreaties she replied only: “I will not depart until I have seen your Master. I know he can cast the demon out of my child, and I will not go until the healer has looked upon my daughter.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_3_53"><a href="#fn_a1_3_53">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p1_4">156:1.4</a></small></sup>  Then Thomas sought to send the woman away but met only with failure. To him she said: “I have faith that your Master can cast out this demon which torments my child. I have heard of his mighty works in <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>, and I believe in him. What has happened to you, his disciples, that you would send away those who come seeking your Master’s help?” And when she had thus spoken, Thomas withdrew.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p1_5">156:1.5</a></small></sup>  Then came forward <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Zelotes">Simon Zelotes</a> to remonstrate with <a href="/en/topic/Norana">Norana</a>.

She replied only: “Yes, teacher, I understand your words. I am only a dog in the eyes of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>, but as concerns your Master, I am a believing dog. I am determined that he shall see my daughter, for I am persuaded that, if he shall but look upon her, he will heal her.

<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p1_6">156:1.6</a></small></sup>  At just this time the little girl was seized with a violent convulsion before them all, and the mother cried out: “There, you can see that my child is possessed by an evil spirit. If our need does not impress you, it would appeal to your Master, who I have been told loves all men and dares even to heal the gentiles when they believe. You are not worthy to be his disciples. I will not go until my child has been cured.”</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p1_7">156:1.7</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, who had heard all of this conversation through an open window, now came outside, much to their surprise, and said: “O woman, great is your faith, so great that I cannot withhold that which you desire; go your way in peace. Your daughter already has been made whole.” And the little girl was well from that hour<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>. As <a href="/en/topic/Norana">Norana</a> and the child took leave, Jesus entreated them to tell no one of this occurrence; and while his associates did comply with this request, the mother and the child ceased not to proclaim the fact of the little girl’s healing throughout all the countryside and even in <a href="/en/topic/Sidon">Sidon</a>, so much so that Jesus found it advisable to change his lodgings within a few days.</p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p1_8">156:1.8</a></small></sup>  The next day, as Jesus taught his apostles, commenting on the cure of the daughter of the Syrian woman, he said: “And so it has been all the way along; you see for yourselves how the gentiles are able to exercise saving faith in the teachings of the gospel of the kingdom of heaven. Verily, verily, I tell you that the Father’s kingdom shall be taken by the gentiles if the children of <a href="/en/topic/Abraham_(Old_Testament)">Abraham</a> are not minded to show faith enough to enter therein.”</p>

As they walked over this bridge, Jesus, among other things, said: “This world is only a bridge; you may pass over it, but you should not think to build a dwelling place upon it.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_1_10"><a href="#fn_a2_1_10">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_1_14"><a href="#fn_a2_1_14">[5]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_9"><a href="#fn_s2_1_9">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_1_16"><a href="#fn_s2_1_16">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p2_2">156:2.2</a></small></sup>  As the twenty-four began their labors in Sidon, Jesus went to stay in a home just north of the city, the house of <a href="/en/topic/Justa">Justa</a> and her mother, <a href="/en/topic/Bernice">Bernice</a>. Jesus taught the twenty-four each morning at the home of Justa, and they went abroad in Sidon to teach and preach during the afternoons and evenings.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p2_3">156:2.3</a></small></sup>  The apostles and the evangelists were greatly cheered by the manner in which the gentiles of <a href="/en/topic/Sidon">Sidon</a> received their message; during their short sojourn many were added to the kingdom. This period of about six weeks in Phoenicia was a very fruitful time in the work of winning souls, but the later Jewish writers of the Gospels were wont lightly to pass over the record of this warm reception of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ teachings by these gentiles at this very time when such a large number of his own people were in hostile array against him.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p2_4">156:2.4</a></small></sup>  In many ways these gentile believers appreciated Jesus’ teachings more fully than the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>. Many of these Greek-speaking Syrophoenicians came to know not only that Jesus was like <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> but also that God was like Jesus. These so-called heathen achieved a good understanding of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s teachings about the uniformity of the laws of this world and the entire universe. They grasped the teaching that God is no respecter of <a href="/en/topic/persons">persons</a>, races, or nations; that there is no <a href="/en/topic/favoritism">favoritism</a> with the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>; that the universe is wholly and ever law-abiding and unfailingly dependable<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>.

<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p2_5">156:2.5</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> made it clear to the twenty-four that he had not fled from <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> because he lacked courage to confront his enemies. They comprehended that he was not yet ready for an open clash with established religion, and that he did not seek to become a martyr. It was during one of these conferences at the home of <a href="/en/topic/Justa">Justa</a> that the Master first told his disciples that “even though heaven and earth shall pass away, my words of truth shall not<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_5_11"><a href="#fn_a2_5_11">[8]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_5_7"><a href="#fn_s2_5_7">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p2_6">156:2.6</a></small></sup>  The theme of Jesus’ instructions during the sojourn at <a href="/en/topic/Sidon">Sidon</a> was spiritual progression. He told them they could not stand still; they must go forward in righteousness or retrogress into <a href="/en/topic/evil">evil</a> and <a href="/en/topic/sin">sin</a>. He admonished them to “forget those things which are in the <a href="/en/topic/past">past</a> while you push forward to embrace the greater realities of the kingdom<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b9"><a href="#fn_b9">[9]</a></sup>.” He besought them not to be content with their childhood in the gospel but to strive for the attainment of the full stature of divine sonship in the communion of the spirit and in the fellowship of believers<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_6_13"><a href="#fn_a2_6_13">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_6_47"><a href="#fn_a2_6_47">[10]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p2_8">156:2.8</a></small></sup>  Jesus greatly enjoyed the keen sense of <a href="/en/topic/humor">humor</a> which these gentiles exhibited. It was the sense of humor displayed by <a href="/en/topic/Norana">Norana</a>, the Syrian woman, as well as her great and persistent faith, that so touched the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s heart and appealed to his mercy. Jesus greatly regretted that his people—the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>—were so lacking in humor. He once said to Thomas: “My people take themselves too seriously; they are just about devoid of an appreciation of humor. The burdensome religion of the <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> could never have had origin among a people with a sense of humor.

<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p3_1">156:3.1</a></small></sup>  On Tuesday, June 28, the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and his associates left <a href="/en/topic/Sidon">Sidon</a>, going up the coast to <a href="/en/topic/Porphyreon">Porphyreon</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Heldua">Heldua</a>. They were well received by the gentiles, and many were added to the kingdom during this week of teaching and preaching. The apostles preached in Porphyreon and the evangelists taught in Heldua. While the twenty-four were thus engaged in their work, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> left them for a period of three or four days, paying a visit to the coast city of <a href="/en/topic/Beirut">Beirut</a>, where he visited with a Syrian named <a href="/en/topic/Malach">Malach</a>, who was a believer, and who had been at <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a> the year before.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p3_2">156:3.2</a></small></sup>  On <a href="/en/topic/Wednesday">Wednesday</a>, July 6, they all returned to Sidon and tarried at the home of <a href="/en/topic/Justa">Justa</a> until <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a> morning, when they departed for <a href="/en/topic/Tyre">Tyre</a>, going south along the coast by way of <a href="/en/topic/Sarepta">Sarepta</a>, arriving at Tyre on Monday, July 11. By this time the apostles and the evangelists were becoming accustomed to working among these so-called gentiles, who were in reality mainly descended from the earlier Canaanite tribes of still earlier Semitic origin. All of these peoples spoke the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a>. It was a great surprise to the apostles and evangelists to observe the eagerness of these gentiles to hear the gospel and to note the readiness with which many of them believed.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_2_4"><a href="#fn_a3_2_4">[13]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p4_1">156:4.1</a></small></sup>  From July 11 to July 24 they taught in <a href="/en/topic/Tyre">Tyre</a>. Each of the apostles took with him one of the evangelists, and thus two and two they taught and preached in all parts of Tyre and its environs. The polyglot population of this busy seaport heard them gladly, and many were baptized into the outward fellowship of the kingdom. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> maintained his headquarters at the home of a Jew named <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>, a believer, who lived three or four miles south of Tyre, not far from the tomb of <a href="/en/topic/Hiram">Hiram</a> who had been king of the city-state of Tyre during the times of <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Solomon">Solomon</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p4_2">156:4.2</a></small></sup>  Daily, for this period of two weeks, the apostles and evangelists entered Tyre by way of <a href="/en/topic/Alexander_of_Cyrene">Alexander</a>’s mole to conduct small meetings, and each night most of them would return to the encampment at Joseph’s house south of the city. Every day believers came out from the city to talk with Jesus at his resting place. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> spoke in Tyre only once, on the afternoon of July 20, when he taught the believers concerning the Father’s love for all mankind and about the mission of the Son to reveal the Father to all races of men. There was such an interest in the gospel of the kingdom among these gentiles that, on this occasion, the doors of the <a href="/en/topic/Melkarth_temple">Melkarth temple</a> were opened to him, and it is interesting to record that in subsequent years a Christian church was built on the very site of this ancient <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_2_32"><a href="#fn_a4_2_32">[14]</a></sup></p>

When, shortly thereafter, the supply of the sea animals which were the source of this dye began to diminish, these dye makers went forth in search of new habitats of these shellfish. And thus migrating to the ends of the earth, they carried with them the message of the fatherhood of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and the brotherhood of man—the gospel of the kingdom.</p>

Let every man make sure that the intellectual and moral foundations of character are such as will adequately support the superstructure of the enlarging and ennobling spiritual nature, which is thus to transform the mortal mind and then, in association with that re-created mind, is to achieve the evolvement of the <a href="/en/topic/soul">soul</a> of immortal destiny. Your spirit nature—the jointly created soul—is a living growth, but the mind and morals of the individual are the soil from which these higher manifestations of human development and divine destiny must spring. The soil of the evolving soul is human and material, but the destiny of this combined creature of mind and spirit is spiritual and divine.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_2_13"><a href="#fn_a5_2_13">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_2_21"><a href="#fn_a5_2_21">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_2_35"><a href="#fn_a5_2_35">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_2_54"><a href="#fn_a5_2_54">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_2_56"><a href="#fn_a5_2_56">[19]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s5_2_0"><a href="#fn_s5_2_0">[8]</a></sup></p>

You well know how our forefathers were disposed to see God in almost everything that happened. They looked for the hand of God in all natural occurrences and in every unusual episode of human experience. They connected God with both good and evil. They thought he softened the heart of <a href="/en/topic/Moses">Moses</a> and hardened the heart of Pharaoh<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b20"><a href="#fn_b20">[20]</a></sup>. When man had a strong urge to do something, good or evil, he was in the habit of accounting for these unusual emotions by remarking: ‘The Lord spoke to me saying, do thus and so, or go here and there<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b21"><a href="#fn_b21">[21]</a></sup>.’ Accordingly, since men so often and so violently ran into <a href="/en/topic/temptation">temptation</a>, it became the habit of our forefathers to believe that God led them thither for testing, punishing, or strengthening.

When you are in this way tempted, I admonish you that, while you recognize temptation honestly and sincerely for just what it is, you intelligently redirect the energies of spirit, mind, and body, which are seeking expression, into higher channels and toward more idealistic goals. In this way may you transform your temptations into the highest types of uplifting mortal ministry while you almost wholly avoid these wasteful and weakening conflicts between the animal and spiritual natures<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b23"><a href="#fn_b23">[23]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s5_4_2"><a href="#fn_s5_4_2">[6]</a></sup></p>

If you would be truly triumphant over the temptations of the lesser and lower nature, you must come to that place of spiritual advantage where you have really and truly developed an actual interest in, and love for, those higher and more idealistic forms of conduct which your mind is desirous of substituting for these lower and less idealistic habits of behavior that you recognize as temptation<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b24"><a href="#fn_b24">[24]</a></sup>.
