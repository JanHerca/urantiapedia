<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p0_1">28:0.1</a></small></sup>  AS THE <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a> are the angelic hosts of the central universe and the <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> of the local universes, so are the <a href="/en/topic/seconaphim">seconaphim</a> the <a href="/en/topic/ministering_spirits">ministering spirits</a> of the superuniverses. In degree of divinity and in potential of supremacy, however, these children of the <a href="/en/topic/Reflective_Spirits">Reflective Spirits</a> are much more like supernaphim than seraphim.

Technically, neither <a href="/en/topic/tertiaphim">tertiaphim</a> nor <a href="/en/topic/omniaphim">omniaphim</a> are <a href="/en/topic/ministering_spirits">ministering spirits</a> <i>of</i> the superuniverses, though both serve as spirit ministers <i>in</i> these domains.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. THE TERTIAPHIM </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p1_1">28:1.1</a></small></sup>  These high <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a> are of record on the superuniverse headquarters, and despite service in the local creations, technically they are residents of these superuniverse capitals inasmuch as they are not native to the local universes. Tertiaphim are children of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a> and are personalized on <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> in groups of one thousand. These supernal beings of divine originality and near-supreme versatility are the gift of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite">Infinite</a> Spirit to the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Sons</a> of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_1_4"><a href="#fn_s1_1_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p1_2">28:1.2</a></small></sup>  When a <a href="/en/topic/Michael_Sons">Michael Son</a> is detached from the parental regime of Paradise and is made ready to go forth on the universe adventure of space, the Infinite Spirit is delivered of a group of one thousand of these companion spirits. And these majestic <a href="/en/topic/tertiaphim">tertiaphim</a> accompany this Creator Son when he embarks upon the adventure of universe organization.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_2_10"><a href="#fn_s1_2_10">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p1_3">28:1.3</a></small></sup>  Throughout the early times of universe building, these one thousand tertiaphim are the only personal staff of a <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a>. They acquire a mighty experience as Son assistants during these stirring ages of universe assembling and other astronomical manipulations. They serve by the side of the Creator Son until the day of the personalization of the <a href="/en/topic/Bright_and_Morning_Stars">Bright and Morning Star</a>, the first-born of a local universe<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. Thereupon the formal resignations of the tertiaphim are tendered and accepted. And with the appearance of the initial orders of native angelic life, they retire from active service in the local universe and become the liaison ministers between the Creator Son of former attachment and the <a href="/en/topic/Ancients_of_Days">Ancients of Days</a> of the superuniverse concerned.</p>

They are not of registry on Uversa, nor are they attached to our administration. Neither are they directly concerned with the ascendant scheme of mortal progression.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_6"><a href="#fn_s2_1_6">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_1_4"><a href="#fn_s2_1_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p2_2">28:2.2</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/omniaphim">omniaphim</a> are wholly occupied with the oversight of the superuniverses in the interests of administrative co-ordination from the viewpoint of the Seven Supreme Executives. Our colony of omniaphim on Uversa receives instructions from, and makes reports to, only the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme_Executive_#7_(of_Orvonton)">Supreme Executive of Orvonton</a>, situated on conjoint executive sphere number seven in the outer ring of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> satellites.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. THE SECONAPHIM </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p3_1">28:3.1</a></small></sup>  The secoraphic hosts are produced by the seven <a href="/en/topic/Reflective_Spirits">Reflective Spirits</a> assigned to the headquarters of each superuniverse. There is a definite Paradise-responsive technique associated with the creation of these <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a> in groups of seven. In each seven there are always one primary, three secondary, and three tertiary <a href="/en/topic/seconaphim">seconaphim</a>; they always personalize in this exact proportion. When seven such seconaphim are created, one, the primary, becomes attached to the service of the <a href="/en/topic/Ancients_of_Days">Ancients of Days</a>. The three secondary angels are associated with three groups of Paradise-origin administrators in the supergovernments: the <a href="/en/topic/Divine_Counselors">Divine Counselors</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Perfectors_of_Wisdom">Perfectors of Wisdom</a>, and the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Censors">Universal Censors</a>. The three tertiary angels are attached to the ascendant trinitized associates of the superuniverse rulers: the <a href="/en/topic/Mighty_Messengers">Mighty Messengers</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Those_High_in_Authority">Those High in Authority</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Those_without_Name_and_Number">Those without Name and Number</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_1_6"><a href="#fn_s3_1_6">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s3_1_9"><a href="#fn_s3_1_9">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p3_2">28:3.2</a></small></sup>  These seconaphim of the superuniverses are the offspring of the Reflective Spirits, and therefore <a href="/en/topic/reflectivity">reflectivity</a> is inherent in their nature. They are reflectively responsive to all of each phase of every creature of origin in the <a href="/en/topic/Third_Source_and_Center">Third Source and Center</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Creator_Sons">Paradise Creator Sons</a>, but they are not directly reflective of the beings and entities, personal or otherwise, of sole origin in the <a href="/en/topic/First_Source_and_Center">First Source and Center</a>. We possess many evidences of the actuality of the universal intelligence circuits of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>, but even if we had no other proof, the reflective performances of the seconaphim would be quite sufficient to demonstrate the reality of the universal presence of the infinite mind of the <a href="/en/topic/Conjoint_Actor">Conjoint Actor</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 4. THE PRIMARY SECONAPHIM </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p4_1">28:4.1</a></small></sup>  The primary <a href="/en/topic/seconaphim">seconaphim</a>, of assignment to the <a href="/en/topic/Ancients_of_Days">Ancients of Days</a>, are living <a href="/en/topic/mirrors">mirrors</a> in the service of these triune rulers. Think what it means in the economy of a superuniverse to be able to turn, as it were, to a living mirror and therein to see and therewith to hear the certain responses of another being a thousand or a hundred thousand light-years distant and to do all this instantly and unerringly. Records are essential to the conduct of the universes, <a href="/en/topic/broadcasts_(celestial)">broadcasts</a> are serviceable, the work of the Solitary and other <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> is very helpful, but the <a href="/en/topic/Ancients_of_Days_of_Uversa">Ancients of Days</a> from their position midway between the inhabited worlds and <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>—between man and <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>—can instantly look both ways, hear both ways, and <i>know</i> both ways.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_1_47"><a href="#fn_a4_1_47">[2]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_1_6"><a href="#fn_s4_1_6">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s4_1_4"><a href="#fn_s4_1_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p4_2">28:4.2</a></small></sup>  This ability—to hear and see, as it were, all things—can be perfectly realized in the <a href="/en/topic/superuniverses">superuniverses</a> only by the Ancients of Days and only on their respective headquarters worlds. Even there limits are encountered: From <a href="/en/topic/Uversa">Uversa</a>, such communication is limited to the worlds and universes of <a href="/en/topic/Orvonton_(superuniverse)">Orvonton</a>, and while inoperative between the superuniverses, this same reflective technique keeps each one of them in close touch with the central universe and with Paradise. The seven supergovernments, though individually segregated, are thus perfectly reflective of the authority above and are wholly sympathetic, as well as perfectly conversant, with the needs below.</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p4_3">28:4.3</a></small></sup>  The primary <a href="/en/topic/seconaphim">seconaphim</a> are found to incline by inherent nature towards <a href="/en/topic/7">seven</a> types of service, and it is befitting that <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> serials of this order should be so endowed as inherently to interpret the mind of the Spirit to the <a href="/en/topic/Ancients_of_Days">Ancients of Days</a>:<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_3_4"><a href="#fn_s4_3_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p4_4">28:4.4</a></small></sup>  1. <i><a href="/en/topic/Voices_of_Conjoint_Actor">The Voice of the Conjoint Actor</a>.</i> In each superuniverse the first primary seconaphim and every seventh one of that order subsequently created exhibit a high order of adaptability for understanding and interpreting the mind of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a> to the Ancients of Days and their associates in the supergovernments. This is of great value on the headquarters of the <a href="/en/topic/superuniverses">superuniverses</a>, for, unlike the local creations with their <a href="/en/topic/Divine_Ministers">Divine Ministers</a>, the seat of a supergovernment does not have a specialized personalization of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite">Infinite</a> Spirit. Hence these secoraphic voices come the nearest to being the personal representatives of the <a href="/en/topic/Third_Source_and_Center">Third Source and Center</a> on such a capital sphere. True, the seven <a href="/en/topic/Reflective_Spirits">Reflective Spirits</a> are there, but these mothers of the secoraphic hosts are less truly and automatically reflective of the <a href="/en/topic/Conjoint_Actor">Conjoint Actor</a> than of the <a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirits,_Seven">Seven Master Spirits</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p4_5">28:4.5</a></small></sup>  2. <i><a href="/en/topic/Voices_of_Seven_Master_Spirits">The Voice of the Seven Master Spirits</a>.</i> The second primary <a href="/en/topic/seconaphim">seconaphim</a> and every seventh one thereafter created incline towards portraying the collective natures and reactions of the Seven Master Spirits. Though each Master Spirit is already represented on a superuniverse capital by some one of the seven Reflective Spirits of assignment, such representation is individual, not collective. Collectively, they are only reflectively present; therefore do the Master Spirits welcome the services of these highly personal <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a>, the second serials of the primary seconaphim, who are so competent to represent them before the <a href="/en/topic/Ancients_of_Days">Ancients of Days</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p4_6">28:4.6</a></small></sup>  3. <i><a href="/en/topic/Voices_of_Creator_Sons">The Voice of the Creator Sons</a>.</i> The <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a> must have had something to do with the creation or training of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Sons of the <a href="/en/topic/Michael,_order_of">order of Michael</a>, for the third primary seconaphim and every seventh serial thereafter possess the remarkable gift of being reflective of the minds of these <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Sons</a>. If the Ancients of Days would like to know—really know—the attitude of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael of Nebadon</a> regarding some matter under consideration, they do not have to call him on the lines of space; they need only call for the Chief of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> Voices, who, upon request, will present the <a href="/en/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a> seconaphim of record; and right then and there the Ancients of Days will perceive the voice of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> Son of Nebadon.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_6_47"><a href="#fn_a4_6_47">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p4_7">28:4.7</a></small></sup>  No other order of sonship is thus “reflectible,” and no other order of angel can thus function. We do not fully understand just how this is accomplished, and I doubt very much that the Creator Sons themselves fully understand it. But of a certainty we know it works, and that it unfailingly works acceptably we also know, for in all the history of <a href="/en/topic/Uversa">Uversa</a> the secoraphic voices have never erred in their presentations.</p>
<p id="p4_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p4_8">28:4.8</a></small></sup>  You are here beginning to see something of the manner in which divinity encompasses the space of time and masters the time of space. You are here obtaining one of your first fleeting glimpses of the technique of the eternity cycle, divergent for the moment to assist the children of time in their tasks of mastering the difficult handicaps of space. And these phenomena are additional to the established universe technique of the <a href="/en/topic/Reflective_Spirits">Reflective Spirits</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p4_9">28:4.9</a></small></sup>  Though apparently deprived of the personal presence of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> Spirits above and of the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Sons</a> below, the <a href="/en/topic/Ancients_of_Days">Ancients of Days</a> have at their command living beings attuned to cosmic mechanisms of reflective perfection and ultimate precision whereby they may enjoy the reflective presence of all those exalted beings whose personal presence is denied them. By and through these means, and others unknown to you, <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> is potentially present on the headquarters of the superuniverses.</p>
<p id="p4_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p4_10">28:4.10</a></small></sup>  The Ancients of Days perfectly deduce the Father’s will by equating the Spirit voice-flash from above and the <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a> voice-flashes from below. Thus may they be unerringly certain in calculating the Father’s will concerning the administrative affairs of the local universes. But to deduce the will of one of the Gods from a knowledge of the other two, the three Ancients of Days must act together; two would not be able to achieve the answer. And for this reason, even were there no others, the superuniverses are always presided over by three Ancients of Days, and not by one or even two.</p>
<p id="p4_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p4_11">28:4.11</a></small></sup>  4. <i><a href="/en/topic/Voices_of_Angelic_Hosts">The Voice of the Angelic Hosts</a>.</i> The fourth primary <a href="/en/topic/seconaphim">seconaphim</a> and every seventh serial prove to be <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a> peculiarly responsive to the sentiments of all orders of angels, including the <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a> above and the <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> below. Thus the attitude of any commanding or supervising angel is immediately available for consideration at any council of the <a href="/en/topic/Ancients_of_Days">Ancients of Days</a>. Never a day passes on your world that the chief of seraphim on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> is not made conscious of the phenomenon of reflective transference, of being drawn upon from <a href="/en/topic/Uversa">Uversa</a> for some purpose; but unless forewarned by a Solitary Messenger, she remains wholly ignorant of what is sought and of how it is secured. These <a href="/en/topic/ministering_spirits">ministering spirits</a> of time are constantly furnishing this sort of unconscious and certainly, therefore, unprejudiced testimony concerning the endless array of matters engaging the attention and counsel of the <a href="/en/topic/Ancients_of_Days_of_Uversa">Ancients of Days</a> and their associates.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_11_6"><a href="#fn_s4_11_6">[1]</a></sup></p>

While they are not the regular <a href="/en/topic/broadcasters_(superior_seraphim)">broadcasters</a> of Uversa, they work in liaison with the angels of the reflective voices for the purpose of synchronizing the reflective vision of the Ancients of Days with certain actual messages coming in over the established circuits of universe communication. <a href="/en/topic/broadcast_receivers">Broadcast receivers</a> are the fifth serials, the fifth primary seconaphim to be created and every seventh one thereafter.</p>

Not being highly specialized, they can function fairly well in any of the capacities of their diverse associates, but such specialized work is undertaken only in emergencies. Their usual tasks are the performance of those generalized duties of a superuniverse which do not fall within the scope of the <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a> of specific assignment.</p>

Long before attaining the portals of perfection, you will begin to gain access to the tools of divinity and to make contact with the techniques of <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>.

<p id="p7_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p7_4">28:7.4</a></small></sup>  We are denied the full privilege of using these <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a> of the reflective order on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. They are frequent visitors on your world, accompanying assigned personalities, but here they cannot freely function. This sphere is still under partial spiritual <a href="/en/topic/quarantine">quarantine</a>, and some of the circuits essential to their services are not here at present. When your world is once more restored to the reflective circuits concerned, much of the work of interplanetary and interuniverse communication will be greatly simplified and expedited. Celestial workers on Urantia encounter many difficulties because of this functional curtailment of their reflective associates. But we go on joyfully conducting our affairs with the instrumentalities at hand, notwithstanding our local deprivation of many of the services of these marvelous beings, the living mirrors of space and the presence projectors of time.</p>
