<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_2">139:1.2</a></small></sup>  In A.D. 26, the year he was chosen as an apostle, Andrew was 33, a full year older than <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the oldest of the apostles. He sprang from an excellent line of ancestors and was the ablest man of the twelve. Excepting oratory, he was the peer of his associates in almost every imaginable ability. Jesus never gave Andrew a nickname, a fraternal designation. But even as the apostles soon began to call Jesus <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, so they also designated Andrew by a term the equivalent of Chief.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_59"><a href="#fn_a1_2_59">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_2_18"><a href="#fn_a1_2_18">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_3">139:1.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> was a good organizer but a better administrator. He was one of the inner circle of four <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a>, but his appointment by Jesus as the head of the apostolic group made it necessary for him to remain on duty with his brethren while the other three enjoyed very close communion with the Master. To the very end Andrew remained dean of the apostolic corps.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_3_18"><a href="#fn_a1_3_18">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_4">139:1.4</a></small></sup>  Although Andrew was never an effective preacher, he was an efficient personal worker, being the pioneer missionary of the kingdom in that, as <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> chosen apostle, he immediately brought to <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> his brother, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a>, who subsequently became one of the greatest preachers of the kingdom<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>. Andrew was the chief supporter of Jesus‚Äô policy of utilizing the program of personal work as a means of training the twelve as <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> of the kingdom.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_5">139:1.5</a></small></sup>  Whether Jesus privately taught the <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a> or preached to the multitude, <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> was usually conversant with what was going on; he was an understanding executive and an efficient administrator. He rendered a prompt decision on every matter brought to his notice unless he deemed the problem one beyond the domain of his authority, in which event he would take it straight to Jesus.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_6">139:1.6</a></small></sup>  Andrew and <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> were very unlike in character and temperament, but it must be recorded everlastingly to their credit that they got along together splendidly. Andrew was never jealous of <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Peter</a>‚Äôs oratorical ability. Not often will an older man of Andrew‚Äôs type be observed exerting such a profound influence over a younger and talented brother. Andrew and Peter never seemed to be in the least jealous of each other‚Äôs abilities or achievements. Late on the evening of the day of <a href="/en/topic/Pentecost_(bestowal_of_Spirit_of_Truth)">Pentecost</a>, when, largely through the energetic and inspiring preaching of Peter, two thousand souls were added to the kingdom, Andrew said to his brother: ‚ÄúI could not do that, but I am glad I have a brother who could<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>.‚Äù To which Peter replied: ‚ÄúAnd but for your bringing me to the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and by your steadfastness <i>keeping</i> me with him, I should not have been here to do this.‚Äù Andrew and Peter were the exceptions to the rule, proving that even brothers can live together peaceably and work together effectively.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_7">139:1.7</a></small></sup>  After Pentecost Peter was famous, but it never irritated the older <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> to spend the rest of his life being introduced as ‚Äú<a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> Peter‚Äôs brother<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>.‚Äù</p>

He knew that trouble was brewing in the heart of <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a> even when none of the others suspected that anything was wrong with their treasurer; but he told none of them his fears. Andrew‚Äôs great service to the kingdom was in advising <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a> concerning the choice of <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> missionaries who were sent out to proclaim the gospel, and also in counseling these early leaders about the organization of the administrative affairs of the kingdom. Andrew had a great gift for discovering the hidden resources and latent talents of young people.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_8_46"><a href="#fn_a1_8_46">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_8_60"><a href="#fn_a1_8_60">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_8_18"><a href="#fn_a1_8_18">[10]</a></sup></p>

After Andrew‚Äôs death other copies of this private record were made and circulated freely among the early teachers of the <a href="/en/topic/Christian_church,_early">Christian church</a>. These informal notes of Andrew‚Äôs were subsequently edited, amended, altered, and added to until they made up a fairly consecutive <a href="/en/topic/Urantia_Papers">narrative</a> of the Master‚Äôs life on earth. The last of these few altered and amended copies was destroyed by fire at <a href="/en/topic/Alexandria">Alexandria</a> about one hundred years after the original was written by the first chosen of the twelve apostles.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_9_30"><a href="#fn_a1_9_30">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_9_18"><a href="#fn_a1_9_18">[10]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_9_0"><a href="#fn_s1_9_0">[2]</a></sup></p>

His temperamental handicap was his lack of enthusiasm; he many times failed to encourage his associates by judicious commendation. And this reticence to <a href="/en/topic/praise">praise</a> the worthy accomplishments of his friends grew out of his abhorrence of flattery and insincerity. Andrew was one of those all-round, even-tempered, self-made, and successful men of modest affairs.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_10_18"><a href="#fn_a1_10_18">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_10_61"><a href="#fn_a1_10_61">[11]</a></sup></p>

When men once knew Jesus, they were possessed with the urge to share him with their friends; they really wanted all the world to know him.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_11_12"><a href="#fn_a1_11_12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_11_44"><a href="#fn_a1_11_44">[13]</a></sup></p>

He had grown up permitting himself freely to indulge strong feelings; he was constantly getting into difficulties because he persisted in speaking without thinking. This sort of thoughtlessness also made incessant trouble for all of his friends and associates and was the cause of his receiving many mild rebukes from his Master. The only reason <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> did not get into more trouble because of his thoughtless speaking was that he very early learned to talk over many of his plans and schemes with his brother, <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a>, before he ventured to make public proposals.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_3_6"><a href="#fn_a2_3_6">[17]</a></sup></p>

He asked many questions, more than all the <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a> put together, and while the majority of these questions were good and relevant, many of them were thoughtless and foolish. Peter did not have a deep mind, but he knew his mind fairly well. He was therefore a man of quick decision and sudden action.

But, after all, Jesus knew that Peter‚Äôs faults were of the head and not of the heart. He was one of the most inexplicable combinations of courage and cowardice that ever lived on earth.

<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p3_2">139:3.2</a></small></sup>  This able apostle was a temperamental contradiction; he seemed really to possess two natures, both of which were actuated by strong feelings. He was particularly vehement when his indignation was once fully aroused. He had a fiery temper when once it was adequately provoked, and when the storm was over, he was always wont to justify and excuse his anger under the pretense that it was wholly a manifestation of righteous indignation. Except for these periodic upheavals of wrath, James‚Äôs personality was much like that of Andrew. He did not have Andrew‚Äôs discretion or insight into human nature, but he was a much better public speaker. Next to <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, unless it was <a href="/en/topic/Matthew_Levi">Matthew</a>, James was the best public orator among the twelve.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p3_3">139:3.3</a></small></sup>  Though <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James</a> was in no sense moody, he could be quiet and taciturn one day and a very good talker and <a href="/en/topic/storytelling">storyteller</a> the next. He usually talked freely with <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, but among <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">the twelve</a>, for days at a time he was the silent man. His one great weakness was these spells of unaccountable silence.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p3_4">139:3.4</a></small></sup>  The outstanding feature of James‚Äôs personality was his ability to see all sides of a proposition. Of all the twelve, he came the nearest to grasping the real import and significance of Jesus‚Äô teaching. He, too, was slow at first to comprehend the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>‚Äôs meaning, but ere they had finished their training, he had acquired a <a href="/en/topic/superior_seraphim">superior</a> concept of Jesus‚Äô message. James was able to understand a wide range of human nature; he got along well with the versatile <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a>, the impetuous <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, and his self-contained brother <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p3_5">139:3.5</a></small></sup>  Though <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James</a> and John had their troubles trying to work together, it was inspiring to observe how well they got along. They did not succeed quite so well as Andrew and Peter, but they did much better than would ordinarily be expected of two brothers, especially such headstrong and determined brothers. But, strange as it may seem, these two sons of <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a> were much more tolerant of each other than they were of strangers. They had great affection for one another; they had always been happy playmates. It was these ‚Äú<a href="/en/topic/sons_of_thunder">sons of thunder</a>‚Äù who wanted to call fire down from heaven to destroy the <a href="/en/topic/Samaritans">Samaritans</a> who presumed to show disrespect for their Master<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b24"><a href="#fn_b24">[24]</a></sup>. But the untimely death of <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> greatly modified the vehement temperament of his younger brother John.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_5_16"><a href="#fn_a3_5_16">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p3_6">139:3.6</a></small></sup>  That characteristic of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> which James most admired was the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>‚Äôs sympathetic affection. Jesus‚Äô understanding interest in the small and the great, the rich and the poor, made a great appeal to him.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_6_12"><a href="#fn_a3_6_12">[12]</a></sup></p>

Along with <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a>, he was one of the more level-headed of the apostolic group. He was a vigorous individual but was never in a hurry.

<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p3_8">139:3.8</a></small></sup>  He was modest and undramatic, a daily server, an unpretentious worker, seeking no special reward when he once grasped something of the real meaning of the kingdom. And even in the story about the mother of James and <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a>, who asked that her sons be granted places on the right hand and the left hand of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, it should be remembered that it was the mother who made this request<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b25"><a href="#fn_b25">[25]</a></sup>. And when they signified that they were ready to assume such responsibilities, it should be recognized that they were cognizant of the dangers accompanying the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>‚Äôs supposed revolt against the Roman power, and that they were also willing to pay the price. When Jesus asked if they were ready to drink the cup, they replied that they were<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b26"><a href="#fn_b26">[26]</a></sup>. And as concerns James, it was literally true‚Äîhe did drink the cup with the Master, seeing that he was <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> of the <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a> to experience martyrdom, being early put to death with the sword by <a href="/en/topic/Herod_Agrippa">Herod Agrippa</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b27"><a href="#fn_b27">[27]</a></sup>. James was thus the first of the twelve to sacrifice his life upon the new battle line of the kingdom. <a href="/en/topic/Herod_Antipas">Herod</a> Agrippa feared James above all the other apostles. He was indeed often quiet and silent, but he was brave and determined when his convictions were aroused and challenged.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_8_43"><a href="#fn_a3_8_43">[14]</a></sup></p>

The fact that John was one of the three personal aides of Jesus lent further color to this mistaken idea, not to mention that John, along with his brother James, had known Jesus longer than the others.</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p4_3">139:4.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a> were assigned as personal aides to <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> soon after they became <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a>. Shortly after the selection of the twelve and at the time Jesus appointed <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> to act as director of the group, he said to him: ‚ÄúAnd now I desire that you assign two or three of your associates to be with me and to remain by my side, to comfort me and to minister to my daily needs.‚Äù And Andrew thought best to select for this special duty the next three first-chosen apostles.

His long association with Jesus made many and great changes in his character. This conceit was greatly lessened, but after growing old and becoming more or less childish, this self-esteem reappeared to a certain extent, so that, when engaged in directing <a href="/en/topic/Nathan_of_Cana">Nathan</a> in the writing of the Gospel which now bears his name, the aged apostle did not hesitate repeatedly to refer to himself as the ‚Äúdisciple whom Jesus loved.‚Äù In view of the fact that John came nearer to being the chum of Jesus than any other earth mortal, that he was his chosen personal representative in so many matters, it is not strange that he should have come to regard himself as the ‚Äúdisciple whom Jesus loved‚Äù since he most certainly knew he was the disciple whom Jesus so frequently trusted.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_4_7"><a href="#fn_a4_4_7">[22]</a></sup></p>

His greatest weakness was this characteristic conceit. He was the youngest member of his father‚Äôs family and the youngest of the apostolic group. Perhaps he was just a bit spoiled; maybe he had been humored slightly too much. But the <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John</a> of after years was a very different type of person than the self-admiring and arbitrary young man who joined the ranks of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>‚Äô <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a> when he was twenty-four.</p>

The nickname which the apostles gave him signified ‚Äúcuriosity.‚Äù Philip was always wanting to be shown. He never seemed to see very far into any proposition. He was not necessarily dull, but he lacked imagination. This lack of imagination was the great weakness of his character. He was a commonplace and matter-of-fact individual.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_2_2"><a href="#fn_a5_2_2">[25]</a></sup></p>

And he was a good steward. His strongest characteristic was his methodical thoroughness; he was both mathematical and systematic.</p>
<p id="p5_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p5_4">139:5.4</a></small></sup>  Philip came from a family of seven, three boys and four girls. He was next to the oldest, and after the resurrection he baptized his entire family into the kingdom. Philip‚Äôs people were fisherfolk. His father was a very able man, a deep thinker, but his mother was of a very mediocre family. Philip was not a man who could be expected to do big things, but he was a man who could do little things in a big way, do them well and acceptably. Only a few times in four years did he fail to have food on hand to satisfy the needs of all. Even the many emergency demands attendant upon the life they lived seldom found him unprepared. The commissary department of the apostolic family was intelligently and efficiently managed.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_4_23"><a href="#fn_a5_4_23">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p5_5">139:5.5</a></small></sup>  The strong point about <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a> was his methodical reliability; the weak point in his make-up was his utter lack of imagination, the absence of the ability to put two and two together to obtain four. He was mathematical in the abstract but not constructive in his imagination. He was almost entirely lacking in certain types of imagination. He was the typical everyday and commonplace average man. There were a great many such men and women among the multitudes who came to hear <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> teach and preach, and they derived great comfort from observing one like themselves elevated to an honored position in the councils of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>; they derived courage from the fact that one like themselves had already found a high place in the affairs of the kingdom.

He would not hesitate to interrupt <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> in the midst of one of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>‚Äôs most profound discourses to ask an apparently foolish question. But Jesus never reprimanded him for such thoughtlessness; he was patient with him and considerate of his inability to grasp the deeper meanings of the teaching. Jesus well knew that, if he once rebuked Philip for asking these annoying questions, he would not only wound this honest soul, but such a reprimand would so hurt Philip that he would never again feel free to ask questions. Jesus knew that on his <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_worlds">worlds</a> of space there were untold billions of similar slow-thinking <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a>, and he wanted to encourage them all to look to him and always to feel free to come to him with their questions and problems.

<p id="p7_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p7_2">139:7.2</a></small></sup>  Andrew appointed Matthew the financial representative of the apostles. In a way he was the fiscal agent and publicity spokesman for the apostolic organization. He was a keen <a href="/en/topic/Roman_magistrate_in_Rome">judge</a> of human nature and a very efficient propagandist. His is a personality difficult to visualize, but he was a very earnest disciple and an increasing believer in the mission of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and in the certainty of the kingdom. Jesus never gave Levi a nickname, but his fellow apostles commonly referred to him as the ‚Äúmoney-getter.‚Äù</p>
<p id="p7_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p7_3">139:7.3</a></small></sup>  Levi‚Äôs strong point was his wholehearted devotion to the cause. That he, a publican, had been taken in by Jesus and his <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a> was the cause for overwhelming gratitude on the part of the former revenue collector. However, it required some little time for the rest of the apostles, especially <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Zelotes">Simon Zelotes</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>, to become reconciled to the publican‚Äôs presence in their midst. <a href="/en/topic/Matthew_Levi">Matthew</a>‚Äôs weakness was his shortsighted and materialistic viewpoint of life. But in all these matters he made great progress as the months went by.

He was one of the <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a> who made extensive notes on the sayings of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, and these notes were used as the basis of <a href="/en/topic/Isador">Isador</a>‚Äôs subsequent <a href="/en/topic/Urantia_Papers">narrative</a> of the sayings and doings of Jesus, which has become known as the Gospel according to Matthew.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a7_5_30"><a href="#fn_a7_5_30">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p7_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p7_8">139:7.8</a></small></sup>  Matthew received freely tendered offerings from believing disciples and the immediate auditors of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>‚Äôs teachings, but he never openly solicited funds from the multitudes. He did all his financial work in a quiet and personal way and <a href="/en/topic/fundraising">raised</a> most of the money among the more substantial class of interested believers. He gave practically the whole of his modest fortune to the work of the Master and his apostles, but they never knew of this generosity, save Jesus, who knew all about it. Matthew hesitated openly to contribute to the apostolic funds for fear that Jesus and his associates might regard his money as being tainted; so he gave much in the names of other believers. During the earlier months, when Matthew knew his presence among them was more or less of a trial, he was strongly tempted to let them know that his funds often supplied them with their daily bread, but he did not yield. When evidence of the disdain of the publican would become manifest, Levi would burn to reveal to them his generosity, but always he managed to keep still.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a7_8_58"><a href="#fn_a7_8_58">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p7_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p7_9">139:7.9</a></small></sup>  When the funds for the week were short of the estimated requirements, Levi would often draw heavily upon his own personal resources. Also, sometimes when he became greatly interested in <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>‚Äô teaching, he preferred to remain and hear the instruction, even though he knew he must personally make up for his failure to solicit the necessary funds. But Levi did so wish that Jesus might know that much of the money came from his pocket! He little realized that the Master knew all about it. The <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a> all died without knowing that <a href="/en/topic/Matthew_Levi">Matthew</a> was their benefactor to such an extent that, when he went forth to proclaim the gospel of the kingdom after the beginning of the persecutions, he was practically penniless.</p>
<p id="p7_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p7_10">139:7.10</a></small></sup>  When these persecutions caused the believers to forsake <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, Matthew journeyed north, preaching the gospel of the kingdom and baptizing believers.

He grew up having a very disagreeable and quarrelsome disposition. Even <a href="/en/topic/Claudia_Procula">his wife</a> was glad to see him join the <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a>; she was relieved by the thought that her pessimistic husband would be away from home most of the time.

They found he was superbly honest and unflinchingly loyal. He was perfectly sincere and unquestionably truthful, but he was a natural-born faultfinder and had grown up to become a real pessimist. His analytical mind had become cursed with suspicion. He was rapidly losing faith in his fellow men when he became associated with the twelve and thus came in contact with the noble character of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. This association with the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> began at once to transform Thomas‚Äôs whole disposition and to effect great changes in his mental reactions to his fellow men.</p>
<p id="p8_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p8_4">139:8.4</a></small></sup>  Thomas‚Äôs great strength was his superb analytical mind coupled with his unflinching courage‚Äîwhen he had once made up his mind.

<p id="p8_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p8_5">139:8.5</a></small></sup>  In the organization of the twelve <a href="/en/topic/Thomas_Didymus">Thomas</a> was assigned to arrange and manage the itinerary, and he was an able director of the work and movements of the apostolic corps.

<p id="p8_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p8_6">139:8.6</a></small></sup>  Jesus enjoyed Thomas very much and had many long, personal talks with him. His presence among the apostles was a great comfort to all honest doubters and encouraged many troubled minds to come into the kingdom, even if they could not wholly understand everything about the spiritual and philosophic phases of the teachings of Jesus.

Again and again would he stand out against some project as being foolhardy and presumptuous; he would debate to the bitter end, but when <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> would put the proposition to a vote, and after the twelve would elect to do that which he had so strenuously opposed, Thomas was the first to say, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go!‚Äù He was a good loser<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b53"><a href="#fn_b53">[53]</a></sup>.

<p id="p12_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_2">139:12.2</a></small></sup>  When Nathaniel met Judas at <a href="/en/topic/Tarichea">Tarichea</a>, he was seeking employment with a fish-drying enterprise at the lower end of the <a href="/en/topic/Sea_of_Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a>. He was thirty years of age and unmarried when he joined the apostles. He was probably the best-educated man among the twelve and the only Judean in the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>‚Äôs apostolic family. Judas had no outstanding trait of personal strength, though he had many outwardly appearing traits of culture and habits of training. He was a good thinker but not always a truly <i>honest</i> thinker. Judas did not really understand himself; he was not really sincere in dealing with himself.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a12_2_31"><a href="#fn_a12_2_31">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a12_2_40"><a href="#fn_a12_2_40">[61]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p12_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_3">139:12.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> appointed <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas</a> treasurer of <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">the twelve</a>, a position which he was eminently fitted to hold, and up to the time of the betrayal of his Master he discharged the responsibilities of his office honestly, faithfully, and most efficiently.</p>
<p id="p12_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_4">139:12.4</a></small></sup>  There was no special trait about <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> which Judas admired above the generally attractive and exquisitely charming personality of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>. Judas was never able to rise above his Judean prejudices against his Galilean associates; he would even criticize in his mind many things about Jesus. Him whom eleven of the apostles looked upon as the perfect man, as the ‚Äúone altogether lovely and the chiefest among ten thousand,‚Äù this self-satisfied Judean often dared to criticize in his own heart<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b66"><a href="#fn_b66">[66]</a></sup>. He really entertained the notion that Jesus was timid and somewhat afraid to assert his own power and authority.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a12_4_12"><a href="#fn_a12_4_12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p12_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_5">139:12.5</a></small></sup>  Judas was a good business man. It required tact, ability, and patience, as well as painstaking devotion, to manage the financial affairs of such an idealist as Jesus, to say nothing of wrestling with the helter-skelter business methods of some of his <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a>. Judas really was a great executive, a farseeing and able financier. And he was a stickler for organization. None of the twelve ever criticized Judas. As far as they could see, <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a> was a matchless treasurer, a learned man, a loyal (though sometimes critical) apostle, and in every sense of the word a great success. The apostles loved Judas; he was really one of them. He must have <i>believed</i> in Jesus, but we doubt whether he really <i>loved</i> the Master with a whole heart<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b67"><a href="#fn_b67">[67]</a></sup>. The case of Judas illustrates the truthfulness of that saying: ‚ÄúThere is a <a href="/en/topic/way">way</a> that seems right to a man, but the end thereof is death.‚Äù It is altogether possible to fall victim to the peaceful deception of pleasant adjustment to the paths of <a href="/en/topic/sin">sin</a> and death. Be assured that Judas was always financially loyal to his Master and his fellow apostles. Money could never have been the motive for his <a href="/en/topic/betrayal">betrayal</a> of the Master.</p>
<p id="p12_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_6">139:12.6</a></small></sup>  Judas was an only son of unwise parents. When very young, he was pampered and petted; he was a spoiled child. As he grew up, he had exaggerated ideas about his <a href="/en/topic/self-importance">self-importance</a>. He was a poor loser. He had loose and distorted ideas about fairness; he was given to the indulgence of <a href="/en/topic/hatred">hate</a> and <a href="/en/topic/suspicion">suspicion</a>. He was an expert at misinterpretation of the words and acts of his friends. All through his life Judas had cultivated the habit of getting even with those whom he fancied had mistreated him. His sense of values and loyalties was defective.</p>
<p id="p12_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_7">139:12.7</a></small></sup>  To <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas</a> was a <a href="/en/topic/faith">faith</a> adventure. From the beginning the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> fully understood the weakness of this <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostle</a> and well knew the dangers of admitting him to fellowship. But it is the nature of the <a href="/en/topic/Sons_of_God">Sons of God</a> to give every created being a full and equal chance for salvation and <a href="/en/topic/survival_(of_mortal_death)">survival</a>. Jesus wanted not only the <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of this world but the onlookers of innumerable other <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_worlds">worlds</a> to know that, when doubts exist as to the sincerity and wholeheartedness of a creature‚Äôs devotion to the kingdom, it is the invariable practice of the <a href="/en/topic/Judges_(Old_Testament)">Judges</a> of men fully to receive the doubtful candidate. The door of eternal life is wide open to all; ‚Äúwhosoever will may come‚Äù; there are no restrictions or qualifications save the <i>faith</i> of the one who comes<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b68"><a href="#fn_b68">[68]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a12_7_27"><a href="#fn_a12_7_27">[62]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a12_7_64"><a href="#fn_a12_7_64">[63]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a12_7_5"><a href="#fn_a12_7_5">[64]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s12_7_5"><a href="#fn_s12_7_5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s12_7_1"><a href="#fn_s12_7_1">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p12_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_8">139:12.8</a></small></sup>  This is just the reason why Jesus permitted Judas to go on to the very end, always doing everything possible to transform and save this weak and confused apostle. But when <a href="/en/topic/light">light</a> is not honestly received and lived up to, it tends to become darkness within the soul. Judas grew intellectually regarding Jesus‚Äô teachings about the kingdom, but he did not make progress in the acquirement of spiritual character as did the other apostles. He failed to make satisfactory personal progress in spiritual experience.</p>
<p id="p12_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_9">139:12.9</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas</a> became increasingly a brooder over personal disappointment, and finally he became a victim of <a href="/en/topic/resentment">resentment</a>. His feelings had been many times hurt, and he grew abnormally suspicious of his best friends, even of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>. Presently he became obsessed with the idea of getting even, anything to avenge himself, yes, even betrayal of his associates and his Master.</p>
<p id="p12_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_10">139:12.10</a></small></sup>  But these wicked and dangerous ideas did not take definite shape until the day when a grateful woman broke an expensive box of incense at <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>‚Äô feet<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b69"><a href="#fn_b69">[69]</a></sup>. This seemed wasteful to Judas, and when his public protest was so sweepingly disallowed by Jesus right there in the hearing of all, it was too much. That event determined the mobilization of all the accumulated hate, hurt, malice, prejudice, jealousy, and revenge of a lifetime, and he made up his mind to get even with he knew not whom; but he crystallized all the evil of his nature upon the <i>one</i> innocent person in all the sordid drama of his unfortunate life just because Jesus happened to be the chief actor in the episode which marked his passing from the progressive kingdom of light into that self-chosen domain of darkness.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a12_10_5"><a href="#fn_a12_10_5">[64]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p12_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_11">139:12.11</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> many times, both privately and publicly, had warned <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas</a> that he was slipping, but divine <a href="/en/topic/warnings">warnings</a> are usually useless in dealing with embittered human nature. Jesus did everything possible, consistent with man‚Äôs moral freedom, to prevent Judas‚Äôs choosing to go the wrong way. The great test finally came. The son of resentment failed; he yielded to the sour and sordid dictates of a proud and vengeful mind of exaggerated self-importance and swiftly plunged on down into confusion, despair, and depravity.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a12_11_5"><a href="#fn_a12_11_5">[64]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a12_11_50"><a href="#fn_a12_11_50">[65]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p12_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_12">139:12.12</a></small></sup>  Judas then entered into the base and shameful intrigue to betray his Lord and Master and quickly carried the nefarious scheme into effect<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b70"><a href="#fn_b70">[70]</a></sup>. During the outworking of his anger-conceived plans of traitorous <a href="/en/topic/betrayal">betrayal</a>, he experienced moments of regret and shame, and in these lucid intervals he faintheartedly conceived, as a defense in his own mind, the idea that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> might possibly exert his power and deliver himself at <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> moment.</p>
<p id="p12_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_13">139:12.13</a></small></sup>  When the sordid and sinful business was all over, this renegade mortal, who thought lightly of selling his friend for thirty pieces of silver to satisfy his long-nursed craving for revenge, rushed out and committed the final act in the drama of fleeing from the realities of mortal existence‚Äî<a href="/en/topic/suicide">suicide</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b71"><a href="#fn_b71">[71]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a12_13_15"><a href="#fn_a12_13_15">[66]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p12_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_14">139:12.14</a></small></sup>  The eleven <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a> were horrified, stunned. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> regarded the betrayer only with pity. The <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_worlds">worlds</a> have found it difficult to forgive <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas</a>, and his name has become eschewed throughout a far-flung universe.</p>
