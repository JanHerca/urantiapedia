<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p0_2">139:0.2</a></small></sup>  The apostles learned from Jesus about the kingdom of heaven, and Jesus learned much from them about the kingdom of men, human nature as it lives on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> and on the other evolutionary worlds of time and space. These twelve men represented many different types of human temperament, and they had not been made <i>alike</i> by schooling. Many of these Galilean fishermen carried heavy strains of gentile blood as a result of the forcible conversion of the gentile population of <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> one hundred years previously.</p>

<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_2">139:1.2</a></small></sup>  In A.D. 26, the year he was chosen as an apostle, Andrew was 33, a full year older than <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the oldest of the apostles. He sprang from an excellent line of ancestors and was the ablest man of the twelve. Excepting oratory, he was the peer of his associates in almost every imaginable ability. Jesus never gave Andrew a nickname, a fraternal designation. But even as the apostles soon began to call Jesus <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, so they also designated Andrew by a term the equivalent of Chief.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_35"><a href="#fn_a1_2_35">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_3">139:1.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> was a good organizer but a better administrator. He was one of the inner circle of four apostles, but his appointment by Jesus as the head of the apostolic group made it necessary for him to remain on duty with his brethren while the other three enjoyed very close communion with the Master. To the very end Andrew remained dean of the apostolic corps.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_4">139:1.4</a></small></sup>  Although Andrew was never an effective preacher, he was an efficient personal worker, being the pioneer missionary of the kingdom in that, as <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> chosen apostle, he immediately brought to <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> his brother, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a>, who subsequently became one of the greatest preachers of the kingdom<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>. Andrew was the chief supporter of Jesus’ policy of utilizing the program of personal work as a means of training the twelve as <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> of the kingdom.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_5">139:1.5</a></small></sup>  Whether Jesus privately taught the apostles or preached to the multitude, <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> was usually conversant with what was going on; he was an understanding executive and an efficient administrator. He rendered a prompt decision on every matter brought to his notice unless he deemed the problem one beyond the domain of his authority, in which event he would take it straight to Jesus.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_6">139:1.6</a></small></sup>  Andrew and <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> were very unlike in character and temperament, but it must be recorded everlastingly to their credit that they got along together splendidly. Andrew was never jealous of <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Peter</a>’s oratorical ability. Not often will an older man of Andrew’s type be observed exerting such a profound influence over a younger and talented brother. Andrew and Peter never seemed to be in the least jealous of each other’s abilities or achievements. Late on the evening of the day of <a href="/en/topic/Pentecost_(bestowal_of_Spirit_of_Truth)">Pentecost</a>, when, largely through the energetic and inspiring preaching of Peter, two thousand souls were added to the kingdom, Andrew said to his brother: “I could not do that, but I am glad I have a brother who could<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>.” To which Peter replied: “And but for your bringing me to the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and by your steadfastness <i>keeping</i> me with him, I should not have been here to do this.” Andrew and Peter were the exceptions to the rule, proving that even brothers can live together peaceably and work together effectively.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_7">139:1.7</a></small></sup>  After Pentecost Peter was famous, but it never irritated the older <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> to spend the rest of his life being introduced as “<a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> Peter’s brother<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_8">139:1.8</a></small></sup>  Of all the apostles, Andrew was the best <a href="/en/topic/Roman_magistrate_in_Rome">judge</a> of men. He knew that trouble was brewing in the heart of <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a> even when none of the others suspected that anything was wrong with their treasurer; but he told none of them his fears. Andrew’s great service to the kingdom was in advising <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>, and John concerning the choice of <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> missionaries who were sent out to proclaim the gospel, and also in counseling these early leaders about the organization of the administrative affairs of the kingdom. Andrew had a great gift for discovering the hidden resources and latent talents of young people.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_8_28"><a href="#fn_a1_8_28">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_8_36"><a href="#fn_a1_8_36">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_9">139:1.9</a></small></sup>  Very soon after <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ ascension on high, <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> began the writing of a personal record of many of the sayings and doings of his departed <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>. After Andrew’s death other copies of this private record were made and circulated freely among the early teachers of the Christian church. These informal notes of Andrew’s were subsequently edited, amended, altered, and added to until they made up a fairly consecutive narrative of the Master’s life on earth. The last of these few altered and amended copies was destroyed by fire at <a href="/en/topic/Alexandria">Alexandria</a> about one hundred years after the original was written by the first chosen of the twelve apostles.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_9_0"><a href="#fn_s1_9_0">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_10">139:1.10</a></small></sup>  Andrew was a man of clear insight, logical thought, and firm decision, whose great strength of character consisted in his superb stability. His temperamental handicap was his lack of enthusiasm; he many times failed to encourage his associates by judicious commendation. And this reticence to <a href="/en/topic/praise">praise</a> the worthy accomplishments of his friends grew out of his abhorrence of flattery and insincerity. Andrew was one of those all-round, even-tempered, self-made, and successful men of modest affairs.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_10_37"><a href="#fn_a1_10_37">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_11">139:1.11</a></small></sup>  Every one of the apostles loved <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, but it remains true that each of the twelve was drawn toward him because of some certain trait of personality which made a special appeal to the individual apostle. <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> admired Jesus because of his consistent sincerity, his unaffected dignity. When men once knew Jesus, they were possessed with the urge to share him with their friends; they really wanted all the world to know him.</p>
<p id="p1_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_12">139:1.12</a></small></sup>  When the later persecutions finally scattered the apostles from <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, Andrew journeyed through <a href="/en/topic/Armenia">Armenia</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Asia_Minor">Asia Minor</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Macedonia">Macedonia</a> and, after bringing many thousands into the kingdom, was finally apprehended and <a href="/en/topic/crucifixion">crucified</a> in <a href="/en/topic/Patrae">Patrae</a> in <a href="/en/topic/Achaia">Achaia</a>. It was two full days before this robust man expired on the cross, and throughout these tragic hours he continued effectively to proclaim the glad tidings of the salvation of the kingdom of heaven.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_12_27"><a href="#fn_a1_12_27">[8]</a></sup></p>

Simon was well known to all his friends as an erratic and impulsive fellow.

<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p2_3">139:2.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a> was a man of impulse, an optimist. He had grown up permitting himself freely to indulge strong feelings; he was constantly getting into difficulties because he persisted in speaking without thinking. This sort of thoughtlessness also made incessant trouble for all of his friends and associates and was the cause of his receiving many mild rebukes from his Master. The only reason <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> did not get into more trouble because of his thoughtless speaking was that he very early learned to talk over many of his plans and schemes with his brother, <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a>, before he ventured to make public proposals.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_3_6"><a href="#fn_a2_3_6">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p2_4">139:2.4</a></small></sup>  Peter was a fluent speaker, eloquent and dramatic. He was also a natural and inspirational leader of men, a quick thinker but not a deep reasoner. He asked many questions, more than all the apostles put together, and while the majority of these questions were good and relevant, many of them were thoughtless and foolish. Peter did not have a deep mind, but he knew his mind fairly well. He was therefore a man of quick decision and sudden action. While others talked in their astonishment at seeing <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> on the beach, Peter jumped in and swam ashore to meet the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b14"><a href="#fn_b14">[14]</a></sup>.</p>

He never forgot the lesson about forgiving the wrongdoer, not only seven times but seventy times and seven. He thought much about these impressions of the Master’s forgiving character during those dark and dismal days immediately following his thoughtless and unintended denial of Jesus in the high priest’s courtyard<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b16"><a href="#fn_b16">[16]</a></sup>.</p>

First he refused to let <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> wash his feet and then, on hearing the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s reply, begged to be washed all over. But, after all, Jesus knew that Peter’s faults were of the head and not of the heart. He was one of the most inexplicable combinations of courage and cowardice that ever lived on earth. His great strength of character was loyalty, friendship. Peter really and truly loved Jesus<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b18"><a href="#fn_b18">[18]</a></sup>. And yet despite this towering strength of devotion he was so unstable and inconstant that he permitted a servant girl to tease him into denying his Lord and Master. Peter could withstand persecution and any other form of direct assault, but he withered and shrank before <a href="/en/topic/ridicule">ridicule</a>.

<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p3_2">139:3.2</a></small></sup>  This able apostle was a temperamental contradiction; he seemed really to possess two natures, both of which were actuated by strong feelings. He was particularly vehement when his indignation was once fully aroused. He had a fiery temper when once it was adequately provoked, and when the storm was over, he was always wont to justify and excuse his anger under the pretense that it was wholly a manifestation of righteous indignation. Except for these periodic upheavals of wrath, James’s personality was much like that of Andrew. He did not have Andrew’s discretion or insight into human nature, but he was a much better public speaker. Next to <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, unless it was Matthew, James was the best public orator among the twelve.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p3_3">139:3.3</a></small></sup>  Though <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> was in no sense moody, he could be quiet and taciturn one day and a very good talker and storyteller the next. He usually talked freely with <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, but among the twelve, for days at a time he was the silent man. His one great weakness was these spells of unaccountable silence.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p3_4">139:3.4</a></small></sup>  The outstanding feature of James’s personality was his ability to see all sides of a proposition. Of all the twelve, he came the nearest to grasping the real import and significance of Jesus’ teaching. He, too, was slow at first to comprehend the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s meaning, but ere they had finished their training, he had acquired a superior concept of Jesus’ message. James was able to understand a wide range of human nature; he got along well with the versatile <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a>, the impetuous <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, and his self-contained brother John.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p3_5">139:3.5</a></small></sup>  Though <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> and John had their troubles trying to work together, it was inspiring to observe how well they got along. They did not succeed quite so well as Andrew and Peter, but they did much better than would ordinarily be expected of two brothers, especially such headstrong and determined brothers. But, strange as it may seem, these two sons of <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a> were much more tolerant of each other than they were of strangers. They had great affection for one another; they had always been happy playmates. It was these “<a href="/en/topic/sons_of_thunder">sons of thunder</a>” who wanted to call fire down from heaven to destroy the <a href="/en/topic/Samaritans">Samaritans</a> who presumed to show disrespect for their Master<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b24"><a href="#fn_b24">[24]</a></sup>.

<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p3_6">139:3.6</a></small></sup>  That characteristic of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> which James most admired was the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s sympathetic affection. Jesus’ understanding interest in the small and the great, the rich and the poor, made a great appeal to him.</p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p3_7">139:3.7</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James Zebedee</a> was a well-balanced thinker and planner. Along with <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a>, he was one of the more level-headed of the apostolic group. He was a vigorous individual but was never in a hurry. He was an excellent balance wheel for <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p3_8">139:3.8</a></small></sup>  He was modest and undramatic, a daily server, an unpretentious worker, seeking no special reward when he once grasped something of the real meaning of the kingdom. And even in the <a href="/en/topic/Genesis,_Book_of">story</a> about the mother of James and John, who asked that her sons be granted places on the right hand and the left hand of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, it should be remembered that it was the mother who made this request<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b25"><a href="#fn_b25">[25]</a></sup>. And when they signified that they were ready to assume such responsibilities, it should be recognized that they were cognizant of the dangers accompanying the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s supposed revolt against the Roman power, and that they were also willing to pay the price. When Jesus asked if they were ready to drink the cup, they replied that they were<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b26"><a href="#fn_b26">[26]</a></sup>. And as concerns James, it was literally true—he did drink the cup with the Master, seeing that he was <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> of the apostles to experience martyrdom, being early put to death with the sword by <a href="/en/topic/Herod_Agrippa">Herod Agrippa</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b27"><a href="#fn_b27">[27]</a></sup>. James was thus the first of the twelve to sacrifice his life upon the new battle line of the kingdom. Herod Agrippa feared James above all the other apostles. He was indeed often quiet and silent, but he was brave and determined when his convictions were aroused and challenged.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_8_27"><a href="#fn_a3_8_27">[8]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p4_2">139:4.2</a></small></sup>  Since John was the youngest of the twelve and so closely associated with Jesus in his family affairs, he was very dear to the Master, but it cannot be truthfully said that he was “the disciple whom Jesus loved<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b29"><a href="#fn_b29">[29]</a></sup>.” You would hardly suspect such a magnanimous personality as Jesus to be guilty of showing favoritism, of loving one of his apostles more than the others. The fact that John was one of the three personal aides of Jesus lent further color to this mistaken idea, not to mention that John, along with his brother James, had known Jesus longer than the others.</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p4_3">139:4.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>, and John were assigned as personal aides to <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> soon after they became apostles. Shortly after the selection of the twelve and at the time Jesus appointed <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> to act as director of the group, he said to him: “And now I desire that you assign two or three of your associates to be with me and to remain by my side, to comfort me and to minister to my daily needs.” And Andrew thought best to select for this special duty the next three first-chosen apostles. He would have liked to volunteer for such a blessed service himself, but the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> had already given him his commission; so he immediately directed that <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Peter</a>, James, and John attach themselves to Jesus.</p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p4_4">139:4.4</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John Zebedee</a> had many lovely traits of character, but one which was not so lovely was his inordinate but usually well-concealed conceit. His long association with Jesus made many and great changes in his character. This conceit was greatly lessened, but after growing old and becoming more or less childish, this self-esteem reappeared to a certain extent, so that, when engaged in directing <a href="/en/topic/Nathan_of_Cana">Nathan</a> in the writing of the Gospel which now bears his name, the aged apostle did not hesitate repeatedly to refer to himself as the “disciple whom Jesus loved.” In view of the fact that John came nearer to being the chum of Jesus than any other earth mortal, that he was his chosen personal representative in so many matters, it is not strange that he should have come to regard himself as the “disciple whom Jesus loved” since he most certainly knew he was the disciple whom Jesus so frequently trusted.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_4_7"><a href="#fn_a4_4_7">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p4_5">139:4.5</a></small></sup>  The strongest trait in John’s character was his dependability; he was prompt and courageous, faithful and devoted. His greatest weakness was this characteristic conceit. He was the youngest member of his father’s family and the youngest of the apostolic group. Perhaps he was just a bit spoiled; maybe he had been humored slightly too much. But the John of after years was a very different type of person than the self-admiring and arbitrary young man who joined the ranks of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ apostles when he was twenty-four.</p>
<p id="p4_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p4_6">139:4.6</a></small></sup>  Those characteristics of Jesus which John most appreciated were the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s love and unselfishness; these traits made such an impression on him that his whole subsequent life became dominated by the sentiment of love and brotherly devotion. He talked about love and wrote about love. This “son of <a href="/en/topic/thunder">thunder</a>” became the “apostle of love”; and at <a href="/en/topic/Ephesus">Ephesus</a>, when the aged bishop was no longer able to stand in the pulpit and preach but had to be carried to church in a chair, and when at the close of the service he was asked to say a few words to the believers, for years his only utterance was, “My little children, love one another<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b30"><a href="#fn_b30">[30]</a></sup>.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b31"><a href="#fn_b31">[31]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_6_17"><a href="#fn_a4_6_17">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_6_26"><a href="#fn_a4_6_26">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p4_7">139:4.7</a></small></sup>  John was a man of few words except when his temper was aroused. He thought much but said little. As he grew older, his temper became more subdued, better controlled, but he never overcame his disinclination to talk; he never fully mastered this reticence. But he was gifted with a remarkable and creative imagination.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_7_2"><a href="#fn_a4_7_2">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p4_8">139:4.8</a></small></sup>  There was another side to John that one would not expect to find in this quiet and introspective type. He was somewhat bigoted and inordinately intolerant. In this respect he and <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> were much alike—they both wanted to call down fire from heaven on the heads of the disrespectful <a href="/en/topic/Samaritans">Samaritans</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b32"><a href="#fn_b32">[32]</a></sup>.

<p id="p4_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p4_9">139:4.9</a></small></sup>  John’s life was tremendously influenced by the sight of Jesus’ going about without a home as he knew how faithfully he had made provision for the care of his mother and family. John also deeply sympathized with Jesus because of his family’s failure to understand him, being aware that they were gradually withdrawing from him. This entire situation, together with Jesus’ ever deferring his slightest wish to the will of the Father in heaven and his daily life of implicit trust, made such a profound impression on John that it produced marked and permanent changes in his character, changes which manifested themselves throughout his entire subsequent life.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_9_14"><a href="#fn_a4_9_14">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_9_21"><a href="#fn_a4_9_21">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_9_32"><a href="#fn_a4_9_32">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_9_33"><a href="#fn_a4_9_33">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_9_30"><a href="#fn_a4_9_30">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p4_10">139:4.10</a></small></sup>  John had a cool and daring courage which few of the other apostles possessed. He was the one apostle who followed right along with <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> the night of his arrest and dared to accompany his <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> into the very jaws of death.

One thing is certain, John was thoroughly dependable. John usually sat on Jesus’ right hand when the twelve were at meat. He was <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> of the twelve really and fully to believe in the resurrection, and he was the first to recognize the Master when he came to them on the seashore after his resurrection<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b35"><a href="#fn_b35">[35]</a></sup>.</p>

<p id="p4_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p4_13">139:4.13</a></small></sup>  John was in prison several times and was banished to the <a href="/en/topic/Isle_of_Patmos">Isle of Patmos</a> for a period of four years until another emperor came to power in <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b36"><a href="#fn_b36">[36]</a></sup>. Had not John been tactful and sagacious, he would undoubtedly have been killed as was his more outspoken brother James. As the years passed, John, together with James the Lord’s brother, learned to practice wise conciliation when they appeared before the civil magistrates.

The nickname which the apostles gave him signified “curiosity.” Philip was always wanting to be shown. He never seemed to see very far into any proposition. He was not necessarily dull, but he lacked imagination. This lack of imagination was the great weakness of his character. He was a commonplace and matter-of-fact individual.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_2_2"><a href="#fn_a5_2_2">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p5_3">139:5.3</a></small></sup>  When the apostles were organized for service, <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a> was made steward; it was his duty to see that they were at all times supplied with provisions. And he was a good steward. His strongest characteristic was his methodical thoroughness; he was both mathematical and systematic.</p>
<p id="p5_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p5_4">139:5.4</a></small></sup>  Philip came from a family of seven, three boys and four girls. He was next to the oldest, and after the resurrection he baptized his entire family into the kingdom. Philip’s people were fisherfolk. His father was a very able man, a deep thinker, but his mother was of a very mediocre family. Philip was not a man who could be expected to do big things, but he was a man who could do little things in a big way, do them well and acceptably. Only a few times in four years did he fail to have food on hand to satisfy the needs of all. Even the many emergency demands attendant upon the life they lived seldom found him unprepared. The commissary department of the apostolic family was intelligently and efficiently managed.</p>
<p id="p5_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p5_5">139:5.5</a></small></sup>  The strong point about <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a> was his methodical reliability; the weak point in his make-up was his utter lack of imagination, the absence of the ability to put two and two together to obtain four. He was mathematical in the abstract but not constructive in his imagination. He was almost entirely lacking in certain types of imagination. He was the typical everyday and commonplace average man. There were a great many such men and women among the multitudes who came to hear <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> teach and preach, and they derived great comfort from observing one like themselves elevated to an honored position in the councils of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>; they derived courage from the fact that one like themselves had already found a high place in the affairs of the kingdom. And Jesus learned much about the way some human minds function as he so patiently listened to <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Tetrarch)">Philip</a>’s foolish questions and so many times complied with his steward’s request to “be shown.”</p>
<p id="p5_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p5_6">139:5.6</a></small></sup>  The one quality about Jesus which Philip so continuously admired was the Master’s unfailing generosity. Never could Philip find anything in Jesus which was small, niggardly, or stingy, and he worshiped this ever-present and unfailing liberality.</p>
<p id="p5_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p5_7">139:5.7</a></small></sup>  There was little about <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a>’s personality that was impressive. He was often spoken of as “<a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Tetrarch)">Philip</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a>, the town where <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> live<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b39"><a href="#fn_b39">[39]</a></sup>.” He was almost without discerning vision; he was unable to grasp the dramatic possibilities of a given situation. He was not pessimistic; he was simply prosaic. He was also greatly lacking in spiritual insight. He would not hesitate to interrupt <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> in the midst of one of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s most profound discourses to ask an apparently foolish question. But Jesus never reprimanded him for such thoughtlessness; he was patient with him and considerate of his inability to grasp the deeper meanings of the teaching. Jesus well knew that, if he once rebuked Philip for asking these annoying questions, he would not only wound this honest soul, but such a reprimand would so hurt Philip that he would never again feel free to ask questions. Jesus knew that on his worlds of space there were untold billions of similar slow-thinking <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a>, and he wanted to encourage them all to look to him and always to feel free to come to him with their questions and problems. After all, Jesus was really more interested in Philip’s foolish questions than in the sermon he might be preaching. Jesus was supremely interested in <i>men,</i> all kinds of men.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_7_9"><a href="#fn_a5_7_9">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p5_8">139:5.8</a></small></sup>  The apostolic steward was not a good public speaker, but he was a very persuasive and successful personal worker. He was not easily discouraged; he was a plodder and very tenacious in anything he undertook. He had that great and rare gift of saying, “Come.” When his first convert, <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a>, wanted to argue about the merits and demerits of Jesus and <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, Philip’s effective reply was, “Come and see<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b40"><a href="#fn_b40">[40]</a></sup>.” He was not a dogmatic preacher who exhorted his hearers to “Go”—do this and do that. He met all situations as they arose in his work with “Come”—“come with me; I will show you the way.” And that is always the effective technique in all forms and phases of teaching. Even parents may learn from Philip the better way of saying to their children <i>not</i> “Go do this and go do that,” but rather, “Come with us while we show and share with you the better way.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_8_23"><a href="#fn_a5_8_23">[24]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p6_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p6_2">139:6.2</a></small></sup>  When Nathaniel joined the apostles, he was twenty-five years old and was the next to the youngest of the group. He was the youngest of a family of seven, was unmarried, and the only support of aged and infirm parents, with whom he lived at <a href="/en/topic/Cana">Cana</a>; his brothers and sister were either married or deceased, and none lived there<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b45"><a href="#fn_b45">[45]</a></sup>.

<p id="p6_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p6_3">139:6.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> did not himself give <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a> a nickname, but the twelve soon began to speak of him in terms that signified honesty, sincerity.

The weakness of his character was his <a href="/en/topic/pride">pride</a>; he was very proud of his family, his city, his reputation, and his nation, all of which is commendable if it is not carried too far. But <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_the_Pharisee">Nathaniel</a> was inclined to go to extremes with his personal prejudices.

He was not slow to ask the question, even before he had met Jesus, “Can any good thing come out of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>?” But Nathaniel was not obstinate, even if he was proud. He was quick to reverse himself when he once looked into Jesus’ face.</p>
<p id="p6_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p6_4">139:6.4</a></small></sup>  In many respects Nathaniel was the odd genius of the twelve. He was the apostolic philosopher and dreamer, but he was a very practical sort of dreamer. He alternated between seasons of profound philosophy and periods of rare and droll humor; when in the proper mood, he was probably the best storyteller among the twelve. Jesus greatly enjoyed hearing Nathaniel discourse on things both serious and frivolous. Nathaniel progressively took Jesus and the kingdom more seriously, but never did he take himself seriously.</p>
<p id="p6_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p6_5">139:6.5</a></small></sup>  The apostles all loved and respected <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a>, and he got along with them splendidly, excepting <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>.

<p id="p7_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p7_2">139:7.2</a></small></sup>  Andrew appointed Matthew the financial representative of the apostles.

His is a personality difficult to visualize, but he was a very earnest disciple and an increasing believer in the mission of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and in the certainty of the kingdom.

<p id="p7_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p7_3">139:7.3</a></small></sup>  Levi’s strong point was his wholehearted devotion to the cause.

<p id="p7_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p7_6">139:7.6</a></small></sup>  The great and useful life of Matthew, the business man and customs collector of <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, has been the means of leading thousands upon thousands of other business men, public officials, and politicians, down through the subsequent ages, also to hear that engaging voice of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> saying, “Follow me<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b51"><a href="#fn_b51">[51]</a></sup>.” Matthew really was a shrewd politician, but he was intensely loyal to Jesus and supremely devoted to the task of seeing that the <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> of the coming kingdom were adequately financed.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a7_6_39"><a href="#fn_a7_6_39">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p7_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p7_7">139:7.7</a></small></sup>  The presence of Matthew among the twelve was the means of keeping the doors of the kingdom wide open to hosts of downhearted and outcast souls who had regarded themselves as long since without the bounds of religious consolation. Outcast and despairing men and women flocked to hear <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, and he never turned one away.</p>
<p id="p7_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p7_8">139:7.8</a></small></sup>  Matthew received freely tendered offerings from believing disciples and the immediate auditors of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s teachings, but he never openly solicited funds from the multitudes. He did all his financial work in a quiet and personal way and raised most of the money among the more substantial class of interested believers. He gave practically the whole of his modest fortune to the work of the Master and his apostles, but they never knew of this generosity, save Jesus, who knew all about it. Matthew hesitated openly to contribute to the apostolic funds for fear that Jesus and his associates might regard his money as being tainted; so he gave much in the names of other believers. During the earlier months, when Matthew knew his presence among them was more or less of a trial, he was strongly tempted to let them know that his funds often supplied them with their daily bread, but he did not yield. When evidence of the disdain of the publican would become manifest, Levi would burn to reveal to them his generosity, but always he managed to keep still.</p>
<p id="p7_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p7_9">139:7.9</a></small></sup>  When the funds for the week were short of the estimated requirements, Levi would often draw heavily upon his own personal resources. Also, sometimes when he became greatly interested in <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ teaching, he preferred to remain and hear the instruction, even though he knew he must personally make up for his failure to solicit the necessary funds. But Levi did so wish that Jesus might know that much of the money came from his pocket! He little realized that the Master knew all about it. The apostles all died without knowing that Matthew was their benefactor to such an extent that, when he went forth to proclaim the gospel of the kingdom after the beginning of the persecutions, he was practically penniless.</p>
<p id="p7_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p7_10">139:7.10</a></small></sup>  When these persecutions caused the believers to forsake <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, Matthew journeyed north, preaching the gospel of the kingdom and baptizing believers.

<p id="p8_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p8_2">139:8.2</a></small></sup>  When Thomas joined the apostles, he was twenty-nine years old, was married, and had four children. Formerly he had been a carpenter and <a href="/en/topic/Aaron_the_stone_mason">stone mason</a>, but latterly he had become a fisherman and resided at <a href="/en/topic/Tarichea">Tarichea</a>, situated on the west bank of the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> where it flows out of the <a href="/en/topic/Sea_of_Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a>, and he was regarded as the leading citizen of this little village. He had little education, but he possessed a keen, reasoning mind and was the son of excellent parents, who lived at <a href="/en/topic/Tiberias">Tiberias</a>. Thomas had the one truly analytical mind of the twelve; he was the real scientist of the apostolic group.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a8_2_24"><a href="#fn_a8_2_24">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p8_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p8_3">139:8.3</a></small></sup>  The early home life of Thomas had been unfortunate; his parents were not altogether happy in their married life, and this was reflected in Thomas’s adult experience. He grew up having a very disagreeable and quarrelsome disposition. Even his wife was glad to see him join the apostles; she was relieved by the thought that her pessimistic husband would be away from home most of the time. Thomas also had a streak of suspicion which made it very difficult to get along peaceably with him. <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> was very much upset by Thomas at first, complaining to his brother, <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a>, that Thomas was “mean, ugly, and always suspicious.” But the better his associates knew Thomas, the more they liked him. They found he was superbly honest and unflinchingly loyal. He was perfectly sincere and unquestionably truthful, but he was a natural-born faultfinder and had grown up to become a real pessimist. His analytical mind had become cursed with suspicion. He was rapidly losing faith in his fellow men when he became associated with the twelve and thus came in contact with the noble character of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. This association with the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> began at once to transform Thomas’s whole disposition and to effect great changes in his mental reactions to his fellow men.</p>
<p id="p8_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p8_4">139:8.4</a></small></sup>  Thomas’s great strength was his superb analytical mind coupled with his unflinching courage—when he had once made up his mind. His great weakness was his suspicious doubting, which he never fully overcame throughout his whole lifetime in the flesh.</p>
<p id="p8_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p8_5">139:8.5</a></small></sup>  In the organization of the twelve Thomas was assigned to arrange and manage the itinerary, and he was an able director of the work and movements of the apostolic corps. He was a good executive, an excellent businessman, but he was handicapped by his many moods; he was one man one day and another man the next. He was inclined toward melancholic brooding when he joined the apostles, but contact with <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the apostles largely cured him of this morbid introspection.</p>
<p id="p8_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p8_6">139:8.6</a></small></sup>  Jesus enjoyed Thomas very much and had many long, personal talks with him. His presence among the apostles was a great comfort to all honest doubters and encouraged many troubled minds to come into the kingdom, even if they could not wholly understand everything about the spiritual and philosophic phases of the teachings of Jesus. Thomas’s membership in the twelve was a standing declaration that Jesus loved even honest doubters.</p>
<p id="p8_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p8_7">139:8.7</a></small></sup>  The other apostles held <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> in reverence because of some special and outstanding trait of his replete personality, but Thomas revered his <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> because of his superbly balanced character. Increasingly Thomas admired and honored one who was so lovingly merciful yet so inflexibly just and fair; so firm but never obstinate; so calm but never indifferent; so helpful and so sympathetic but never meddlesome or dictatorial; so strong but at the same time so gentle; so positive but never rough or rude; so tender but never vacillating; so pure and innocent but at the same time so virile, aggressive, and forceful; so truly courageous but never rash or foolhardy; such a lover of <a href="/en/topic/nature">nature</a> but so free from all tendency to revere nature; so humorous and so playful, but so free from levity and frivolity. It was this matchless <a href="/en/topic/symmetry">symmetry</a> of personality that so charmed Thomas. He probably enjoyed the highest intellectual understanding and personality appreciation of Jesus of any of the twelve.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a8_7_3"><a href="#fn_a8_7_3">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p8_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p8_8">139:8.8</a></small></sup>  In the councils of the twelve Thomas was always cautious, advocating a policy of safety first, but if his conservatism was voted down or overruled, he was always <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> fearlessly to move out in execution of the program decided upon. Again and again would he stand out against some project as being foolhardy and presumptuous; he would debate to the bitter end, but when <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> would put the proposition to a vote, and after the twelve would elect to do that which he had so strenuously opposed, Thomas was the first to say, “Let’s go!” He was a good loser<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b53"><a href="#fn_b53">[53]</a></sup>. He did not hold grudges nor nurse wounded feelings. Time and again did he oppose letting Jesus expose himself to danger, but when the Master would decide to take such risks, always was it Thomas who rallied the apostles with his courageous words, “Come on, comrades, let’s go and die with him.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b54"><a href="#fn_b54">[54]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p8_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p8_9">139:8.9</a></small></sup>  Thomas was in some respects like <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a>; he also wanted “to be shown,” but his outward expressions of doubt were based on entirely different intellectual operations. Thomas was analytical, not merely skeptical. As far as personal physical courage was concerned, he was one of the bravest among the twelve.</p>
<p id="p8_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p8_10">139:8.10</a></small></sup>  Thomas had some very bad days; he was blue and downcast at times. The loss of his twin sister when he was nine years old had occasioned him much youthful sorrow and had added to his temperamental problems of later life<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b55"><a href="#fn_b55">[55]</a></sup>. When Thomas would become despondent, sometimes it was <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a> who helped him to recover, sometimes <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, and not infrequently one of the <a href="/en/topic/Alpheus_twins">Alpheus twins</a>. When he was most depressed, unfortunately he always tried to avoid coming in direct contact with <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. But the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> knew all about this and had an understanding sympathy for his apostle when he was thus afflicted with <a href="/en/topic/depression">depression</a> and harassed by <a href="/en/topic/doubt">doubts</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a8_10_29"><a href="#fn_a8_10_29">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p8_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p8_11">139:8.11</a></small></sup>  Sometimes Thomas would get permission from <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> to go off by himself for a day or two. But he soon learned that such a course was not wise; he early found that it was best, when he was downhearted, to stick close to his work and to remain near his associates. But no matter what happened in his emotional life, he kept right on being an apostle. When the time actually came to move forward, it was always Thomas who said, “Let’s go!”</p>
<p id="p8_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p8_12">139:8.12</a></small></sup>  Thomas is the great example of a human being who has doubts, faces them, and wins. He had a great mind; he was no carping critic. He was a logical thinker; he was the acid test of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and his fellow apostles. If Jesus and his work had not been genuine, it could not have held a man like Thomas from the start to the finish. He had a keen and sure sense of <i>fact.</i> At <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> appearance of fraud or deception Thomas would have forsaken them all. Scientists may not fully understand all about Jesus and his work on earth, but there lived and worked with the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and his human associates a man whose mind was that of a true scientist—<a href="/en/topic/Thomas_Didymus">Thomas Didymus</a>—and he believed in Jesus of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a8_12_15"><a href="#fn_a8_12_15">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p8_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p8_13">139:8.13</a></small></sup>  Thomas had a trying time during the days of the trial and crucifixion. He was for a season in the depths of despair, but he rallied his courage, stuck to the apostles, and was present with them to welcome Jesus on the <a href="/en/topic/Sea_of_Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b56"><a href="#fn_b56">[56]</a></sup>. For a while he succumbed to his doubting depression but eventually rallied his faith and courage. He gave wise counsel to the apostles after <a href="/en/topic/Pentecost_(bestowal_of_Spirit_of_Truth)">Pentecost</a> and, when persecution scattered the believers, went to <a href="/en/topic/Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Crete">Crete</a>, the North African coast, and <a href="/en/topic/Sicily">Sicily</a>, preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom and baptizing believers.

<p id="p11_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p11_4">139:11.4</a></small></sup>  Simon’s great weakness was his material-mindedness. He could not quickly change himself from a Jewish nationalist to a spiritually minded internationalist. Four years was too short a time in which to make such an intellectual and emotional transformation, but <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was always patient with him.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a11_4_31"><a href="#fn_a11_4_31">[34]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p11_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p11_6">139:11.6</a></small></sup>  Although Simon was a rabid revolutionist, a fearless firebrand of agitation, he gradually subdued his fiery nature until he became a powerful and effective preacher of “Peace on earth and good will among men<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b64"><a href="#fn_b64">[64]</a></sup>.” Simon was a great debater; he did like to argue.

He had always identified himself with the party of protest, but he now joined the party of progress, unlimited and eternal progression of spirit and truth. <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> was a man of intense loyalties and warm personal devotions, and he did profoundly love Jesus.</p>
<p id="p11_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p11_8">139:11.8</a></small></sup>  Jesus was not afraid to identify himself with business men, laboring men, optimists, pessimists, philosophers, skeptics, publicans, politicians, and patriots.</p>

We must be dedicated to the doing of the Father’s will. Our business is to be ambassadors of a spiritual <a href="/en/topic/government">government</a> on high, and we must not immediately concern ourselves with aught but the representation of the will and character of the divine Father who stands at the head of the government whose credentials we bear.” It was all difficult for <a href="/en/topic/Simon_the_tanner">Simon</a> to comprehend, but gradually he began to grasp something of the meaning of the Master’s teaching.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a11_9_25"><a href="#fn_a11_9_25">[35]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p12_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_2">139:12.2</a></small></sup>  When Nathaniel met Judas at <a href="/en/topic/Tarichea">Tarichea</a>, he was seeking employment with a fish-drying enterprise at the lower end of the <a href="/en/topic/Sea_of_Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a>. He was thirty years of age and unmarried when he joined the apostles. He was probably the best-educated man among the twelve and the only Judean in the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s apostolic family. Judas had no outstanding trait of personal strength, though he had many outwardly appearing traits of culture and habits of training. He was a good thinker but not always a truly <i>honest</i> thinker. Judas did not really understand himself; he was not really sincere in dealing with himself.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a12_2_24"><a href="#fn_a12_2_24">[38]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p12_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_3">139:12.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> appointed Judas treasurer of the twelve, a position which he was eminently fitted to hold, and up to the time of the betrayal of his Master he discharged the responsibilities of his office honestly, faithfully, and most efficiently.</p>
<p id="p12_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_4">139:12.4</a></small></sup>  There was no special trait about <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> which Judas admired above the generally attractive and exquisitely charming personality of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>. Judas was never able to rise above his Judean prejudices against his Galilean associates; he would even criticize in his mind many things about Jesus. Him whom eleven of the apostles looked upon as the perfect man, as the “one altogether lovely and the chiefest among ten thousand,” this self-satisfied Judean often dared to criticize in his own heart<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b66"><a href="#fn_b66">[66]</a></sup>. He really entertained the notion that Jesus was timid and somewhat afraid to assert his own power and authority.</p>
<p id="p12_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_5">139:12.5</a></small></sup>  Judas was a good business man. It required tact, ability, and patience, as well as painstaking devotion, to manage the financial affairs of such an idealist as Jesus, to say nothing of wrestling with the helter-skelter business methods of some of his apostles. Judas really was a great executive, a farseeing and able financier. And he was a stickler for organization. None of the twelve ever criticized Judas. As far as they could see, <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a> was a matchless treasurer, a learned man, a loyal (though sometimes critical) apostle, and in every sense of the word a great success. The apostles loved Judas; he was really one of them. He must have <i>believed</i> in Jesus, but we doubt whether he really <i>loved</i> the Master with a whole heart<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b67"><a href="#fn_b67">[67]</a></sup>. The case of Judas illustrates the truthfulness of that saying: “There is a <a href="/en/topic/way">way</a> that seems right to a man, but the end thereof is death.” It is altogether possible to fall victim to the peaceful deception of pleasant adjustment to the paths of <a href="/en/topic/sin">sin</a> and death. Be assured that Judas was always financially loyal to his Master and his fellow apostles. Money could never have been the motive for his <a href="/en/topic/betrayal">betrayal</a> of the Master.</p>
<p id="p12_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_6">139:12.6</a></small></sup>  Judas was an only son of unwise parents. When very young, he was pampered and petted; he was a spoiled child. As he grew up, he had exaggerated ideas about his <a href="/en/topic/self-importance">self-importance</a>. He was a poor loser. He had loose and distorted ideas about fairness; he was given to the indulgence of <a href="/en/topic/hatred">hate</a> and <a href="/en/topic/suspicion">suspicion</a>. He was an expert at misinterpretation of the words and acts of his friends. All through his life Judas had cultivated the habit of getting even with those whom he fancied had mistreated him. His sense of values and loyalties was defective.</p>
<p id="p12_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_7">139:12.7</a></small></sup>  To <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, Judas was a <a href="/en/topic/faith">faith</a> adventure. From the beginning the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> fully understood the weakness of this apostle and well knew the dangers of admitting him to fellowship. But it is the nature of the <a href="/en/topic/Sons_of_God">Sons of God</a> to give every created being a full and equal chance for salvation and <a href="/en/topic/survival_(of_mortal_death)">survival</a>. Jesus wanted not only the <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of this world but the onlookers of innumerable other worlds to know that, when doubts exist as to the sincerity and wholeheartedness of a creature’s devotion to the kingdom, it is the invariable practice of the <a href="/en/topic/Judges_(Old_Testament)">Judges</a> of men fully to receive the doubtful candidate. The door of eternal life is wide open to all; “whosoever will may come”; there are no restrictions or qualifications save the <i>faith</i> of the one who comes<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b68"><a href="#fn_b68">[68]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a12_7_18"><a href="#fn_a12_7_18">[39]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a12_7_40"><a href="#fn_a12_7_40">[40]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a12_7_5"><a href="#fn_a12_7_5">[41]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s12_7_5"><a href="#fn_s12_7_5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s12_7_1"><a href="#fn_s12_7_1">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p12_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_8">139:12.8</a></small></sup>  This is just the reason why Jesus permitted Judas to go on to the very end, always doing everything possible to transform and save this weak and confused apostle. But when <a href="/en/topic/light">light</a> is not honestly received and lived up to, it tends to become darkness within the soul. Judas grew intellectually regarding Jesus’ teachings about the kingdom, but he did not make progress in the acquirement of spiritual character as did the other apostles. He failed to make satisfactory personal progress in spiritual experience.</p>
<p id="p12_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_9">139:12.9</a></small></sup>  Judas became increasingly a brooder over personal disappointment, and finally he became a victim of <a href="/en/topic/resentment">resentment</a>. His feelings had been many times hurt, and he grew abnormally suspicious of his best friends, even of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>. Presently he became obsessed with the idea of getting even, anything to avenge himself, yes, even betrayal of his associates and his Master.</p>
<p id="p12_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_10">139:12.10</a></small></sup>  But these wicked and dangerous ideas did not take definite shape until the day when a grateful woman broke an expensive box of incense at <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ feet<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b69"><a href="#fn_b69">[69]</a></sup>. This seemed wasteful to Judas, and when his public protest was so sweepingly disallowed by Jesus right there in the hearing of all, it was too much. That event determined the mobilization of all the accumulated hate, hurt, malice, prejudice, jealousy, and revenge of a lifetime, and he made up his mind to get even with he knew not whom; but he crystallized all the evil of his nature upon the <i>one</i> innocent person in all the sordid drama of his unfortunate life just because Jesus happened to be the chief actor in the episode which marked his passing from the progressive kingdom of light into that self-chosen domain of darkness.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a12_10_5"><a href="#fn_a12_10_5">[41]</a></sup></p>

Jesus did everything possible, consistent with man’s moral freedom, to prevent Judas’s choosing to go the wrong way. The great test finally came. The son of resentment failed; he yielded to the sour and sordid dictates of a proud and vengeful mind of exaggerated self-importance and swiftly plunged on down into confusion, despair, and depravity.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a12_11_5"><a href="#fn_a12_11_5">[41]</a></sup></p>

During the outworking of his anger-conceived plans of traitorous <a href="/en/topic/betrayal">betrayal</a>, he experienced moments of regret and shame, and in these lucid intervals he faintheartedly conceived, as a defense in his own mind, the idea that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> might possibly exert his power and deliver himself at <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> moment.</p>
<p id="p12_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_13">139:12.13</a></small></sup>  When the sordid and sinful business was all over, this renegade mortal, who thought lightly of selling his friend for thirty pieces of silver to satisfy his long-nursed craving for revenge, rushed out and committed the final act in the drama of fleeing from the realities of mortal existence—<a href="/en/topic/suicide">suicide</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b71"><a href="#fn_b71">[71]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a12_13_12"><a href="#fn_a12_13_12">[42]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p12_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p12_14">139:12.14</a></small></sup>  The eleven apostles were horrified, stunned. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> regarded the betrayer only with pity.
