<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p0_2">123:0.2</a></small></sup>  All through these early years of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ helpless infancy, Mary maintained one long and constant vigil lest anything befall her child which might jeopardize his welfare or in any way interfere with his future mission on earth; no mother was ever more devoted to her child. In the home where Jesus chanced to be there were two other children about his age, and among the near neighbors there were six others whose ages were sufficiently near his own to make them acceptable play-fellows. At first Mary was disposed to keep Jesus close by her side. She feared something might happen to him if he were allowed to play in the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a> with the other children, but Joseph, with the assistance of his kinsfolk, was able to convince her that such a course would deprive Jesus of the helpful experience of learning how to adjust himself to children of his own age. And Mary, realizing that such a program of undue sheltering and unusual protection might tend to make him self-conscious and somewhat self-centered, finally gave assent to the plan of permitting the child of promise to grow up just like any other child; and though she was obedient to this decision, she made it her business always to be on watch while the little folks were at play about the house or in the garden. Only an affectionate mother can know the burden that Mary carried in her heart for the safety of her son during these years of his infancy and early childhood.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p0_3">123:0.3</a></small></sup>  Throughout the two years of their sojourn at <a href="/en/topic/Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, Jesus enjoyed good health and continued to grow normally. Aside from a few friends and relatives no one was told about Jesus’ being a “child of promise.” One of <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>’s relatives revealed this to a few friends in Memphis, descendants of the distant <a href="/en/topic/Ikhnaton">Ikhnaton</a>, and they, with a small group of Alexandrian believers, assembled at the palatial home of <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_(Old_Testament)">Joseph</a>’s relative-benefactor a short time before the return to <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a> to wish the <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> family well and to pay their respects to the child. On this occasion the assembled friends presented Jesus with a complete copy of the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> translation of the Hebrew scriptures. But this copy of the Jewish sacred writings was not placed in <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_(father_of_Jesus)">Joseph</a>’s hands until both he and <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> had finally declined the invitation of their Memphis and Alexandrian friends to remain in <a href="/en/topic/Egypt">Egypt</a>. These believers insisted that the child of destiny would be able to exert a far greater world influence as a resident of Alexandria than of any designated place in Palestine. These persuasions delayed their departure for Palestine for some time after they received the news of Herod’s death.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p1_1">123:1.1</a></small></sup>  On the fourth day of the journey the party reached its destination in safety. They arrived unannounced at the <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> home, which had been occupied for more than three years by one of <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>’s married brothers, who was indeed surprised to see them; so quietly had they gone about their business that neither the family of <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_(Old_Testament)">Joseph</a> nor that of <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> knew they had even left <a href="/en/topic/Alexandria">Alexandria</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>.

In less than a week <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_(brother_of_Jesus)">Joseph</a> secured work as a carpenter, and they were supremely happy.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p1_2">123:1.2</a></small></sup>  Jesus was about three years and two months old at the time of their return to Nazareth. He had stood all these travels very well and was in excellent health and full of childish glee and excitement at having premises of his own to run about in and to enjoy<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>.

<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p1_3">123:1.3</a></small></sup>  On the way to <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> had persuaded <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> that it would be unwise to spread the word among their Galilean friends and relatives that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was a child of promise. They agreed to refrain from all mention of these matters to anyone. And they were both very faithful in keeping this promise.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p1_4">123:1.4</a></small></sup>  Jesus’ entire fourth year was a period of normal physical development and of unusual mental activity. Meantime he had formed a very close attachment for a neighbor boy about his own age named <a href="/en/topic/Jacob_of_Crete">Jacob</a>. Jesus and <a href="/en/topic/Jacob_of_Emmaus">Jacob</a> were always happy in their play, and they grew up to be great friends and loyal companions.</p>

After this he did very little carpenter work by the day. He had as associates two of his brothers and several other mechanics, whom he sent out to work while he remained at the shop making yokes and plows and doing other woodwork. He also did some work in leather and with rope and canvas.

<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p1_7">123:1.7</a></small></sup>  In July of this year, one month before <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was four years old, an outbreak of malignant intestinal trouble spread over all <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> from contact with the caravan travelers. <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> became so alarmed by the danger of Jesus being exposed to this epidemic of disease that she bundled up both her children and fled to the country home of her brother, several miles south of Nazareth on the <a href="/en/topic/Megiddo">Megiddo</a> road near <a href="/en/topic/Sarid">Sarid</a>. They did not return to Nazareth for more than two months; Jesus greatly enjoyed this, his first experience on a <a href="/en/topic/farm">farm</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. THE FIFTH YEAR (2 B.C.) </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p2_1">123:2.1</a></small></sup>  In something more than a year after the return to <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> the boy <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> arrived at the age of his first personal and wholehearted moral decision; and there came to abide with him a Thought Adjuster, a divine gift of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Father, which had aforetime served with <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Machiventa Melchizedek</a>, thus gaining the experience of functioning in connection with the incarnation of a supermortal being living in the likeness of mortal flesh. This event occurred on February 11, 2 B.C. Jesus was no more aware of the coming of the divine Monitor than are the millions upon millions of other children who, before and since that day, have likewise received these <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Thought Adjusters</a> to indwell their minds and work for the ultimate spiritualization of these minds and the eternal survival of their evolving immortal souls.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_1"><a href="#fn_s2_1_1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_1_2"><a href="#fn_s2_1_2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p2_2">123:2.2</a></small></sup>  On this day in February the direct and personal supervision of the Universe Rulers, as it was related to the integrity of the childlike incarnation of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a>, terminated. From that time on throughout the human unfolding of the incarnation, the guardianship of Jesus was destined to rest in the keeping of this indwelling Adjuster and the associated seraphic guardians, supplemented from time to time by the ministry of midway creatures assigned for the performance of certain definite duties in accordance with the instruction of their planetary superiors.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p2_3">123:2.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was five years old in August of this year, and we will, therefore, refer to this as his fifth (calendar) year of life. In this year, 2 B.C., a little more than one month before his fifth birthday anniversary, Jesus was made very happy by the coming of his sister <a href="/en/topic/Miriam_(Old_Testament)">Miriam</a>, who was born on the night of July 11. During the evening of the following day Jesus had a long talk with his father concerning the manner in which various groups of living things are born into the world as separate individuals<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>. The most valuable part of Jesus’ early <a href="/en/topic/education">education</a> was secured from his parents in answer to his thoughtful and searching inquiries. <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> never failed to do his full duty in taking pains and spending time answering the boy’s numerous questions. From the time Jesus was five years old until he was ten, he was one continuous question mark. While <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_(Old_Testament)">Joseph</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> could not always answer his questions, they never failed fully to discuss his inquiries and in every other possible way to assist him in his efforts to reach a satisfactory solution of the problem which his alert mind had suggested.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p2_4">123:2.4</a></small></sup>  Since returning to <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, theirs had been a busy household, and Joseph had been unusually occupied building his new shop and getting his business started again. So fully was he occupied that he had found no time to build a cradle for <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>, but this was corrected long before Miriam came, so that she had a very comfortable crib in which to nestle while the family admired her. And the child Jesus heartily entered into all these natural and normal home experiences. He greatly enjoyed his little brother and his baby sister and was of great help to Mary in their care.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p2_5">123:2.5</a></small></sup>  There were few homes in the gentile world of those days that could give a child a better intellectual, moral, and religious training than the Jewish homes of <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>. These <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> had a systematic program for rearing and educating their children. They divided a child’s life into seven stages:</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p2_6">123:2.6</a></small></sup>  1. The newborn child, <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> to the eighth day.</p>

<p id="p2_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p2_13">123:2.13</a></small></sup>  It was the custom of the Galilean <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> for the mother to bear the responsibility for a child’s training until the fifth birthday, and then, if the child were a boy, to hold the father responsible for the lad’s <a href="/en/topic/education">education</a> from that time on. This year, therefore, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> entered upon the fifth stage of a Galilean Jewish child’s career, and accordingly on August 21, 2 B.C., <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> formally turned him over to <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> for further instruction.</p>
<p id="p2_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p2_14">123:2.14</a></small></sup>  Though Joseph was now assuming the direct responsibility for Jesus’ intellectual and religious education, his mother still interested herself in his home training. She taught him to know and care for the vines and flowers growing about the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a> walls which completely surrounded the home plot. She also provided on the <a href="/en/topic/roof">roof</a> of the house (the summer bedroom) shallow boxes of sand in which Jesus worked out maps and did much of his early practice at writing <a href="/en/topic/Aramaic">Aramaic</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a>, and later on, Hebrew, for in time he learned to read, write, and speak, fluently, all three languages.</p>

There were only two complete copies of the Scriptures in Greek in all <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, and the possession of one of them by the carpenter’s family made <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_(Old_Testament)">Joseph</a>’s home a much-sought place and enabled Jesus, as he grew up, to meet an almost endless procession of earnest students and sincere truth seekers. Before this year ended, Jesus had assumed custody of this priceless manuscript, having been told on his sixth birthday that the sacred book had been presented to him by Alexandrian friends and relatives. And in a very short time he could read it readily.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p3_2">123:3.2</a></small></sup>  The first great shock of Jesus’ young life occurred when he was not quite six years old. It had seemed to the lad that his father—at least his father and mother together—knew everything. Imagine, therefore, the surprise of this inquiring child, when he asked his father the cause of a mild earthquake which had just occurred, to hear Joseph say, “My son, I really do not know.” Thus began that long and disconcerting disillusionment in the course of which Jesus found out that his earthly parents were not all-wise and all-knowing.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p3_3">123:3.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>’s first thought was to tell <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> that the earthquake had been caused by <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, but a moment’s reflection admonished him that such an answer would immediately be provocative of further and still more embarrassing inquiries. Even at an early age it was very difficult to answer Jesus’ questions about physical or social phenomena by thoughtlessly telling him that either God or the devil was responsible. In harmony with the prevailing belief of the Jewish people, Jesus was long willing to accept the doctrine of good spirits and evil spirits as the possible explanation of mental and spiritual phenomena, but he very early became doubtful that such unseen influences were responsible for the physical happenings of the natural world.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p3_4">123:3.4</a></small></sup>  Before Jesus was six years of age, in the early summer of 1 B.C., <a href="/en/topic/Zacharias">Zacharias</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Elizabeth_of_Tiberias">Elizabeth</a> and their son John came to visit the <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> family. Jesus and John had a happy time during this, their first visit within their memories. Although the visitors could remain only a few days, the parents talked over many things, including the future plans for their sons. While they were thus engaged, the lads played with blocks in the sand on top of the house and in many other ways enjoyed themselves in true boyish fashion.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p3_5">123:3.5</a></small></sup>  Having met John, who came from near <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> began to evince an unusual interest in the history of <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a> and to inquire in great detail as to the meaning of the <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> rites, the synagogue sermons, and the recurring feasts of commemoration. His father explained to him the meaning of all these seasons. The first was the midwinter festive illumination, lasting eight days, starting out with one candle <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> night and adding one each successive night; this commemorated the dedication of the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> after the restoration of the Mosaic services by <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Maccabee">Judas Maccabee</a>. Next came the early springtime celebration of <a href="/en/topic/Purim">Purim</a>, the feast of <a href="/en/topic/Esther">Esther</a> and Israel’s deliverance through her. Then followed the solemn <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a>, which the adults celebrated in Jerusalem whenever possible, while at home the children would remember that no leavened bread was to be eaten for the whole week. Later came the feast of the first-fruits, the harvest ingathering; and last, the most solemn of all, the feast of the new year, the day of atonement. While some of these celebrations and observances were difficult for Jesus’ young mind to understand, he pondered them seriously and then entered fully into the joy of the feast of tabernacles, the annual vacation season of the whole Jewish people, the time when they camped out in leafy booths and gave themselves up to mirth and pleasure.</p>

Before the year was over, the family income had more than trebled. Never again, until after Joseph’s death, did the Nazareth family feel the pinch of poverty.

Jesus was a keen <a href="/en/topic/Most_High_observer_of_Urantia">observer</a> and gained much practical knowledge from these trips away from home; he was assiduously storing up knowledge regarding man and the way he lived on earth.</p>
<p id="p3_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p3_9">123:3.9</a></small></sup>  This year Jesus made great progress in adjusting his strong feelings and vigorous impulses to the demands of family co-operation and home <a href="/en/topic/discipline">discipline</a>. <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> was a loving mother but a fairly strict disciplinarian. In many ways, however, Joseph exerted the greater control over Jesus as it was his practice to sit down with the boy and fully explain the real and underlying reasons for the necessity of disciplinary curtailment of personal desires in deference to the welfare and tranquillity of the entire family. When the situation had been explained to Jesus, he was always intelligently and willingly co-operative with parental wishes and family regulations.</p>

Early in January a great snowstorm occurred in <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>. Snow fell two feet deep, the heaviest snowfall Jesus saw during his lifetime and one of the deepest at <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> in a hundred years.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p4_2">123:4.2</a></small></sup>  The play life of Jewish children in the times of Jesus was rather circumscribed; all too often the children played at the more serious things they observed their elders doing. They played much at weddings and funerals, ceremonies which they so frequently saw and which were so spectacular. They danced and sang but had few organized games, such as children of later days so much enjoy.</p>

It was always difficult for Jesus to comprehend the harm of certain sorts of play which were forbidden on the <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a>, but he never failed to conform to his parents’ wishes. He had a capacity for humor and play which was afforded little opportunity for expression in the environment of his day and generation, but up to the age of fourteen he was cheerful and lighthearted most of the time.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_3_5"><a href="#fn_a4_3_5">[4]</a></sup></p>

It happened during an unexpected July sandstorm from the east. The hot winds, carrying blasts of fine <a href="/en/topic/sand">sand</a>, usually blew during the rainy season, especially in March and April. It was extraordinary to have such a storm in July. When the storm came up, Jesus was on the housetop playing, as was his habit, for during much of the dry season this was his accustomed playroom. He was blinded by the sand when descending the stairs and fell. After this accident <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> built a balustrade up both sides of the stairway.</p>
<p id="p4_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p4_6">123:4.6</a></small></sup>  There was no way in which this accident could have been prevented.

It simply could not have been avoided. But this slight accident, occurring while Joseph was absent in <a href="/en/topic/Endor">Endor</a>, caused such great anxiety to develop in <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a>’s mind that she unwisely tried to keep Jesus very close to her side for some months.</p>

<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p5_1">123:5.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was now seven years old, the age when Jewish children were supposed to begin their formal <a href="/en/topic/education">education</a> in the synagogue schools. Accordingly, in August of this year he entered upon his eventful school life at <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>. Already this lad was a fluent reader, writer, and speaker of two languages, <a href="/en/topic/Aramaic">Aramaic</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a>. He was now to acquaint himself with the task of learning to read, write, and speak the <a href="/en/topic/Hebrew_language">Hebrew language</a>. And he was truly eager for the new school life which was ahead of him.</p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p5_2">123:5.2</a></small></sup>  For three years—until he was ten—he attended the elementary school of the Nazareth synagogue. For these three years he studied the rudiments of the Book of the Law as it was recorded in the Hebrew tongue. For the following three years he studied in the advanced school and committed to <a href="/en/topic/memory">memory</a>, by the method of repeating aloud, the deeper teachings of the sacred law. He graduated from this school of the synagogue during his thirteenth year and was turned over to his parents by the synagogue rulers as an educated “son of the commandment”—henceforth a responsible citizen of the commonwealth of <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a>, all of which entailed his attendance at the Passovers in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>; accordingly, he attended his first <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> that year in company with his father and mother.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s5_2_0"><a href="#fn_s5_2_0">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p5_3">123:5.3</a></small></sup>  At <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> the pupils sat on the floor in a semicircle, while their teacher, the chazan, an officer of the synagogue, sat facing them. Beginning with the Book of Leviticus, they passed on to the study of the other books of the law, followed by the study of the Prophets and the <a href="/en/topic/Psalms">Psalms</a>. The Nazareth synagogue possessed a complete copy of the Scriptures in Hebrew. Nothing but the Scriptures was studied prior to the twelfth year. In the summer months the hours for school were greatly shortened.</p>
<p id="p5_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p5_4">123:5.4</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> early became a master of Hebrew, and as a young man, when no visitor of prominence happened to be sojourning in Nazareth, he would often be asked to read the Hebrew scriptures to the faithful assembled in the synagogue at the regular <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> services.</p>
<p id="p5_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p5_5">123:5.5</a></small></sup>  These synagogue schools, of course, had no textbooks. In teaching, the chazan would utter a statement while the pupils would in unison repeat it after him. When having access to the written books of the law, the student learned his lesson by reading aloud and by constant repetition.</p>
<p id="p5_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p5_6">123:5.6</a></small></sup>  Next, in addition to his more formal schooling, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> began to make contact with human nature from the four quarters of the earth as men from many lands passed in and out of his father’s repair shop. When he grew older, he mingled freely with the caravans as they tarried near the spring for rest and nourishment. Being a fluent speaker of <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a>, he had little trouble in conversing with the majority of the caravan travelers and conductors.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_6_4"><a href="#fn_a5_6_4">[8]</a></sup></p>

In <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> mingled more freely with the <a href="/en/topic/gentiles">gentiles</a> than was their practice in <a href="/en/topic/Judea">Judea</a>. And of all the cities of Galilee, the <a href="/en/topic/Jews_(ancient_Hebrews)">Jews</a> of Nazareth were most liberal in their interpretation of the social restrictions based on the fears of contamination as a result of contact with the gentiles.

He secured much of his intellectual and theological <a href="/en/topic/education">education</a> from the chazan. But his real education—that equipment of mind and heart for the actual test of grappling with the difficult problems of life—he obtained by mingling with his fellow men. It was this close association with his fellow men, young and old, Jew and gentile, that afforded him the opportunity to know the human race. Jesus was highly educated in that he thoroughly understood men and devotedly loved them.</p>
<p id="p5_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p5_9">123:5.9</a></small></sup>  Throughout his years at the synagogue he was a brilliant student, possessing a great advantage since he was conversant with three languages. The <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> chazan, on the occasion of Jesus’ finishing the course in his school, remarked to <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> that he feared he “had learned more from Jesus’ searching questions” than he had “been able to teach the lad.”</p>
<p id="p5_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p5_10">123:5.10</a></small></sup>  Throughout his course of study <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> learned much and derived great inspiration from the regular <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> sermons in the synagogue. It was customary to ask distinguished visitors, stopping over the Sabbath in Nazareth, to address the synagogue. As Jesus grew up, he heard many great thinkers of the entire Jewish world expound their views, and many also who were hardly orthodox <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> since the synagogue of Nazareth was an advanced and liberal center of Hebrew thought and culture.</p>
<p id="p5_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p5_11">123:5.11</a></small></sup>  When entering school at seven years (at this time the Jews had just inaugurated a compulsory <a href="/en/topic/education">education</a> law), it was customary for the pupils to choose their “birthday text,” a sort of golden rule to guide them throughout their studies, one upon which they often expatiated at their graduation when thirteen years old. The text which Jesus chose was from the Prophet <a href="/en/topic/Isaiah_(first)">Isaiah</a>: “The spirit of the Lord <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> is upon me, for the Lord has anointed me; he has sent me to bring good news to the meek, to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and to set the spiritual prisoners free<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup>.”</p>

But the Galilean priesthood was more liberal in the interpretation of the traditional laws than were the Judean scribes and rabbis. And at Nazareth they were also more liberal regarding the observance of the <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a>. It was therefore the custom for <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> to take <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> out for walks on Sabbath afternoons, one of their favorite jaunts being to climb the high hill near their home, from which they could obtain a panoramic view of all <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>.

<p id="p5_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p5_15">123:5.15</a></small></sup>  Before he was eight years of age, he was known to all the mothers and young women of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, who had met him and talked with him at the spring, which was not far from his home, and which was one of the social centers of contact and gossip for the entire town. This year Jesus learned to milk the family <a href="/en/topic/cattle">cow</a> and care for the other animals. During this and the following year he also learned to make <a href="/en/topic/cheese">cheese</a> and to weave. When he was ten years of age, he was an expert loom operator. It was about this time that Jesus and the neighbor boy <a href="/en/topic/Jacob_of_Crete">Jacob</a> became great friends of the potter who worked near the flowing spring; and as they watched <a href="/en/topic/Nathan_of_Cana">Nathan</a>’s deft fingers mold the clay on the potter’s wheel, many times both of them determined to be <a href="/en/topic/potters">potters</a> when they grew up. <a href="/en/topic/Nathan_of_Caesarea">Nathan</a> was very fond of the lads and often gave them clay to play with, seeking to stimulate their creative imaginations by suggesting competitive efforts in modeling various objects and animals.</p>
<h2 id="p6" class="toc-header"><a href="#p6" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 6. HIS EIGHTH YEAR (A.D. 2) </h2>
<p id="p6_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p6_1">123:6.1</a></small></sup>  This was an interesting year at school. Although <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was not an unusual student, he was a diligent pupil and belonged to the more progressive third of the class, doing his work so well that he was excused from attendance one week out of each month. This week he usually spent either with his fisherman uncle on the shores of the <a href="/en/topic/Sea_of_Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a> near <a href="/en/topic/Magdala">Magdala</a> or on the <a href="/en/topic/farm">farm</a> of another uncle (his mother’s brother) five miles south of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>.</p>
<p id="p6_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p6_2">123:6.2</a></small></sup>  Although his mother had become unduly anxious about his health and safety, she gradually became reconciled to these trips away from home. Jesus’ uncles and aunts were all very fond of him, and there ensued a lively competition among them to secure his company for these monthly visits throughout this and immediately subsequent years. His first week’s sojourn on his uncle’s farm (since infancy) was in January of this year; <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> week’s fishing experience on the Sea of Galilee occurred in the month of May.</p>
<p id="p6_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p6_3">123:6.3</a></small></sup>  About this time <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> met a teacher of <a href="/en/topic/mathematics">mathematics</a> from <a href="/en/topic/Damascus">Damascus</a>, and learning some new techniques of numbers, he spent much time on mathematics for several years. He developed a keen sense of numbers, distances, and proportions.</p>
<p id="p6_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p6_4">123:6.4</a></small></sup>  Jesus began to enjoy his brother <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> very much and by the end of this year had begun to teach him the alphabet.</p>
<p id="p6_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p6_5">123:6.5</a></small></sup>  This year <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> made arrangements to exchange dairy products for lessons on the <a href="/en/topic/harp">harp</a>. He had an unusual liking for everything musical. Later on he did much to promote an interest in vocal <a href="/en/topic/music">music</a> among his youthful associates. By the time he was eleven years of age, he was a skillful harpist and greatly enjoyed entertaining both family and friends with his extraordinary interpretations and able improvisations.</p>
<p id="p6_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p6_6">123:6.6</a></small></sup>  While Jesus continued to make enviable progress at school, all did not run smoothly for either parents or teachers. He persisted in asking many embarrassing questions concerning both science and religion, particularly regarding geography and astronomy. He was especially insistent on finding out why there was a dry season and a rainy season in <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a>. Repeatedly he sought the explanation for the great difference between the temperatures of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> valley. He simply never ceased to ask such intelligent but perplexing questions.</p>
<p id="p6_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p6_7">123:6.7</a></small></sup>  His third brother, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a>, was born on <a href="/en/topic/Fridays">Friday</a> evening, April 14, of this year, A.D. 2.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b12"><a href="#fn_b12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p6_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p6_8">123:6.8</a></small></sup>  In February, <a href="/en/topic/Nahor_(rabbi)">Nahor</a>, one of the teachers in a <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> academy of the rabbis, came to <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> to observe <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, having been on a similar mission to <a href="/en/topic/Zacharias">Zacharias</a>’s home near Jerusalem. He came to Nazareth at the instigation of John’s father. While at first he was somewhat shocked by Jesus’ frankness and unconventional manner of relating himself to things religious, he attributed it to the remoteness of <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> from the centers of Hebrew learning and culture and advised <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> to allow him to take Jesus back with him to Jerusalem, where he could have the advantages of education and training at the center of Jewish culture. <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Clopas)">Mary</a> was half persuaded to consent; she was convinced her eldest son was to become the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a>, the Jewish <a href="/en/topic/Deliverer">deliverer</a>; <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_(Old_Testament)">Joseph</a> hesitated; he was equally persuaded that Jesus was to grow up to become a man of destiny, but what that destiny would prove to be he was profoundly uncertain. But he never really doubted that his son was to fulfill some great mission on earth. The more he thought about <a href="/en/topic/Nahor_(evangelist)">Nahor</a>’s advice, the more he questioned the wisdom of the proposed sojourn in Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="p6_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p6_9">123:6.9</a></small></sup>  Because of this difference of opinion between Joseph and Mary, Nahor requested permission to lay the whole matter before Jesus. Jesus listened attentively, talked with Joseph, Mary, and a neighbor, <a href="/en/topic/Jacob_the_stone_mason_(son)">Jacob the stone mason</a>, whose son was his favorite playmate, and then, two days later, reported that since there was such a difference of opinion among his parents and advisers, and since he did not feel competent to assume the responsibility for such a decision, not feeling strongly one way or the other, in view of the whole situation, he had finally decided to “talk with my Father who is in heaven”; and while he was not perfectly sure about the answer, he rather felt he should remain at home “with my father and mother,” adding, “they who love me so much should be able to do more for me and guide me more safely than strangers who can only view my body and observe my mind but can hardly truly know me.” They all marveled, and Nahor went his way, back to Jerusalem. And it was many years before the subject of Jesus’ going away from home again came up for consideration.</p>
