<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p0_2">123:0.2</a></small></sup>  All through these early years of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>‚Äô helpless infancy, Mary maintained one long and constant vigil lest anything befall her child which might jeopardize his welfare or in any way interfere with his future mission on earth; no mother was ever more devoted to her child. In the home where Jesus chanced to be there were two other children about his age, and among the near neighbors there were six others whose ages were sufficiently near his own to make them acceptable play-fellows. At first Mary was disposed to keep Jesus close by her side. She feared something might happen to him if he were allowed to play in the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a> with the other children, but Joseph, with the assistance of his kinsfolk, was able to convince her that such a course would deprive Jesus of the helpful experience of learning how to adjust himself to children of his own age. And Mary, realizing that such a program of undue sheltering and unusual protection might tend to make him self-conscious and somewhat self-centered, finally gave assent to the plan of permitting the child of promise to grow up just like any other child; and though she was obedient to this decision, she made it her business always to be on watch while the little folks were at play about the house or in the garden. Only an affectionate mother can know the burden that Mary carried in her heart for the safety of her son during these years of his infancy and early childhood.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_2_42"><a href="#fn_a0_2_42">[1]</a></sup></p>

Before this year ended, Jesus had assumed custody of this priceless manuscript, having been told on his sixth birthday that the sacred book had been presented to him by Alexandrian friends and relatives. And in a very short time he could read it readily.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_1_42"><a href="#fn_a3_1_42">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_1_0"><a href="#fn_a3_1_0">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_1_5"><a href="#fn_a3_1_5">[14]</a></sup></p>

Imagine, therefore, the surprise of this inquiring child, when he asked his father the cause of a mild <a href="/en/topic/earthquakes">earthquake</a> which had just occurred, to hear Joseph say, ‚ÄúMy son, I really do not know.‚Äù Thus began that long and disconcerting disillusionment in the course of which Jesus found out that his earthly parents were not all-wise and all-knowing.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_2_2"><a href="#fn_s3_2_2">[1]</a></sup></p>

Even at an early age it was very difficult to answer Jesus‚Äô questions about physical or social phenomena by thoughtlessly telling him that either God or the devil was responsible. In harmony with the prevailing belief of the Jewish people, Jesus was long willing to accept the doctrine of good spirits and evil spirits as the possible explanation of mental and spiritual phenomena, but he very early became doubtful that such unseen influences were responsible for the physical happenings of the natural world.</p>

Although the visitors could remain only a few days, the parents talked over many things, including the future plans for their sons.

His father explained to him the meaning of all these seasons. The first was the midwinter festive illumination, lasting eight days, starting out with one candle <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> night and adding one each successive night; this commemorated the dedication of the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> after the restoration of the Mosaic services by <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Maccabee">Judas Maccabee</a>.

Later came the feast of the first-fruits, the harvest ingathering; and last, the most solemn of all, the feast of the new year, the day of atonement. While some of these celebrations and observances were difficult for Jesus‚Äô young mind to understand, he pondered them seriously and then entered fully into the joy of the feast of tabernacles, the annual vacation season of the whole Jewish people, the time when they camped out in leafy booths and gave themselves up to mirth and pleasure.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_5_9"><a href="#fn_a3_5_9">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_5_17"><a href="#fn_a3_5_17">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_5_37"><a href="#fn_a3_5_37">[18]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p4_2">123:4.2</a></small></sup>  The play life of Jewish children in the times of Jesus was rather circumscribed; all too often the children played at the more serious things they observed their elders doing.
