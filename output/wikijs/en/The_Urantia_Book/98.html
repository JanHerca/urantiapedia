<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p0_1">98:0.1</a></small></sup>  THE <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> teachings entered <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a> along many routes, but chiefly they came by way of <a href="/en/topic/Egypt">Egypt</a> and were embodied in Occidental philosophy after being thoroughly Hellenized and later Christianized. The ideals of the Western world were basically Socratic, and its later religious philosophy became that of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> as it was modified and compromised through contact with evolving Occidental philosophy and religion, all of which culminated in the <a href="/en/topic/Christian_church,_early">Christian church</a>.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p0_2">98:0.2</a></small></sup>  For a long time in Europe the <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> missionaries carried on their activities, becoming gradually absorbed into many of the cults and ritual groups which periodically arose. Among those who maintained the <a href="/en/topic/Salem_teachings">Salem teachings</a> in the purest form must be mentioned the <a href="/en/topic/Cynics">Cynics</a>. These preachers of faith and trust in <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> were still functioning in Roman Europe in <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> century after <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a>, being later incorporated into the newly forming Christian religion.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_2_3"><a href="#fn_s0_2_3">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s0_2_7"><a href="#fn_s0_2_7">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p0_3">98:0.3</a></small></sup>  Much of the Salem doctrine was spread in <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a> by the Jewish mercenary soldiers who fought in so many of the Occidental military struggles. In ancient times the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> were famed as much for military valor as for theologic peculiarities.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_3_7"><a href="#fn_s0_3_7">[2]</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. THE SALEM RELIGION AMONG THE GREEKS </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p1_1">98:1.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> <a href="/en/topic/missionaries">missionaries</a> might have built up a great religious structure among the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a> had it not been for their strict interpretation of their oath of ordination, a pledge imposed by Machiventa which forbade the organization of exclusive congregations for worship, and which exacted the promise of each teacher never to function as a priest, never to receive fees for religious service, only food, clothing, and shelter. When the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> teachers penetrated to pre-Hellenic <a href="/en/topic/Greece">Greece</a>, they found a people who still fostered the traditions of <a href="/en/topic/Adamson">Adamson</a> and the days of the <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andites</a>, but these teachings had become greatly adulterated with the notions and beliefs of the hordes of inferior slaves that had been brought to the Greek shores in increasing numbers. This adulteration produced a reversion to a crude <a href="/en/topic/animism">animism</a> with bloody rites, the lower classes even making ceremonial out of the execution of condemned criminals.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_1_7"><a href="#fn_s1_1_7">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p1_2">98:1.2</a></small></sup>  The early influence of the Salem teachers was nearly destroyed by the so-called <a href="/en/topic/Aryans">Aryan</a> invasion from southern <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a> and the East. These Hellenic invaders brought along with them anthropomorphic <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> concepts similar to those which their Aryan fellows had carried to <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a>. This importation inaugurated the evolution of the Greek family of gods and goddesses. This new religion was partly based on the cults of the incoming Hellenic barbarians, but it also shared in the myths of the older inhabitants of Greece.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_8"><a href="#fn_a1_2_8">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p1_3">98:1.3</a></small></sup>  The Hellenic <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a> found the <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_region">Mediterranean</a> world largely dominated by the <a href="/en/topic/mother_cult">mother cult</a>, and they imposed upon these peoples their man-god, <a href="/en/topic/Dyaus-Zeus">Dyaus-Zeus</a>, who had already become, like <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a> among the henotheistic <a href="/en/topic/Semites">Semites</a>, head of the whole Greek pantheon of subordinate gods. And the Greeks would have eventually achieved a true monotheism in the concept of <a href="/en/topic/Zeus">Zeus</a> except for their retention of the overcontrol of <a href="/en/topic/Fate">Fate</a>. A God of final value must, himself, be the arbiter of fate and the creator of destiny.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_3_25"><a href="#fn_a1_3_25">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p1_4">98:1.4</a></small></sup>  As a consequence of these factors in religious evolution, there presently developed the popular belief in the happy-go-lucky gods of <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Olympus">Mount Olympus</a>, gods more human than divine, and gods which the intelligent Greeks never did regard very seriously. They neither greatly loved nor greatly feared these divinities of their own creation. They had a patriotic and racial feeling for Zeus and his family of half men and half gods, but they hardly reverenced or worshiped them.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_4_5"><a href="#fn_a1_4_5">[3]</a></sup></p>

Even the making of images to the gods became more of a work in art than a matter of worship.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p1_6">98:1.6</a></small></sup>  The Olympian gods illustrate man’s typical anthropomorphism. But the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> mythology was more aesthetic than ethic. The Greek religion was helpful in that it portrayed a universe governed by a deity group. But Greek morals, ethics, and philosophy presently advanced far beyond the god concept, and this <a href="/en/topic/balance">imbalance</a> between intellectual and spiritual growth was as hazardous to Greece as it had proved to be in <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_6_17"><a href="#fn_a1_6_17">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p2_1">98:2.1</a></small></sup>  A lightly regarded and superficial religion cannot endure, especially when it has no priesthood to foster its forms and to fill the hearts of the devotees with fear and awe. The <a href="/en/topic/Olympian_religion">Olympian religion</a> did not promise salvation, nor did it quench the spiritual thirst of its believers; therefore was it doomed to perish. Within a millennium of its inception it had nearly vanished, and the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a> were without a national religion, the gods of Olympus having lost their hold upon the better minds.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_8"><a href="#fn_s2_1_8">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p2_2">98:2.2</a></small></sup>  This was the situation when, during the sixth century before <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a>, the Orient and the <a href="/en/topic/Levant">Levant</a> experienced a revival of spiritual consciousness and a new awakening to the recognition of monotheism. But the West did not share in this new development; neither <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a> nor northern <a href="/en/topic/Africa">Africa</a> extensively participated in this religious renaissance. The Greeks, however, did engage in a magnificent intellectual advancement. They had begun to master fear and no longer sought <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> as an antidote therefor, but they did not perceive that true religion is the cure for soul hunger, spiritual disquiet, and moral despair. They sought for the solace of the soul in deep thinking—<a href="/en/topic/philosophy">philosophy</a> and <a href="/en/topic/metaphysics">metaphysics</a>. They turned from the contemplation of self-preservation—salvation—to self-realization and self-understanding.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_2_15"><a href="#fn_a2_2_15">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_2_16"><a href="#fn_a2_2_16">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p2_3">98:2.3</a></small></sup>  By rigorous thought the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a> attempted to attain that consciousness of security which would serve as a substitute for the belief in survival, but they utterly failed. Only the more intelligent among the higher classes of the Hellenic peoples could grasp this new teaching; the rank and file of the progeny of the slaves of former generations had no capacity for the reception of this new substitute for religion.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p2_4">98:2.4</a></small></sup>  The philosophers disdained all forms of worship, notwithstanding that they practically all held loosely to the background of a belief in the <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> doctrine of “the Intelligence of the universe,” “the idea of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>,” and “the Great Source.” In so far as the Greek philosophers gave recognition to the divine and the superfinite, they were frankly monotheistic; they gave scant recognition to the whole galaxy of Olympian gods and goddesses.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_4_8"><a href="#fn_a2_4_8">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_4_10"><a href="#fn_a2_4_10">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_4_14"><a href="#fn_a2_4_14">[8]</a></sup></p>

They elevated its ideals, but they were more artists than religionists. They failed to develop a technique for fostering and conserving supreme values.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_5_17"><a href="#fn_a2_5_17">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p2_6">98:2.6</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Xenophanes">Xenophanes</a> taught one <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, but his deity concept was too pantheistic to be a personal Father to mortal man. <a href="/en/topic/Anaxagoras">Anaxagoras</a> was a mechanist except that he did recognize a <a href="/en/topic/First_Cause">First Cause</a>, an Initial Mind. <a href="/en/topic/Socrates">Socrates</a> and his successors, <a href="/en/topic/Plato">Plato</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, taught that <a href="/en/topic/virtue">virtue</a> is knowledge; <a href="/en/topic/goodness">goodness</a>, health of the soul; that it is better to suffer <a href="/en/topic/injustice">injustice</a> than to be guilty of it, that it is wrong to return <a href="/en/topic/evil">evil</a> for evil, and that the gods are wise and <a href="/en/topic/good">good</a>.

<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p2_7">98:2.7</a></small></sup>  The evolution of religious philosophy among the Hellenic and Hebrew peoples affords a contrastive illustration of the function of the <a href="/en/topic/churches">church</a> as an institution in the shaping of cultural progress. In <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a>, human thought was so priest-controlled and scripture-directed that philosophy and aesthetics were entirely submerged in religion and morality. In <a href="/en/topic/Greece">Greece</a>, the almost complete absence of priests and “sacred scriptures” left the human mind free and unfettered, resulting in a startling development in depth of thought. But religion as a personal experience failed to <a href="/en/topic/balance">keep pace with</a> the intellectual probings into the nature and reality of the cosmos.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_7_17"><a href="#fn_a2_7_17">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p2_8">98:2.8</a></small></sup>  In Greece, believing was subordinated to thinking; in Palestine, thinking was held subject to believing. Much of the strength of <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a> is due to its having borrowed heavily from both Hebrew morality and <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> thought.</p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p2_9">98:2.9</a></small></sup>  In <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a>, religious dogma became so crystallized as to jeopardize further growth; in <a href="/en/topic/Greece">Greece</a>, human thought became so abstract that the concept of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> resolved itself into a misty vapor of pantheistic speculation not at all unlike the impersonal <a href="/en/topic/Infinity_(The)">Infinity</a> of the <a href="/en/topic/Brahmanism">Brahman philosophers</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p2_10">98:2.10</a></small></sup>  But the average men of these times could not grasp, nor were they much interested in, the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> philosophy of self-realization and an abstract <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>; they rather craved promises of <a href="/en/topic/salvation">salvation</a>, coupled with a personal God who could hear their prayers. They exiled the philosophers, persecuted the remnants of the <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> cult, both doctrines having become much blended, and made ready for that terrible orgiastic plunge into the follies of the <a href="/en/topic/mystery_cults">mystery cults</a> which were then overspreading the <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_region">Mediterranean</a> lands. The <a href="/en/topic/Eleusinian_mysteries">Eleusinian mysteries</a> grew up within the Olympian pantheon, a Greek version of the worship of fertility; <a href="/en/topic/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> nature worship flourished; the best of the cults was the <a href="/en/topic/Orphic_brotherhood">Orphic brotherhood</a>, whose moral preachments and promises of salvation made a great appeal to many.</p>
<p id="p2_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p2_11">98:2.11</a></small></sup>  All <a href="/en/topic/Greece">Greece</a> became involved in these new methods of attaining salvation, these emotional and fiery ceremonials. No nation ever attained such heights of artistic philosophy in so short a time; none ever created such an advanced system of ethics practically without Deity and entirely devoid of the promise of human salvation; no nation ever plunged so quickly, deeply, and violently into such depths of intellectual stagnation, moral depravity, and spiritual poverty as these same Greek peoples when they flung themselves into the mad whirl of the mystery cults.</p>

<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p3_1">98:3.1</a></small></sup>  Having grown out of the earlier religious forms of worship of the family gods into the tribal reverence for <a href="/en/topic/Mars_(god)">Mars</a>, the god of war, it was natural that the later religion of the Latins was more of a political observance than were the intellectual systems of the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Brahmanism">Brahmans</a> or the more spiritual religions of several other peoples.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p3_2">98:3.2</a></small></sup>  In the great monotheistic renaissance of <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a>’s gospel during the sixth century before <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a>, too few of the <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> missionaries penetrated <a href="/en/topic/Italy">Italy</a>, and those who did were unable to overcome the influence of the rapidly spreading <a href="/en/topic/Etruscan_priesthood">Etruscan priesthood</a> with its new galaxy of gods and temples, all of which became organized into the Roman state religion. This religion of the <a href="/en/topic/Latin">Latin</a> tribes was not trivial and venal like that of the Greeks, neither was it austere and tyrannical like that of the <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a>; it consisted for the most part in the observance of mere forms, vows, and taboos.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_2_10"><a href="#fn_a3_2_10">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p4_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p4_6">98:4.6</a></small></sup>  The Phrygian and Egyptian mysteries taught that the divine son (respectively <a href="/en/topic/Attis">Attis</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Osiris">Osiris</a>) had experienced death and had been resurrected by divine power, and further that all who were properly initiated into the mystery, and who reverently celebrated the anniversary of the god’s death and resurrection, would thereby become partakers of his divine nature and his immortality.</p>

<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p5_1">98:5.1</a></small></sup>  The Phrygian and Egyptian mysteries eventually gave way before the greatest of all the <a href="/en/topic/mystery_cults">mystery cults</a>, the worship of <a href="/en/topic/Mithras">Mithras</a>. The Mithraic cult made its appeal to a wide range of human nature and gradually supplanted both of its predecessors. <a href="/en/topic/Mithraism">Mithraism</a> spread over the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_Empire">Roman Empire</a> through the propagandizing of Roman legions recruited in the <a href="/en/topic/Levant">Levant</a>, where this religion was the vogue, for they carried this belief wherever they went.

But by the time Mithraism reached <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a>, it had become greatly improved by the absorption of many of Zoroaster’s teachings.

<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p5_3">98:5.3</a></small></sup>  The Mithraic cult portrayed a militant god taking origin in a great rock, engaging in valiant exploits, and causing water to gush forth from a rock struck with his arrows. There was a <a href="/en/topic/floods">flood</a> from which one man escaped in a specially built boat and a last supper which <a href="/en/topic/Mithras">Mithras</a> celebrated with the sun-god before he ascended into the heavens. This sun-god, or <a href="/en/topic/Sol_Invictus">Sol Invictus</a>, was a degeneration of the <a href="/en/topic/Ahura-Mazda">Ahura-Mazda</a> deity concept of <a href="/en/topic/Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrianism</a>. Mithras was conceived as the surviving champion of the sun-god in his struggle with the god of darkness. And in recognition of his slaying the mythical sacred <a href="/en/topic/bulls">bull</a>, Mithras was made immortal, being exalted to the station of intercessor for the human race among the gods on high.</p>
<p id="p5_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p5_4">98:5.4</a></small></sup>  The adherents of this cult worshiped in <a href="/en/topic/caves">caves</a> and other secret places, chanting hymns, mumbling magic, eating the flesh of the sacrificial animals, and <a href="/en/topic/blood_drinking">drinking the blood</a>. Three times a day they worshiped, with special weekly ceremonials on the day of the sun-god and with the most elaborate observance of all on the annual festival of Mithras, <a href="/en/topic/Christmas">December twenty-fifth</a>. It was believed that the partaking of the sacrament ensured eternal life, the immediate passing, after death, to the bosom of Mithras, there to tarry in bliss until the <a href="/en/topic/judgment">judgment</a> day. On the judgment day the Mithraic keys of heaven would unlock the gates of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> for the reception of the faithful; whereupon all the unbaptized of the living and the dead would be annihilated upon the return of Mithras to earth. It was taught that, when a man died, he went before Mithras for judgment, and that at the end of the world Mithras would summon all the dead from their graves to face <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> judgment. The wicked would be destroyed by fire, and the righteous would reign with Mithras forever.</p>
<p id="p5_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p5_5">98:5.5</a></small></sup>  At first it was a religion only for men, and there were seven different orders into which believers could be successively initiated. Later on, the wives and daughters of believers were admitted to the <a href="/en/topic/Mother_of_God_cult">temples of the Great Mother</a>, which adjoined the Mithraic temples.
