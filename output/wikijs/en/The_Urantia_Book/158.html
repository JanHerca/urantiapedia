It was to fit them for this revelation of himself that he tarried with them at the foot of the mountain. But they could not attain those spiritual levels which would justify their exposure to the full experience of the visitation of the <a href="/en/topic/celestial_beings">celestial beings</a> so soon to appear on earth. And since he could not take all of his associates with him, he decided to take only the three who were in the habit of accompanying him on such special vigils. Accordingly, only <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a> shared even a part of this unique experience with the Master.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_2_11"><a href="#fn_a0_2_11">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_2_14"><a href="#fn_a0_2_14">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p1_1">158:1.1</a></small></sup>  Early on the morning of Monday, August 15, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the three apostles began the ascent of <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Hermon">Mount Hermon</a>, and this was six days after the memorable noontide confession of <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> by the roadside under the mulberry trees.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p1_2">158:1.2</a></small></sup>  Jesus had been summoned to go up on the mountain, apart by himself, for the transaction of important matters having to do with the progress of his bestowal in the flesh as this experience was related to the universe of his own creation. It is significant that this extraordinary event was timed to occur while Jesus and the apostles were in the lands of the gentiles, and that it actually transpired on a mountain of the gentiles.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_11"><a href="#fn_a1_2_11">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_2_14"><a href="#fn_a1_2_14">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p1_3">158:1.3</a></small></sup>  They reached their destination, about halfway up the mountain, shortly before noon, and while eating lunch, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> told the three apostles something of his experience in the hills to the east of <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> shortly after his baptism and also some more of his experience on <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Hermon">Mount Hermon</a> in connection with his former visit to this lonely retreat.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p1_4">158:1.4</a></small></sup>  When a boy, Jesus used to ascend the hill near his home and dream of the battles which had been fought by the armies of empires on the plain of <a href="/en/topic/Esdraelon">Esdraelon</a>; now he ascended Mount Hermon to receive the endowment which was to prepare him to descend upon the plains of the Jordan to enact the closing scenes of the drama of his bestowal on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> could have relinquished the struggle this day on Mount Hermon and returned to his rule of the universe domains, but he not only chose to meet the requirements of his order of divine sonship embraced in the mandate of the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a> on <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>, but he also elected to meet <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> and full measure of the present will of his Paradise Father. On this day in August three of his apostles saw him decline to be invested with full universe authority. They looked on in amazement as the celestial <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> departed, leaving him alone to finish out his earth life as the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_God">Son of God</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p1_5">158:1.5</a></small></sup>  The faith of the <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a> was at a high point at the time of the feeding of the five thousand, and then it rapidly fell almost to zero. Now, as a result of the Master‚Äôs admission of his divinity, the lagging faith of the twelve arose in the next few weeks to its highest pitch, only to undergo a progressive decline. The third revival of their faith did not occur until after the Master‚Äôs resurrection.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p1_6">158:1.6</a></small></sup>  It was about three o‚Äôclock on this beautiful afternoon that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> took leave of the three apostles, saying: ‚ÄúI go apart by myself for a season to commune with the Father and his <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a>; I bid you tarry here and, while awaiting my return, pray that the Father‚Äôs will may be done in all your experience in connection with the further bestowal mission of the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>.‚Äù And after saying this to them, Jesus withdrew for a long conference with <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Father_Melchizedek">Father Melchizedek</a>, not returning until about six o‚Äôclock. When Jesus saw their anxiety over his prolonged absence, he said: ‚ÄúWhy were you afraid? You well know I must be about my <a href="/en/topic/Father‚Äôs_business">Father‚Äôs business</a>; wherefore do you doubt when I am not with you? I now declare that the Son of Man has chosen to go through his full life in your midst and as one of you.

<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p1_8">158:1.8</a></small></sup>  When the three had been fast asleep for about half an hour, they were suddenly awakened by a near-by crackling sound, and much to their amazement and consternation, on looking about them, they beheld <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> in intimate converse with two brilliant beings clothed in the habiliments of the light of the celestial world<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.

The <a href="/en/topic/physical_controllers">physical controllers</a> had arranged for the apostles to witness this scene because of Jesus‚Äô request.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_8_13"><a href="#fn_a1_8_13">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_8_22"><a href="#fn_a1_8_22">[6]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_8_5"><a href="#fn_s1_8_5">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p1_9">158:1.9</a></small></sup>  The three apostles were so badly frightened that they were slow in collecting their wits, but <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, who was first to recover himself, said, as the dazzling vision faded from before them and they observed Jesus standing alone: ‚ÄúJesus, <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, it is good to have been here<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>.

If you are willing, let us abide here, and we will erect three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.‚Äù And <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Peter</a> said this because of his confusion, and because nothing else came into his mind at just that moment.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_9_14"><a href="#fn_a1_9_14">[4]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_9_5"><a href="#fn_s1_9_5">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p1_10">158:1.10</a></small></sup>  While Peter was yet speaking, a silvery cloud drew near and overshadowed the four of them. The apostles now became greatly frightened, and as they fell down on their faces to worship, they heard a voice, the same that had spoken on the occasion of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>‚Äô baptism, say: ‚ÄúThis is my beloved Son; give heed to him<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>.‚Äù And when the cloud vanished, again was Jesus alone with the three, and he reached down and touched them, saying: ‚ÄúArise and be not afraid; you shall see greater things than this.‚Äù But the apostles were truly afraid; they were a silent and thoughtful trio as they made ready to descend the mountain shortly before midnight.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_10_16"><a href="#fn_a1_10_16">[7]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_10_5"><a href="#fn_s1_10_5">[3]</a></sup></p>

But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they received him not but did to him whatsoever they willed.‚Äù And then did the three apostles perceive that he referred to <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John the Baptist</a> as Elijah.

Although Peter, James, and John pondered all this in their minds, they spoke not of it to any man until after the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>‚Äôs resurrection.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p2_4">158:2.4</a></small></sup>  As they continued to descend the mountain, Jesus said to them: ‚ÄúYou would not receive me as the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>; therefore have I consented to be received in accordance with your settled determination, but, mistake not, the will of my Father must prevail.

At the time of the arrival of this group the nine apostles, at least the majority of them, had succumbed to their old temptation‚Äîthat of discussing who should be greatest in the coming kingdom; they were busily arguing about the probable positions which would be assigned the individual apostles.

What a shock these words were to these Galilean fishermen who persisted in dreaming of an earthly kingdom with positions of honor for themselves! But their loyal hearts were stirred by this courageous appeal, and not one of them was minded to forsake him. Jesus was not sending them alone into the conflict; he was leading them. He asked only that they bravely follow.</p>

As the days passed, <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a>, recalling their experience upon the mount of the transfiguration, arrived at a fuller understanding of certain of these matters.</p>

Jesus had always been patient with their human shortcomings, but not so when faced by an impending threat against the program of implicitly carrying out his Father‚Äôs will regarding the remainder of his earth career. The apostles were literally stunned; they were amazed and horrified. They could not find words to express their sorrow. Slowly they began to realize what the Master must endure, and that they must go through these experiences with him, but they did not awaken to the reality of these coming events until long after these early hints of the impending tragedy of his latter days.</p>
