<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p0_1">146:0.1</a></small></sup>  THE first public preaching tour of <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> began on <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a>, January 18, A.D. 28, and continued for about two months, ending with the return to <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> on March 17. On this tour <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the twelve apostles, assisted by the former apostles of John, preached the gospel and baptized believers in <a href="/en/topic/Rimmon">Rimmon</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Jotapata">Jotapata</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Ramah">Ramah</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Zebulun">Zebulun</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Iron_Age">Iron</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Gischala">Gischala</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Chorazin">Chorazin</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Madon">Madon</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Cana">Cana</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Nain">Nain</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Endor">Endor</a>. In these cities they tarried and taught, while in many other smaller towns they proclaimed the gospel of the kingdom as they passed through.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p0_2">146:0.2</a></small></sup>  This was <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> time Jesus permitted his associates to preach without restraint. On this tour he cautioned them on only three occasions; he admonished them to remain away from <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> and to be discreet when passing through Capernaum and <a href="/en/topic/Tiberias">Tiberias</a>. It was a source of great satisfaction to the apostles at last to feel they were at liberty to preach and teach without restriction, and they threw themselves into the work of preaching the gospel, ministering to the sick, and baptizing believers, with great earnestness and joy.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_2_53"><a href="#fn_a0_2_53">[1]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. PREACHING AT RIMMON </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p1_1">146:1.1</a></small></sup>  The small city of <a href="/en/topic/Rimmon">Rimmon</a> had once been dedicated to the worship of a <a href="/en/topic/Babylon">Babylonian</a> god of the air, <a href="/en/topic/Ramman">Ramman</a>. Many of the earlier Babylonian and later Zoroastrian teachings were still embraced in the beliefs of the Rimmonites; therefore did <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the twenty-four devote much of their time to the task of making plain the difference between these older beliefs and the new gospel of the kingdom. <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> here preached one of the great sermons of his early career on “<a href="/en/topic/Aaron_(Old_Testament)">Aaron</a> and the Golden Calf<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p1_2">146:1.2</a></small></sup>  Although many of the citizens of Rimmon became believers in Jesus’ teachings, they made great trouble for their brethren in later years. It is difficult to convert nature worshipers to the full fellowship of the adoration of a spiritual ideal during the short space of a single lifetime.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p1_3">146:1.3</a></small></sup>  Many of the better of the <a href="/en/topic/Babylon">Babylonian</a> and Persian ideas of light and darkness, good and evil, time and eternity, were later incorporated in the doctrines of so-called <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a>, and their inclusion rendered the Christian teachings more immediately acceptable to the peoples of the Near East. In like manner, the inclusion of many of <a href="/en/topic/Plato">Plato</a>’s theories of the ideal spirit or invisible patterns of all things visible and material, as later adapted by Philo to the Hebrew theology, made <a href="/en/topic/Paul">Paul</a>’s Christian teachings more easy of acceptance by the western <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p1_4">146:1.4</a></small></sup>  It was at <a href="/en/topic/Rimmon">Rimmon</a> that <a href="/en/topic/Todan">Todan</a> first heard the gospel of the kingdom, and he later carried this message into <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and far beyond. He was among <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> to preach the good news to those who dwelt beyond the <a href="/en/topic/Euphrates_River">Euphrates</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. AT JOTAPATA </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p2_1">146:2.1</a></small></sup>  While the common people of <a href="/en/topic/Jotapata">Jotapata</a> heard <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and his apostles gladly and many accepted the gospel of the kingdom, it was the discourse of Jesus to the twenty-four on the second evening of their sojourn in this small town that distinguishes the Jotapata mission. <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a> was confused in his mind about the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s teachings concerning prayer, thanksgiving, and worship, and in response to his question Jesus spoke at great length in further explanation of his teaching. Summarized in modern phraseology, this discourse may be presented as emphasizing the following points:<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_1_53"><a href="#fn_a2_1_53">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_1_30"><a href="#fn_a2_1_30">[2]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_2"><a href="#fn_s2_1_2">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_1_6"><a href="#fn_s2_1_6">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_1_7"><a href="#fn_s2_1_7">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p2_2">146:2.2</a></small></sup>  1. The conscious and persistent regard for <a href="/en/topic/iniquity">iniquity</a> in the heart of man gradually destroys the prayer connection of the human soul with the spirit circuits of communication between man and his Maker<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>. Naturally <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> hears the petition of his child, but when the human heart deliberately and persistently harbors the concepts of iniquity, there gradually ensues the loss of personal communion between the earth child and his heavenly Father.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_2_48"><a href="#fn_a2_2_48">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_2_15"><a href="#fn_a2_2_15">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_2_25"><a href="#fn_a2_2_25">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p2_3">146:2.3</a></small></sup>  2. That <a href="/en/topic/prayer">prayer</a> which is inconsistent with the known and established laws of God is an abomination to the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Deities">Paradise Deities</a>. If man will not listen to the Gods as they speak to their creation in the laws of spirit, mind, and matter, the very act of such deliberate and conscious disdain by the creature turns the ears of spirit personalities away from hearing the personal petitions of such lawless and disobedient <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a>. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> quoted to his apostles from the Prophet <a href="/en/topic/Zechariah">Zechariah</a>: “But they refused to hearken and pulled away the shoulder and stopped their ears that they should not hear. Yes, they made their hearts adamant like a stone, lest they should hear my <a href="/en/topic/law">law</a> and the words which I sent by my spirit through the prophets; therefore did the results of their evil thinking come as a great wrath upon their guilty heads. And so it came to pass that they cried for mercy, but there was no ear open to hear<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>.” And then Jesus quoted the proverb of the wise man who said: “He who turns away his ear from hearing the divine law, even his prayer shall be an abomination<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_3_10"><a href="#fn_a2_3_10">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_3_31"><a href="#fn_a2_3_31">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_3_15"><a href="#fn_a2_3_15">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_3_54"><a href="#fn_a2_3_54">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p2_4">146:2.4</a></small></sup>  3. By opening the human end of the channel of the God-man communication, mortals make immediately available the ever-flowing stream of divine ministry to the creatures of the worlds. When man hears <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>’s spirit speak within the human heart, inherent in such an experience is the fact that God simultaneously hears that man’s prayer. Even the <a href="/en/topic/forgiveness">forgiveness</a> of sin operates in this same unerring fashion<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>. The Father in heaven has forgiven you even before you have thought to ask him, but such forgiveness is not available in your personal religious experience until such a time as you forgive your fellow men. God’s forgiveness in <i>fact</i> is not conditioned upon your forgiving your fellows, but in <i>experience</i> it is exactly so conditioned. And this fact of the synchrony of divine and human forgiveness was thus recognized and linked together in the prayer which Jesus taught the apostles.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_4_34"><a href="#fn_a2_4_34">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_4_39"><a href="#fn_a2_4_39">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_4_40"><a href="#fn_a2_4_40">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_4_15"><a href="#fn_a2_4_15">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_4_54"><a href="#fn_a2_4_54">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_4_42"><a href="#fn_a2_4_42">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p2_5">146:2.5</a></small></sup>  4. There is a basic law of <a href="/en/topic/justice">justice</a> in the universe which <a href="/en/topic/mercy">mercy</a> is powerless to circumvent. The unselfish glories of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> are not possible of reception by a thoroughly selfish creature of the realms of time and space. Even the infinite love of God cannot force the <a href="/en/topic/salvation">salvation</a> of eternal <a href="/en/topic/survival_(of_mortal_death)">survival</a> upon any mortal creature who does not choose to survive. Mercy has great latitude of bestowal, but, after all, there are mandates of justice which even love combined with mercy cannot effectively abrogate. Again <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> quoted from the Hebrew scriptures: “I have called and you refused to hear; I stretched out my hand, but no man regarded. You have set at naught all my counsel, and you have rejected my reproof, and because of this rebellious attitude it becomes inevitable that you shall call upon me and fail to receive an answer. Having rejected the way of life, you may seek me diligently in your times of suffering, but you will not find me<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_5_6"><a href="#fn_a2_5_6">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_5_15"><a href="#fn_a2_5_15">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p2_6">146:2.6</a></small></sup>  5. They who would receive mercy must show mercy; <a href="/en/topic/Roman_magistrate_in_Rome">judge</a> not that you be not judged<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>. With the spirit with which you judge others you also shall be judged. Mercy does not wholly abrogate universe fairness. In the end it will prove true: “Whoso stops his ears to the cry of the poor, he also shall some day cry for help, and no one will hear him<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>.” The sincerity of any <a href="/en/topic/prayer">prayer</a> is the assurance of its being heard; the spiritual wisdom and universe consistency of any petition is the determiner of the time, manner, and degree of the answer. A wise father does not <i>literally</i> answer the foolish prayers of his ignorant and inexperienced children, albeit the children may derive much pleasure and real soul satisfaction from the making of such absurd petitions.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_6_44"><a href="#fn_a2_6_44">[9]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_6_0"><a href="#fn_s2_6_0">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_6_1"><a href="#fn_s2_6_1">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p2_7">146:2.7</a></small></sup>  6. When you have become wholly dedicated to the doing of the will of the Father in heaven, the answer to all your petitions will be forthcoming because your prayers will be in full accordance with the Father’s will, and the Father’s will is ever manifest throughout his vast universe<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b9"><a href="#fn_b9">[9]</a></sup>. What the true son desires and the infinite Father wills IS. Such a prayer cannot remain unanswered, and no other sort of petition can possibly be fully answered.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_7_18"><a href="#fn_a2_7_18">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_7_38"><a href="#fn_a2_7_38">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_7_15"><a href="#fn_a2_7_15">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p2_8">146:2.8</a></small></sup>  7. The cry of the righteous is the <a href="/en/topic/faith">faith</a> act of the child of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> which opens the door of the Father’s storehouse of goodness, truth, and mercy, and these good <a href="/en/topic/gifts">gifts</a> have long been in waiting for the son’s approach and personal appropriation. Prayer does not change the divine attitude toward man, but it does change man’s attitude toward the changeless Father. The <i>motive</i> of the <a href="/en/topic/prayer">prayer</a> gives it right of way to the divine ear, not the social, economic, or outward religious status of the one who prays.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_8_13"><a href="#fn_a2_8_13">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_8_33"><a href="#fn_a2_8_33">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_8_29"><a href="#fn_a2_8_29">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_8_54"><a href="#fn_a2_8_54">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p2_9">146:2.9</a></small></sup>  8. Prayer may not be employed to avoid the delays of time or to transcend the handicaps of space. Prayer is not designed as a technique for aggrandizing self or for gaining unfair advantage over one’s fellows. A thoroughly selfish soul cannot pray in the true sense of the word. Said <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>: “Let your supreme delight be in the character of God, and he shall surely give you the sincere desires of your heart<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup>.” “Commit your way to the Lord; trust in him, and he will act<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b11"><a href="#fn_b11">[11]</a></sup>.” “For the Lord hears the cry of the needy, and he will regard the prayer of the destitute<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b12"><a href="#fn_b12">[12]</a></sup>.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_9_44"><a href="#fn_a2_9_44">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_9_19"><a href="#fn_a2_9_19">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_9_24"><a href="#fn_a2_9_24">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p2_10">146:2.10</a></small></sup>  9. “I have come forth from the Father; if, therefore, you are ever in doubt as to what you would ask of the Father, ask in my name, and I will present your petition in accordance with your real needs and desires and in accordance with my Father’s will.” Guard against the great danger of becoming self-centered in your prayers. Avoid praying much for yourself; pray more for the spiritual progress of your brethren. Avoid materialistic praying; pray in the spirit and for the abundance of the <a href="/en/topic/gifts">gifts</a> of the spirit<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b13"><a href="#fn_b13">[13]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_10_8"><a href="#fn_a2_10_8">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_10_38"><a href="#fn_a2_10_38">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p2_11">146:2.11</a></small></sup>  10. When you pray for the sick and afflicted, do not expect that your petitions will take the place of loving and intelligent ministry to the necessities of these afflicted ones. Pray for the welfare of your families, friends, and fellows, but especially pray for those who curse you, and make loving petitions for those who persecute you<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b14"><a href="#fn_b14">[14]</a></sup>. “But when to pray, I will not say. Only the spirit that dwells within you may move you to the utterance of those petitions which are expressive of your inner relationship with the Father of spirits<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b15"><a href="#fn_b15">[15]</a></sup>.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_11_29"><a href="#fn_a2_11_29">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_11_40"><a href="#fn_a2_11_40">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p2_12">146:2.12</a></small></sup>  11. Many resort to <a href="/en/topic/prayer">prayer</a> only when in trouble. Such a practice is thoughtless and misleading. True, you do well to pray when harassed, but you should also be mindful to speak as a son to your Father even when all goes well with your soul.

Do not let men hear your personal prayers. Prayers of thanksgiving are appropriate for groups of worshipers, but the prayer of the soul is a personal matter. There is but one form of prayer which is appropriate for all <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>’s children, and that is: “Nevertheless, your will be done.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_12_15"><a href="#fn_a2_12_15">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_12_54"><a href="#fn_a2_12_54">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_12_61"><a href="#fn_a2_12_61">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p2_13">146:2.13</a></small></sup>  12. All believers in this gospel should pray sincerely for the extension of the kingdom of heaven. Of all the prayers of the Hebrew scriptures he commented most approvingly on the petition of the Psalmist: “Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. Purge me from secret sins and keep back your servant from presumptuous transgression<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b17"><a href="#fn_b17">[17]</a></sup>.” <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> commented at great length on the relation of prayer to careless and offending speech, quoting: “<a href="/en/topic/Set">Set</a> a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b18"><a href="#fn_b18">[18]</a></sup>.” “The human <a href="/en/topic/tongue">tongue</a>,” said Jesus, “is a member which few men can tame, but the spirit within can transform this unruly member into a kindly voice of tolerance and an inspiring minister of mercy<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b19"><a href="#fn_b19">[19]</a></sup>.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_13_3"><a href="#fn_a2_13_3">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_13_5"><a href="#fn_a2_13_5">[23]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_13_21"><a href="#fn_a2_13_21">[24]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_13_32"><a href="#fn_a2_13_32">[25]</a></sup></p>

How they wished he would cleanse another leper or in some other manner so manifest his power as to attract the attention of the people! But the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> was unmoved by their earnest urging.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_6_20"><a href="#fn_a4_6_20">[61]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p5" class="toc-header"><a href="#p5" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 5. BACK IN CANA </h2>
<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p5_1">146:5.1</a></small></sup>  The apostolic party was greatly cheered when <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> announced, “Tomorrow we go to <a href="/en/topic/Cana">Cana</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b33"><a href="#fn_b33">[33]</a></sup>.” They knew they would have a sympathetic hearing at Cana, for Jesus was well known there. They were doing well with their work of bringing people into the kingdom when, on the third day, there arrived in Cana a certain prominent citizen of <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Titus_(Emperor)">Titus</a>, who was a partial believer, and whose son was critically ill<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b34"><a href="#fn_b34">[34]</a></sup>. He heard that Jesus was at Cana; so he hastened over to see him. The believers at Capernaum thought Jesus could heal any sickness.</p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p5_2">146:5.2</a></small></sup>  When this nobleman had located Jesus in Cana, he besought him to hurry over to Capernaum and heal his afflicted son. While the apostles stood by in breathless expectancy, Jesus, looking at the father of the sick boy, said: “How long shall I bear with you? The power of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> is in your midst, but except you see signs and behold wonders, you refuse to believe.” But the nobleman pleaded with Jesus, saying: “My Lord, I do believe, but come ere my child perishes, for when I left him he was even then at the point of death.” And when Jesus had bowed his head a moment in silent meditation, he suddenly spoke, “Return to your home; your son will live.” Titus believed the word of Jesus and hastened back to Capernaum. And as he was returning, his servants came out to meet him, saying, “Rejoice, for your son is improved—he lives.” Then Titus inquired of them at what hour the boy began to mend, and when the servants answered “yesterday about the seventh hour the fever left him,” the father recalled that it was about that hour when Jesus had said, “Your son will live.” And Titus henceforth believed with a whole heart, and all his family also believed. This son became a mighty minister of the kingdom and later yielded up his life with those who suffered in <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a>. Though the entire household of Titus, their friends, and even the apostles regarded this episode as a miracle, it was not. At least this was not a miracle of curing physical disease<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b35"><a href="#fn_b35">[35]</a></sup>. It was merely a case of preknowledge concerning the course of natural law, just such knowledge as Jesus frequently resorted to subsequent to his baptism<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b36"><a href="#fn_b36">[36]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_2_53"><a href="#fn_a5_2_53">[1]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s5_2_5"><a href="#fn_s5_2_5">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p5_3">146:5.3</a></small></sup>  Again was <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> compelled to hasten away from <a href="/en/topic/Cana">Cana</a> because of the undue attention attracted by the second episode of this sort to attend his ministry in this village. The townspeople remembered the water and the wine, and now that he was supposed to have healed the <a href="/en/topic/Titus_of_Capernaum">nobleman</a>’s son at so great a distance, they came to him, not only bringing the sick and afflicted but also sending <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> requesting that he heal sufferers at a distance. And when Jesus saw that the whole countryside was aroused, he said, “Let us go to <a href="/en/topic/Nain">Nain</a>.”</p>
<h2 id="p6" class="toc-header"><a href="#p6" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 6. NAIN AND THE WIDOW’S SON </h2>
<p id="p6_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p6_1">146:6.1</a></small></sup>  These people believed in signs; they were a wonder-seeking generation. By this time the people of central and southern <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> had become miracle minded regarding <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and his personal ministry. Scores, hundreds, of honest persons suffering from purely nervous disorders and afflicted with emotional disturbances came into Jesus’ presence and then returned home to their friends announcing that Jesus had healed them. And such cases of mental healing these ignorant and simple-minded people regarded as physical healing, miraculous cures.</p>
<p id="p6_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p6_2">146:6.2</a></small></sup>  When Jesus sought to leave <a href="/en/topic/Cana">Cana</a> and go to <a href="/en/topic/Nain">Nain</a>, a great multitude of believers and many curious people followed after him. They were bent on beholding miracles and wonders, and they were not to be disappointed. As Jesus and his apostles drew near the gate of the city, they met a funeral procession on its way to the near-by cemetery, carrying the only son of a widowed mother of Nain<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b37"><a href="#fn_b37">[37]</a></sup>. This woman was much respected, and half of the village followed the bearers of the bier of this supposedly dead boy. When the funeral procession had come up to Jesus and his followers, the widow and her friends recognized the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and besought him to bring the son back to life. Their miracle expectancy was aroused to such a high pitch they thought Jesus could cure any human disease, and why could not such a healer even raise the dead? Jesus, while being thus importuned, stepped forward and, raising the covering of the bier, examined the boy. Discovering that the young man was not really dead, he perceived the tragedy which his presence could avert; so, turning to the mother, he said: “Weep not. Your son is not dead; he sleeps. He will be restored to you.” And then, taking the young man by the hand, he said, “Awake and arise.” And the youth who was supposed to be dead presently sat up and began to speak, and Jesus sent them back to their homes.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s6_2_5"><a href="#fn_s6_2_5">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p6_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p6_3">146:6.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> endeavored to calm the multitude and vainly tried to explain that the lad was not really dead, that he had not brought him back from the grave, but it was useless. The multitude which followed him, and the whole village of Nain, were aroused to the highest pitch of emotional frenzy<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b38"><a href="#fn_b38">[38]</a></sup>. Fear seized many, panic others, while still others fell to praying and wailing over their sins. And it was not until long after nightfall that the clamoring multitude could be dispersed. And, of course, notwithstanding Jesus’ statement that the boy was not dead, everyone insisted that a miracle had been wrought, even the dead raised. Although Jesus told them the boy was merely in a deep sleep, they explained that that was the manner of his speaking and called attention to the fact that he always in great modesty tried to hide his miracles.</p>
<p id="p6_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p6_4">146:6.4</a></small></sup>  So the word went abroad throughout <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> and into <a href="/en/topic/Judea">Judea</a> that Jesus had raised the widow’s son from the dead, and many who heard this report believed it. Never was Jesus able to make even all his apostles fully understand that the widow’s son was not really dead when he bade him awake and arise. But he did impress them sufficiently to keep it out of all subsequent records except that of <a href="/en/topic/Luke">Luke</a>, who recorded it as the episode had been related to him<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b39"><a href="#fn_b39">[39]</a></sup>.

<p id="p7_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p7_1">146:7.1</a></small></sup>  At <a href="/en/topic/Endor">Endor</a> <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> escaped for a few days from the clamoring multitudes in quest of physical healing.

Jesus plainly told his apostles that the stray and rebellious <a href="/en/topic/midwayers">midwayers</a> who had oftentimes impersonated the supposed spirits of the dead would soon be brought under control so that they could no more do these strange things. He told his followers that, after he returned to the Father, and after they had poured out their spirit upon all flesh, no more could such semispirit beings—so-called unclean spirits—possess the feeble- and evil-minded among <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a7_1_15"><a href="#fn_a7_1_15">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p7_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p7_2">146:7.2</a></small></sup>  Jesus further explained to his apostles that the spirits of departed human beings do not come back to the world of their origin to communicate with their living fellows. Only after the passing of a dispensational age would it be possible for the advancing spirit of mortal man to return to earth and then only in exceptional cases and as a part of the spiritual administration of the planet.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a7_2_15"><a href="#fn_a7_2_15">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_2_0"><a href="#fn_a7_2_0">[62]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_2_41"><a href="#fn_a7_2_41">[63]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_2_50"><a href="#fn_a7_2_50">[64]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s7_2_4"><a href="#fn_s7_2_4">[9]</a></sup></p>
