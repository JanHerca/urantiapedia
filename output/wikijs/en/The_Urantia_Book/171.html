<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p0_1">171:0.1</a></small></sup>  THE day after the memorable sermon on “The Kingdom of Heaven,” <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> announced that on the following day he and the apostles would depart for the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, visiting numerous cities in southern <a href="/en/topic/Perea">Perea</a> on the way<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p0_2">171:0.2</a></small></sup>  The address on the kingdom and the announcement that he was going to the Passover set all his followers to thinking that he was going up to Jerusalem to inaugurate the temporal kingdom of Jewish supremacy. No matter what Jesus said about the nonmaterial character of the kingdom, he could not wholly remove from the minds of his Jewish hearers the idea that the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a> was to establish some kind of nationalistic government with headquarters at Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p0_3">171:0.3</a></small></sup>  What <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> said in his <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> sermon only tended to confuse the majority of his followers; very few were enlightened by the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s discourse. The leaders understood something of his teachings regarding the inner kingdom, “the kingdom of heaven within you,” but they also knew that he had spoken about another and future kingdom, and it was this kingdom they believed he was now going up to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> to establish<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>. When they were disappointed in this expectation, when he was rejected by the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>, and later on, when Jerusalem was literally destroyed, they still clung to this hope, sincerely believing that the Master would soon return to the world in great power and majestic glory to establish the promised kingdom.</p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p0_4">171:0.4</a></small></sup>  It was on this <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a> afternoon that <a href="/en/topic/Salome_(wife_of_Zebedee)">Salome</a> the mother of <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> and <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John Zebedee</a> came to Jesus with her two apostle sons and, in the manner of approaching an Oriental potentate, sought to have Jesus promise in advance to grant whatever request she might make. But the Master would not promise; instead, he asked her, “What do you want me to do for you?” Then answered <a href="/en/topic/Salome_(sister_of_Mary_mother_of_Jesus)">Salome</a>: “Master, now that you are going up to Jerusalem to establish the kingdom, I would ask you in advance to promise me that these my sons shall have honor with you, the one to sit on your right hand and the other to sit on your left hand in your kingdom<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p0_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p0_5">171:0.5</a></small></sup>  When <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> heard Salome’s request, he said: “Woman, you know not what you ask.” And then, looking straight into the eyes of the two honor-seeking apostles, he said: “Because I have long known and loved you; because I have even lived in your mother’s house; because <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> has assigned you to be with me at all times; therefore do you permit your mother to come to me secretly, making this unseemly request. But let me ask you: Are you able to drink the <a href="/en/topic/cup">cup</a> I am about to drink?” And without a moment for thought, James and John answered, “Yes, <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, we are able.” Said Jesus: “I am saddened that you know not why we go up to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>; I am grieved that you understand not the nature of my kingdom; I am disappointed that you bring your mother to make this request of me; but I know you love me in your hearts; therefore I declare that you shall indeed drink of my cup of bitterness and share in my humiliation, but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give. Such honors are reserved for those who have been designated by my Father<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p0_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p0_6">171:0.6</a></small></sup>  By this time someone had carried word of this conference to <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> and the other apostles, and they were highly indignant that <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> and John would seek to be preferred before them, and that they would secretly go with their mother to make such a request. When they fell to arguing among themselves, Jesus called them all together and said: “You well understand how the rulers of the gentiles lord it over their subjects, and how those who are great exercise authority. But it shall not be so in the <a href="/en/topic/kingdom_of_heaven">kingdom of heaven</a>. Whosoever would be great among you, let him first become your servant. He who would be first in the kingdom, let him become your minister. I declare to you that the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> came not to be ministered to but to minister; and I now go up to Jerusalem to lay down my life in the doing of the Father’s will and in the <a href="/en/topic/service">service</a> of my brethren.” When the apostles heard these words, they withdrew by themselves to pray. That evening, in response to the labors of <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Peter</a>, James and John made suitable apologies to the ten and were restored to the good graces of their brethren.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1"><a href="#fn_a1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p0_7">171:0.7</a></small></sup>  In asking for places on the right hand and on the left hand of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, the sons of <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a> little realized that in less than one month their beloved teacher would be hanging on a Roman cross with a dying thief on one side and another transgressor on the other side. And their mother, who was present at the crucifixion, well remembered the foolish request she had made of Jesus at <a href="/en/topic/Pella">Pella</a> regarding the honors she so unwisely sought for her apostle sons.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. THE DEPARTURE FROM PELLA </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p1_1">171:1.1</a></small></sup>  On the forenoon of Monday, March 13, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and his twelve apostles took final leave of the <a href="/en/topic/Pella">Pella</a> encampment, starting south on their tour of the cities of southern <a href="/en/topic/Perea">Perea</a>, where <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a>’s associates were at work. They spent more than two weeks visiting among the seventy and then went directly to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> for the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p1_2">171:1.2</a></small></sup>  When the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> left Pella, the disciples encamped with the apostles, about one thousand in number, followed after him. About one half of this group left him at the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> ford on the road to <a href="/en/topic/Jericho">Jericho</a> when they learned he was going over to <a href="/en/topic/Heshbon">Heshbon</a>, and after he had preached the sermon on “Counting the Cost.” They went on up to Jerusalem, while the other half followed him for two weeks, visiting the towns in southern Perea.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p1_3">171:1.3</a></small></sup>  In a general way, most of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ immediate followers understood that the camp at <a href="/en/topic/Pella">Pella</a> had been abandoned, but they really thought this indicated that their Master at last intended to go to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and lay claim to <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a>’s throne. A large majority of his followers never were able to grasp any other concept of the kingdom of heaven; no matter what he taught them, they would not give up this Jewish idea of the kingdom.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p1_4">171:1.4</a></small></sup>  Acting on the instructions of the Apostle <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a>, <a href="/en/topic/David_Zebedee">David Zebedee</a> closed the visitors’ camp at Pella on <a href="/en/topic/Wednesday">Wednesday</a>, March 15. At this time almost four thousand visitors were in residence, and this does not include the one thousand and more persons who sojourned with the apostles at what was known as the teachers’ camp, and who went south with Jesus and the twelve. Much as David disliked to do it, he sold the entire equipment to numerous buyers and proceeded with the funds to Jerusalem, subsequently turning the money over to <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p1_5">171:1.5</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a> was present in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> during the tragic last week, taking his mother back with him to <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a> after the crucifixion. While awaiting <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the apostles, David stopped with <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a> at <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a> and became tremendously agitated by the manner in which the <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> had begun to persecute and harass him since his resurrection. Andrew had directed David to discontinue the messenger service; and this was construed by all as an indication of the early establishment of the kingdom at Jerusalem. David found himself without a job, and he had about decided to become the self-appointed defender of <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Nazarite_parable)">Lazarus</a> when presently the object of his indignant solicitude fled in haste to <a href="/en/topic/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. Accordingly, sometime after the resurrection and also after the death of his mother, David betook himself to Philadelphia, having first assisted <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(wife_of_Justus)">Martha</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> in disposing of their real estate; and there, in association with <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a> and Lazarus, he spent the remainder of his life, becoming the financial overseer of all those large interests of the kingdom which had their center at Philadelphia during the lifetime of Abner.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p1_6">171:1.6</a></small></sup>  Within a short time after the destruction of Jerusalem, <a href="/en/topic/Antioch">Antioch</a> became the headquarters of <i><a href="/en/topic/Christian_church,_early">Pauline Christianity</a>,</i> while Philadelphia remained the center of the <i>Abnerian kingdom of heaven.</i> From Antioch the Pauline version of the teachings of Jesus and about Jesus spread to all the Western world; from Philadelphia the missionaries of the Abnerian version of the kingdom of heaven spread throughout <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Arabia">Arabia</a> until the later times when these uncompromising emissaries of the teachings of Jesus were overwhelmed by the sudden rise of <a href="/en/topic/Islam">Islam</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. ON COUNTING THE COST </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p2_1">171:2.1</a></small></sup>  When <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the company of almost one thousand followers arrived at the <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_beyond_Jordan">Bethany ford of the Jordan</a> sometimes called <a href="/en/topic/Bethabara">Bethabara</a>, his disciples began to realize that he was not going directly to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>. While they hesitated and debated among themselves, Jesus climbed upon a huge stone and delivered that discourse which has become known as “Counting the Cost<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b9"><a href="#fn_b9">[9]</a></sup>.” The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> said:</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p2_2">171:2.2</a></small></sup>  “You who would follow after me from this time on, must be willing to pay the price of wholehearted dedication to the doing of my Father’s will. If you would be my <a href="/en/topic/disciples">disciples</a>, you must be willing to forsake father, mother, wife, <a href="/en/topic/children">children</a>, brothers, and sisters. If any one of you would now be my disciple, you must be willing to give up even your life just as the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> is about to offer up his life for the completion of the mission of doing the Father’s will on earth and in the flesh.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2"><a href="#fn_a2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p2_3">171:2.3</a></small></sup>  “If you are not willing to pay the full price, you can hardly be my disciple<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup>. Before you go further, you should each sit down and count the cost of being my disciple. Which one of you would undertake to build a <a href="/en/topic/watchtower">watchtower</a> on your lands without first sitting down to count up the cost to see whether you had money enough to complete it? If you fail thus to reckon the cost, after you have laid the foundation, you may discover that you are unable to finish that which you have begun, and therefore will all your neighbors mock you, saying, ‘Behold, this man began to build but was unable to finish his work<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b11"><a href="#fn_b11">[11]</a></sup>.’ Again, what king, when he prepares to make war upon another king, does not first sit down and take counsel as to whether he will be able, with ten thousand men, to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand? If the king cannot afford to meet his enemy because he is unprepared, he sends an embassy to this other king, even when he is yet a great way off, asking for terms of peace.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b12"><a href="#fn_b12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p2_4">171:2.4</a></small></sup>  “Now, then, must each of you sit down and count the cost of being my <a href="/en/topic/disciples">disciple</a>. From now on you will not be able to follow after us, listening to the teaching and beholding the works; you will be required to face bitter persecutions and to bear witness for this gospel in the face of crushing <a href="/en/topic/disappointment">disappointment</a>. If you are unwilling to renounce all that you are and to dedicate all that you have, then are you unworthy to be my disciple<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b13"><a href="#fn_b13">[13]</a></sup>. If you have already conquered yourself within your own heart, you need have no fear of that outward victory which you must presently gain when the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> is rejected by the chief priests and the <a href="/en/topic/Sadducees">Sadducees</a> and is given into the hands of mocking unbelievers.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p2_5">171:2.5</a></small></sup>  “Now should you examine yourself to find out your motive for being my disciple<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b14"><a href="#fn_b14">[14]</a></sup>. If you seek honor and glory, if you are worldly minded, you are like the <a href="/en/topic/salt">salt</a> when it has lost its savor<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b15"><a href="#fn_b15">[15]</a></sup>. And when that which is valued for its saltiness has lost its savor, wherewith shall it be seasoned? Such a condiment is useless; it is fit only to be cast out among the refuse. Now have I warned you to turn back to your homes in peace if you are not willing to drink with me the <a href="/en/topic/cup">cup</a> which is being prepared. Again and again have I told you that my kingdom is not of this world, but you will not believe me. He who has ears to hear let him hear what I say.”</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p2_6">171:2.6</a></small></sup>  Immediately after speaking these words, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, leading the twelve, started off on the way to <a href="/en/topic/Heshbon">Heshbon</a>, followed by about five hundred. After a brief delay the other half of the multitude went on up to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. His apostles, together with the leading disciples, thought much about these words, but still they clung to the belief that, after this brief period of adversity and trial, the kingdom would certainly be set up somewhat in accordance with their long-cherished hopes.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. THE PEREAN TOUR </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p3_1">171:3.1</a></small></sup>  For more than two weeks <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the twelve, followed by a crowd of several hundred disciples, journeyed about in southern <a href="/en/topic/Perea">Perea</a>, visiting all of the towns wherein the seventy labored. Many gentiles lived in this region, and since few were going up to the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> feast at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> of the kingdom went right on with their work of teaching and preaching.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p3_2">171:3.2</a></small></sup>  Jesus met <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a> at <a href="/en/topic/Heshbon">Heshbon</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> directed that the labors of the seventy should not be interrupted by the Passover feast; Jesus advised that the messengers should go forward with their work in complete disregard of what was about to happen at Jerusalem. He also counseled Abner to permit the women’s corps, at least such as desired, to go to Jerusalem for the Passover. And this was <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> time Abner ever saw Jesus in the flesh. His farewell to Abner was: “My son, I know you will be true to the kingdom, and I pray the Father to grant you wisdom that you may love and understand your brethren.”</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p3_3">171:3.3</a></small></sup>  As they traveled from city to city, large numbers of their followers deserted to go on to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> so that, by the time <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> started for the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a>, the number of those who followed along with him day by day had dwindled to less than two hundred.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p3_4">171:3.4</a></small></sup>  The apostles understood that Jesus was going to Jerusalem for the Passover. They knew that the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> had broadcast a message to all <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a> that he had been condemned to die and directing that anyone knowing his whereabouts should inform the Sanhedrin; and yet, despite all this, they were not so alarmed as they had been when he had announced to them in <a href="/en/topic/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> that he was going to <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a> to see <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a>. This change of attitude from that of intense fear to a state of hushed expectancy was mostly because of <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Nazarite_parable)">Lazarus</a>’s resurrection. They had reached the conclusion that Jesus might, in an emergency, assert his divine power and put to shame his enemies. This hope, coupled with their more profound and mature faith in the spiritual supremacy of their <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, accounted for the outward courage displayed by his immediate followers, who now made ready to follow him into Jerusalem in the very face of the open declaration of the Sanhedrin that he must die.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p3_5">171:3.5</a></small></sup>  The majority of the apostles and many of his inner disciples did not believe it possible for <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> to die; they, believing that he was “the resurrection and the life,” regarded him as immortal and already triumphant over death<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b16"><a href="#fn_b16">[16]</a></sup>.</p>

<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p4_1">171:4.1</a></small></sup>  On <a href="/en/topic/Wednesday">Wednesday</a> evening, March 29, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and his followers encamped at <a href="/en/topic/Livias">Livias</a> on their way to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, after having completed their tour of the cities of southern <a href="/en/topic/Perea">Perea</a>. It was during this night at Livias that <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Zelotes">Simon Zelotes</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a>, having conspired to have delivered into their hands at this place more than one hundred <a href="/en/topic/swords">swords</a>, received and distributed these arms to all who would accept them and wear them concealed beneath their cloaks. <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> was still wearing his sword on the night of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s betrayal in the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p4_2">171:4.2</a></small></sup>  Early on <a href="/en/topic/Thursday">Thursday</a> morning before the others were awake, Jesus called <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> and said: “Awaken your brethren! I have something to say to them.” Jesus knew about the swords and which of his apostles had received and were wearing these weapons, but he never disclosed to them that he knew such things. When Andrew had aroused his associates, and they had assembled off by themselves, Jesus said: “My children, you have been with me a long while, and I have taught you much that is needful for this time, but I would now warn you not to put your trust in the uncertainties of the <a href="/en/topic/flesh">flesh</a> nor in the frailties of man’s defense against the trials and testing which lie ahead of us. I have called you apart here by yourselves that I may once more plainly tell you that we are going up to Jerusalem, where you know the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> has already been condemned to death.

Again I declare that my kingdom is not of this world; but if the Son of Man had been accorded the spiritual rule of his people, he would have accepted such a kingdom of men’s souls and would have reigned over such a dominion of human hearts. Notwithstanding that they reject my spiritual rule over them, I will return again to receive from others such a kingdom of spirit as is now denied me. You will see the Son of Man rejected now, but in another age that which the children of <a href="/en/topic/Abraham_(Old_Testament)">Abraham</a> now reject will be received and exalted.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b37"><a href="#fn_b37">[37]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a18"><a href="#fn_a18">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a19"><a href="#fn_a19">[19]</a></sup></p>
