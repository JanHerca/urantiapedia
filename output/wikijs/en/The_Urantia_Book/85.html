Early religion was wholly intellectual in nature and was entirely predicated on associational circumstances. The objects of worship were altogether suggestive; they consisted of the things of nature which were close at hand, or which loomed large in the commonplace experience of the simple-minded primitive Urantians.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_2_0"><a href="#fn_a0_2_0">[1]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_2_3"><a href="#fn_s0_2_3">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s0_2_1"><a href="#fn_s0_2_1">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s0_2_2"><a href="#fn_s0_2_2">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p1_1">85:1.1</a></small></sup>  The first object to be worshiped by evolving man was a <a href="/en/topic/stone">stone</a>. Today the <a href="/en/topic/Kateri">Kateri</a> people of southern <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a> still <a href="/en/topic/worship">worship</a> a stone, as do numerous tribes in northern India. <a href="/en/topic/Jacob_of_Crete">Jacob</a> slept on a stone because he venerated it; he even anointed it<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>. <a href="/en/topic/Rachel_(Old_Testament)">Rachel</a> concealed a number of sacred stones in her tent<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_1_3"><a href="#fn_s1_1_3">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_1_1"><a href="#fn_s1_1_1">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p1_2">85:1.2</a></small></sup>  Stones first impressed early man as being out of the ordinary because of the manner in which they would so suddenly appear on the surface of a cultivated field or pasture. Men failed to take into account either erosion or the results of the overturning of soil. Stones also greatly impressed early peoples because of their frequent resemblance to animals. The attention of civilized man is arrested by numerous stone formations in the mountains which so much resemble the faces of animals and even men. But the most profound influence was exerted by meteoric stones which primitive humans beheld hurtling through the atmosphere in flaming grandeur. The shooting star was awesome to early man, and he easily believed that such blazing streaks marked the passage of a spirit on its way to earth. No wonder men were led to worship such phenomena, especially when they subsequently discovered the <a href="/en/topic/meteors">meteors</a>. And this led to greater reverence for all other stones. In <a href="/en/topic/Bengal">Bengal</a> many worship a meteor which fell to earth in A.D. 1880.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p1_3">85:1.3</a></small></sup>  All ancient clans and tribes had their sacred stones, and most modern peoples manifest a degree of veneration for certain types of stones—their jewels. A group of five stones was reverenced in <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a>; in <a href="/en/topic/Greece">Greece</a> it was a cluster of thirty; among the red men it was usually a circle of stones. The <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a> always threw a <a href="/en/topic/stone">stone</a> into the air when invoking <a href="/en/topic/Jupiter_(god)">Jupiter</a>. In India even to this day a stone can be used as a witness<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>. In some regions a stone may be employed as a talisman of the law, and by its prestige an offender can be haled into court. But simple <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> do not always identify <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> with an object of reverent ceremony. Such <a href="/en/topic/fetishes">fetishes</a> are many times mere symbols of the real object of <a href="/en/topic/worship">worship</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p1_4">85:1.4</a></small></sup>  The ancients had a peculiar regard for holes in stones. Such porous rocks were supposed to be unusually efficacious in curing <a href="/en/topic/disease">diseases</a>. Ears were not perforated to carry stones, but the stones were put in to keep the ear holes open. Even in modern times superstitious persons make holes in <a href="/en/topic/coins">coins</a>. In <a href="/en/topic/Africa">Africa</a> the natives make much ado over their fetish stones. In fact, among all backward tribes and peoples stones are still held in superstitious veneration. Stone worship is even now widespread over the world. The tombstone is a surviving symbol of images and idols which were carved in stone in connection with beliefs in ghosts and the spirits of departed fellow beings.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_4_3"><a href="#fn_s1_4_3">[1]</a></sup></p>

It presently became the custom to believe that the gods inhabited the <a href="/en/topic/mountains">mountains</a>, so that high elevations of land were worshiped for this additional reason<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>. As time passed, certain mountains were associated with certain gods and therefore became holy. The ignorant and superstitious aborigines believed that <a href="/en/topic/caves">caves</a> led to the underworld, with its evil spirits and demons, in contrast with the mountains, which were identified with the later evolving concepts of good spirits and deities.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_5_3"><a href="#fn_s1_5_3">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_5_1"><a href="#fn_s1_5_1">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. WORSHIP OF PLANTS AND TREES </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p2_1">85:2.1</a></small></sup>  Plants were first feared and then worshiped because of the intoxicating liquors which were derived therefrom. Primitive man believed that <a href="/en/topic/intoxication">intoxication</a> rendered one divine. There was supposed to be something unusual and sacred about such an experience. Even in modern times alcohol is known as “spirits.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_3"><a href="#fn_s2_1_3">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_1_2"><a href="#fn_s2_1_2">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p2_2">85:2.2</a></small></sup>  Early man looked upon sprouting grain with dread and superstitious awe. The Apostle <a href="/en/topic/Paul">Paul</a> was not <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> to draw profound spiritual lessons from, and predicate religious beliefs on, the sprouting grain<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p2_3">85:2.3</a></small></sup>  The cults of tree <a href="/en/topic/worship">worship</a> are among the oldest religious groups. All early marriages were held under the <a href="/en/topic/trees">trees</a>, and when women desired children, they would sometimes be found out in the forest affectionately embracing a sturdy oak. Many plants and trees were venerated because of their real or fancied medicinal powers. The savage believed that all chemical effects were due to the direct activity of supernatural forces.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_3_3"><a href="#fn_s2_3_3">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_3_1"><a href="#fn_s2_3_1">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p2_4">85:2.4</a></small></sup>  Ideas about tree spirits varied greatly among different tribes and races. Some trees were indwelt by kindly spirits; others harbored the deceptive and cruel. The <a href="/en/topic/Finns">Finns</a> believed that most trees were occupied by kind spirits. The Swiss long mistrusted the trees, believing they contained tricky spirits. The inhabitants of <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a> and eastern <a href="/en/topic/Russia">Russia</a> regard the tree spirits as being cruel. The <a href="/en/topic/Patagonians">Patagonians</a> still worship trees, as did the early <a href="/en/topic/Semites">Semites</a>. Long after the <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a> ceased tree worship, they continued to venerate their various deities in the groves<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>.

<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p2_5">85:2.5</a></small></sup>  The belief that water or precious metals beneath the earth’s surface can be detected by a wooden <a href="/en/topic/divination">divining rod</a> is a relic of the ancient tree cults. The <a href="/en/topic/Maypole">Maypole</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Christmas">Christmas</a> tree, and the superstitious practice of rapping on <a href="/en/topic/wood">wood</a> perpetuate certain of the ancient customs of tree <a href="/en/topic/worship">worship</a> and the later-day tree cults.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_5_3"><a href="#fn_s2_5_3">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p2_6">85:2.6</a></small></sup>  Many of these earliest forms of nature veneration became blended with the later evolving techniques of worship, but the earliest mind-adjutant-activated types of worship were functioning long before the newly awakening religious nature of mankind became fully responsive to the stimulus of spiritual influences.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. THE WORSHIP OF ANIMALS </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p3_1">85:3.1</a></small></sup>  Primitive man had a peculiar and fellow feeling for the higher <a href="/en/topic/animals">animals</a>. His ancestors had lived with them and even mated with them. In southern <a href="/en/topic/Asia">Asia</a> it was early believed that the souls of men came back to earth in animal form. This belief was a survival of the still earlier practice of worshiping animals.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_1_3"><a href="#fn_s3_1_3">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p3_2">85:3.2</a></small></sup>  Early men revered the animals for their power and their cunning. They thought the keen scent and the farseeing eyes of certain creatures betokened spirit guidance. The animals have all been worshiped by one race or another at one time or another. Among such objects of <a href="/en/topic/worship">worship</a> were creatures that were regarded as half human and half animal, such as <a href="/en/topic/centaurs">centaurs</a> and <a href="/en/topic/mermaids">mermaids</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p3_3">85:3.3</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a> worshiped serpents down to the days of King <a href="/en/topic/Hezekiah">Hezekiah</a>, and the <a href="/en/topic/Hindus">Hindus</a> still maintain friendly relations with their house <a href="/en/topic/snakes">snakes</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup>. The <a href="/en/topic/Chinese">Chinese</a> worship of the <a href="/en/topic/dragon">dragon</a> is a survival of the snake cults. The wisdom of the serpent was a symbol of <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> medicine and is still employed as an emblem by modern physicians. The art of snake charming has been handed down from the days of the female shamans of the <i>snake love cult,</i> who, as the result of daily snake bites, became immune, in fact, became genuine venom addicts and could not get along without this poison.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p3_4">85:3.4</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/worship">worship</a> of <a href="/en/topic/insects">insects</a> and other <a href="/en/topic/animals">animals</a> was promoted by a later misinterpretation of the <a href="/en/topic/golden_rule">golden rule</a>—doing to others (every form of life) as you would be done by. The ancients once believed that all winds were produced by the wings of <a href="/en/topic/birds">birds</a> and therefore both feared and worshiped all winged creatures. The early Nordics thought that <a href="/en/topic/eclipses">eclipses</a> were caused by a wolf that devoured a portion of the sun or moon. The Hindus often show <a href="/en/topic/Vishnu">Vishnu</a> with a horse’s head. Many times an animal symbol stands for a forgotten god or a vanished cult. Early in evolutionary <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> the lamb became the typical sacrificial animal and the dove the symbol of <a href="/en/topic/peace">peace</a> and <a href="/en/topic/love">love</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b11"><a href="#fn_b11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b12"><a href="#fn_b12">[12]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_4_4"><a href="#fn_a3_4_4">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p3_5">85:3.5</a></small></sup>  In religion, <a href="/en/topic/symbolism">symbolism</a> may be either good or bad just to the extent that the symbol does or does not displace the original worshipful idea. And symbolism must not be confused with direct <a href="/en/topic/idolatry">idolatry</a> wherein the material object is directly and actually worshiped.</p>
<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 4. WORSHIP OF THE ELEMENTS </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p4_1">85:4.1</a></small></sup>  Mankind has worshiped earth, air, <a href="/en/topic/water">water</a>, and fire. The primitive races venerated springs and worshiped rivers. Even now in <a href="/en/topic/Mongolia">Mongolia</a> there flourishes an influential river cult. Baptism became a religious ceremonial in <a href="/en/topic/Babylon">Babylon</a>, and the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a> practiced the annual ritual bath<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b13"><a href="#fn_b13">[13]</a></sup>. It was easy for the ancients to imagine that the spirits dwelt in the bubbling springs, gushing fountains, flowing rivers, and raging torrents. Moving waters vividly impressed these simple minds with beliefs of spirit animation and supernatural power<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b14"><a href="#fn_b14">[14]</a></sup>.

<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p4_2">85:4.2</a></small></sup>  Many things and numerous events have functioned as religious stimuli to different peoples in different ages.

The east <a href="/en/topic/wind">wind</a> is a god in <a href="/en/topic/South_America">South America</a>, for it brings rain; in India it is a devil because it brings dust and causes drought.
