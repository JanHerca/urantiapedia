<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p0_2">168:0.2</a></small></sup>  When Martha and <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> sent word to Jesus concerning Lazarus’s illness, they were confident the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> would do something about it. They knew that their brother was desperately sick, and though they hardly dared hope that Jesus would leave his work of teaching and preaching to come to their assistance, they had such confidence in his power to heal disease that they thought he would just speak the curative words, and Lazarus would immediately be made whole. And when Lazarus died a few hours after the messenger left Bethany for <a href="/en/topic/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, they reasoned that it was because the Master did not learn of their brother’s illness until it was too late, until he had already been dead for several hours.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p0_3">168:0.3</a></small></sup>  But they, with all of their believing friends, were greatly puzzled by the message which the runner brought back Tuesday forenoon when he reached <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>. The messenger insisted that he heard <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> say, “...this sickness is really not to the death.” Neither could they understand why he sent no word to them nor otherwise proffered assistance.</p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p0_4">168:0.4</a></small></sup>  Many friends from near-by hamlets and others from <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> came over to comfort the sorrow-stricken sisters<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>. <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a> and his sisters were the children of a well-to-do and honorable Jew, one who had been the leading resident of the little village of Bethany. And notwithstanding that all three had long been ardent followers of Jesus, they were highly respected by all who knew them. They had inherited extensive vineyards and olive orchards in this vicinity, and that they were wealthy was further attested by the fact that they could afford a private burial <a href="/en/topic/tombs">tomb</a> on their own premises. Both of their parents had already been laid away in this tomb.</p>
<p id="p0_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p0_5">168:0.5</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> had given up the thought of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ coming and was abandoned to her grief, but <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(wife_of_Justus)">Martha</a> clung to the hope that Jesus would come, even up to the time on that very morning when they rolled the stone in front of the tomb and sealed the entrance. Even then she instructed a neighbor lad to keep watch down the <a href="/en/topic/Jericho">Jericho</a> road from the brow of the hill to the east of <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a>; and it was this lad who brought tidings to <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(sister_of_Jesus)">Martha</a> that Jesus and his friends were approaching.</p>
<p id="p0_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p0_6">168:0.6</a></small></sup>  When Martha met Jesus, she fell at his feet, exclaiming, “<a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, if you had been here, my brother would not have died!” Many fears were passing through Martha’s mind, but she gave expression to no doubt, nor did she venture to criticize or question the Master’s conduct as related to <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a>’s death. When she had spoken, Jesus reached down and, lifting her upon her feet, said, “Only have faith, Martha, and your brother shall rise again<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>.” Then answered Martha: “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection of <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> day; and even now I believe that whatever you shall ask of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, our Father will give you.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_6_0"><a href="#fn_s0_6_0">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p0_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p0_8">168:0.8</a></small></sup>  Jesus having inquired for <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a>, Martha went at once into the house and, whispering to her sister, said, “The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> is here and has asked for you<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>.” And when <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Clopas)">Mary</a> heard this, she rose up quickly and hastened out to meet Jesus, who still tarried at the place, some distance from the house, where Martha had first met him. The friends who were with <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)">Mary</a>, seeking to comfort her, when they saw that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep.</p>
<p id="p0_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p0_9">168:0.9</a></small></sup>  Many of those present were <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ bitter enemies. That is why <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(wife_of_Justus)">Martha</a> had come out to meet him alone, and also why she went in secretly to inform Mary that he had asked for her. <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(sister_of_Jesus)">Martha</a>, while craving to see Jesus, desired to avoid any possible unpleasantness which might be caused by his coming suddenly into the midst of a large group of his <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> enemies. It had been <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(sister_of_Lazarus)">Martha</a>’s intention to remain in the house with their friends while Mary went to greet Jesus, but in this she failed, for they all followed Mary and so found themselves unexpectedly in the presence of the Master.</p>
<p id="p0_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p0_10">168:0.10</a></small></sup>  Martha led <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> to Jesus, and when she saw him, she fell at his feet, exclaiming, “If you had only been here, my brother would not have died!” And when Jesus saw how they all grieved over the death of <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a>, his soul was moved with compassion<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b9"><a href="#fn_b9">[9]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p0_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p0_11">168:0.11</a></small></sup>  When the mourners saw that Mary had gone to greet <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, they withdrew for a short distance while both <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(wife_of_Justus)">Martha</a> and Mary talked with the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and received further words of comfort and exhortation to maintain strong faith in the Father and complete resignation to the divine will.</p>
<p id="p0_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p0_12">168:0.12</a></small></sup>  The human mind of Jesus was mightily moved by the contention between his love for <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a> and the bereaved sisters and his disdain and contempt for the outward show of affection manifested by some of these unbelieving and murderously intentioned <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>. Jesus indignantly resented the show of forced and outward <a href="/en/topic/mourning">mourning</a> for <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Nazarite_parable)">Lazarus</a> by some of these professed friends inasmuch as such false sorrow was associated in their hearts with so much bitter enmity toward himself. Some of these <a href="/en/topic/Jews_(ancient_Hebrews)">Jews</a>, however, were sincere in their mourning, for they were real friends of the family.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. AT THE TOMB OF LAZARUS </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p1_1">168:1.1</a></small></sup>  After <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had spent a few moments in comforting <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(wife_of_Justus)">Martha</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a>, apart from the mourners, he asked them, “Where have you laid him?” Then <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(sister_of_Jesus)">Martha</a> said, “Come and see<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup>.” And as the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> followed on in silence with the two sorrowing sisters, he wept<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b11"><a href="#fn_b11">[11]</a></sup>. When the friendly <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> who followed after them saw his tears, one of them said: “Behold how he loved him. Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind have kept this man from dying?” By this time they were standing before the family <a href="/en/topic/tombs">tomb</a>, a small natural cave, or declivity, in the ledge of rock which rose up some thirty feet at the far end of the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a> plot.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p1_2">168:1.2</a></small></sup>  It is difficult to explain to human minds just why Jesus wept<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b12"><a href="#fn_b12">[12]</a></sup>. While we have access to the registration of the combined human emotions and divine thoughts, as of record in the mind of the Personalized <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Adjuster</a>, we are not altogether certain about the real cause of these emotional manifestations. We are inclined to believe that Jesus wept because of a number of thoughts and feelings which were going through his mind at this time, such as:</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p1_3">168:1.3</a></small></sup>  1. He felt a genuine and sorrowful sympathy for <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(wife_of_Justus)">Martha</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a>; he had a real and deep human affection for these sisters who had lost their brother.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p1_4">168:1.4</a></small></sup>  2. He was perturbed in his mind by the presence of the crowd of mourners, some sincere and some merely pretenders. He always resented these outward exhibitions of <a href="/en/topic/mourning">mourning</a>. He knew the sisters loved their brother and had faith in the survival of believers. These conflicting emotions may possibly explain why he groaned as they came near the tomb.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p1_5">168:1.5</a></small></sup>  3. He truly hesitated about bringing <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a> back to the mortal life. His sisters really needed him, but <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> regretted having to summon his friend back to experience the bitter persecution which he well knew <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Nazarite_parable)">Lazarus</a> would have to endure as a result of being the subject of the greatest of all demonstrations of the divine power of the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p1_6">168:1.6</a></small></sup>  And now we may relate an interesting and instructive fact: Although this <a href="/en/topic/Urantia_Papers">narrative</a> unfolds as an apparently natural and normal event in human affairs, it has some very interesting side lights. While the messenger went to Jesus on <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a>, telling him of Lazarus’s illness, and while Jesus sent word that it was “not to the death,” at the same time he went in person up to <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a> and even asked the sisters, “Where have you laid him?” Even though all of this seems to indicate that the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> was proceeding after the manner of this life and in accordance with the limited knowledge of the human mind, nevertheless, the records of the universe reveal that Jesus’ Personalized <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Adjuster</a> issued orders for the indefinite detention of Lazarus’s Thought Adjuster on the planet subsequent to Lazarus’s death, and that this order was made of record just fifteen minutes before Lazarus breathed his last<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b13"><a href="#fn_b13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b14"><a href="#fn_b14">[14]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p1_7">168:1.7</a></small></sup>  Did the divine mind of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> know, even before <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a> died, that he would raise him from the dead? We do not know. We know only what we are herewith placing on record.</p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p1_8">168:1.8</a></small></sup>  Many of Jesus’ enemies were inclined to sneer at his manifestations of affection, and they said among themselves: “If he thought so much of this man, why did he tarry so long before coming to <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a>? If he is what they claim, why did he not save his dear friend? What is the good of healing strangers in <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> if he cannot save those whom he loves?” And in many other ways they mocked and made light of the teachings and works of Jesus.</p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p1_9">168:1.9</a></small></sup>  And so, on this <a href="/en/topic/Thursday">Thursday</a> afternoon at about half past two o’clock, was the stage all set in this little hamlet of Bethany for the enactment of the greatest of all works connected with the earth ministry of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael of Nebadon</a>, the greatest manifestation of divine power during his incarnation in the flesh, since his own resurrection occurred after he had been liberated from the bonds of mortal habitation.</p>
<p id="p1_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p1_10">168:1.10</a></small></sup>  The small group assembled before <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a>’s tomb little realized the presence near at hand of a vast concourse of all orders of <a href="/en/topic/celestial_beings">celestial beings</a> assembled under the leadership of <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a> and now in waiting, by direction of the Personalized <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Adjuster</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, vibrating with expectancy and ready to execute the bidding of their beloved Sovereign.</p>
<p id="p1_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p1_11">168:1.11</a></small></sup>  When Jesus spoke those words of command, “Take away the stone,” the assembled celestial hosts made ready to enact the drama of the resurrection of Lazarus in the likeness of his mortal flesh<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b15"><a href="#fn_b15">[15]</a></sup>. Such a form of resurrection involves difficulties of execution which far transcend the usual technique of the resurrection of mortal creatures in morontia form and requires far more celestial personalities and a far greater organization of universe facilities.</p>
<p id="p1_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p1_12">168:1.12</a></small></sup>  When <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(wife_of_Justus)">Martha</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> heard this command of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> directing that the stone in front of the <a href="/en/topic/tombs">tomb</a> be rolled away, they were filled with conflicting emotions. <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Clopas)">Mary</a> hoped that <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a> was to be raised from the dead, but <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(sister_of_Jesus)">Martha</a>, while to some extent sharing her sister’s faith, was more exercised by the fear that <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Nazarite_parable)">Lazarus</a> would not be presentable, in his appearance, to Jesus, the apostles, and their friends. Said <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(sister_of_Lazarus)">Martha</a>: “Must we roll away the stone? My brother has now been dead four days, so that by this time decay of the body has begun<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b16"><a href="#fn_b16">[16]</a></sup>.” <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(sister_of_Jesus’_mother)">Martha</a> also said this because she was not certain as to why the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> had requested that the stone be removed; she thought maybe Jesus wanted only to take one last look at Lazarus. She was not settled and constant in her attitude. As they hesitated to roll away the stone, Jesus said: “Did I not tell you at <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> that this sickness was not to the death? Have I not come to fulfill my promise? And after I came to you, did I not say that, if you would only believe, you should see the glory of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>? Wherefore do you doubt? How long before you will believe and obey?”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b17"><a href="#fn_b17">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p1_13">168:1.13</a></small></sup>  When Jesus had finished speaking, his apostles, with the assistance of willing neighbors, laid hold upon the stone and rolled it away from the entrance to the tomb<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b18"><a href="#fn_b18">[18]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p1_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p1_14">168:1.14</a></small></sup>  It was the common belief of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> that the drop of <a href="/en/topic/gall">gall</a> on the point of the sword of the angel of death began to work by the end of the third day, so that it was taking full effect on the fourth day. They allowed that the soul of man might linger about the tomb until the end of the third day, seeking to reanimate the dead body; but they firmly believed that such a soul had gone on to the abode of departed spirits ere the fourth day had dawned.</p>
<p id="p1_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p1_15">168:1.15</a></small></sup>  These beliefs and opinions regarding the dead and the departure of the spirits of the dead served to make sure, in the minds of all who were now present at <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a>’s tomb and subsequently to all who might hear of what was about to occur, that this was really and truly a case of the raising of the dead by the personal working of one who declared he was “the resurrection and the life<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b19"><a href="#fn_b19">[19]</a></sup>.”</p>

<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. MEETING OF THE SANHEDRIN </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p3_1">168:3.1</a></small></sup>  Even though the testimony of this man raised from the dead did much to consolidate the faith of the mass of believers in the gospel of the kingdom, it had little or no influence on the attitude of the religious leaders and rulers at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> except to hasten their decision to destroy <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and stop his work.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p3_2">168:3.2</a></small></sup>  At one o’clock the next day, <a href="/en/topic/Fridays">Friday</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> met to deliberate further on the question, “What shall we do with Jesus of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>?” After more than two hours of discussion and acrimonious debate, a certain Pharisee presented a resolution calling for Jesus’ immediate death, proclaiming that he was a menace to all <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a> and formally committing the Sanhedrin to the decision of death, without trial and in defiance of all precedent<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b24"><a href="#fn_b24">[24]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p3_3">168:3.3</a></small></sup>  Time and again had this august body of Jewish leaders decreed that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> be apprehended and brought to trial on charges of blasphemy and numerous other accusations of flouting the Jewish sacred law. They had once before even gone so far as to declare he should die, but this was <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> time the Sanhedrin had gone on record as desiring to decree his death in advance of a trial. But this resolution did not come to a vote since fourteen members of the Sanhedrin resigned in a body when such an unheard-of action was proposed. While these resignations were not formally acted upon for almost two weeks, this group of fourteen withdrew from the Sanhedrin on that day, never again to sit in the council. When these resignations were subsequently acted upon, five other members were thrown out because their associates believed they entertained friendly feelings toward Jesus. With the ejection of these nineteen men the Sanhedrin was in a position to try and to condemn Jesus with a solidarity bordering on unanimity.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p3_4">168:3.4</a></small></sup>  The following week <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a> and his sisters were summoned to appear before the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a>. When their testimony had been heard, no doubt could be entertained that <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Nazarite_parable)">Lazarus</a> had been raised from the dead. Though the transactions of the Sanhedrin virtually admitted the resurrection of Lazarus, the record carried a resolution attributing this and all other wonders worked by Jesus to the power of the <a href="/en/topic/prince_of_devils">prince of devils</a>, with whom Jesus was declared to be in league.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_4_2"><a href="#fn_a3_4_2">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p4_1">168:4.1</a></small></sup>  On the way from <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a> to <a href="/en/topic/Pella">Pella</a> the apostles asked <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> many questions, all of which the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> freely answered except those involving the details of the resurrection of the dead. Such problems were beyond the comprehension capacity of his apostles; therefore did the Master decline to discuss these questions with them. Since they had departed from Bethany in secret, they were alone. Jesus therefore embraced the opportunity to say many things to the ten which he thought would prepare them for the trying days just ahead.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_1_6"><a href="#fn_a4_1_6">[4]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_1_1"><a href="#fn_s4_1_1">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p4_2">168:4.2</a></small></sup>  The apostles were much stirred up in their minds and spent considerable time discussing their recent experiences as they were related to <a href="/en/topic/prayer">prayer</a> and its answering. They all recalled Jesus’ statement to the Bethany messenger at <a href="/en/topic/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, when he said plainly, “This sickness is not really to the death<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b28"><a href="#fn_b28">[28]</a></sup>.” And yet, in spite of this promise, <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a> actually died. All that day, again and again, they reverted to the discussion of this question of the answer to prayer.</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p4_3">168:4.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ answers to their many questions may be summarized as follows:</p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p4_4">168:4.4</a></small></sup>  1. Prayer is an expression of the finite mind in an effort to approach the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite">Infinite</a>. The making of a <a href="/en/topic/prayer">prayer</a> must, therefore, be limited by the knowledge, wisdom, and attributes of the finite; likewise must the answer be conditioned by the vision, aims, ideals, and prerogatives of the Infinite. There never can be observed an unbroken continuity of material phenomena between the making of a prayer and the reception of the full spiritual answer thereto.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_4_2"><a href="#fn_s4_4_2">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p4_5">168:4.5</a></small></sup>  2. When a prayer is apparently unanswered, the delay often betokens a better answer, although one which is for some good reason greatly delayed. When <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> said that <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a>’s sickness was really not to the death, he had already been dead eleven hours. No sincere prayer is denied an answer except when the <a href="/en/topic/superior_seraphim">superior</a> viewpoint of the spiritual world has devised a better answer, an answer which meets the petition of the spirit of man as contrasted with the prayer of the mere mind of man.</p>
<p id="p4_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p4_6">168:4.6</a></small></sup>  3. The prayers of time, when indited by the spirit and expressed in faith, are often so vast and all-encompassing that they can be answered only in eternity; the finite petition is sometimes so fraught with the grasp of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite">Infinite</a> that the answer must long be postponed to await the creation of adequate capacity for receptivity; the <a href="/en/topic/prayer">prayer</a> of faith may be so all-embracing that the answer can be received only on <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_6_0"><a href="#fn_a4_6_0">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p4_7">168:4.7</a></small></sup>  4. The answers to the prayer of the mortal mind are often of such a nature that they can be received and recognized only after that same praying mind has attained the immortal state. The prayer of the material being can many times be answered only when such an individual has progressed to the spirit level.</p>
<p id="p4_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p4_8">168:4.8</a></small></sup>  5. The <a href="/en/topic/prayer">prayer</a> of a God-knowing person may be so distorted by ignorance and so deformed by superstition that the answer thereto would be highly undesirable. Then must the intervening spirit beings so translate such a prayer that, when the answer arrives, the petitioner wholly fails to recognize it as the answer to his prayer.</p>
<p id="p4_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p4_9">168:4.9</a></small></sup>  6. All true prayers are addressed to spiritual beings, and all such petitions must be answered in spiritual terms, and all such answers must consist in spiritual realities. Spirit beings cannot bestow material answers to the spirit petitions of even material beings. Material beings can pray effectively only when they “pray in the spirit<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b29"><a href="#fn_b29">[29]</a></sup>.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_9_3"><a href="#fn_a4_9_3">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_9_5"><a href="#fn_a4_9_5">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p4_10">168:4.10</a></small></sup>  7. No <a href="/en/topic/prayer">prayer</a> can hope for an answer unless it is born of the spirit and nurtured by faith<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b30"><a href="#fn_b30">[30]</a></sup>. Your sincere faith implies that you have in advance virtually granted your prayer hearers the full right to answer your petitions in accordance with that supreme wisdom and that divine love which your faith depicts as always actuating those beings to whom you pray.</p>
<p id="p4_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p4_11">168:4.11</a></small></sup>  8. The child is always within his rights when he presumes to petition the parent; and the parent is always within his parental obligations to the immature child when his <a href="/en/topic/superior_seraphim">superior</a> wisdom dictates that the answer to the child’s prayer be delayed, modified, segregated, transcended, or postponed to another stage of spiritual ascension.</p>
<p id="p4_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p4_12">168:4.12</a></small></sup>  9. Do not hesitate to pray the prayers of spirit longing; doubt not that you shall receive the answer to your petitions<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b31"><a href="#fn_b31">[31]</a></sup>. These answers will be on deposit, awaiting your achievement of those future spiritual levels of actual cosmic attainment, on this world or on others, whereon it will become possible for you to recognize and appropriate the long-waiting answers to your earlier but ill-timed petitions.</p>
<p id="p4_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p4_13">168:4.13</a></small></sup>  10. All genuine spirit-born petitions are certain of an answer. Ask and you shall receive<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b32"><a href="#fn_b32">[32]</a></sup>. But you should remember that you are progressive creatures of time and space; therefore must you constantly reckon with the time-space factor in the experience of your personal reception of the full answers to your manifold prayers and petitions.</p>
