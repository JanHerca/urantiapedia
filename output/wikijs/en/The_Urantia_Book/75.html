The realization of race betterment appeared to be a long way off, and the situation seemed so desperate as to demand something for relief not embraced in the original plans. At least that is what often passed through <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(village)">Adam</a>’s mind, and he so expressed himself many times to <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a>. <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(original_of_Satania)">Adam</a> and his mate were loyal, but they were isolated from their kind, and they were sorely distressed by the sorry plight of their world.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_1_16"><a href="#fn_a0_1_16">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p1_1">75:1.1</a></small></sup>  The Adamic mission on experimental, rebellion-seared, and isolated <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> was a formidable undertaking. And the Material Son and Daughter early became aware of the difficulty and complexity of their planetary assignment. Nevertheless, they courageously set about the task of solving their manifold problems. But when they addressed themselves to the all-important work of eliminating the defectives and degenerates from among the human strains, they were quite dismayed. They could see no way out of the dilemma, and they could not take counsel with their superiors on either <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> or <a href="/en/topic/Edentia">Edentia</a>. Here they were, isolated and day by day confronted with some new and complicated tangle, some problem that seemed to be unsolvable.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_1_4"><a href="#fn_a1_1_4">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_1_10"><a href="#fn_a1_1_10">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_1_11"><a href="#fn_a1_1_11">[4]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_1_5"><a href="#fn_s1_1_5">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_1_8"><a href="#fn_s1_1_8">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p1_2">75:1.2</a></small></sup>  Under normal conditions <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> work of a Planetary <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> would be the co-ordination and blending of the races. But on Urantia such a project seemed just about hopeless, for the races, while biologically fit, had never been purged of their retarded and defective strains.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_10"><a href="#fn_a1_2_10">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p1_3">75:1.3</a></small></sup>  Adam and Eve found themselves on a sphere wholly unprepared for the proclamation of the brotherhood of man, a world groping about in abject spiritual darkness and cursed with confusion worse confounded by the miscarriage of the mission of the preceding administration. Mind and morals were at a low level, and instead of beginning the task of effecting religious unity, they must begin all anew the work of converting the inhabitants to the most simple forms of religious belief. Instead of finding one <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a> ready for adoption, they were confronted by the world-wide confusion of hundreds upon hundreds of local dialects. No Adam of the planetary service was ever set down on a more difficult world; the obstacles seemed insuperable and the problems beyond creature solution.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_3_0"><a href="#fn_a1_3_0">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_3_9"><a href="#fn_a1_3_9">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_3_39"><a href="#fn_a1_3_39">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p1_4">75:1.4</a></small></sup>  They were isolated, and the tremendous sense of loneliness which bore down upon them was all the more heightened by the early departure of the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_receivers">Melchizedek receivers</a>. Only indirectly, by means of the angelic orders, could they communicate with any being off the planet. Slowly their courage weakened, their spirits drooped, and sometimes their faith almost faltered.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p1_5">75:1.5</a></small></sup>  And this is the true picture of the consternation of these two noble souls as they pondered the tasks which confronted them. They were both keenly aware of the enormous undertaking involved in the execution of their planetary assignment.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p1_6">75:1.6</a></small></sup>  Probably no <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> were ever faced with such a difficult and seemingly hopeless task as confronted <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> in the sorry plight of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. But they would have sometime met with success had they been more farseeing and <i>patient.</i> Both of them, especially Eve, were altogether too <a href="/en/topic/impatience">impatient</a>; they were not willing to settle down to the long, long endurance test. They wanted to see some immediate results, and they did, but the results thus secured proved most disastrous both to themselves and to their world.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_6_39"><a href="#fn_a1_6_39">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_6_20"><a href="#fn_a1_6_20">[8]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_6_4"><a href="#fn_s1_6_4">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_6_10"><a href="#fn_s1_6_10">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p2_1">75:2.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia">Caligastia</a> paid frequent visits to the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">Garden</a> and held many conferences with <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a>, but they were adamant to all his suggestions of compromise and short-cut adventures. They had before them enough of the results of <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">rebellion</a> to produce effective immunity against all such insinuating proposals. Even the young offspring of <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(village)">Adam</a> were uninfluenced by the overtures of <a href="/en/topic/Daligastia">Daligastia</a>. And of course neither Caligastia nor his associate had power to influence any individual against his will, much less to persuade the children of <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(original_of_Satania)">Adam</a> to do wrong.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_1_22"><a href="#fn_a2_1_22">[9]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_8"><a href="#fn_s2_1_8">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p2_2">75:2.2</a></small></sup>  It must be remembered that Caligastia was still the titular <a href="/en/topic/Planetary_Prince_of_Urantia">Planetary Prince of Urantia</a>, a misguided but nevertheless high Son of the local universe. He was not finally deposed until the times of <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a> <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a> on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p2_3">75:2.3</a></small></sup>  But the fallen Prince was persistent and determined. He soon gave up working on <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and decided to try a wily flank attack on <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a>. The evil one concluded that the only hope for success lay in the adroit employment of suitable persons belonging to the upper strata of the Nodite group, the descendants of his onetime corporeal-staff associates. And the plans were accordingly laid for entrapping the mother of the <a href="/en/topic/Adamites">violet race</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p2_4">75:2.4</a></small></sup>  It was farthest from Eve’s intention ever to do anything which would militate against Adam’s plans or jeopardize their planetary trust. Knowing the tendency of <a href="/en/topic/women">woman</a> to look upon immediate results rather than to plan farsightedly for more remote effects, the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_Sons">Melchizedeks</a>, before departing, had especially enjoined Eve as to the peculiar dangers besetting their isolated position on the planet and had in particular warned her never to stray from the side of her mate, that is, to attempt no personal or secret methods of furthering their mutual undertakings. Eve had most scrupulously carried out these instructions for more than one hundred years, and it did not occur to her that any danger would attach to the increasingly private and confidential visits she was enjoying with a certain Nodite leader named <a href="/en/topic/Serapatatia">Serapatatia</a>. The whole affair developed so gradually and naturally that she was taken unawares.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_4_0"><a href="#fn_a2_4_0">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_4_2"><a href="#fn_a2_4_2">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_4_14"><a href="#fn_a2_4_14">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_4_26"><a href="#fn_a2_4_26">[12]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_4_8"><a href="#fn_s2_4_8">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_4_3"><a href="#fn_s2_4_3">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p2_5">75:2.5</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">Garden</a> dwellers had been in contact with the <a href="/en/topic/Nodites">Nodites</a> since the early days of Eden. From these mixed descendants of the defaulting members of <a href="/en/topic/corporeal_staffs_of_Planetary_Princes">Caligastia’s staff</a> they had received much valuable help and co-operation, and through them the Edenic regime was now to meet its complete undoing and final overthrow.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. THE TEMPTATION OF EVE </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p3_1">75:3.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> had just finished his first one hundred years on earth when <a href="/en/topic/Serapatatia">Serapatatia</a>, upon the death of his father, came to the leadership of the western or Syrian confederation of the Nodite tribes. Serapatatia was a <a href="/en/topic/brown_race">brown-tinted man</a>, a brilliant descendant of the onetime chief of the <a href="/en/topic/Dalamatia">Dalamatia</a> commission on health mated with one of the master female minds of the blue race of those distant days. All down through the ages this line had held authority and wielded a great influence among the western Nodite tribes.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_1_8"><a href="#fn_s3_1_8">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p3_2">75:3.2</a></small></sup>  Serapatatia had made several visits to the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">Garden</a> and had become deeply impressed with the righteousness of Adam’s cause. And shortly after assuming the leadership of the Syrian <a href="/en/topic/Nodites">Nodites</a>, he announced his intention of establishing an affiliation with the work of Adam and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> in the Garden. The majority of his people joined him in this program, and Adam was cheered by the news that the most powerful and the most intelligent of all the neighboring tribes had swung over almost bodily to the support of the program for world improvement; it was decidedly heartening. And shortly after this great event, Serapatatia and his new <a href="/en/topic/corporeal_staffs_of_Planetary_Princes">staff</a> were entertained by Adam and Eve in their own home.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p3_3">75:3.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Serapatatia">Serapatatia</a> became one of the most able and efficient of all of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a>’s lieutenants. He was entirely honest and thoroughly sincere in all of his activities; he was never conscious, even later on, that he was being used as a circumstantial tool of the wily <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia">Caligastia</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_3_22"><a href="#fn_a3_3_22">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p3_4">75:3.4</a></small></sup>  Presently, Serapatatia became the associate chairman of the Edenic commission on tribal relations, and many plans were laid for the more vigorous prosecution of the work of winning the remote tribes to the cause of the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">Garden</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_4_8"><a href="#fn_s3_4_8">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p3_5">75:3.5</a></small></sup>  He held many conferences with <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a>—especially with Eve—and they talked over many plans for improving their methods. One day, during a talk with Eve, it occurred to <a href="/en/topic/Serapatatia">Serapatatia</a> that it would be very helpful if, while awaiting the recruiting of large numbers of the <a href="/en/topic/Adamites">violet race</a>, something could be done in the meantime immediately to advance the needy waiting tribes. Serapatatia contended that, if the <a href="/en/topic/Nodites">Nodites</a>, as the most progressive and co-operative race, could have a leader born to them of part origin in the violet stock, it would constitute a powerful tie binding these peoples more closely to the Garden. And all of this was soberly and honestly considered to be for the good of the world since this child, to be reared and educated in the Garden, would exert a great influence for good over his father’s people.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_5_16"><a href="#fn_a3_5_16">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_5_22"><a href="#fn_a3_5_22">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p3_6">75:3.6</a></small></sup>  It should again be emphasized that Serapatatia was altogether honest and wholly sincere in all that he proposed. He never once suspected that he was playing into the hands of <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia">Caligastia</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Daligastia">Daligastia</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>. Serapatatia was entirely loyal to the plan of building up a strong reserve of the violet race before attempting the world-wide upstepping of the confused peoples of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. But this would require hundreds of years to consummate, and he was <a href="/en/topic/impatience">impatient</a>; he wanted to see some immediate results—something in his own lifetime. He made it clear to Eve that Adam was oftentimes discouraged by the little that had been accomplished toward uplifting the world.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_6_8"><a href="#fn_s3_6_8">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s3_6_10"><a href="#fn_s3_6_10">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p3_7">75:3.7</a></small></sup>  For more than five years these plans were secretly matured. At last they had developed to the point where <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> consented to have a secret conference with <a href="/en/topic/Cano">Cano</a>, the most brilliant mind and active leader of the near-by colony of friendly <a href="/en/topic/Nodites">Nodites</a>. Cano was very sympathetic with the Adamic regime; in fact, he was the sincere spiritual leader of those neighboring Nodites who favored friendly relations with the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">Garden</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_7_8"><a href="#fn_s3_7_8">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p3_8">75:3.8</a></small></sup>  The fateful meeting occurred during the twilight hours of the autumn evening, not far from the home of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a>. Eve had never before met the beautiful and enthusiastic Cano—and he was a magnificent specimen of the survival of the <a href="/en/topic/superior_seraphim">superior</a> physique and outstanding intellect of his remote progenitors of the <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia_one_hundred">Prince’s staff</a>. And Cano also thoroughly believed in the righteousness of the <a href="/en/topic/Serapatatia">Serapatatia</a> project.
