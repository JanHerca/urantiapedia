<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p0_1">147:0.1</a></small></sup>  JESUS and the apostles arrived in <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> on <a href="/en/topic/Wednesday">Wednesday</a>, March 17, and spent two weeks at the <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a> headquarters before they departed for <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. These two weeks the apostles taught the people by the seaside while <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> spent much time alone in the hills about his <a href="/en/topic/Father’s_business">Father’s business</a>. During this period Jesus, accompanied by <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> and <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John Zebedee</a>, made two secret trips to <a href="/en/topic/Tiberias">Tiberias</a>, where they met with the believers and instructed them in the gospel of the kingdom.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p0_2">147:0.2</a></small></sup>  Many of the household of Herod believed in Jesus and attended these meetings. It was the influence of these believers among Herod’s official family that had helped to lessen that ruler’s enmity toward Jesus. These believers at Tiberias had fully explained to Herod that the “kingdom” which Jesus proclaimed was spiritual in nature and not a political venture. Herod rather believed these members of his own household and therefore did not permit himself to become unduly alarmed by the spreading abroad of the reports concerning Jesus’ teaching and healing. He had no objections to Jesus’ work as a healer or religious teacher. Notwithstanding the favorable attitude of many of Herod’s advisers, and even of Herod himself, there existed a group of his subordinates who were so influenced by the religious leaders at Jerusalem that they remained bitter and threatening enemies of Jesus and the apostles and, later on, did much to hamper their public activities. The greatest danger to Jesus lay in the Jerusalem religious leaders and not in Herod. And it was for this very reason that Jesus and the apostles spent so much time and did most of their public preaching in <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> rather than at Jerusalem and in <a href="/en/topic/Judea">Judea</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. THE CENTURION’S SERVANT </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p1_1">147:1.1</a></small></sup>  On the day before they made ready to go to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> for the feast of the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Mangus">Mangus</a>, a centurion, or captain, of the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_soldiers_in_Jerusalem">Roman guard</a> stationed at <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, came to the rulers of the synagogue, saying: “My faithful orderly is sick and at the point of death. Would you, therefore, go to <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> in my behalf and beseech him to heal my servant?” The <a href="/en/topic/Roman_centurion_of_Jerusalem">Roman captain</a> did this because he thought the Jewish leaders would have more influence with Jesus<sup id="cite1"><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>. So the elders went to see Jesus and their spokesman said: “Teacher, we earnestly request you to go over to Capernaum and save the favorite servant of the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_centurion_in_Corinth">Roman centurion</a>, who is worthy of your notice because he loves our nation and even built us the very synagogue wherein you have so many times spoken.”</p>

<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p1_2">147:1.2</a></small></sup>  And when Jesus had heard them, he said, “I will go with you.” And as he went with them over to the centurion’s house, and before they had entered his yard, the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_soldier_in_Rome">Roman soldier</a> sent his friends out to greet Jesus, instructing them to say: “Lord, trouble not yourself to enter my house, for I am not worthy that you should come under my roof. Neither did I think myself worthy to come to you; wherefore I sent the elders of your own people. But I know that you can speak the word where you stand and my servant will be healed. For I am myself under the orders of others, and I have soldiers under me, and I say to this one go, and he goes; to another come, and he comes, and to my servants do this or do that, and they do it<sup id="cite2"><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p1_3">147:1.3</a></small></sup>  And when <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> heard these words, he turned and said to his apostles and those who were with them: “I marvel at the belief of the gentile. Verily, verily, I say to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a><sup id="cite3"><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup>.” Jesus, turning from the house, said, “Let us go hence.” And the friends of the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_centurion_of_Jerusalem">centurion</a> went into the house and told <a href="/en/topic/Mangus">Mangus</a> what Jesus had said. And from that hour the servant began to mend and was eventually restored to his normal health and usefulness<sup id="cite4"><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p1_4">147:1.4</a></small></sup>  But we never knew just what happened on this occasion. This is simply the record, and as to whether or not invisible beings ministered healing to the centurion’s servant, was not revealed to those who accompanied Jesus. We only know of the fact of the servant’s complete recovery.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. THE JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p2_1">147:2.1</a></small></sup>  Early on the morning of Tuesday, March 30, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the apostolic party started on their journey to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> for the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a>, going by the route of the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> valley. They arrived on the afternoon of <a href="/en/topic/Fridays">Friday</a>, April 2, and established their headquarters, as usual, at <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a>. Passing through <a href="/en/topic/Jericho">Jericho</a>, they paused to rest while Judas made a deposit of some of their common funds in the bank of a friend of his family. This was <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> time Judas had carried a surplus of money, and this deposit was left undisturbed until they passed through Jericho again when on that last and eventful journey to Jerusalem just before the trial and death of Jesus.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p2_2">147:2.2</a></small></sup>  The party had an uneventful trip to Jerusalem, but they had hardly got themselves settled at Bethany when from near and far those seeking healing for their bodies, comfort for troubled minds, and salvation for their souls, began to congregate, so much so that Jesus had little time for rest. Therefore they pitched tents at <a href="/en/topic/Gethsemane">Gethsemane</a>, and the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> would go back and forth from Bethany to Gethsemane to avoid the crowds which so constantly thronged him. The apostolic party spent almost three weeks at Jerusalem, but Jesus enjoined them to do no public preaching, only private teaching and personal work.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p2_3">147:2.3</a></small></sup>  At <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a> they quietly celebrated the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a>. And this was <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> time that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and all of the twelve partook of the bloodless Passover feast. The apostles of John did not eat the Passover with Jesus and his apostles; they celebrated the feast with <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a> and many of the early believers in John’s preaching. This was the second Passover Jesus had observed with his apostles in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p2_4">147:2.4</a></small></sup>  When Jesus and the twelve departed for <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, the apostles of John did not return with them. Under the direction of Abner they remained in Jerusalem and the surrounding country, quietly laboring for the extension of the kingdom, while Jesus and the twelve returned to work in <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>. Never again were the twenty-four all together until a short time before the commissioning and sending forth of the seventy evangelists. But the two groups were co-operative, and notwithstanding their differences of opinion, the best of feelings prevailed.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. AT THE POOL OF BETHESDA </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p3_1">147:3.1</a></small></sup>  The afternoon of the second <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, as the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and the apostles were about to participate in the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> services, John said to <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, “Come with me, I would show you something.” John conducted Jesus out through one of the Jerusalem gates to a pool of water called <a href="/en/topic/Bethesda_(pool)">Bethesda</a><sup id="cite5"><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup>. Surrounding this pool was a structure of five porches under which a large group of sufferers lingered in quest of healing. This was a hot spring whose reddish-tinged water would bubble up at irregular intervals because of gas accumulations in the rock caverns underneath the pool. This periodic disturbance of the warm waters was believed by many to be due to supernatural influences, and it was a popular belief that <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> person who entered the water after such a disturbance would be healed of whatever infirmity he had.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p3_2">147:3.2</a></small></sup>  The apostles were somewhat restless under the restrictions imposed by Jesus, and John, the youngest of the twelve, was especially restive under this restraint. He had brought Jesus to the pool thinking that the sight of the assembled sufferers would make such an appeal to the Master’s compassion that he would be moved to perform a miracle of healing, and thereby would all Jerusalem be astounded and presently be won to believe in the <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> of the kingdom. Said John to Jesus: “Master, see all of these suffering ones; is there nothing we can do for them?” And Jesus replied: “John, why would you tempt me to turn aside from the way I have chosen? Why do you go on desiring to substitute the working of wonders and the healing of the sick for the proclamation of the gospel of eternal truth? My son, I may not do that which you desire, but gather together these sick and afflicted that I may speak words of good cheer and eternal comfort to them.”</p>

<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p3_3">147:3.3</a></small></sup>  In speaking to those assembled, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> said: “Many of you are here, sick and afflicted, because of your many years of wrong living. Some suffer from the accidents of time, others as a result of the mistakes of their forebears, while some of you struggle under the handicaps of the imperfect conditions of your temporal existence. But my Father works, and I would work, to improve your earthly state but more especially to insure your eternal estate. None of us can do much to change the <a href="/en/topic/difficulties">difficulties</a> of life unless we discover the Father in heaven so wills. After all, we are all beholden to do the will of the Eternal. If you could all be healed of your physical afflictions, you would indeed marvel, but it is even greater that you should be cleansed of all spiritual <a href="/en/topic/disease">disease</a> and find yourselves healed of all moral infirmities. You are all <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>’s children; you are the sons of the heavenly Father. The bonds of time may seem to afflict you, but the God of eternity loves you. And when the time of <a href="/en/topic/judgment">judgment</a> shall come, fear not, you shall all find, not only justice, but an abundance of mercy. Verily, verily, I say to you: He who hears the gospel of the kingdom and believes in this teaching of sonship with God, has <a href="/en/topic/eternal_life">eternal life</a>; already are such believers passing from judgment and death to light and life. And the hour is coming in which even those who are in the tombs shall hear the voice of the resurrection<sup id="cite6"><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p3_4">147:3.4</a></small></sup>  And many of those who heard believed the gospel of the kingdom. Some of the afflicted were so inspired and spiritually revivified that they went about proclaiming that they had also been cured of their physical ailments.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p3_5">147:3.5</a></small></sup>  One man who had been many years downcast and grievously afflicted by the infirmities of his troubled mind, rejoiced at <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ words and, picking up his bed, went forth to his home, even though it was the <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> day. This afflicted man had waited all these years for <i>somebody</i> to help him; he was such a victim of the feeling of his own <a href="/en/topic/helplessness">helplessness</a> that he had never once entertained the idea of helping himself which proved to be the one thing he had to do in order to effect recovery—take up his bed and walk<sup id="cite7"><a href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p3_6">147:3.6</a></small></sup>  Then said Jesus to John: “Let us depart ere the chief priests and the scribes come upon us and take offense that we spoke words of life to these afflicted ones<sup id="cite8"><a href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup>.” And they returned to the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> to join their companions, and presently all of them departed to spend the night at <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a>. But John never told the other apostles of this visit of himself and Jesus to the <a href="/en/topic/pool_of_Bethesda">pool of Bethesda</a> on this Sabbath afternoon.</p>
<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 4. THE RULE OF LIVING </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p4_1">147:4.1</a></small></sup>  On the evening of this same <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> day, at <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a>, while <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, the twelve, and a group of believers were assembled about the fire in <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a>’s <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a> asked Jesus this question: “<a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, although you have taught us the positive version of the old rule of life, instructing us that we should do to others as we wish them to do to us, I do not fully discern how we can always abide by such an injunction. Let me illustrate my contention by citing the example of a lustful man who thus wickedly looks upon his intended consort in sin. How can we teach that this evil-intending man should do to others as he would they should do to him?”<sup id="cite9"><a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p4_2">147:4.2</a></small></sup>  When Jesus heard Nathaniel’s question, he immediately stood upon his feet and, pointing his finger at the apostle, said: “Nathaniel, Nathaniel! What manner of thinking is going on in your heart? Do you not receive my teachings as one who has been born of the spirit? Do you not hear the truth as men of wisdom and spiritual understanding? When I admonished you to do to others as you would have them do to you, I spoke to men of high ideals, not to those who would be tempted to distort my teaching into a license for the encouragement of evil-doing.”</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p4_3">147:4.3</a></small></sup>  When the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> had spoken, <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a> stood up and said: “But, Master, you should not think that I approve of such an interpretation of your teaching. I asked the question because I conjectured that many such men might thus misjudge your admonition, and I hoped you would give us further instruction regarding these matters.” And then when <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_the_Pharisee">Nathaniel</a> had sat down, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> continued speaking: “I well know, Nathaniel, that no such idea of evil is approved in your mind, but I am disappointed in that you all so often fail to put a genuinely spiritual interpretation upon my commonplace teachings, instruction which must be given you in human <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a> and as men must speak. Let me now teach you concerning the differing levels of meaning attached to the interpretation of this rule of living, this admonition to ‘do to others that which you desire others to do to you’:</p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p4_4">147:4.4</a></small></sup>  “1. <i>The level of the flesh.</i> Such a purely selfish and lustful interpretation would be well exemplified by the supposition of your question.</p>
<p id="p4_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p4_5">147:4.5</a></small></sup>  “2. <i>The level of the feelings.</i> This plane is one level higher than that of the flesh and implies that sympathy and pity would enhance one’s interpretation of this rule of living.</p>
<p id="p4_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p4_6">147:4.6</a></small></sup>  “3. <i>The level of mind.</i> Now come into action the reason of mind and the intelligence of experience. Good judgment dictates that such a rule of living should be interpreted in consonance with the highest idealism embodied in the nobility of profound self-respect.</p>
<p id="p4_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p4_7">147:4.7</a></small></sup>  “4. <i>The level of brotherly love.</i> Still higher is discovered the level of unselfish devotion to the welfare of one’s fellows. On this higher plane of wholehearted social service growing out of the consciousness of the fatherhood of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and the consequent recognition of the brotherhood of man, there is discovered a new and far more beautiful interpretation of this basic rule of life.</p>
<p id="p4_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p4_8">147:4.8</a></small></sup>  “5. <i>The moral level.</i> And then when you attain true philosophic levels of interpretation, when you have real insight into the <i>rightness</i> and <i>wrongness</i> of things, when you perceive the eternal fitness of human relationships, you will begin to view such a problem of interpretation as you would imagine a high-minded, idealistic, wise, and impartial third person would so view and interpret such an injunction as applied to your personal problems of adjustment to your life situations.</p>
<p id="p4_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p4_9">147:4.9</a></small></sup>  “6. <i>The spiritual level.</i> And then last, but greatest of all, we attain the level of spirit insight and spiritual interpretation which impels us to recognize in this rule of life the divine command to treat all men as we conceive <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> would treat them. That is the universe ideal of human relationships. And this is your attitude toward all such problems when your supreme desire is ever to do the Father’s will. I would, therefore, that you should do to all men that which you know I would do to them in like circumstances.”</p>
<p id="p4_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p4_10">147:4.10</a></small></sup>  Nothing <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had said to the apostles up to this time had ever more astonished them. They continued to discuss the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s words long after he had retired. While <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a> was slow to recover from his supposition that Jesus had misunderstood the spirit of his question, the others were more than thankful that their philosophic fellow apostle had had the courage to ask such a thought-provoking question.</p>
<h2 id="p5" class="toc-header"><a href="#p5" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 5. VISITING SIMON THE PHARISEE </h2>
<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p5_1">147:5.1</a></small></sup>  Though <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> was not a member of the Jewish <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a>, he was an influential Pharisee of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a><sup id="cite10"><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup>.

<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p5_2">147:5.2</a></small></sup>  The wealthy <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> were devoted to almsgiving, and they did not shun publicity regarding their philanthropy. Sometimes they would even blow a trumpet as they were about to bestow <a href="/en/topic/charity">charity</a> upon some beggar. It was the custom of these Pharisees, when they provided a <a href="/en/topic/banquets">banquet</a> for distinguished guests, to leave the doors of the house open so that even the street beggars might come in and, standing around the walls of the room behind the couches of the diners, be in position to receive portions of food which might be tossed to them by the banqueters.</p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p5_3">147:5.3</a></small></sup>  On this particular occasion at <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a>’s house, among those who came in off the street was a woman of unsavory reputation who had recently become a believer in the good news of the gospel of the kingdom. This woman was well known throughout all <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> as the former keeper of one of the so-called high-class <a href="/en/topic/brothels">brothels</a> located hard by the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> court of the gentiles. She had, on accepting the teachings of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, closed up her nefarious place of business and had induced the majority of the women associated with her to accept the gospel and change their mode of living; notwithstanding this, she was still held in great disdain by the Pharisees and was compelled to wear her <a href="/en/topic/hair">hair</a> down—the badge of harlotry. This unnamed woman had brought with her a large flask of perfumed anointing lotion and, standing behind Jesus as he reclined at meat, began to anoint his feet while she also wet his feet with her <a href="/en/topic/tears">tears</a> of gratitude, wiping them with the hair of her head.

The one owed him five hundred <a href="/en/topic/denarii">denarii</a> and the other fifty. Now, when neither of them had wherewith to pay, he forgave them both. Which of them do you think, Simon, would love him most?” Simon answered, “He, I suppose, whom he forgave the most<sup id="cite12"><a href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup>.” And Jesus said, “You have rightly judged,” and pointing to the woman, he continued: “Simon, take a good look at this woman. I entered your house as an invited guest, yet you gave me no water for my feet. This grateful woman has washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hair of her head. You gave me no kiss of friendly greeting, but this woman, ever since she came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet. My head with oil you neglected to anoint, but she has anointed my feet with precious lotions. And what is the meaning of all this? Simply that her many sins have been forgiven, and this has led her to love much. But those who have received but little forgiveness sometimes love but little.” And turning around toward the woman, he took her by the hand and, lifting her up, said: “You have indeed repented of your sins, and they are forgiven. Be not discouraged by the thoughtless and unkind attitude of your fellows; go on in the joy and liberty of the kingdom of heaven.”</p>

And I declare to all of you that the Father has opened the doors of the heavenly kingdom to all who have the faith to enter, and no man or association of men can close those doors even to the most humble soul or supposedly most flagrant sinner on earth if such sincerely seek an entrance.” And Jesus, with <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>, and John, took leave of their host and went to join the rest of the apostles at the camp in the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Gethsemane">Gethsemane</a><sup id="cite14"><a href="#fn14">[14]</a></sup>.</p>

Said Jesus: “My children, if there exists a true and living connection between the child and the Father, the child is certain to progress continuously toward the Father’s ideals. True, the child may at first make slow progress, but the progress is none the less sure. The important thing is not the rapidity of your progress but rather its certainty. Your actual achievement is not so important as the fact that the <i>direction</i> of your progress is Godward. What you are becoming day by day is of infinitely more importance than what you are today.</p>

There are present in this woman tremendous spiritual possibilities for the future. Some of you may not stand high in actual levels of soul and spirit, but you are making daily progress on the living way opened up, through faith, to God.

He declared that the heavenly Father is not a lax, loose, or foolishly indulgent parent who is ever ready to condone <a href="/en/topic/sin">sin</a> and forgive recklessness. He cautioned his hearers not mistakenly to apply his illustrations of father and son so as to make it appear that God is like some overindulgent and unwise parents who conspire with the foolish of earth to encompass the moral undoing of their thoughtless children, and who are thereby certainly and directly contributing to the <a href="/en/topic/delinquency">delinquency</a> and early demoralization of their own offspring. Said Jesus: “My Father does not indulgently condone those acts and practices of his children which are self-destructive and suicidal to all moral growth and spiritual progress.

<p id="p6_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p6_1">147:6.1</a></small></sup>  The last week of April, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the twelve departed from their <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a> headquarters near <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and began their journey back to <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> by way of <a href="/en/topic/Jericho">Jericho</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a>.</p>
<p id="p6_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p6_2">147:6.2</a></small></sup>  The chief priests and the religious leaders of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> held many secret meetings for the purpose of deciding what to do with Jesus. They were all agreed that something should be done to put a stop to his teaching, but they could not agree on the method. They had hoped that the civil authorities would dispose of him as Herod had put an end to John, but they discovered that Jesus was so conducting his work that the Roman officials were not much alarmed by his preaching. Accordingly, at a meeting which was held the day before Jesus’ departure for Capernaum, it was decided that he would have to be apprehended on a religious charge and be tried by the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a>. Therefore a commission of six secret spies was appointed to follow Jesus, to observe his words and acts, and when they had amassed sufficient evidence of lawbreaking and blasphemy, to return to Jerusalem with their report. These six <a href="/en/topic/Jews_(ancient_Hebrews)">Jews</a> caught up with the apostolic party, numbering about thirty, at Jericho and, under the pretense of desiring to become disciples, attached themselves to Jesus’ family of followers, remaining with the group up to the time of the beginning of the second preaching tour in <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>; whereupon three of them returned to Jerusalem to submit their report to the chief priests and the Sanhedrin.</p>

As the company passed along the narrow road, the waving <a href="/en/topic/wheat">wheat</a>, which was just then ripening, was near at hand on either side, and some of the apostles, being hungry, plucked the ripe <a href="/en/topic/grain">grain</a> and ate it. It was customary for travelers to help themselves to grain as they passed along the road, and therefore no thought of wrongdoing was attached to such conduct. But the spies seized upon this as a pretext for assailing Jesus. When they saw Andrew rub the grain in his hand, they went up to him and said: “Do you not know that it is unlawful to pluck and rub the grain on the Sabbath day?” And Andrew answered: “But we are hungry and rub only sufficient for our needs; and since when did it become sinful to eat grain on the Sabbath day?” But the <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> answered: “You do no wrong in eating, but you do break the law in plucking and rubbing out the grain between your hands; surely your <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> would not approve of such acts<sup id="cite16"><a href="#fn16">[16]</a></sup>.” Then said Andrew: “But if it is not wrong to eat the grain, surely the rubbing out between our hands is hardly more work than the chewing of the grain, which you allow; wherefore do you quibble over such trifles?” When Andrew intimated that they were quibblers, they were indignant, and rushing back to where Jesus walked along, talking to Matthew, they protested, saying: “Behold, Teacher, your apostles do that which is unlawful on the Sabbath day; they pluck, rub, and eat the grain. We are sure you will command them to cease.” And then said Jesus to the accusers: “You are indeed zealous for the law, and you do well to remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy; but did you never read in the Scripture that, one day when <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a> was hungry, he and they who were with him entered the house of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and ate the <a href="/en/topic/showbread">showbread</a>, which it was not lawful for anyone to eat save the priests? and David also gave this bread to those who were with him. And have you not read in our law that it is lawful to do many needful things on the Sabbath day? And shall I not, before the day is finished, see you eat that which you have brought along for the needs of this day? My good men, you do well to be zealous for the Sabbath, but you would do better to guard the health and well-being of your fellows. I declare that the Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath. And if you are here present with us to watch my words, then will I openly proclaim that the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> is lord even of the Sabbath.”<sup id="cite17"><a href="#fn17">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p6_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p6_5">147:6.5</a></small></sup>  The Pharisees were astonished and confounded by his words of discernment and wisdom. For the remainder of the day they kept by themselves and dared not ask any more questions.</p>

<h2 id="p7" class="toc-header"><a href="#p7" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 7. BACK IN CAPERNAUM </h2>
<p id="p7_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p7_1">147:7.1</a></small></sup>  It was around noon on Monday, May 3, when <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the twelve came to <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a> by boat from <a href="/en/topic/Tarichea">Tarichea</a>.

<p id="p7_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p7_2">147:7.2</a></small></sup>  On Tuesday evening Jesus was conducting one of his customary classes of questions and answers when the leader of the six spies said to him: “I was today talking with one of John’s disciples who is here attending upon your teaching, and we were at a loss to understand why you never command your disciples to fast and pray as we <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> fast and as John bade his followers.” And Jesus, referring to a statement by John, answered this questioner: “Do the sons of the bridechamber fast while the <a href="/en/topic/bridegroom">bridegroom</a> is with them? As long as the bridegroom remains with them, they can hardly fast. But the time is coming when the bridegroom shall be taken away, and during those times the children of the bridechamber undoubtedly will fast and pray. To pray is natural for the children of light, but <a href="/en/topic/fasting">fasting</a> is not a part of the <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> of the kingdom of heaven<sup id="cite18"><a href="#fn18">[18]</a></sup>. Be reminded that a wise tailor does not sew a piece of new and unshrunk <a href="/en/topic/clothing">cloth</a> upon an old garment, lest, when it is wet, it shrink and produce a worse rent. Neither do men put new <a href="/en/topic/wine">wine</a> into old wine skins, lest the new wine burst the skins so that both the wine and the skins perish. The wise man puts the new wine into fresh wine skins. Therefore do my disciples show wisdom in that they do not bring too much of the old order over into the new teaching of the gospel of the kingdom. You who have lost your teacher may be justified in fasting for a time. Fasting may be an appropriate part of the law of <a href="/en/topic/Moses">Moses</a>, but in the coming kingdom the sons of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> shall experience freedom from fear and joy in the divine spirit<sup id="cite19"><a href="#fn19">[19]</a></sup>.” And when they heard these words, the disciples of John were comforted while the Pharisees themselves were the more confounded.</p>
<p id="p7_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p7_3">147:7.3</a></small></sup>  Then the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> proceeded to warn his hearers against entertaining the notion that all olden teaching should be replaced entirely by new doctrines. Said <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>: “That which is old and also <i>true</i> must abide. Likewise, that which is new but false must be rejected. But that which is new and also true, have the faith and courage to accept. Remember it is written: ‘Forsake not an old friend, for the new is not comparable to him. As new wine, so is a new friend; if it becomes old, you shall drink it with gladness.’”<sup id="cite20"><a href="#fn20">[20]</a></sup></p>

For what reason do you afflict your souls while you continue to find pleasure in oppression and to take delight in injustice? Behold, you fast for the sake of strife and contention and to smite with the fist of wickedness.

Is not this the fast I should choose: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the knots of heavy burdens, to let the oppressed go free, and to break every yoke? Is it not to share my bread with the hungry and to bring those who are <a href="/en/topic/homeless">homeless</a> and <a href="/en/topic/poor">poor</a> to my house? And when I see those who are naked, I will clothe them<sup id="cite22"><a href="#fn22">[22]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p8_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p8_4">147:8.4</a></small></sup>  “‘Then shall your light break forth as the morning while your health springs forth speedily.

And all this he will do if you refrain from <a href="/en/topic/oppression">oppression</a>, condemnation, and <a href="/en/topic/vanity">vanity</a>. The Father rather desires that you draw out your heart to the hungry, and that you minister to the afflicted souls; then shall your light shine in obscurity, and even your darkness shall be as the noonday. Then shall the Lord guide you continually, satisfying your soul and renewing your strength. You shall become like a watered <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a>, like a spring whose waters fail not. And they who do these things shall restore the wasted glories; they shall raise up the foundations of many generations; they shall be called the rebuilders of broken walls, the restorers of safe paths in which to dwell<sup id="cite23"><a href="#fn23">[23]</a></sup>.’”</p>

His last words that night were: “Grow in <a href="/en/topic/grace_(God’s_mercy)">grace</a> by means of that living faith which grasps the fact that you are the sons of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> while at the same time it recognizes every man as a brother<sup id="cite24"><a href="#fn24">[24]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p8_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p8_6">147:8.6</a></small></sup>  It was after two o’clock in the morning when Jesus ceased speaking and every man went to his place for sleep.</p>
