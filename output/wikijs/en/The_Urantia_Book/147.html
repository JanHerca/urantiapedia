<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p0_1">147:0.1</a></small></sup>  JESUS and the apostles arrived in <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> on <a href="/en/topic/Wednesday">Wednesday</a>, March 17, and spent two weeks at the <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a> headquarters before they departed for <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. These two weeks the apostles taught the people by the seaside while <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> spent much time alone in the hills about his <a href="/en/topic/Father’s_business">Father’s business</a>. During this period Jesus, accompanied by <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> and <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John Zebedee</a>, made two secret trips to <a href="/en/topic/Tiberias">Tiberias</a>, where they met with the believers and instructed them in the gospel of the kingdom.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p0_2">147:0.2</a></small></sup>  Many of the household of Herod believed in Jesus and attended these meetings. It was the influence of these believers among Herod’s official family that had helped to lessen that ruler’s enmity toward Jesus. These believers at Tiberias had fully explained to Herod that the “kingdom” which Jesus proclaimed was spiritual in nature and not a political venture. Herod rather believed these members of his own household and therefore did not permit himself to become unduly alarmed by the spreading abroad of the reports concerning Jesus’ teaching and healing. He had no objections to Jesus’ work as a healer or religious teacher. Notwithstanding the favorable attitude of many of Herod’s advisers, and even of Herod himself, there existed a group of his subordinates who were so influenced by the religious leaders at Jerusalem that they remained bitter and threatening enemies of Jesus and the apostles and, later on, did much to hamper their public activities. The greatest danger to Jesus lay in the Jerusalem religious leaders and not in Herod. And it was for this very reason that Jesus and the apostles spent so much time and did most of their public preaching in <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> rather than at Jerusalem and in <a href="/en/topic/Judea">Judea</a>.</p>

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p1_1">147:1.1</a></small></sup>  On the day before they made ready to go to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> for the feast of the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Mangus">Mangus</a>, a centurion, or captain, of the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_soldiers_in_Jerusalem">Roman guard</a> stationed at <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, came to the rulers of the synagogue, saying: “My faithful orderly is sick and at the point of death. Would you, therefore, go to <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> in my behalf and beseech him to heal my servant?” The <a href="/en/topic/Roman_centurion_of_Jerusalem">Roman captain</a> did this because he thought the Jewish leaders would have more influence with Jesus<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. So the elders went to see Jesus and their spokesman said: “Teacher, we earnestly request you to go over to Capernaum and save the favorite servant of the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_centurion_in_Corinth">Roman centurion</a>, who is worthy of your notice because he loves our nation and even built us the very synagogue wherein you have so many times spoken.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_1_3"><a href="#fn_s1_1_3">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p1_2">147:1.2</a></small></sup>  And when Jesus had heard them, he said, “I will go with you.” And as he went with them over to the centurion’s house, and before they had entered his yard, the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_soldier_in_Rome">Roman soldier</a> sent his friends out to greet Jesus, instructing them to say: “Lord, trouble not yourself to enter my house, for I am not worthy that you should come under my roof. Neither did I think myself worthy to come to you; wherefore I sent the elders of your own people. But I know that you can speak the word where you stand and my servant will be healed. For I am myself under the orders of others, and I have soldiers under me, and I say to this one go, and he goes; to another come, and he comes, and to my servants do this or do that, and they do it<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p1_3">147:1.3</a></small></sup>  And when <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> heard these words, he turned and said to his apostles and those who were with them: “I marvel at the belief of the gentile. Verily, verily, I say to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>.” Jesus, turning from the house, said, “Let us go hence.” And the friends of the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_centurion_of_Jerusalem">centurion</a> went into the house and told <a href="/en/topic/Mangus">Mangus</a> what Jesus had said. And from that hour the servant began to mend and was eventually restored to his normal health and usefulness<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_3_3"><a href="#fn_a1_3_3">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p1_4">147:1.4</a></small></sup>  But we never knew just what happened on this occasion. This is simply the record, and as to whether or not invisible beings ministered healing to the centurion’s servant, was not revealed to those who accompanied Jesus. We only know of the fact of the servant’s complete recovery.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. THE JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p2_1">147:2.1</a></small></sup>  Early on the morning of Tuesday, March 30, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the apostolic party started on their journey to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> for the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a>, going by the route of the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> valley. They arrived on the afternoon of <a href="/en/topic/Fridays">Friday</a>, April 2, and established their headquarters, as usual, at <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a>. Passing through <a href="/en/topic/Jericho">Jericho</a>, they paused to rest while Judas made a deposit of some of their common funds in the bank of a friend of his family. This was <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> time Judas had carried a surplus of money, and this deposit was left undisturbed until they passed through Jericho again when on that last and eventful journey to Jerusalem just before the trial and death of Jesus.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p2_2">147:2.2</a></small></sup>  The party had an uneventful trip to Jerusalem, but they had hardly got themselves settled at Bethany when from near and far those seeking healing for their bodies, comfort for troubled minds, and salvation for their souls, began to congregate, so much so that Jesus had little time for rest. Therefore they pitched tents at <a href="/en/topic/Gethsemane">Gethsemane</a>, and the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> would go back and forth from Bethany to Gethsemane to avoid the crowds which so constantly thronged him. The apostolic party spent almost three weeks at Jerusalem, but Jesus enjoined them to do no public preaching, only private teaching and personal work.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p2_3">147:2.3</a></small></sup>  At <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a> they quietly celebrated the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a>. And this was <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> time that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and all of the twelve partook of the bloodless Passover feast. The apostles of John did not eat the Passover with Jesus and his apostles; they celebrated the feast with <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a> and many of the early believers in John’s preaching. This was the second Passover Jesus had observed with his apostles in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p2_4">147:2.4</a></small></sup>  When Jesus and the twelve departed for <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, the apostles of John did not return with them. Under the direction of Abner they remained in Jerusalem and the surrounding country, quietly laboring for the extension of the kingdom, while Jesus and the twelve returned to work in <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>. Never again were the twenty-four all together until a short time before the commissioning and sending forth of the seventy evangelists. But the two groups were co-operative, and notwithstanding their differences of opinion, the best of feelings prevailed.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. AT THE POOL OF BETHESDA </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p3_1">147:3.1</a></small></sup>  The afternoon of the second <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, as the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and the apostles were about to participate in the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> services, John said to <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, “Come with me, I would show you something.” John conducted Jesus out through one of the Jerusalem gates to a pool of water called <a href="/en/topic/Bethesda_(pool)">Bethesda</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>. Surrounding this pool was a structure of five porches under which a large group of sufferers lingered in quest of healing. This was a hot spring whose reddish-tinged water would bubble up at irregular intervals because of gas accumulations in the rock caverns underneath the pool. This periodic disturbance of the warm waters was believed by many to be due to supernatural influences, and it was a popular belief that <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> person who entered the water after such a disturbance would be healed of whatever infirmity he had.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_1_3"><a href="#fn_s3_1_3">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p3_2">147:3.2</a></small></sup>  The apostles were somewhat restless under the restrictions imposed by Jesus, and John, the youngest of the twelve, was especially restive under this restraint. He had brought Jesus to the pool thinking that the sight of the assembled sufferers would make such an appeal to the Master’s compassion that he would be moved to perform a miracle of healing, and thereby would all Jerusalem be astounded and presently be won to believe in the <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> of the kingdom. Said John to Jesus: “Master, see all of these suffering ones; is there nothing we can do for them?” And Jesus replied: “John, why would you tempt me to turn aside from the way I have chosen? Why do you go on desiring to substitute the working of wonders and the healing of the sick for the proclamation of the gospel of eternal truth? My son, I may not do that which you desire, but gather together these sick and afflicted that I may speak words of good cheer and eternal comfort to them.”</p>

<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p3_3">147:3.3</a></small></sup>  In speaking to those assembled, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> said: “Many of you are here, sick and afflicted, because of your many years of wrong living. Some suffer from the accidents of time, others as a result of the mistakes of their forebears, while some of you struggle under the handicaps of the imperfect conditions of your temporal existence. But my Father works, and I would work, to improve your earthly state but more especially to insure your eternal estate. None of us can do much to change the <a href="/en/topic/difficulties">difficulties</a> of life unless we discover the Father in heaven so wills. After all, we are all beholden to do the will of the Eternal. If you could all be healed of your physical afflictions, you would indeed marvel, but it is even greater that you should be cleansed of all spiritual <a href="/en/topic/disease">disease</a> and find yourselves healed of all moral infirmities. You are all <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>’s children; you are the sons of the heavenly Father. The bonds of time may seem to afflict you, but the God of eternity loves you. And when the time of <a href="/en/topic/judgment">judgment</a> shall come, fear not, you shall all find, not only justice, but an abundance of mercy. Verily, verily, I say to you: He who hears the gospel of the kingdom and believes in this teaching of sonship with God, has <a href="/en/topic/eternal_life">eternal life</a>; already are such believers passing from judgment and death to light and life.

This afflicted man had waited all these years for <i>somebody</i> to help him; he was such a victim of the feeling of his own <a href="/en/topic/helplessness">helplessness</a> that he had never once entertained the idea of helping himself which proved to be the one thing he had to do in order to effect recovery—take up his bed and walk<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p3_6">147:3.6</a></small></sup>  Then said Jesus to John: “Let us depart ere the chief priests and the scribes come upon us and take offense that we spoke words of life to these afflicted ones<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>.” And they returned to the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> to join their companions, and presently all of them departed to spend the night at <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a>.

Let me illustrate my contention by citing the example of a lustful man who thus wickedly looks upon his intended consort in sin.

What manner of thinking is going on in your heart? Do you not receive my teachings as one who has been born of the spirit? Do you not hear the truth as men of wisdom and spiritual understanding? When I admonished you to do to others as you would have them do to you, I spoke to men of high ideals, not to those who would be tempted to distort my teaching into a license for the encouragement of evil-doing.”</p>

Let me now teach you concerning the differing levels of meaning attached to the interpretation of this rule of living, this admonition to ‘do to others that which you desire others to do to you’:</p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p4_4">147:4.4</a></small></sup>  “1. <i>The level of the flesh.</i> Such a purely selfish and lustful interpretation would be well exemplified by the supposition of your question.</p>
