In spite of the massing of land in high latitudes, the world climate remained relatively mild because of the enormous increase in the size of the tropic seas, nor was the land elevated sufficiently to produce <a href="/en/topic/glaciers">glaciers</a>.

<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p2_4">61:2.4</a></small></sup>  Marked changes were taking place in the fauna of the planet. The sea life was undergoing great modification; most of the present-day orders of marine life were in existence, and <a href="/en/topic/foraminifers">foraminifers</a> continued to play an important role.
