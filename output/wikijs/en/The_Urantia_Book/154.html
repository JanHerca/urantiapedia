<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p0_1">154:0.1</a></small></sup>  ON THE eventful Saturday night of April 30, as <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was speaking words of comfort and courage to his downcast and bewildered disciples, at <a href="/en/topic/Tiberias">Tiberias</a> a council was being held between <a href="/en/topic/Herod_Antipas">Herod Antipas</a> and a group of special commissioners representing the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a>. These scribes and <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> urged <a href="/en/topic/Herod_the_Great">Herod</a> to arrest Jesus; they did their best to convince him that Jesus was stirring up the populace to dissension and even to <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">rebellion</a>. But Herod refused to take action against him as a political offender. Herod‚Äôs advisers had correctly reported the episode across the lake when the people sought to proclaim Jesus king and how he rejected the proposal.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p0_2">154:0.2</a></small></sup>  One of Herod‚Äôs official family, <a href="/en/topic/Chuza">Chuza</a>, whose wife belonged to the women‚Äôs ministering corps, had informed him that Jesus did not propose to meddle with the affairs of earthly rule; that he was only concerned with the establishment of the spiritual brotherhood of his believers, which brotherhood he called the kingdom of heaven. Herod had confidence in Chuza‚Äôs reports, so much so that he refused to interfere with Jesus‚Äô activities. Herod was also influenced at this time, in his attitude toward Jesus, by his superstitious fear of <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John the Baptist</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. Herod was one of those apostate <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> who, while he believed nothing, feared everything<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>. He had a bad conscience for having put <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a> to death, and he did not want to become entangled in these intrigues against Jesus. He knew of many cases of sickness which had been apparently healed by Jesus, and he regarded him as either a prophet or a relatively harmless religious fanatic.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p0_3">154:0.3</a></small></sup>  When the Jews threatened to report to Caesar that he was shielding a traitorous subject, <a href="/en/topic/Herod_Antipas">Herod</a> ordered them out of his council chamber. Thus matters rested for one week, during which time <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> prepared his followers for the impending dispersion.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 1. A WEEK OF COUNSEL </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p1_1">154:1.1</a></small></sup>  From May 1 to May 7 <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> held intimate counsel with his followers at the <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a> house. Only the tried and trusted disciples were admitted to these conferences. At this time there were only about one hundred disciples who had the moral courage to brave the opposition of the <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> and openly declare their adherence to Jesus. With this group he held sessions morning, afternoon, and evening. Small companies of inquirers assembled each afternoon by the seaside, where some of the evangelists or apostles discoursed to them. These groups seldom numbered more than fifty.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p1_2">154:1.2</a></small></sup>  On <a href="/en/topic/Fridays">Friday</a> of this week official action was taken by the rulers of the <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> synagogue closing the house of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> to Jesus and all his followers. This action was taken at the instigation of the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> Pharisees. <a href="/en/topic/Jairus">Jairus</a> resigned as chief ruler and openly aligned himself with Jesus.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_11"><a href="#fn_a1_2_11">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_2_10"><a href="#fn_a1_2_10">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p1_3">154:1.3</a></small></sup>  The last of the seaside meetings was held on <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> afternoon, May 7. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> talked to less than one hundred and fifty who had assembled at that time. This Saturday night marked the time of the lowest ebb in the tide of popular regard for Jesus and his teachings. From then on there was a steady, slow, but more healthful and dependable growth in favorable sentiment; a new following was built up which was better grounded in spiritual faith and true religious experience. The more or less composite and compromising transition stage between the materialistic concepts of the kingdom held by the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>‚Äôs followers and those more idealistic and spiritual concepts taught by Jesus, had now definitely ended. From now on there was a more open proclamation of the gospel of the kingdom in its larger scope and in its far-flung spiritual implications.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_3_13"><a href="#fn_a1_3_13">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_3_14"><a href="#fn_a1_3_14">[4]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 2. A WEEK OF REST </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p2_1">154:2.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a>, May 8, A.D. 29, at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> passed a decree closing all the <a href="/en/topic/synagogues">synagogues</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a> to <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and his followers. This was a new and unprecedented usurpation of authority by the Jerusalem Sanhedrin. Theretofore each synagogue had existed and functioned as an independent congregation of worshipers and was under the rule and direction of its own board of governors. Only the synagogues of Jerusalem had been subject to the authority of the Sanhedrin. This summary action of the Sanhedrin was followed by the resignation of five of its members. One hundred <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> were immediately dispatched to convey and enforce this decree. Within the short space of two weeks every synagogue in Palestine had bowed to this manifesto of the Sanhedrin except the synagogue at <a href="/en/topic/Hebron">Hebron</a>. The rulers of the Hebron synagogue refused to acknowledge the right of the Sanhedrin to exercise such jurisdiction over their assembly. This refusal to accede to the Jerusalem decree was based on their contention of congregational autonomy rather than on sympathy with Jesus‚Äô cause. Shortly thereafter the Hebron synagogue was destroyed by <a href="/en/topic/fire">fire</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_1_10"><a href="#fn_a2_1_10">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_1_19"><a href="#fn_a2_1_19">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p2_2">154:2.2</a></small></sup>  This same Sunday morning, Jesus declared a week‚Äôs holiday, urging all of his disciples to return to their homes or friends to rest their troubled souls and speak words of encouragement to their loved ones. He said: ‚ÄúGo to your several places to play or fish while you pray for the extension of the kingdom.‚Äù</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p2_3">154:2.3</a></small></sup>  This week of rest enabled <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> to visit many families and groups about the seaside. He also went fishing with <a href="/en/topic/David_Zebedee">David Zebedee</a> on several occasions, and while he went about alone much of the time, there always lurked near by two or three of <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a>‚Äôs most trusted <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a>, who had no uncertain orders from their chief respecting the safeguarding of Jesus. There was no public teaching of any sort during this week of rest.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p2_4">154:2.4</a></small></sup>  This was the week that <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a> and <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James Zebedee</a> suffered from more than a slight illness. For three days and nights they were acutely afflicted with a painful digestive disturbance. On the third night Jesus sent <a href="/en/topic/Salome_(wife_of_Zebedee)">Salome</a>, <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>‚Äôs mother, to her rest, while he ministered to his suffering apostles. Of course Jesus could have instantly healed these two men, but that is not the method of either the Son or the Father in dealing with these commonplace difficulties and afflictions of the children of men on the evolutionary worlds of time and space. Never once, throughout all of his eventful life in the flesh, did Jesus engage in any sort of supernatural ministration to any member of his earth family or in behalf of any one of his immediate followers.</p>

The animal nature and the lower forms of will creatures do not progress favorably in environmental <a href="/en/topic/ease">ease</a>.

<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 3. THE SECOND TIBERIAS CONFERENCE </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p3_1">154:3.1</a></small></sup>  On May 16 the second conference at <a href="/en/topic/Tiberias">Tiberias</a> between the authorities at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Herod_Antipas">Herod Antipas</a> was convened. Both the religious and the political leaders from Jerusalem were in attendance. The Jewish leaders were able to report to <a href="/en/topic/Herod_the_Great">Herod</a> that practically all the synagogues in both <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Judea">Judea</a> were closed to <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>‚Äô teachings. A new effort was made to have Herod place Jesus under arrest, but he refused to do their bidding. On May 18, however, Herod did agree to the plan of permitting the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> authorities to seize Jesus and carry him to Jerusalem to be tried on religious charges, provided the Roman ruler of Judea concurred in such an arrangement. Meanwhile, Jesus‚Äô enemies were industriously spreading the rumor throughout Galilee that Herod had become hostile to Jesus, and that he meant to exterminate all who believed in his teachings.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_1_19"><a href="#fn_a3_1_19">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p3_2">154:3.2</a></small></sup>  On Saturday night, May 21, word reached Tiberias that the civil authorities at Jerusalem had no objection to the agreement between Herod and the <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> that Jesus be seized and carried to Jerusalem for trial before the Sanhedrin on charges of flouting the sacred laws of the Jewish nation. Accordingly, just before midnight of this day, Herod signed the decree which authorized the officers of the Sanhedrin to seize Jesus within Herod‚Äôs domains and forcibly to carry him to Jerusalem for trial. Strong pressure from many sides was brought to bear upon Herod before he consented to grant this permission, and he well knew that Jesus could not expect a fair trial before his bitter enemies at Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 4. SATURDAY NIGHT IN CAPERNAUM </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p4_1">154:4.1</a></small></sup>  On this same Saturday night, in <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> a group of fifty leading citizens met at the synagogue to discuss the momentous question: ‚ÄúWhat shall we do with <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>?‚Äù They talked and debated until after midnight, but they could not find any common ground for agreement. Aside from a few persons who inclined to the belief that Jesus might be the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a>, at least a holy man, or perhaps a prophet, the meeting was divided into four nearly equal groups who held, respectively, the following views of Jesus:</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p4_2">154:4.2</a></small></sup>  1. That he was a deluded and harmless religious fanatic.</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p4_3">154:4.3</a></small></sup>  2. That he was a dangerous and designing agitator who might stir up <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">rebellion</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p4_4">154:4.4</a></small></sup>  3. That he was in league with devils, that he might even be a prince of devils.</p>
<p id="p4_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p4_5">154:4.5</a></small></sup>  4. That he was beside himself, that he was mad, mentally unbalanced.</p>
<p id="p4_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p4_6">154:4.6</a></small></sup>  There was much talk about <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>‚Äô preaching doctrines which were upsetting for the common people; his enemies maintained that his teachings were impractical, that everything would go to pieces if everybody made an honest effort to live in accordance with his ideas. And the men of many subsequent generations have said the same things. Many intelligent and well-meaning men, even in the more enlightened age of these revelations, maintain that modern <a href="/en/topic/civilization">civilization</a> could not have been built upon the teachings of Jesus‚Äîand they are partially right. But all such doubters forget that a much better civilization could have been built upon his teachings, and sometime will be.

<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p5_1">154:5.1</a></small></sup>  May 22 was an eventful day in the life of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. On this <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a> morning, before daybreak, one of <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a>‚Äôs <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> arrived in great haste from <a href="/en/topic/Tiberias">Tiberias</a>, bringing the word that <a href="/en/topic/Herod_Antipas">Herod</a> had authorized, or was about to authorize, the arrest of Jesus by the officers of the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a>. The receipt of the news of this impending danger caused <a href="/en/topic/David_Zebedee">David Zebedee</a> to arouse his messengers and send them out to all the local groups of disciples, summoning them for an emergency council at seven o‚Äôclock that morning. When the sister-in-law of <a href="/en/topic/Jude">Jude</a> (Jesus‚Äô brother) heard this alarming report, she hastened word to all of Jesus‚Äô family who dwelt near by, summoning them forthwith to assemble at <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a>‚Äôs house. And in response to this hasty call, presently there were assembled <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a>, <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>, Jude, and <a href="/en/topic/Ruth_(Old_Testament)">Ruth</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_1_7"><a href="#fn_a5_1_7">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p5_2">154:5.2</a></small></sup>  At this early morning meeting Jesus imparted his farewell instructions to the assembled disciples; that is, he bade them farewell for the time being, knowing well that they would soon be dispersed from <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>. He directed them all to seek <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> for guidance and to carry on the work of the kingdom regardless of consequences. The evangelists were to labor as they saw fit until such time as they might be called. He selected twelve of the evangelists to accompany him; the twelve apostles he directed to remain with him no matter what happened. The twelve women he instructed to remain at the Zebedee house and at <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>‚Äôs house until he should send for them.</p>

This was a solemn occasion for all present, but Jesus seemed unusually cheerful; he was once more like his normal self.

Jude and <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James</a>, and even <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>, still retained much of their faith in Jesus, but they had permitted pride to interfere with their better judgment and real spiritual inclinations. <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> was likewise torn between love and fear, between mother love and family pride. Though she was harassed by doubts, she could never quite forget the visit of <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a> ere Jesus was born.
