As the personality of the human child expands for the struggles of evolutionary existence, so does the Adjuster wax great in the rehearsals of the next stage of <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending</a> life. As the child acquires adaptative versatility for his adult activities through the social and play life of early childhood, so does the indwelling Adjuster achieve skill for the next stage of cosmic life by virtue of the preliminary mortal planning and rehearsing of those activities which have to do with the morontia career. Human existence constitutes a period of practice which is effectively utilized by the Adjuster in preparing for the increased responsibilities and the greater opportunities of a future life. But the Adjuster’s efforts, while living within you, are not so much concerned with the affairs of temporal life and planetary existence. Today, the Thought Adjusters are, as it were, rehearsing the realities of the universe career in the evolving minds of human beings.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_1_28"><a href="#fn_a0_1_28">[2]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_1_3"><a href="#fn_s0_1_3">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s0_1_4"><a href="#fn_s0_1_4">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s0_1_6"><a href="#fn_s0_1_6">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p1_1">109:1.1</a></small></sup>  There must be a comprehensive and elaborate plan for the training and development of virgin <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Adjusters</a> before they are sent forth from <a href="/en/topic/Divinington">Divinington</a>, but we really do not know very much about it.

<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p3_1">109:3.1</a></small></sup>  The character of the detailed work of <a href="/en/topic/Mystery_Monitors">Mystery Monitors</a> varies in accordance with the nature of their assignments, as to whether or not they are <i>liaison</i> or <i>fusion</i> <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Adjusters</a>. Some Adjusters are merely loaned for the temporal lifetimes of their subjects; others are bestowed as personality candidates with permission for everlasting fusion if their subjects survive. There is also a slight variation in their work among the different planetary types as well as in different systems and universes. But, on the whole, their labors are remarkably uniform, more so than are the duties of any of the created orders of <a href="/en/topic/celestial_beings">celestial beings</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_1_6"><a href="#fn_s3_1_6">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p3_2">109:3.2</a></small></sup>  On certain primitive <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_worlds">worlds</a> (<a href="/en/topic/Urantia_Papers">the series</a> one group) the Adjuster indwells the mind of the creature as an experiential training, chiefly for self-culture and progressive development. Virgin Adjusters are usually sent to such worlds during the earlier times when primitive men are arriving in the valley of decision, but when comparatively few will elect to ascend the moral heights beyond the hills of self-mastery and character acquirement to attain the higher levels of emerging spirituality. (Many, however, who fail of <a href="/en/topic/Adjuster_fusion">Adjuster fusion</a> do survive as Spirit-fused <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascenders</a>.) The Adjusters receive valuable training and acquire wonderful experience in transient association with primitive minds, and they are able subsequently to utilize this experience for the benefit of <a href="/en/topic/superior_seraphim">superior</a> beings on other worlds. <i>Nothing of <a href="/en/topic/survival_value">survival value</a> is ever lost in all the wide universe.</i><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_2_42"><a href="#fn_a3_2_42">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_2_52"><a href="#fn_a3_2_52">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_2_54"><a href="#fn_a3_2_54">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p3_3">109:3.3</a></small></sup>  On another type of world (the series two group) the <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Adjusters</a> are merely loaned to mortal beings. Here the Monitors can never attain fusion personality through such indwelling, but they do afford great help to their human subjects during the mortal lifetime, far more than they are able to give to <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a>. The Adjusters are here loaned to the mortal creatures for a single life span as patterns for their higher spiritual attainment, temporary helpers in the intriguing task of perfecting a survival character. The Adjusters do not return after natural death; these surviving mortals attain eternal life through Spirit fusion.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p3_4">109:3.4</a></small></sup>  On <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_worlds">worlds</a> such as Urantia (<a href="/en/topic/Urantia_Papers">the series</a> three group) there is a real betrothal with the divine gifts, a life and death engagement. If you survive, there is to be an eternal union, an everlasting fusion, the making of man and Adjuster one being.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p3_5">109:3.5</a></small></sup>  In the three-brained <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of this series of worlds, the <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Adjusters</a> are able to gain far more actual contact with their subjects during the temporal life than in the one- and <a href="/en/topic/brains">two-brained</a> types. But in the career after death, the three-brained type proceed just as do the one-brained type and the two-brained peoples—the <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> races.</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p3_6">109:3.6</a></small></sup>  On the two-brain <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_worlds">worlds</a>, subsequent to the sojourn of a <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> bestowal Son, virgin Adjusters are seldom assigned to persons who have unquestioned capacity for survival.

<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p3_7">109:3.7</a></small></sup>  In many of the early evolutionary races of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>, three groups of beings existed. There were those who were so animalistic that they were utterly lacking in <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Adjuster</a> capacity. There were those who exhibited undoubted capacity for Adjusters and promptly received them when the age of moral responsibility was attained. There was a third class who occupied a borderline position; they had capacity for Adjuster reception, but the Monitors could only indwell the mind on the personal petition of the individual.</p>

Animals do have fellow feelings, but they do not communicate concepts to each other; they can express emotions but not ideas and ideals. Neither do men of <a href="/en/topic/animals">animal</a> origin experience a high type of intellectual intercourse or spiritual communion with their fellows until the <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Thought Adjusters</a> have been bestowed, albeit, when such evolutionary creatures develop speech, they are on the highroad to receiving Adjusters.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_1_28"><a href="#fn_a4_1_28">[2]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_1_2"><a href="#fn_s4_1_2">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p4_2">109:4.2</a></small></sup>  Animals do, in a crude way, communicate with each other, but there is little or no <i><a href="/en/topic/personality">personality</a></i> in such primitive contact. Adjusters are not personality; they are prepersonal beings. But they do hail from the source of personality, and their presence does augment the qualitative manifestations of human personality; especially is this true if the Adjuster has had previous experience.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_2_12"><a href="#fn_a4_2_12">[20]</a></sup></p>
