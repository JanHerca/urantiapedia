<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p0_1">16:0.1</a></small></sup>  THE <a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirits,_Seven">Seven Master Spirits</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> are the primary personalities of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>. In this sevenfold creative act of self-duplication the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite">Infinite</a> Spirit exhausted the associative possibilities mathematically inherent in the factual existence of the three persons of <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>. Had it been possible to produce a larger number of <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> Spirits, they would have been created, but there are just <a href="/en/topic/7">seven</a> associative possibilities, and only <a href="/en/topic/seven">seven</a>, inherent in three Deities. And this explains why the universe is operated in seven grand divisions, and why the number seven is basically fundamental in its organization and administration.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p0_2">16:0.2</a></small></sup>  The Seven Master Spirits thus have their origin in, and derive their individual characteristics from, the following seven likenesses:</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p0_3">16:0.3</a></small></sup>  1. The <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>.</p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p0_4">16:0.4</a></small></sup>  2. The <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a>.</p>
<p id="p0_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p0_5">16:0.5</a></small></sup>  3. The <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>.</p>
<p id="p0_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p0_6">16:0.6</a></small></sup>  4. The Father and the Son.</p>
<p id="p0_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p0_7">16:0.7</a></small></sup>  5. The Father and the Spirit.</p>
<p id="p0_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p0_8">16:0.8</a></small></sup>  6. The Son and the Spirit.</p>
<p id="p0_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p0_9">16:0.9</a></small></sup>  7. The Father, Son, and Spirit.</p>
<p id="p0_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p0_10">16:0.10</a></small></sup>  We know very little about the action of the Father and the Son in the creation of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> Spirits. Apparently they were brought into existence by the personal acts of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>, but we have been definitely instructed that both the Father and the Son participated in their origin.</p>
<p id="p0_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p0_11">16:0.11</a></small></sup>  In spirit character and nature these Seven Spirits of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> are as one, but in all other aspects of identity they are very unlike, and the results of their functioning in the superuniverses are such that the individual differences of each are unmistakably discernible. All the afterplans of the seven segments of the grand universe—and even the correlative segments of outer space—have been conditioned by the other-than-spiritual diversity of these Seven Master Spirits of supreme and ultimate supervision.</p>
<p id="p0_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p0_12">16:0.12</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> Spirits have many functions, but at the present time their particular domain is the central supervision of the seven <a href="/en/topic/superuniverses">superuniverses</a>. Each <a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirits,_Seven">Master Spirit</a> maintains an enormous force-focal headquarters, which slowly circulates around the periphery of Paradise, always maintaining a position opposite the superuniverse of immediate supervision and at the Paradise focal point of its specialized power control and segmental energy distribution. The radial boundary lines of any one of the superuniverses do actually converge at the Paradise headquarters of the supervising Master Spirit.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. RELATION TO TRIUNE DEITY </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p1_1">16:1.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Conjoint_Creator">Conjoint Creator</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>, is necessary to the completion of the triune personalization of undivided <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>. This threefold Deity personalization is inherently sevenfold in possibility of individual and associative expression; hence the subsequent plan to create universes inhabited by intelligent and potentially spiritual beings, duly expressive of the Father, Son, and Spirit, made the personalization of the <a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirits,_Seven">Seven Master Spirits</a> inescapable. We have come to speak of the threefold personalization of Deity as the <i>absolute inevitability,</i> while we have come to look upon the appearance of the Seven <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> Spirits as the <i>subabsolute inevitability.</i></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p1_2">16:1.2</a></small></sup>  While the Seven Master Spirits are hardly expressive of <i>threefold</i> Deity, they are the eternal portrayal of <i>sevenfold</i> Deity, the active and associative functions of the three ever-existent persons of Deity. By and in and through these Seven Spirits, the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a>, or the Infinite Spirit, or any dual association, is able to function as such. When the Father, the Son, and the Spirit act together, they can and do function through <a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirit_Number_Seven">Master Spirit Number Seven</a>, but not as the <a href="/en/topic/Trinity">Trinity</a>. The Master Spirits singly and collectively represent any and all possible Deity functions, single and several, but not collective, not the Trinity. Master Spirit Number Seven is personally nonfunctional with regard to the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Trinity">Paradise Trinity</a>, and that is just why he can function <i>personally</i> for the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme">Supreme</a> Being.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p1_3">16:1.3</a></small></sup>  But when the <a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirits,_Seven">Seven Master Spirits</a> vacate their individual seats of personal power and superuniverse authority and assemble about the <a href="/en/topic/Conjoint_Actor">Conjoint Actor</a> in the triune presence of Paradise <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>, then and there are they collectively representative of the functional power, wisdom, and authority of undivided Deity—the Trinity—to and in the evolving universes. Such a Paradise union of the primal sevenfold expression of Deity does actually embrace, literally encompass, all of every attribute and attitude of the three eternal Deities in <a href="/en/topic/Supremacy">Supremacy</a> and in Ultimacy. To all practical intents and purposes the Seven <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> Spirits do, then and there, encompass the functional domain of the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme-Ultimate">Supreme-Ultimate</a> to and in the master universe.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p1_4">16:1.4</a></small></sup>  As far as we can discern, these Seven Spirits are associated with the divine activities of the three eternal persons of Deity; we detect no evidence of direct association with the functioning presences of the three eternal phases of the <a href="/en/topic/Absolute">Absolute</a>. When associated, the Master Spirits represent the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Deities">Paradise Deities</a> in what may be roughly conceived as the finite domain of action. It might embrace much that is ultimate but <i>not</i> absolute.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. RELATION TO THE INFINITE SPIRIT </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p2_1">16:2.1</a></small></sup>  Just as the Eternal and <a href="/en/topic/Original">Original</a> Son is revealed through the persons of the constantly increasing number of divine Sons, so is the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite">Infinite</a> and Divine Spirit revealed through the channels of the <a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirits,_Seven">Seven Master Spirits</a> and their associated spirit groups. At the center of centers the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a> is approachable, but not all who attain <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> are immediately able to discern his personality and differentiated presence; but all who attain the central universe can and do immediately commune with one of the Seven <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> Spirits, the one presiding over the superuniverse from which the newly arrived space pilgrim hails.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p2_2">16:2.2</a></small></sup>  To the universe of universes the Paradise Father speaks only through his Son, while he and the Son conjointly act only through the Infinite Spirit. Outside of Paradise and <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> the Infinite Spirit <i>speaks</i> only by the voices of the Seven Master Spirits.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p2_3">16:2.3</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a> exerts an influence of <i>personal presence</i> within the confines of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise-Havona_system">Paradise-Havona system</a>; elsewhere his personal spirit presence is exerted by and through one of the <a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirits,_Seven">Seven Master Spirits</a>. Therefore is the superuniverse spirit presence of the <a href="/en/topic/Third_Source_and_Center">Third Source and Center</a> on any world or in any individual conditioned by the unique nature of the supervisory <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> Spirit of that segment of creation. Conversely, the combined lines of spirit force and intelligence pass inward to the <a href="/en/topic/Third_Person_of_Deity">Third Person of Deity</a> by way of the Seven Master Spirits.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p2_4">16:2.4</a></small></sup>  The Seven Master Spirits are collectively endowed with the supreme-ultimate attributes of the Third Source and Center. While each one individually partakes of this endowment, only collectively do they disclose the attributes of <a href="/en/topic/omnipotence">omnipotence</a>, <a href="/en/topic/omniscience">omniscience</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/omnipresence">omnipresence</a>. No one of them can so function universally; as individuals and in the exercise of these powers of supremacy and ultimacy each is personally limited to the superuniverse of immediate supervision.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p2_5">16:2.5</a></small></sup>  All of everything which has been told you concerning the divinity and personality of the <a href="/en/topic/Conjoint_Actor">Conjoint Actor</a> applies equally and fully to the <a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirits,_Seven">Seven Master Spirits</a>, who so effectively distribute the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a> to the seven segments of the grand universe in accordance with their divine endowment and in the manner of their differing and individually unique natures. It would therefore be proper to apply to the collective group of seven any or all of the names of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite">Infinite</a> Spirit. Collectively they are one with the <a href="/en/topic/Conjoint_Creator">Conjoint Creator</a> on all subabsolute levels.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. IDENTITY AND DIVERSITY OF THE MASTER SPIRITS </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p3_1">16:3.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirits,_Seven">Seven Master Spirits</a> are indescribable beings, but they are distinctly and definitely personal. They have names, but we elect to introduce them by number. As primary personalizations of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>, they are akin, but as primary expressions of the seven possible associations of triune <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>, they are essentially diverse in nature, and this diversity of nature determines their differential of superuniverse conduct. These Seven <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> Spirits may be described as follows:</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p3_2">16:3.2</a></small></sup>  <i><a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirit_Number_One">Master Spirit Number One</a>.</i> In a special manner this Spirit is the direct representation of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Father. He is a peculiar and efficient manifestation of the power, love, and wisdom of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>. He is the close associate and supernal adviser of the <a href="/en/topic/chief_of_Mystery_Monitors">chief of Mystery Monitors</a>, that being who presides over the College of <a href="/en/topic/Personalized_Adjusters">Personalized Adjusters</a> on <a href="/en/topic/Divinington">Divinington</a>. In all associations of the Seven Master Spirits, it is always Master Spirit Number One who speaks for the Universal Father.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p3_3">16:3.3</a></small></sup>  This Spirit presides over <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> superuniverse and, while unfailingly exhibiting the divine nature of a primary personalization of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>, seems more especially to resemble the Universal Father in character. He is always in personal liaison with the seven <a href="/en/topic/Reflective_Spirits">Reflective Spirits</a> at the headquarters of the first superuniverse.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p3_4">16:3.4</a></small></sup>  <i><a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirit_Number_Two">Master Spirit Number Two</a>.</i> This Spirit adequately portrays the matchless nature and charming character of the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a>, the first-born of all creation. He is always in close association with all orders of the <a href="/en/topic/Sons_of_God">Sons of God</a> whenever they may happen to be in the residential universe as individuals or in joyous conclave. In all the assemblies of the <a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirits,_Seven">Seven Master Spirits</a> he always speaks for, and in behalf of, the Eternal Son.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p3_5">16:3.5</a></small></sup>  This Spirit directs the destinies of superuniverse number two and rules this vast domain much as would the Eternal Son. He is always in liaison with the seven <a href="/en/topic/Reflective_Spirits">Reflective Spirits</a> situated at the capital of the second superuniverse.</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p3_6">16:3.6</a></small></sup>  <i><a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirit_Number_Three">Master Spirit Number Three</a>.</i> This Spirit personality especially resembles the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>, and he directs the movements and work of many of the high personalities of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite">Infinite</a> Spirit. He presides over their assemblies and is closely associated with all personalities who take exclusive origin in the <a href="/en/topic/Third_Source_and_Center">Third Source and Center</a>. When the <a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirits,_Seven">Seven Master Spirits</a> are in council, it is <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> Spirit Number Three who always speaks for the Infinite Spirit.</p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p3_7">16:3.7</a></small></sup>  This Spirit is in charge of superuniverse number three, and he administers the affairs of this segment much as would the Infinite Spirit. He is always in liaison with the <a href="/en/topic/Reflective_Spirits">Reflective Spirits</a> at the headquarters of the third superuniverse.</p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p3_8">16:3.8</a></small></sup>  <i><a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirit_Number_Four">Master Spirit Number Four</a>.</i> Partaking of the combined natures of the Father and the Son, this <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> Spirit is the determining influence regarding Father-Son policies and procedures in the councils of the <a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirits,_Seven">Seven Master Spirits</a>. This Spirit is the chief director and adviser of those ascendant beings who have attained the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a> and thus have become candidates for seeing the Son and the Father. He fosters that enormous group of personalities taking origin in the Father and the Son. When it becomes necessary to represent the Father and the Son in the association of the Seven Master Spirits, it is always Master Spirit Number Four who speaks.</p>
<p id="p3_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p3_9">16:3.9</a></small></sup>  This Spirit fosters the fourth segment of the grand universe in accordance with his peculiar association of the attributes of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a>. He is always in personal liaison with the <a href="/en/topic/Reflective_Spirits">Reflective Spirits</a> of the headquarters of the fourth superuniverse.</p>
<p id="p3_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p3_10">16:3.10</a></small></sup>  <i><a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirit_Number_Five">Master Spirit Number Five</a>.</i> This divine personality who exquisitely blends the character of the Universal Father and the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a> is the adviser of that enormous group of beings known as the power directors, <a href="/en/topic/power_centers">power centers</a>, and physical controllers. This Spirit also fosters all personalities taking origin in the Father and the <a href="/en/topic/Conjoint_Actor">Conjoint Actor</a>. In the councils of the <a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirits,_Seven">Seven Master Spirits</a>, when the Father-Spirit attitude is in question, it is always <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> Spirit Number Five who speaks.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1"><a href="#fn_a1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p3_11">16:3.11</a></small></sup>  This Spirit directs the welfare of the fifth superuniverse in such a way as to suggest the combined action of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a> and the Infinite Spirit. He is always in liaison with the <a href="/en/topic/Reflective_Spirits">Reflective Spirits</a> at the headquarters of the fifth superuniverse.</p>
<p id="p3_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p3_12">16:3.12</a></small></sup>  <i><a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirit_Number_Six">Master Spirit Number Six</a>.</i> This divine being seems to portray the combined character of the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>. Whenever the creatures jointly created by the Son and the Spirit forgather in the central universe, it is this <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> Spirit who is their adviser; and whenever, in the councils of the <a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirits,_Seven">Seven Master Spirits</a>, it becomes necessary to speak conjointly for the Eternal Son and the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite">Infinite</a> Spirit, it is Master Spirit Number Six who responds.</p>
<p id="p3_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p3_13">16:3.13</a></small></sup>  This Spirit directs the affairs of the sixth superuniverse much as would the Eternal Son and the Infinite Spirit. He is always in liaison with the <a href="/en/topic/Reflective_Spirits">Reflective Spirits</a> at the headquarters of the sixth superuniverse.</p>
<p id="p3_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p3_14">16:3.14</a></small></sup>  <i><a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirit_Number_Seven">Master Spirit Number Seven</a>.</i> The presiding Spirit of the seventh superuniverse is a uniquely equal portrayal of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a>, and the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>. The Seventh Spirit, the fostering adviser of all <a href="/en/topic/triune-origin_beings">triune-origin beings</a>, is also the adviser and director of all the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_pilgrims">ascending pilgrims</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a>, those lowly beings who have attained the courts of glory through the combined ministry of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</p>
<p id="p3_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p3_15">16:3.15</a></small></sup>  The Seventh Master Spirit is not organically representative of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Trinity">Paradise Trinity</a>; but it is a known fact that his personal and spiritual nature <i>is</i> the <a href="/en/topic/Conjoint_Actor">Conjoint Actor</a>’s portraiture in equal proportions of the three infinite persons whose <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> union <i>is</i> the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> <a href="/en/topic/Trinity">Trinity</a>, and whose function as such <i>is</i> the source of the personal and spiritual nature of <a href="/en/topic/God_the_Supreme">God the Supreme</a>. Hence the Seventh Master Spirit discloses a personal and organic relationship to the spirit person of the evolving <a href="/en/topic/Supreme">Supreme</a>. Therefore in the Master Spirit councils on high, when it becomes necessary to cast the ballot for the combined personal attitude of the Father, Son, and Spirit or to depict the spiritual attitude of the Supreme Being, it is Master Spirit Number Seven who functions. He thus inherently becomes the presiding head of the Paradise council of the Seven Master Spirits.</p>
<p id="p3_16"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p3_16">16:3.16</a></small></sup>  No one of the Seven Spirits is organically representative of the Paradise Trinity, but when they unite as sevenfold Deity, this union in a deity sense—not in a personal sense—equivalates to a functional level associable with Trinity functions. In this sense the “<a href="/en/topic/Sevenfold">Sevenfold</a> Spirit” is functionally associable with the Paradise Trinity. It is also in this sense that <a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirit_Number_Seven">Master Spirit Number Seven</a> sometimes speaks in confirmation of Trinity attitudes or, rather, acts as spokesman for the attitude of the Sevenfold-Spirit-union regarding the attitude of the Threefold-Deity-union, the attitude of the Paradise Trinity.</p>
<p id="p3_17"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p3_17">16:3.17</a></small></sup>  The multiple functions of the Seventh Master Spirit thus range from a combined portraiture of the <i>personal natures</i> of the Father, Son, and Spirit, through a representation of the <i>personal attitude</i> of <a href="/en/topic/God_the_Supreme">God the Supreme</a>, to a disclosure of the <i>deity attitude</i> of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Trinity">Paradise Trinity</a>. And in certain respects this presiding Spirit is similarly expressive of the <i>attitudes</i> of the <a href="/en/topic/Ultimate">Ultimate</a> and of the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme-Ultimate">Supreme-Ultimate</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_18"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p3_18">16:3.18</a></small></sup>  It is <a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirit_Number_Seven">Master Spirit Number Seven</a> who, in his multiple capacities, personally sponsors the progress of the ascension candidates from the worlds of time in their attempts to achieve comprehension of the undivided <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Supremacy">Supremacy</a>. Such comprehension involves a grasp of the existential sovereignty of the <a href="/en/topic/Trinity_of_Supremacy">Trinity of Supremacy</a> so co-ordinated with a concept of the growing experiential sovereignty of the Supreme Being as to constitute the creature grasp of the unity of Supremacy. Creature realization of these three factors equals <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> comprehension of Trinity reality and endows the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_pilgrims">pilgrims of time</a> with the ability eventually to penetrate the Trinity, to discover the three infinite persons of Deity.</p>
<p id="p3_19"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p3_19">16:3.19</a></small></sup>  The inability of the <a href="/en/topic/Havona_pilgrims">Havona pilgrims</a> fully to find <a href="/en/topic/God_the_Supreme">God the Supreme</a> is compensated by the Seventh Master Spirit, whose triune nature in such a peculiar manner is revelatory of the spirit person of the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme">Supreme</a>. During the present universe age of the noncontactability of the person of the Supreme, Master Spirit Number Seven functions in the place of the <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> of ascendant creatures in the matter of personal relationships.

It is difficult for the mortal mind to understand very much about the Master Spirits because their work is so highly specialized yet all-embracing, so exceptionally material and at the same time so exquisitely spiritual.
