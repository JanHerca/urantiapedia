<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/186#p1_1">186:1.1</a></small></sup>  It was about half past eight o’clock this <a href="/en/topic/Fridays">Friday</a> morning when the hearing of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> before <a href="/en/topic/Pontius_Pilate">Pilate</a> was ended and the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> was placed in the custody of the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_soldiers_in_Jerusalem">Roman soldiers</a> who were to crucify him<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. As soon as the <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a> took possession of Jesus, the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_centurion_of_Jerusalem">captain</a> of the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple_guards">Jewish guards</a> marched with his men back to their <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a> headquarters. The chief priest and his Sanhedrist associates followed close behind the guards, going directly to their usual meeting place in the hall of hewn stone in the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>. Here they found many other members of the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> waiting to learn what had been done with Jesus. As <a href="/en/topic/Caiaphas">Caiaphas</a> was engaged in making his report to the Sanhedrin regarding the trial and condemnation of Jesus, <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas</a> appeared before them to claim his reward for the part he had played in his Master’s arrest and sentence of death.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/186#p1_2">186:1.2</a></small></sup>  All of these <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> loathed Judas; they looked upon the betrayer with only feelings of utter contempt. Throughout the trial of Jesus before Caiaphas and during his appearance before Pilate, Judas was pricked in his conscience about his traitorous conduct<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>. And he was also beginning to become somewhat disillusioned regarding the reward he was to receive as payment for his services as Jesus’ betrayer. He did not like the coolness and aloofness of the Jewish authorities; nevertheless, he expected to be liberally rewarded for his cowardly conduct. He anticipated being called before the full meeting of the Sanhedrin and there hearing himself eulogized while they conferred upon him suitable honors in token of the great service which he flattered himself he had rendered his nation. Imagine, therefore, the great surprise of this egotistic traitor when a servant of the high priest, tapping him on the shoulder, called him just outside the hall and said: “Judas, I have been appointed to pay you for the betrayal of Jesus. Here is your reward.” And thus speaking, the servant of Caiaphas handed Judas a bag containing thirty pieces of silver—the current price of a good, healthy slave<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>

He rushed back to enter the hall but was debarred by the doorkeeper. He wanted to appeal to the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a>, but they would not admit him. Judas could not believe that these rulers of the Jews would allow him to betray his friends and his <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and then offer him as a reward thirty pieces of silver. He was humiliated, disillusioned, and utterly crushed. He walked away from the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>, as it were, in a trance. He automatically dropped the <a href="/en/topic/money">money</a> bag in his deep pocket, that same pocket wherein he had so long carried the bag containing the apostolic funds. And he wandered out through the city after the crowds who were on their way to witness the crucifixions.</p>

The betrayer was well-nigh breathless and highly distraught, but he managed to stammer out these words: “I have sinned in that I have betrayed innocent blood. You have insulted me.

The events already narrated and leading up to this hour of the Master’s impending crucifixion are sufficient to indicate that his death at about this time was a purely natural and man-managed affair.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_1_14"><a href="#fn_a5_1_14">[15]</a></sup></p>
