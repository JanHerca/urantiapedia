From the early times of primitive man, such an inhabited world has passed through the successive planetary ages—the pre- and the post-Planetary Prince ages, the post-Adamic age, the post-Magisterial Son age, and the postbestowal Son age. And then is such a world made ready for the culminating evolutionary attainment, the settled status of light and life, by the ministry of the successive planetary missions of the <a href="/en/topic/Trinity_Teacher_Sons">Trinity Teacher Sons</a> with their ever-advancing revelations of divine truth and cosmic wisdom.

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p1_1">55:1.1</a></small></sup>  The presence of a <a href="/en/topic/morontia_temple">morontia temple</a> at the capital of an inhabited world is the certificate of the admission of such a sphere to the settled ages of <a href="/en/topic/light_and_life">light and life</a>. Before the <a href="/en/topic/Teacher_Sons">Teacher Sons</a> leave a world at the conclusion of their terminal mission, they inaugurate this final epoch of evolutionary attainment; they preside on that day when the “holy <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> comes down upon earth.” This event, signalizing the dawn of the era of light and life, is always honored by the personal presence of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> bestowal Son of that planet, who comes to witness this great day. There in this temple of unparalleled beauty, this bestowal Son of Paradise proclaims the long-time Planetary Prince as the new Planetary Sovereign and invests such a faithful Lanonandek Son with new powers and extended authority over planetary affairs. The System Sovereign is also present and speaks in confirmation of these pronouncements.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_1_4"><a href="#fn_s1_1_4">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_1_7"><a href="#fn_s1_1_7">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_1_5"><a href="#fn_s1_1_5">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_1_8"><a href="#fn_s1_1_8">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p1_2">55:1.2</a></small></sup>  A morontia temple has three parts: Centermost is the sanctuary of the Paradise bestowal Son. On the right is the seat of the former Planetary Prince, now Planetary Sovereign; and when present in the temple, this Lanonandek Son is visible to the more spiritual individuals of the realm. On the left is the seat of the acting chief of <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliters</a> attached to the planet.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_2_8"><a href="#fn_s1_2_8">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p1_3">55:1.3</a></small></sup>  Although the planetary temples have been spoken of as “coming down from heaven,” in reality no actual material is transported from the system headquarters. The architecture of each is worked out in miniature on the system capital, and the <a href="/en/topic/Morontia_Power_Supervisors">Morontia Power Supervisors</a> subsequently bring these approved plans to the planet. Here, in association with the <a href="/en/topic/Master_Physical_Controllers">Master Physical Controllers</a>, they proceed to build the <a href="/en/topic/morontia_temple">morontia temple</a> according to specifications.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_3_5"><a href="#fn_s1_3_5">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p1_4">55:1.4</a></small></sup>  The average morontia temple seats about three hundred thousand spectators. These edifices are not used for worship, play, or for receiving <a href="/en/topic/broadcasts_(celestial)">broadcasts</a>; they are devoted to the special ceremonies of the planet, such as: communications with the System Sovereign or with the <a href="/en/topic/Most_Highs">Most Highs</a>, special visualization ceremonies designed to reveal the personality presence of spirit beings, and silent cosmic contemplation. The schools of cosmic philosophy here conduct their graduation exercises, and here also do the <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of the realm receive planetary recognition for achievements of high social service and for other outstanding attainments.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_4_5"><a href="#fn_s1_4_5">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p1_5">55:1.5</a></small></sup>  Such a <a href="/en/topic/morontia_temple">morontia temple</a> also serves as the place of assembly for witnessing the <a href="/en/topic/translation">translation</a> of living mortals to the morontia existence. It is because the translation <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> is composed of morontia material that it is not destroyed by the blazing glory of the consuming fire which so completely obliterates the physical bodies of those mortals who therein experience final fusion with their divine Adjusters. On a large world these departure flares are almost continuous, and as the number of translations increases, subsidiary morontia life shrines are provided in different areas of the planet. Not long since I sojourned on a world in the far north whereon twenty-five morontia shrines were functioning.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_5_4"><a href="#fn_s1_5_4">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_5_7"><a href="#fn_s1_5_7">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_5_5"><a href="#fn_s1_5_5">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p1_6">55:1.6</a></small></sup>  On presettled worlds, planets without morontia temples, these fusion flashes many times occur in the planetary atmosphere, where the material body of a translation candidate is elevated by the midway creatures and the physical controllers.</p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p2_1">55:2.1</a></small></sup>  Natural, physical <a href="/en/topic/death">death</a> is not a mortal inevitability.

At first only a few <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> in each age attain translation levels of spiritual progress, but with the onset of the successive ages of the <a href="/en/topic/Teacher_Sons">Teacher Sons</a>, more and more Adjuster fusions occur before the termination of the lengthening lives of these progressing mortals; and by the time of the terminal mission of the <a href="/en/topic/Trinity_Teacher_Sons">Teacher Sons</a>, approximately one quarter of these superb mortals are exempt from natural death.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_2_7"><a href="#fn_s2_2_7">[2]</a></sup></p>

A circle of intervening celestial personalities is arranged to protect the material <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> from the action of the energies manifest at the instant of the “<a href="/en/topic/life_flash">life flash</a>” which delivers the ascension candidate from the bonds of material flesh, thereby doing for such an evolutionary mortal everything that natural <a href="/en/topic/death">death</a> does for those who are thereby delivered from the flesh.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_4_7"><a href="#fn_s2_4_7">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_4_8"><a href="#fn_s2_4_8">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p2_5">55:2.5</a></small></sup>  Many fusion candidates may be assembled in the spacious <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> at the same time. And what a beautiful occasion when mortals thus forgather to witness the ascension of their loved ones in spiritual flames, and what a contrast to those earlier ages when mortals must commit their dead to the embrace of the terrestrial elements! The scenes of weeping and wailing characteristic of earlier epochs of human evolution are now replaced by ecstatic joy and the sublimest enthusiasm as these God-knowing mortals bid their loved ones a transient farewell as they are removed from their material associations by the spiritual fires of consuming grandeur and ascending glory. On worlds settled in <a href="/en/topic/light_and_life">light and life</a>, “<a href="/en/topic/funerals">funerals</a>” are occasions of supreme joy, profound satisfaction, and inexpressible hope.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p2_6">55:2.6</a></small></sup>  The souls of these progressing <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> are increasingly filled with faith, hope, and assurance. The spirit permeating those gathered around the <a href="/en/topic/translation">translation</a> shrine resembles that of the joyful friends and relatives who might assemble at a graduating exercise for one of their group, or who might come together to witness the conferring of some great honor upon one of their number. And it would be decidedly helpful if less advanced mortals could only learn to view natural <a href="/en/topic/death">death</a> with something of this same cheerfulness and lightheartedness.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p2_7">55:2.7</a></small></sup>  Mortal observers can see nothing of their translated associates subsequent to the fusion flash. Such translated souls proceed by Adjuster transit direct to the resurrection hall of the appropriate morontia-training world. These transactions concerned with the translation of living human beings to the morontia world are supervised by an archangel who was assigned to such a world on the day when it was first settled in <a href="/en/topic/light_and_life">light and life</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_7_7"><a href="#fn_s2_7_7">[2]</a></sup></p>

Such diminishment of <a href="/en/topic/death">death</a> continues on and on, but I know of no system whose inhabited worlds, even though long settled in life, are entirely free from natural death as the technique of escape from the bonds of flesh. And until such a high state of planetary evolution is uniformly attained, the morontia-training worlds of the local universe must continue in service as educational and cultural spheres for the evolving <a href="/en/topic/morontia_progressors">morontia progressors</a>. The elimination of death is theoretically possible, but it has not yet occurred according to my observation. Perhaps such a status may be attained during the faraway stretches of the succeeding epochs of the seventh stage of settled planetary life.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_8_14"><a href="#fn_s2_8_14">[13]</a></sup></p>

They do not pass through any of the earlier phases of morontia life. They are the only <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortals</a> who so nearly escape the morontia transition from material existence to semispirit status. The initial experience of such <i>Son-seized</i> mortals in the ascension career is in the services of the progression worlds of the universe headquarters. And from these study worlds of <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> they go back as teachers to the very worlds they passed by, subsequently going on inward to <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> by the established route of mortal ascension.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_9_7"><a href="#fn_s2_9_7">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_9_6"><a href="#fn_s2_9_6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_9_9"><a href="#fn_s2_9_9">[14]</a></sup></p>

Such an evolutionary progression pertains primarily to the local universe as a unit and concerns only the components of a local universe.
