<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p0_1">126:0.1</a></small></sup>  OF ALL <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ earth-life experiences, the fourteenth and fifteenth years were the most crucial. These two years, after he began to be self-conscious of divinity and destiny, and before he achieved a large measure of communication with his indwelling Adjuster, were the most trying of his eventful life on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. It is this period of two years which should be called the great test, the real temptation. No human youth, in passing through the early confusions and adjustment problems of adolescence, ever experienced a more crucial testing than that which Jesus passed through during his transition from childhood to young manhood.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_1_2"><a href="#fn_a0_1_2">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p0_2">126:0.2</a></small></sup>  This important period in Jesus’ youthful development began with the conclusion of the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> visit and with his return to <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>. At first <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> was happy in the thought that she had her boy back once more, that Jesus had returned home to be a dutiful son—not that he was ever anything else—and that he would henceforth be more responsive to her plans for his future life. But she was not for long to bask in this sunshine of maternal delusion and unrecognized family pride; very soon she was to be more completely disillusioned. More and more the boy was in the company of his father; less and less did he come to her with his problems, while increasingly both his parents failed to comprehend his frequent alternation between the affairs of this world and the contemplation of his relation to his <a href="/en/topic/Father’s_business">Father’s business</a>. Frankly, they did not understand him, but they did truly love him.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_2_0"><a href="#fn_a0_2_0">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_2_7"><a href="#fn_a0_2_7">[3]</a></sup></p>

Jesus had great respect for the sincere <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> and the honest scribes, but he held the hypocritical Pharisees and the dishonest theologians in great contempt; he looked with disdain upon all those religious leaders who were not sincere. When he scrutinized the leadership of <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a>, he was sometimes tempted to look with favor on the possibility of his becoming the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a> of Jewish expectation, but he never yielded to such a temptation.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_3_1"><a href="#fn_a0_3_1">[4]</a></sup></p>

For a time his praise was on everybody’s lips. All the village recounted his childhood wisdom and praiseworthy conduct and predicted that he was destined to become a great leader in Israel; at last a really great teacher was to come out of Nazareth in <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>. And they all looked forward to the time when he would be fifteen years of age so that he might be permitted regularly to read the Scriptures in the synagogue on the <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> day.</p>

From the summit of this hill of <a href="/en/topic/Simeon_(reputed_holy_man)">Simeon</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> looked out over Nazareth and the surrounding country.

He then would shift his gaze over to <a href="/en/topic/Ebal">Ebal</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Gerizim">Gerizim</a> and recount to himself the traditions of <a href="/en/topic/Abraham_(Old_Testament)">Abraham</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Jacob_of_Crete">Jacob</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Abimelech">Abimelech</a>.

<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p1_3">126:1.3</a></small></sup>  He continued to carry on his advanced courses of reading under the synagogue teachers, and he also continued with the home education of his brothers and sisters as they grew up to suitable ages.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p1_4">126:1.4</a></small></sup>  Early this year <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> arranged to set aside the income from his <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> property to pay for <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ long course of study at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, it having been planned that he should go to Jerusalem in August of the following year when he would be fifteen years of age.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p1_5">126:1.5</a></small></sup>  By the beginning of this year both Joseph and <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> entertained frequent doubts about the destiny of their first-born son. He was indeed a brilliant and lovable child, but he was so difficult to understand, so hard to fathom, and again, nothing extraordinary or miraculous ever happened. Scores of times had his proud mother stood in breathless anticipation, expecting to see her son engage in some superhuman or miraculous performance, but always were her hopes dashed down in cruel disappointment. And all this was discouraging, even disheartening. The devout people of those days truly believed that prophets and men of promise always demonstrated their calling and established their divine authority by performing <a href="/en/topic/miracles">miracles</a> and working wonders. But Jesus did none of these things; wherefore was the confusion of his parents steadily increased as they contemplated his future.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_5_2"><a href="#fn_s1_5_2">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p1_6">126:1.6</a></small></sup>  The improved economic condition of the <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> family was reflected in many ways about the home and especially in the increased number of smooth white boards which were used as <a href="/en/topic/writing">writing</a> slates, the writing being done with charcoal. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was also permitted to resume his <a href="/en/topic/music">music</a> lessons; he was very fond of playing the <a href="/en/topic/harp">harp</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p1_7">126:1.7</a></small></sup>  Throughout this year it can truly be said that Jesus “grew in favor with man and with <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>.” The prospects of the family seemed good; the future was bright.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. THE DEATH OF JOSEPH </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p2_1">126:2.1</a></small></sup>  All did go well until that fateful day of Tuesday, September 25, when a runner from <a href="/en/topic/Sepphoris">Sepphoris</a> brought to this <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> home the tragic news that <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> had been severely injured by the falling of a derrick while at work on the governor’s residence. The messenger from Sepphoris had stopped at the shop on the way to <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_(Old_Testament)">Joseph</a>’s home, informing <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> of his father’s accident, and they went together to the house to break the sad news to <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a>. Jesus desired to go immediately to his father, but <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Clopas)">Mary</a> would hear to nothing but that she must hasten to her husband’s side. She directed that <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>, then ten years of age, should accompany her to Sepphoris while Jesus remained home with the younger children until she should return, as she did not know how seriously <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_(father_of_Jesus)">Joseph</a> had been injured. But <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_(brother_of_Jesus)">Joseph</a> died of his injuries before <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)">Mary</a> arrived. They brought him to Nazareth, and on the following day he was laid to rest with his fathers.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p2_2">126:2.2</a></small></sup>  Just at the time when prospects were good and the future looked bright, an apparently cruel hand struck down the head of this Nazareth household, the affairs of this home were disrupted, and every plan for Jesus and his future education was demolished. This carpenter lad, now just past fourteen years of age, awakened to the realization that he had not only to fulfill the commission of his heavenly Father to reveal the divine nature on earth and in the flesh, but that his young human nature must also shoulder the responsibility of caring for his widowed mother and seven brothers and sisters—and another yet to be born. This lad of Nazareth now became the sole support and comfort of this so suddenly bereaved family. Thus were permitted those occurrences of the natural order of events on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> which would force this young man of destiny so early to assume these heavy but highly educational and disciplinary responsibilities attendant upon becoming the head of a human family, of becoming father to his own brothers and sisters, of supporting and protecting his mother, of functioning as guardian of his father’s home, the only home he was to know while on this world.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_2_0"><a href="#fn_a2_2_0">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p2_3">126:2.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> cheerfully accepted the responsibilities so suddenly thrust upon him, and he carried them faithfully to the end. At least one great problem and anticipated difficulty in his life had been tragically solved—he would not now be expected to go to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> to study under the rabbis. It remained always true that Jesus “sat at no man’s feet.” He was ever willing to learn from even the humblest of little children, but he never derived authority to teach truth from human sources<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_3_0"><a href="#fn_a2_3_0">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p2_4">126:2.4</a></small></sup>  Still he knew nothing of the <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a> visit to his mother before his birth; he only learned of this from John on the day of his baptism, at the beginning of his public ministry.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p2_5">126:2.5</a></small></sup>  As the years passed, this young carpenter of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> increasingly measured every institution of society and every usage of religion by the unvarying test: What does it do for the human soul? does it bring <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> to man? does it bring man to God? While this youth did not wholly neglect the recreational and social aspects of life, more and more he devoted his time and energies to just two purposes: the care of his family and the preparation to do his Father’s heavenly will on earth.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p2_6">126:2.6</a></small></sup>  This year it became the custom for the neighbors to drop in during the winter evenings to hear <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> play upon the harp, to listen to his stories (for the lad was a master storyteller), and to hear him read from the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> scriptures.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p2_7">126:2.7</a></small></sup>  The economic affairs of the family continued to run fairly smoothly as there was quite a sum of money on hand at the time of <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>’s death. Jesus early demonstrated the possession of keen business judgment and financial sagacity. He was liberal but frugal; he was saving but generous. He proved to be a wise and efficient administrator of his father’s estate.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_7_6"><a href="#fn_a2_7_6">[6]</a></sup></p>

Joseph was gone. Joseph was an unusual husband and father, and they all missed him. And it seemed all the more tragic to think that he died ere they could speak to him or hear his farewell blessing.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_8_0"><a href="#fn_a2_8_0">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p3_1">126:3.1</a></small></sup>  By the middle of this fifteenth year—and we are reckoning <a href="/en/topic/time">time</a> in accordance with the <a href="/en/topic/Gregorian_calendar">twentieth-century calendar</a>, not by the Jewish year—<a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had taken a firm grasp upon the management of his family. Before this year had passed, their savings had about disappeared, and they were face to face with the necessity of disposing of one of the <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> houses which <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> and his neighbor <a href="/en/topic/Jacob_of_Crete">Jacob</a> owned in partnership.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p3_2">126:3.2</a></small></sup>  On <a href="/en/topic/Wednesday">Wednesday</a> evening, April 17, A<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>.D. 9, <a href="/en/topic/Ruth_(Old_Testament)">Ruth</a>, the baby of the family, was born, and to the best of his ability Jesus endeavored to take the place of his father in comforting and ministering to his mother during this trying and peculiarly sad ordeal. For almost a score of years (until he began his public ministry) no father could have loved and nurtured his daughter any more affectionately and faithfully than Jesus cared for little <a href="/en/topic/Ruth_(sister_of_Jesus)">Ruth</a>. And he was an equally good father to all the other members of his family.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_2_3"><a href="#fn_a3_2_3">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p3_3">126:3.3</a></small></sup>  During this year <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> first formulated the <a href="/en/topic/prayer">prayer</a> which he subsequently taught to his apostles, and which to many has become known as “The <a href="/en/topic/Lord’s_Prayer">Lord’s Prayer</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>.” In a way it was an evolution of the family altar; they had many forms of praise and several formal prayers. After his father’s death Jesus tried to teach the older children to express themselves individually in prayer—much as he so enjoyed doing—but they could not grasp his thought and would invariably fall back upon their memorized prayer forms. It was in this effort to stimulate his older brothers and sisters to say individual prayers that Jesus would endeavor to lead them along by suggestive phrases, and presently, without intention on his part, it developed that they were all using a form of prayer which was largely built up from these suggestive lines which Jesus had taught them.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_3_2"><a href="#fn_s3_3_2">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p3_4">126:3.4</a></small></sup>  At last Jesus gave up the idea of having each member of the family formulate spontaneous prayers, and one evening in October he sat down by the little squat lamp on the low stone table, and, on a piece of smooth cedar board about eighteen inches square, with a piece of charcoal he wrote out the prayer which became from that time on the standard family petition.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p3_5">126:3.5</a></small></sup>  This year <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was much troubled with confused thinking. Family responsibility had quite effectively removed all thought of immediately carrying out any plan for responding to the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> visitation directing him to “be about his <a href="/en/topic/Father’s_business">Father’s business</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b9"><a href="#fn_b9">[9]</a></sup>.” Jesus rightly reasoned that the watchcare of his earthly father’s <a href="/en/topic/family">family</a> must take precedence of all duties; that the support of his family must become his first obligation.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_5_3"><a href="#fn_a3_5_3">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_5_4"><a href="#fn_a3_5_4">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p3_6">126:3.6</a></small></sup>  In the course of this year Jesus found a passage in the so-called <a href="/en/topic/apocrypha">Book of Enoch</a> which influenced him in the later adoption of the term “<a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>” as a designation for his bestowal mission on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup>. He had thoroughly considered the idea of the Jewish <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a> and was firmly convinced that he was not to be that Messiah. He longed to help his father’s people, but he never expected to lead Jewish armies in overthrowing the foreign domination of <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a>. He knew he would never sit on the throne of <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a> at Jerusalem. Neither did he believe that his mission was that of a spiritual <a href="/en/topic/Deliverer">deliverer</a> or moral teacher solely to the Jewish people. In no sense, therefore, could his life mission be the fulfillment of the intense longings and supposed Messianic prophecies of the Hebrew scriptures; at least, not as the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> understood these predictions of the prophets. Likewise he was certain he was never to appear as the Son of Man depicted by the Prophet <a href="/en/topic/Daniel">Daniel</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b11"><a href="#fn_b11">[11]</a></sup>.</p>

What claim should he make concerning his mission? By what name would he be called by the people who would become believers in his teachings?</p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p3_8">126:3.8</a></small></sup>  While turning all these problems over in his mind, he found in the synagogue library at <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, among the apocalyptic books which he had been studying, this manuscript called “The <a href="/en/topic/apocrypha">Book of Enoch</a>”; and though he was certain that it had not been written by <a href="/en/topic/Enoch">Enoch</a> of old, it proved very intriguing to him, and he read and reread it many times. There was one passage which particularly impressed him, a passage in which this term “<a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>” appeared. The writer of this so-called Book of Enoch went on to tell about this Son of Man, describing the work he would do on earth and explaining that this Son of Man, before coming down on this earth to bring salvation to mankind, had walked through the courts of heavenly glory with his Father, the Father of all; and that he had turned his back upon all this grandeur and glory to come down on earth to proclaim salvation to needy <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a>. As <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> would read these passages (well understanding that much of the Eastern mysticism which had become admixed with these teachings was erroneous), he responded in his heart and recognized in his mind that of all the Messianic predictions of the Hebrew scriptures and of all the theories about the Jewish <a href="/en/topic/Deliverer">deliverer</a>, none was so near the <a href="/en/topic/truth">truth</a> as this <a href="/en/topic/Genesis,_Book_of">story</a> tucked away in this only partially accredited Book of Enoch; and he then and there decided to adopt as his inaugural title “the Son of Man.” And this he did when he subsequently began his public work. Jesus had an unerring ability for the recognition of truth, and truth he never hesitated to embrace, no matter from what source it appeared to emanate.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_8_8"><a href="#fn_a3_8_8">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p3_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p3_10">126:3.10</a></small></sup>  The great confusion of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ younger days now arose. Having settled something about the nature of his mission on earth, “to be about his <a href="/en/topic/Father’s_business">Father’s business</a>”—to show forth his Father’s loving nature to all mankind—he began to ponder anew the many statements in the Scriptures referring to the coming of a national <a href="/en/topic/Deliverer">deliverer</a>, a Jewish teacher or king<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b12"><a href="#fn_b12">[12]</a></sup>. To what event did these prophecies refer? Was not he a Jew? or was he? Was he or was he not of the house of <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a>? His mother averred he was; his father had ruled that he was not. He decided he was not. But had the prophets confused the nature and mission of the Messiah?</p>
<p id="p3_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p3_11">126:3.11</a></small></sup>  After all, could it be possible that his mother was right? In most matters, when differences of opinion had arisen in the past, she had been right. If he were a new teacher and <i>not</i> the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a>, then how should he recognize the Jewish Messiah if such a one should appear in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> during the time of his earth mission; and, further, what should be his relation to this Jewish Messiah? And what should be his relation, after embarking on his life mission, to his family? to the Jewish commonwealth and religion? to the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_Empire">Roman Empire</a>? to the gentiles and their religions?

From this year on, Jesus’ disclosures about what was going on in his mind steadily diminished; that is, he talked less about those things which an average person could not grasp, and which would lead to his being regarded as peculiar or different from ordinary folks. To all appearances he became commonplace and conventional, though he did long for someone who could understand his problems. He craved a trustworthy and confidential friend, but his problems were too complex for his human associates to comprehend.

Each of the older children had an individual garden, and they entered into keen competition in their agricultural efforts. Their eldest brother spent some time with them in the garden each day during the season of vegetable cultivation. As Jesus worked with his younger brothers and sisters in the garden, he many times entertained the wish that they were all located on a <a href="/en/topic/farm">farm</a> out in the country where they could enjoy the liberty and freedom of an unhampered life. But they did not find themselves growing up in the country; and Jesus, being a thoroughly practical youth as well as an idealist, intelligently and vigorously attacked his problem just as he found it, and did everything within his power to adjust himself and his family to the realities of their situation and to adapt their condition to the highest possible satisfaction of their individual and collective longings.</p>

But when Herod refused to pay them any of the funds due <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>, they gave up the ambition of owning a home in the country.
