These two years, after he began to be self-conscious of divinity and destiny, and before he achieved a large measure of communication with his indwelling <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Adjuster</a>, were the most trying of his eventful life on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. It is this period of two years which should be called the great test, the real temptation. No human youth, in passing through the early confusions and adjustment problems of adolescence, ever experienced a more crucial testing than that which Jesus passed through during his transition from childhood to young manhood.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_1_6"><a href="#fn_a0_1_6">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_1_10"><a href="#fn_a0_1_10">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_1_51"><a href="#fn_a0_1_51">[3]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_1_1"><a href="#fn_s0_1_1">[1]</a></sup></p>

But she was not for long to bask in this sunshine of maternal delusion and unrecognized family pride; very soon she was to be more completely disillusioned. More and more the boy was in the company of his father; less and less did he come to her with his problems, while increasingly both his parents failed to comprehend his frequent alternation between the affairs of this world and the contemplation of his relation to his <a href="/en/topic/Father‚Äôs_business">Father‚Äôs business</a>.

Jesus had great respect for the sincere <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> and the honest scribes, but he held the hypocritical Pharisees and the dishonest theologians in great contempt; he looked with disdain upon all those religious leaders who were not sincere. When he scrutinized the leadership of <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a>, he was sometimes tempted to look with favor on the possibility of his becoming the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a> of Jewish expectation, but he never yielded to such a temptation.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_3_4"><a href="#fn_a0_3_4">[7]</a></sup></p>

For a time his praise was on everybody‚Äôs lips. All the village recounted his childhood wisdom and praiseworthy conduct and predicted that he was destined to become a great leader in Israel; at last a really great teacher was to come out of Nazareth in <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>.

He was indeed a brilliant and lovable child, but he was so difficult to understand, so hard to fathom, and again, nothing extraordinary or miraculous ever happened. Scores of times had his proud mother stood in breathless anticipation, expecting to see her son engage in some superhuman or miraculous performance, but always were her hopes dashed down in cruel disappointment. And all this was discouraging, even disheartening. The devout people of those days truly believed that prophets and men of promise always demonstrated their calling and established their divine authority by performing <a href="/en/topic/miracles">miracles</a> and working wonders.

This carpenter lad, now just past fourteen years of age, awakened to the realization that he had not only to fulfill the commission of his heavenly Father to reveal the divine nature on earth and in the flesh, but that his young human nature must also shoulder the responsibility of caring for his widowed mother and seven brothers and sisters‚Äîand another yet to be born. This lad of Nazareth now became the sole support and comfort of this so suddenly bereaved family. Thus were permitted those occurrences of the natural order of events on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> which would force this young man of destiny so early to assume these heavy but highly educational and disciplinary responsibilities attendant upon becoming the head of a human family, of becoming father to his own brothers and sisters, of supporting and protecting his mother, of functioning as guardian of his father‚Äôs home, the only home he was to know while on this world.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_2_3"><a href="#fn_a2_2_3">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_2_9"><a href="#fn_a2_2_9">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_2_29"><a href="#fn_a2_2_29">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_2_47"><a href="#fn_a2_2_47">[18]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p5_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p5_5">126:5.5</a></small></sup>  The pay of a common day-laboring carpenter was slowly diminishing. By the end of this year <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> could earn, by working early and late, only the equivalent of about twenty-five cents a day. By the next year they found it difficult to <a href="/en/topic/tax_collectors">pay the civil taxes</a>, not to mention the synagogue assessments and the <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a> tax of one-half <a href="/en/topic/shekels">shekel</a>. During this year the tax collector tried to squeeze extra revenue out of Jesus, even threatening to take his harp.</p>
<p id="p5_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p5_6">126:5.6</a></small></sup>  Fearing that the copy of the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> scriptures might be discovered and confiscated by the tax collectors, Jesus, on his fifteenth birthday, presented it to the <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> synagogue library as his maturity offering to the Lord.</p>
<p id="p5_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p5_7">126:5.7</a></small></sup>  The great shock of his fifteenth year came when <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> went over to <a href="/en/topic/Sepphoris">Sepphoris</a> to receive the decision of <a href="/en/topic/Herod_the_Great">Herod</a> regarding the appeal taken to him in the dispute about the amount of money due <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> at the time of his accidental death. Jesus and <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> had hoped for the receipt of a considerable sum of money when the treasurer at Sepphoris had offered them a paltry amount. <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_(Old_Testament)">Joseph</a>‚Äôs brothers had taken an appeal to Herod himself, and now Jesus stood in the palace and heard Herod decree that his father had nothing due him at the time of his death. And for such an unjust decision Jesus never again trusted <a href="/en/topic/Herod_Antipas">Herod Antipas</a>. It is not surprising that he once alluded to Herod as ‚Äúthat fox<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b20"><a href="#fn_b20">[20]</a></sup>.‚Äù<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s5_7_3"><a href="#fn_s5_7_3">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p5_8">126:5.8</a></small></sup>  The close work at the carpenter‚Äôs bench during this and subsequent years deprived Jesus of the opportunity of mingling with the <a href="/en/topic/caravans">caravan</a> passengers. The family supply shop had already been taken over by his uncle, and Jesus worked altogether in the home shop, where he was near to help Mary with the family. About this time he began sending <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James</a> up to the camel lot to gather information about world events, and thus he sought to keep in touch with the news of the day.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_8_22"><a href="#fn_a5_8_22">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p5_9">126:5.9</a></small></sup>  As he grew up to manhood, he passed through all those conflicts and confusions which the average young persons of previous and subsequent ages have undergone. And the rigorous experience of supporting his family was a sure safeguard against his having overmuch time for idle meditation or the indulgence of mystic tendencies.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_9_3"><a href="#fn_a5_9_3">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_9_7"><a href="#fn_a5_9_7">[30]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_9_18"><a href="#fn_a5_9_18">[40]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_9_1"><a href="#fn_a5_9_1">[53]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s5_9_1"><a href="#fn_s5_9_1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s5_9_3"><a href="#fn_s5_9_3">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p5_10">126:5.10</a></small></sup>  This was the year that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> rented a considerable piece of land just to the north of their home, which was divided up as a family <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a> plot. Each of the older children had an individual garden, and they entered into keen competition in their agricultural efforts. Their eldest brother spent some time with them in the garden each day during the season of vegetable cultivation. As Jesus worked with his younger brothers and sisters in the garden, he many times entertained the wish that they were all located on a <a href="/en/topic/farm">farm</a> out in the country where they could enjoy the liberty and freedom of an unhampered life. But they did not find themselves growing up in the country; and Jesus, being a thoroughly practical youth as well as an idealist, intelligently and vigorously attacked his problem just as he found it, and did everything within his power to adjust himself and his family to the realities of their situation and to adapt their condition to the highest possible satisfaction of their individual and collective longings.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_10_24"><a href="#fn_a5_10_24">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_10_12"><a href="#fn_a5_10_12">[48]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_10_15"><a href="#fn_a5_10_15">[54]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p5_11">126:5.11</a></small></sup>  At one time Jesus faintly hoped that he might be able to gather up sufficient means, provided they could collect the considerable sum of money due his father for work on <a href="/en/topic/Herod_Antipas">Herod</a>‚Äôs palace, to warrant undertaking the purchase of a small farm. He had really given serious thought to this plan of moving his family out into the country. But when <a href="/en/topic/Herod_the_Great">Herod</a> refused to pay them any of the funds due <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>, they gave up the ambition of owning a home in the country. As it was, they contrived to enjoy much of the experience of farm life as they now had three <a href="/en/topic/cattle">cows</a>, four sheep, a flock of chickens, a donkey, and a dog, in addition to the doves. Even the little tots had their regular duties to perform in the well-regulated scheme of management which characterized the home life of this <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> family.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_11_23"><a href="#fn_a5_11_23">[29]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_11_2"><a href="#fn_a5_11_2">[55]</a></sup></p>
