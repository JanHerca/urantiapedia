<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p0_1">77:0.1</a></small></sup>  MOST of the inhabited worlds of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> harbor one or more groups of unique beings existing on a life-functioning level about midway between those of the <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of the realms and of the angelic orders; hence are they called <i>midway</i> creatures. They appear to be an accident of time, but they occur so widespreadly and are so valuable as helpers that we have all long since accepted them as one of the essential orders of our combined planetary ministry.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p0_2">77:0.2</a></small></sup>  On <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> there function two distinct orders of <a href="/en/topic/midwayers">midwayers</a>: the primary or senior corps, who came into being back in the days of <a href="/en/topic/Dalamatia">Dalamatia</a>, and the secondary or younger group, whose origin dates from the times of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. THE PRIMARY MIDWAYERS </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p1_1">77:1.1</a></small></sup>  The primary <a href="/en/topic/midwayers">midwayers</a> have their genesis in a unique interassociation of the material and the spiritual on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. We know of the existence of similar creatures on other worlds and in other systems, but they originated by dissimilar techniques.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p1_2">77:1.2</a></small></sup>  It is well always to bear in mind that the successive bestowals of the <a href="/en/topic/Sons_of_God">Sons of God</a> on an evolving planet produce marked changes in the spiritual economy of the realm and sometimes so modify the workings of the interassociation of spiritual and material agencies on a planet as to create situations indeed difficult of understanding. The status of the one hundred corporeal members of Prince <a href="/en/topic/corporeal_staffs_of_Planetary_Princes">Caligastia’s staff</a> illustrates just such a unique interassociation: As ascendant morontia citizens of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> they were supermaterial creatures without reproductive prerogatives. As descendant planetary ministers on Urantia they were material sex creatures capable of procreating material offspring (as some of them later did). What we cannot satisfactorily explain is how these one hundred could function in the parental role on a supermaterial level, but that is exactly what happened. A supermaterial (nonsexual) liaison of a male and a female member of the corporeal staff resulted in the appearance of the first-born of the primary midwayers.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p1_3">77:1.3</a></small></sup>  It was immediately discovered that a creature of this order, midway between the mortal and angelic levels, would be of great service in carrying on the affairs of the Prince’s headquarters, and each couple of the corporeal staff was accordingly granted permission to produce a similar being. This effort resulted in the first group of fifty midway creatures.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p1_4">77:1.4</a></small></sup>  After a year of observing the work of this unique group, the Planetary Prince authorized the reproduction of <a href="/en/topic/midwayers">midwayers</a> without restriction. This plan was carried out as long as the power to create continued, and the original corps of 50,000 was accordingly brought into being.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p1_5">77:1.5</a></small></sup>  A period of one-half year intervened between the production of each midwayer, and when one thousand such beings had been born to each couple, no more were ever forthcoming. And there is no explanation available as to why this power was exhausted upon the appearance of the one thousandth offspring. No amount of further experimentation ever resulted in anything but failure.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p1_6">77:1.6</a></small></sup>  These creatures constituted the intelligence corps of the Prince’s administration. They ranged far and wide, studying and observing the world races and rendering other invaluable services to the Prince and his staff in the work of influencing human society remote from the planetary headquarters.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p1_7">77:1.7</a></small></sup>  This regime continued until the tragic days of the planetary rebellion, which ensnared a little over four fifths of the primary <a href="/en/topic/midwayers">midwayers</a>. The loyal corps entered the service of the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_receivers">Melchizedek receivers</a>, functioning under the titular leadership of <a href="/en/topic/Van_(lake)">Van</a> until the days of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. THE NODITE RACE </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p2_1">77:2.1</a></small></sup>  While this is the narrative of the origin, nature, and function of the midway creatures of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>, the kinship between the two orders—primary and secondary—makes it necessary to interrupt the <a href="/en/topic/Genesis,_Book_of">story</a> of the primary <a href="/en/topic/midwayers">midwayers</a> at this point in order to follow out the line of descent from the rebel members of the <a href="/en/topic/corporeal_staffs_of_Planetary_Princes">corporeal staff</a> of Prince <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia">Caligastia</a> from the days of the planetary rebellion to the times of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a>. It was this line of inheritance which, in the early days of the second <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a>, furnished one half of the ancestry for the secondary order of midway creatures.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p2_2">77:2.2</a></small></sup>  The physical members of the Prince’s staff had been constituted sex creatures for the purpose of participating in the plan of procreating offspring embodying the combined qualities of their special order united with those of the selected stock of the <a href="/en/topic/Andon_and_Fonta">Andon</a> tribes, and all of this was in anticipation of the subsequent appearance of Adam. The <a href="/en/topic/Life_Carriers">Life Carriers</a> had planned a new type of mortal embracing the union of the conjoint offspring of the Prince’s staff with the first-generation offspring of Adam and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a>. They had thus projected a plan envisioning a new order of planetary creatures whom they hoped would become the teacher-rulers of human society. Such beings were designed for social sovereignty, not civil sovereignty. But since this project almost completely miscarried, we shall never know what an aristocracy of benign leadership and matchless culture Urantia was thus deprived of. For when the corporeal staff later reproduced, it was subsequent to the rebellion and after they had been deprived of their connection with the <a href="/en/topic/life">life</a> currents of the system.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p2_3">77:2.3</a></small></sup>  The postrebellion era on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> witnessed many unusual happenings. A great civilization—the culture of <a href="/en/topic/Dalamatia">Dalamatia</a>—was going to pieces. “The <a href="/en/topic/Nephilim">Nephilim</a> (<a href="/en/topic/Nodites">Nodites</a>) were on earth in those days, and when these sons of the gods went in to the daughters of men and they bore to them, their children were the ‘mighty men of old,’ the ‘men of renown<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>.’” While hardly “sons of the gods,” the staff and their early descendants were so regarded by the evolutionary <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of those distant days; even their stature came to be magnified by tradition<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>. This, then, is the origin of the well-nigh universal folk tale of the gods who came down to earth and there with the daughters of men begot an ancient race of heroes. And all this legend became further confused with the race mixtures of the later appearing <a href="/en/topic/Adamites">Adamites</a> in the second <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1"><a href="#fn_a1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p2_4">77:2.4</a></small></sup>  Since the one hundred corporeal members of the Prince’s staff carried germ plasm of the Andonic human strains, it would naturally be expected that, if they engaged in sexual reproduction, their progeny would altogether resemble the offspring of other <a href="/en/topic/Andonites">Andonite</a> parents. But when the sixty rebels of the staff, the followers of <a href="/en/topic/Nod_(land_of)">Nod</a>, actually engaged in sexual reproduction, their children proved to be far superior in almost every way to both the Andonite and the Sangik peoples. This unexpected excellence characterized not only physical and intellectual qualities but also spiritual capacities.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p2_5">77:2.5</a></small></sup>  These mutant traits appearing in <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> Nodite generation resulted from certain changes which had been wrought in the configuration and in the chemical constituents of the inheritance factors of the Andonic germ plasm. These changes were caused by the presence in the bodies of the staff members of the powerful life-maintenance circuits of the <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> system. These <a href="/en/topic/life">life</a> circuits caused the <a href="/en/topic/chromosomes">chromosomes</a> of the specialized <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> pattern to reorganize more after the patterns of the standardized Satania specialization of the ordained <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> life manifestation. The technique of this germ plasm metamorphosis by the action of the system life currents is not unlike those procedures whereby Urantia scientists modify the germ plasm of plants and animals by the use of <a href="/en/topic/X_rays">X rays</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2"><a href="#fn_a2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3"><a href="#fn_a3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4"><a href="#fn_a4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p2_6">77:2.6</a></small></sup>  Thus did the Nodite peoples arise out of certain peculiar and unexpected modifications occurring in the life plasm which had been transferred from the bodies of the <a href="/en/topic/Andonites">Andonite</a> contributors to those of the <a href="/en/topic/corporeal_staffs_of_Planetary_Princes">corporeal staff</a> members by the <a href="/en/topic/Avalon">Avalon</a> surgeons<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p2_7">77:2.7</a></small></sup>  It will be recalled that the one hundred Andonite germ plasm contributors were in turn made possessors of the organic complement of the <a href="/en/topic/tree_of_life">tree of life</a> so that the <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> life currents likewise invested their bodies. The forty-four modified Andonites who followed the staff into rebellion also mated among themselves and made a great contribution to the better strains of the Nodite people.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p2_8">77:2.8</a></small></sup>  These two groups, embracing 104 individuals who carried the modified <a href="/en/topic/Andonites">Andonite</a> germ plasm, constitute the ancestry of the <a href="/en/topic/Nodites">Nodites</a>, the eighth race to appear on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. And this new feature of human life on Urantia represents another phase of the outworking of the original plan of utilizing this planet as a life-modification world, except that this was one of the unforeseen developments.</p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p2_9">77:2.9</a></small></sup>  The pure-line Nodites were a magnificent race, but they gradually mingled with the evolutionary peoples of earth, and before long great deterioration had occurred<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>. Ten thousand years after the rebellion they had lost ground to the point where their average length of life was little more than that of the evolutionary races.</p>
<p id="p2_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p2_10">77:2.10</a></small></sup>  When archaeologists dig up the clay-tablet records of the later-day Sumerian descendants of the <a href="/en/topic/Nodites">Nodites</a>, they discover lists of Sumerian kings running back for several thousand years; and as these records go further back, the reigns of the individual kings lengthen from around twenty-five or thirty years up to one hundred and fifty years and more. This lengthening of the reigns of these older kings signifies that some of the early Nodite rulers (immediate descendants of the Prince’s staff) did live longer than their later-day successors and also indicates an effort to stretch the dynasties back to <a href="/en/topic/Dalamatia">Dalamatia</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p2_11">77:2.11</a></small></sup>  The records of such long-lived individuals are also due to the confusion of months and years as <a href="/en/topic/time">time</a> periods<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>. This may also be observed in the Biblical genealogy of <a href="/en/topic/Abraham_(Old_Testament)">Abraham</a> and in the early records of the <a href="/en/topic/Chinese">Chinese</a>. The confusion of the twenty-eight-day month, or season, with the later introduced year of more than three hundred and fifty days is responsible for the traditions of such long human lives. There are records of a <a href="/en/topic/Methuselah">man who lived</a> over nine hundred “years.” This period represents not quite seventy years, and such lives were regarded for ages as very long, “threescore years and ten” as such a <a href="/en/topic/life">life</a> span was later designated<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p2_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p2_12">77:2.12</a></small></sup>  The reckoning of time by the twenty-eight-day month persisted long after the days of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a>. But when the Egyptians undertook to reform the <a href="/en/topic/calendar">calendar</a>, about seven thousand years ago, they did it with great accuracy, introducing the year of 365 days.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. THE TOWER OF BABEL </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p3_1">77:3.1</a></small></sup>  After the submergence of <a href="/en/topic/Dalamatia">Dalamatia</a> the <a href="/en/topic/Nodites">Nodites</a> moved north and east, presently founding the new city of <a href="/en/topic/Dilmun">Dilmun</a> as their racial and cultural headquarters. And about fifty thousand years after the death of <a href="/en/topic/Nod_(land_of)">Nod</a>, when the offspring of the Prince’s staff had become too numerous to find subsistence in the lands immediately surrounding their new city of Dilmun, and after they had reached out to intermarry with the <a href="/en/topic/Andonites">Andonite</a> and Sangik tribes adjoining their borders, it occurred to their leaders that something should be done to preserve their racial unity. Accordingly a council of the tribes was called, and after much deliberation the plan of <a href="/en/topic/Bablot_(city)">Bablot</a>, a descendant of <a href="/en/topic/Nod_(Prince’s_corporeal_staff)">Nod</a>, was endorsed.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p3_2">77:3.2</a></small></sup>  Bablot proposed to erect a pretentious <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> of racial glorification at the center of their then occupied territory. This temple was to have a tower the like of which the world had never seen. It was to be a monumental memorial to their passing greatness. There were many who wished to have this monument erected in Dilmun, but others contended that such a great structure should be placed a safe distance from the dangers of the sea, remembering the traditions of the engulfment of their first capital, Dalamatia.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p3_3">77:3.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Bablot_(city)">Bablot</a> planned that the new buildings should become the nucleus of the future center of the Nodite culture and civilization. His counsel finally prevailed, and construction was started in accordance with his plans. The new city was to be named <i><a href="/en/topic/Bablot_(architect)">Bablot</a></i> after the architect and builder of the tower. This location later became known as <a href="/en/topic/Bablod">Bablod</a> and eventually as <a href="/en/topic/Babel">Babel</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p3_4">77:3.4</a></small></sup>  But the <a href="/en/topic/Nodites">Nodites</a> were still somewhat divided in sentiment as to the plans and purposes of this undertaking. Neither were their leaders altogether agreed concerning either construction plans or usage of the buildings after they should be completed. After four and one-half years of work a great dispute arose about the object and motive for the erection of the tower. The contentions became so bitter that all work stopped. The food carriers spread the news of the dissension, and large numbers of the tribes began to forgather at the building site. Three differing views were propounded as to the purpose of building the tower:</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p3_5">77:3.5</a></small></sup>  1. The largest group, almost one half, desired to see the tower built as a memorial of Nodite <a href="/en/topic/history">history</a> and racial superiority. They thought it ought to be a great and imposing structure which would challenge the admiration of all future generations.</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p3_6">77:3.6</a></small></sup>  2. The next largest faction wanted the tower designed to commemorate the <a href="/en/topic/Dilmun">Dilmun</a> culture. They foresaw that <a href="/en/topic/Bablot_(city)">Bablot</a> would become a great center of commerce, art, and manufacture.</p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p3_7">77:3.7</a></small></sup>  3. The smallest and minority contingent held that the erection of the tower presented an opportunity for making atonement for the folly of their progenitors in participating in the <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia">Caligastia</a> rebellion. They maintained that the tower should be devoted to the worship of the Father of all, that the whole purpose of the new city should be to take the place of <a href="/en/topic/Dalamatia">Dalamatia</a>—to function as the cultural and religious center for the surrounding barbarians.</p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p3_8">77:3.8</a></small></sup>  The religious group were promptly voted down. The majority rejected the teaching that their ancestors had been guilty of rebellion; they resented such a racial stigma. Having disposed of one of the three angles to the dispute and failing to settle the other two by debate, they fell to fighting. The religionists, the noncombatants, fled to their homes in the south, while their fellows fought until well-nigh obliterated.</p>
<p id="p3_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p3_9">77:3.9</a></small></sup>  About twelve thousand years ago a second attempt to erect the tower of <a href="/en/topic/Babel">Babel</a> was made. The mixed races of the <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andites</a> (<a href="/en/topic/Nodites">Nodites</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Adamites">Adamites</a>) undertook to raise a new <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> on the ruins of <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> structure, but there was not sufficient support for the enterprise; it fell of its own pretentious weight. This region was long known as the land of Babel.</p>
<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 4. NODITE CENTERS OF CIVILIZATION </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p4_1">77:4.1</a></small></sup>  The dispersion of the <a href="/en/topic/Nodites">Nodites</a> was an immediate result of the internecine conflict over the tower of <a href="/en/topic/Babel">Babel</a>. This internal war greatly reduced the numbers of the purer Nodites and was in many ways responsible for their failure to establish a great pre-Adamic civilization. From this time on Nodite culture declined for over one hundred and twenty thousand years until it was upstepped by Adamic infusion. But even in the times of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> the Nodites were still an able people. Many of their mixed descendants were numbered among the Garden builders, and several of <a href="/en/topic/Van_(lake)">Van</a>’s group captains were Nodites. Some of the most capable minds serving on <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(village)">Adam</a>’s staff were of this race.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p4_2">77:4.2</a></small></sup>  Three out of the four great Nodite centers were established immediately following the <a href="/en/topic/Bablot_(city)">Bablot</a> conflict:</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p4_3">77:4.3</a></small></sup>  1. <i>The western or Syrian <a href="/en/topic/Nodites">Nodites</a>.</i> The remnants of the nationalistic or racial memorialists journeyed northward, uniting with the <a href="/en/topic/Andonites">Andonites</a> to found the later Nodite centers to the northwest of <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>. This was the largest group of the dispersing Nodites, and they contributed much to the later appearing <a href="/en/topic/Assyria">Assyrian stock</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p4_4">77:4.4</a></small></sup>  2. <i>The eastern or Elamite Nodites.</i> The culture and commerce advocates migrated in large numbers eastward into <a href="/en/topic/Elam">Elam</a> and there united with the mixed Sangik tribes. The <a href="/en/topic/Elamites">Elamites</a> of thirty to forty thousand years ago had become largely Sangik in nature, although they continued to maintain a civilization superior to that of the surrounding barbarians.</p>
<p id="p4_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p4_5">77:4.5</a></small></sup>  After the establishment of the second <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a> it was customary to allude to this near-by Nodite settlement as “the land of <a href="/en/topic/Nod_(land_of)">Nod</a>”; and during the long period of relative peace between this Nodite group and the <a href="/en/topic/Adamites">Adamites</a>, the two races were greatly blended, for it became more and more the custom for the <a href="/en/topic/Sons_of_God">Sons of God</a> (the Adamites) to intermarry with the daughters of men (the <a href="/en/topic/Nodites">Nodites</a>)<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>.<sup id="cite_b9"><a href="#fn_b9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p4_6">77:4.6</a></small></sup>  3. <i>The central or pre-Sumerian Nodites.</i> A small group at the mouth of the <a href="/en/topic/Tigris_River">Tigris</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Euphrates_River">Euphrates</a> rivers maintained more of their racial integrity.

In a little over three years Adamson’s party actually found the object of their adventure, and among these people he discovered a wonderful and beautiful woman, twenty years old, who claimed to be <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> pure-line descendant of the Prince’s staff. This woman, <a href="/en/topic/Ratta">Ratta</a>, said that her ancestors were all descendants of two of the fallen staff of the Prince. She was the last of her race, having no living brothers or sisters. She had about decided not to mate, had about made up her mind to die without issue, but she lost her heart to the majestic Adamson.

<p id="p8_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p8_6">77:8.6</a></small></sup>  1. <i>Midway <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a>.</i> This group bear names; they are a small corps and are of great assistance on an evolutionary world in the service of quick and reliable personal communication.</p>
<p id="p8_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p8_7">77:8.7</a></small></sup>  2. <i>Planetary sentinels.</i> Midwayers are the guardians, the sentinels, of the worlds of space. They perform the important duties of observers for all the numerous phenomena and types of communication which are of import to the supernatural beings of the realm. They patrol the invisible spirit realm of the planet.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a15"><a href="#fn_a15">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p8_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p8_8">77:8.8</a></small></sup>  3. <i><a href="/en/topic/contact_personalities">Contact personalities</a>.</i> In the contacts made with the mortal beings of the material worlds, such as with the subject through whom these communications were transmitted, the midway creatures are always employed. They are an essential factor in such liaisons of the spiritual and the material levels.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a16"><a href="#fn_a16">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p8_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p8_9">77:8.9</a></small></sup>  4. <i>Progress helpers.</i> These are the more spiritual of the midway creatures, and they are distributed as assistants to the various orders of <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> who function in special groups on the planet.</p>
<p id="p8_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p8_10">77:8.10</a></small></sup>  Midwayers vary greatly in their abilities to make contact with the seraphim above and with their human cousins below. It is exceedingly difficult, for instance, for the primary <a href="/en/topic/midwayers">midwayers</a> to make direct contact with material agencies. They are considerably nearer the angelic type of being and are therefore usually assigned to working with, and ministering to, the spiritual forces resident on the planet. They act as companions and guides for celestial visitors and student sojourners, whereas the secondary creatures are almost exclusively attached to the ministry of the material beings of the realm.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a17"><a href="#fn_a17">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p8_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p8_11">77:8.11</a></small></sup>  The 1,111 loyal secondary midwayers are engaged in important missions on earth. As compared with their primary associates, they are decidedly material. They exist just outside the range of mortal vision and possess sufficient latitude of adaptation to make, at will, physical contact with what humans call “material things.” These unique creatures have certain definite powers over the things of time and space, not excepting the beasts of the realm.</p>
<p id="p8_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p8_12">77:8.12</a></small></sup>  Many of the more literal phenomena ascribed to <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a> have been performed by the secondary midway creatures. When the early teachers of the gospel of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> were thrown into prison by the ignorant religious leaders of that day, an actual “angel of the Lord” “by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b13"><a href="#fn_b13">[13]</a></sup>.” But in the case of <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>’s deliverance after the killing of <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> by Herod’s order, it was a secondary midwayer who performed the work ascribed to an angel<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b14"><a href="#fn_b14">[14]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a18"><a href="#fn_a18">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a19"><a href="#fn_a19">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p8_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p8_13">77:8.13</a></small></sup>  Their chief work today is that of unperceived personal-liaison associates of those men and women who constitute the planetary <a href="/en/topic/reserve_corps_of_destiny">reserve corps of destiny</a>. It was the work of this secondary group, ably seconded by certain of the primary corps, that brought about the co-ordination of personalities and circumstances on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> which finally induced the planetary celestial supervisors to initiate those petitions that resulted in the granting of the mandates making possible the series of revelations of which this presentation is a part. But it should be made clear that the midway creatures are not involved in the sordid performances taking place under the general designation of “<a href="/en/topic/spiritualism">spiritualism</a>.” The <a href="/en/topic/midwayers">midwayers</a> at present on Urantia, all of whom are of honorable standing, are not connected with the phenomena of so-called “mediumship”; and they do not, ordinarily, permit humans to witness their sometimes necessary physical activities or other contacts with the material world, as they are perceived by human senses.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a20"><a href="#fn_a20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a21"><a href="#fn_a21">[21]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p9_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p9_1">77:9.1</a></small></sup>  Midwayers may be regarded as <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> group of the permanent inhabitants to be found on the various orders of worlds throughout the universes in contrast with evolutionary <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascenders</a> like the mortal creatures and the angelic hosts. Such <a href="/en/topic/permanent_citizens">permanent citizens</a> are encountered at various points in the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> ascent.</p>
<p id="p9_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p9_2">77:9.2</a></small></sup>  Unlike the various orders of <a href="/en/topic/celestial_beings">celestial beings</a> who are assigned to <i>minister</i> on a planet, the <a href="/en/topic/midwayers">midwayers</a> <i>live</i> on an inhabited world. The <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> come and go, but the midway creatures remain and will remain, albeit they are nonetheless ministers for being natives of the planet, and they provide the one continuing regime which harmonizes and connects the changing administrations of the <a href="/en/topic/seraphic_hosts">seraphic hosts</a>.</p>
<p id="p9_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p9_3">77:9.3</a></small></sup>  As actual citizens of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>, the midwayers have a kinship interest in the destiny of this sphere. They are a determined association, persistently working for the progress of their native planet. Their determination is suggested by the motto of their order: “What the United Midwayers undertake, the United Midwayers do.”</p>
<p id="p9_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p9_4">77:9.4</a></small></sup>  Although their ability to traverse the energy circuits makes planetary departure feasible to any midwayer, they have individually pledged themselves not to leave the planet prior to their sometime release by the universe authorities. Midwayers are anchored on a planet until the ages of settled light and life. With the exception of 1-2-3 <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a>, no loyal midway creatures have ever departed from Urantia.</p>
<p id="p9_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p9_5">77:9.5</a></small></sup>  1-2-3 the first, the eldest of the primary order, was released from immediate planetary duties shortly after <a href="/en/topic/Pentecost_(bestowal_of_Spirit_of_Truth)">Pentecost</a>. This noble midwayer stood steadfast with <a href="/en/topic/Van_(lake)">Van</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Amadon">Amadon</a> during the tragic days of the planetary rebellion, and his fearless leadership was instrumental in reducing the casualties in his order. He serves at present on <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> as a member of the twenty-four counselors, having already functioned as governor general of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> once since Pentecost<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b15"><a href="#fn_b15">[15]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p9_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p9_6">77:9.6</a></small></sup>  Midwayers are planet bound, but much as <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> talk with travelers from afar and thus learn about remote places on the planet, so do <a href="/en/topic/midwayers">midwayers</a> converse with celestial travelers to learn about the far places of the universe. So do they become conversant with this system and universe, even with <a href="/en/topic/Orvonton_(superuniverse)">Orvonton</a> and its sister creations, and so do they prepare themselves for citizenship on the higher levels of creature existence.</p>
<p id="p9_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p9_7">77:9.7</a></small></sup>  While the midwayers were brought into existence fully developed—experiencing no period of growth or development from immaturity—they never cease to grow in wisdom and experience. Like mortals they are evolutionary creatures, and they have a culture which is a bona fide evolutionary attainment. There are many great minds and mighty spirits among the <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> midway corps.</p>
<p id="p9_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p9_8">77:9.8</a></small></sup>  In the larger aspect the <a href="/en/topic/civilization">civilization</a> of Urantia is the joint product of the Urantia <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> and the Urantia <a href="/en/topic/midwayers">midwayers</a>, and this is true despite the present differential between the two levels of culture, a differential which will not be compensated prior to the ages of light and life.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a22"><a href="#fn_a22">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a23"><a href="#fn_a23">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p9_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p9_9">77:9.9</a></small></sup>  The midway culture, being the product of an immortal planetary citizenry, is relatively immune to those temporal vicissitudes which beset human civilization. The generations of men forget; the corps of midwayers remembers, and that memory is the treasure house of the traditions of your inhabited world. Thus does the culture of a planet remain ever present on that planet, and in proper circumstances such treasured memories of past events are made available, even as the <a href="/en/topic/Genesis,_Book_of">story</a> of the life and teachings of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> has been given by the midwayers of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> to their cousins in the flesh.</p>
<p id="p9_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p9_10">77:9.10</a></small></sup>  Midwayers are the skillful ministers who compensate that gap between the material and spiritual affairs of Urantia which appeared upon the death of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a>. They are likewise your elder brethren, comrades in the long struggle to attain a settled status of light and life on Urantia. The United Midwayers are a rebellion-tested corps, and they will faithfully enact their part in planetary evolution until this world attains the goal of the ages, until that distant day when in fact peace does reign on earth and in truth is there good will in the hearts of men.</p>
<p id="p9_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p9_11">77:9.11</a></small></sup>  Because of the valuable work performed by these <a href="/en/topic/midwayers">midwayers</a>, we have concluded that they are a truly essential part of the spirit economy of the realms. And where rebellion has not marred a planet’s affairs, they are of still greater assistance to the <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a>.</p>
