The ozone permeating this region, at conditions prevailing on the earth’s surface, would make a layer only one tenth of an inch thick; nevertheless, this relatively small and apparently insignificant amount of ozone protects Urantia inhabitants from the excess of these dangerous and destructive ultraviolet radiations present in sunlight.

At a height of forty-five or fifty miles, the temperature begins to rise, and this increase continues until, at the level of the <a href="/en/topic/auroral_displays">auroral displays</a>, a temperature of 1200° F. is attained, and it is this intense heat that ionizes the oxygen. But temperature in such a rarefied atmosphere is hardly comparable with heat reckoning at the surface of the earth.

In this region there occurred one hundred and twenty-seven successive lava flows on land with succeeding water submergence and consequent rock deposition. Although much of the upper rock sedimentation and intermittent lava flow is absent today, and though the bottom of this system is buried deep in the earth, nevertheless, about sixty-five or seventy of these stratified records of past ages are now exposed to view.</p>
<p id="p7_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/58#p7_8">58:7.8</a></small></sup>  In these early ages when much land was near sea level, there occurred many successive submergences and emergences. The earth’s crust was just entering upon its later period of comparative stabilization. The undulations, rises and dips, of the earlier continental drift contributed to the frequency of the periodic submergence of the great land masses.</p>
<p id="p7_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/58#p7_9">58:7.9</a></small></sup>  During these times of primitive marine <a href="/en/topic/life">life</a>, extensive areas of the continental shores sank beneath the seas from a few feet to half a mile. Much of the older <a href="/en/topic/sandstone">sandstone</a> and <a href="/en/topic/conglomerates">conglomerates</a> represents the sedimentary accumulations of these ancient shores. The sedimentary rocks belonging to this early stratification rest directly upon those layers which date back far beyond the origin of life, back to the early appearance of the world-wide ocean.</p>
<p id="p7_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/58#p7_10">58:7.10</a></small></sup>  Some of the upper layers of these transition rock deposits contain small amounts of <a href="/en/topic/shale">shale</a> or <a href="/en/topic/slate">slate</a> of dark colors, indicating the presence of organic <a href="/en/topic/carbon">carbon</a> and testifying to the existence of the ancestors of those forms of plant life which overran the earth during the succeeding <a href="/en/topic/Carboniferous">Carboniferous</a> or coal age.
