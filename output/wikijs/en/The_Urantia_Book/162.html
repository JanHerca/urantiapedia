<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p0_1">162:0.1</a></small></sup>  WHEN <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> started up to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> with the ten apostles, he planned to go through <a href="/en/topic/Samaria">Samaria</a>, that being the shorter route. Accordingly, they passed down the eastern shore of the lake and, by way of <a href="/en/topic/Scythopolis">Scythopolis</a>, entered the borders of Samaria. Near nightfall Jesus sent <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a> and Matthew over to a village on the eastern slopes of <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Gilboa">Mount Gilboa</a> to secure lodging for the company. It so happened that these villagers were greatly prejudiced against the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>, even more so than the average <a href="/en/topic/Samaritans">Samaritans</a>, and these feelings were heightened at this particular time as so many were on their way to the feast of tabernacles. These people knew very little about Jesus, and they refused him lodging because he and his associates were <a href="/en/topic/Jews_(ancient_Hebrews)">Jews</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. When Matthew and <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Tetrarch)">Philip</a> manifested indignation and informed these Samaritans that they were declining to entertain the Holy One of <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a>, the infuriated villagers chased them out of the little town with sticks and stones.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_1_9"><a href="#fn_a0_1_9">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p0_2">162:0.2</a></small></sup>  After Philip and Matthew had returned to their fellows and reported how they had been driven out of the village, <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> and John stepped up to Jesus and said: ‚Äú<a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, we pray you to give us permission to bid fire come down from heaven to devour these insolent and impenitent Samaritans.‚Äù But when Jesus heard these words of vengeance, he turned upon the sons of <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a> and severely rebuked them: ‚ÄúYou know not what manner of attitude you manifest<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>. Vengeance savors not of the outlook of the kingdom of heaven. Rather than dispute, let us journey over to the little village by the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> ford.‚Äù Thus because of sectarian prejudice these Samaritans denied themselves the honor of showing hospitality to the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> of a universe.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_2_1"><a href="#fn_s0_2_1">[1]</a></sup></p>

Early the next day they crossed the river and continued on to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> by way of the east Jordan highway, arriving at <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a> late <a href="/en/topic/Wednesday">Wednesday</a> evening. Thomas and <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a> arrived on <a href="/en/topic/Fridays">Friday</a>, having been delayed by their conferences with Rodan.</p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p0_4">162:0.4</a></small></sup>  Jesus and the twelve remained in the vicinity of Jerusalem until the end of the following month (October), about four and one-half weeks. Jesus himself went into the city only a few times, and these brief visits were made during the days of the feast of tabernacles. He spent a considerable portion of October with <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a> and his associates at <a href="/en/topic/Bethlehem_(Judea)">Bethlehem</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 1. THE DANGERS OF THE VISIT TO JERUSALEM </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p1_1">162:1.1</a></small></sup>  Long before they fled from <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>, the followers of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had implored him to go to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> to proclaim the gospel of the kingdom in order that his message might have the prestige of having been preached at the center of Jewish culture and learning; but now that he had actually come to Jerusalem to teach, they were afraid for his life<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>. Knowing that the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> had sought to bring Jesus to Jerusalem for trial and recalling the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>‚Äôs recently reiterated declarations that he must be subject to death, the <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a> had been literally stunned by his sudden decision to attend the feast of tabernacles. To all their previous entreaties that he go to Jerusalem he had replied, ‚ÄúThe hour has not yet come<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>.‚Äù Now, to their protests of fear he answered only, ‚ÄúBut the hour has come.‚Äù</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p1_2">162:1.2</a></small></sup>  During the feast of tabernacles Jesus went boldly into Jerusalem on several occasions and publicly taught in the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>. This he did in spite of the efforts of his apostles to dissuade him. Though they had long urged him to proclaim his message in Jerusalem, they now feared to see him enter the city at this time, knowing full well that the scribes and <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> were bent on bringing about his death.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p1_3">162:1.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>‚Äô bold appearance in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> more than ever confused his followers. Many of his disciples, and even <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>, the apostle, had dared to think that Jesus had fled in haste into Phoenicia because he feared the Jewish leaders and <a href="/en/topic/Herod_Antipas">Herod Antipas</a>. They failed to comprehend the significance of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>‚Äôs movements<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>. His presence in Jerusalem at the feast of tabernacles, even in opposition to the advice of his followers, sufficed forever to put an end to all whisperings about fear and cowardice.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p1_4">162:1.4</a></small></sup>  During the feast of tabernacles, thousands of believers from all parts of the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_Empire">Roman Empire</a> saw Jesus, heard him teach, and many even journeyed out to <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a> to confer with him regarding the progress of the kingdom in their home districts.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p1_5">162:1.5</a></small></sup>  There were many reasons why <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was able publicly to preach in the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> courts throughout the days of the feast, and chief of these was the fear that had come over the officers of the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> as a result of the secret division of sentiment in their own ranks. It was a fact that many of the members of the Sanhedrin either secretly believed in Jesus or else were decidedly averse to arresting him during the feast, when such large numbers of people were present in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, many of whom either believed in him or were at least friendly to the spiritual movement which he sponsored.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_5_0"><a href="#fn_s1_5_0">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p1_6">162:1.6</a></small></sup>  The efforts of <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a> and his associates throughout <a href="/en/topic/Judea">Judea</a> had also done much to consolidate sentiment favorable to the kingdom, so much so that the enemies of Jesus dared not be too outspoken in their opposition. This was one of the reasons why Jesus could publicly visit Jerusalem and live to go away. One or two months before this he would certainly have been put to death.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p1_7">162:1.7</a></small></sup>  But the audacious boldness of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> in publicly appearing in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> overawed his enemies; they were not prepared for such a daring challenge. Several times during this month the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> made feeble attempts to place the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> under arrest, but nothing came of these efforts. His enemies were so taken aback by Jesus‚Äô unexpected public appearance in Jerusalem that they conjectured he must have been promised protection by the Roman authorities. Knowing that <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a> (<a href="/en/topic/Herod_Antipas">Herod Antipas</a>‚Äôs brother) was almost a follower of Jesus, the members of the Sanhedrin speculated that <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Tetrarch)">Philip</a> had secured for Jesus promises of protection against his enemies. Jesus had departed from their jurisdiction before they awakened to the realization that they had been mistaken in the belief that his sudden and bold appearance in Jerusalem had been due to a secret understanding with the Roman officials.</p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p1_8">162:1.8</a></small></sup>  Only the twelve apostles had known that Jesus intended to attend the feast of tabernacles when they had departed from Magadan<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>. The other followers of the Master were greatly astonished when he appeared in the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> courts and began publicly to teach, and the Jewish authorities were surprised beyond expression when it was reported that he was teaching in the temple.</p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p1_9">162:1.9</a></small></sup>  Although his disciples had not expected <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> to attend the feast, the vast majority of the pilgrims from afar who had heard of him entertained the hope that they might see him at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>. And they were not disappointed, for on several occasions he taught in <a href="/en/topic/Solomon‚Äôs_Porch">Solomon‚Äôs Porch</a> and elsewhere in the <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a> courts. These teachings were really the official or formal announcement of the divinity of Jesus to the Jewish people and to the whole world.</p>
<p id="p1_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p1_10">162:1.10</a></small></sup>  The multitudes who listened to the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>‚Äôs teachings were divided in their opinions<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b9"><a href="#fn_b9">[9]</a></sup>. Some said he was a good man; some a prophet; some that he was truly the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a>; others said he was a mischievous meddler, that he was leading the people astray with his strange doctrines. His enemies hesitated to denounce him openly for fear of his friendly believers, while his friends feared to acknowledge him openly for fear of the Jewish leaders, knowing that the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> was determined to put him to death. But even his enemies marveled at his teaching, knowing that he had not been instructed in the schools of the rabbis<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p1_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p1_11">162:1.11</a></small></sup>  Every time <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> went to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, his <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a> were filled with terror. They were the more afraid as, from day to day, they listened to his increasingly bold pronouncements regarding the nature of his mission on earth. They were unaccustomed to hearing Jesus make such positive claims and such amazing assertions even when preaching among his friends.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 2. THE FIRST TEMPLE TALK </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p2_1">162:2.1</a></small></sup>  The first afternoon that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> taught in the <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a>, a considerable company sat listening to his words depicting the liberty of the new gospel and the joy of those who believe the good news, when a curious listener interrupted him to ask: ‚ÄúTeacher, how is it you can quote the Scriptures and teach the people so fluently when I am told that you are untaught in the learning of the rabbis?‚Äù Jesus replied: ‚ÄúNo man has taught me the truths which I declare to you. And this teaching is not mine but His who sent me<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b11"><a href="#fn_b11">[11]</a></sup>. If any man really desires to do my Father‚Äôs will, he shall certainly know about my teaching, whether it be <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>‚Äôs or whether I speak for myself. He who speaks for himself seeks his own <a href="/en/topic/glory">glory</a>, but when I declare the words of the Father, I thereby seek the glory of him who sent me. But before you try to enter into the new light, should you not rather follow the light you already have? <a href="/en/topic/Moses">Moses</a> gave you the law, yet how many of you honestly seek to fulfill its demands? Moses in this law enjoins you, saying, ‚ÄòYou shall not kill‚Äô; notwithstanding this command some of you seek to kill the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b12"><a href="#fn_b12">[12]</a></sup>.‚Äù<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_2"><a href="#fn_s2_1_2">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p2_2">162:2.2</a></small></sup>  When the crowd heard these words, they fell to wrangling among themselves. Some said he was mad; some that he had a devil. Others said this was indeed the prophet of <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> whom the scribes and <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> had long sought to kill. Some said the religious authorities were afraid to molest him; others thought that they laid not hands upon him because they had become believers in him. After considerable debate one of the crowd stepped forward and asked Jesus, ‚ÄúWhy do the rulers seek to kill you?‚Äù And he replied: ‚ÄúThe rulers seek to kill me because they resent my teaching about the good news of the kingdom, a <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> that sets men free from the burdensome traditions of a formal religion of ceremonies which these teachers are determined to uphold at any cost. They circumcise in accordance with the law on the <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> day, but they would kill me because I once on the Sabbath day set free a man held in the bondage of affliction. They follow after me on the Sabbath to spy on me but would kill me because on another occasion I chose to make a grievously stricken man completely whole on the Sabbath day. They seek to kill me because they well know that, if you honestly believe and dare to accept my teaching, their system of traditional religion will be overthrown, forever destroyed. Thus will they be deprived of authority over that to which they have devoted their lives since they steadfastly refuse to accept this new and more glorious gospel of the kingdom of God. And now do I appeal to every one of you: Judge not according to outward appearances but rather <a href="/en/topic/Roman_magistrate_in_Rome">judge</a> by the true spirit of these teachings; judge righteously<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b13"><a href="#fn_b13">[13]</a></sup>.‚Äù</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p2_3">162:2.3</a></small></sup>  Then said another inquirer: ‚ÄúYes, Teacher, we do look for the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a>, but when he comes, we know that his appearance will be in mystery. We know whence you are. You have been among your brethren from the beginning. The <a href="/en/topic/Deliverer">deliverer</a> will come in power to restore the throne of <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a>‚Äôs kingdom. Do you really claim to be the Messiah?‚Äù And <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> replied: ‚ÄúYou claim to know me and to know whence I am. I wish your claims were true, for indeed then would you find abundant life in that knowledge. But I declare that I have not come to you for myself; I have been sent by the Father, and he who sent me is true and faithful. By refusing to hear me, you are refusing to receive Him who sends me. You, if you will receive this gospel, shall come to know Him who sent me. I know the Father, for I have come from the Father to declare and reveal him to you<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b14"><a href="#fn_b14">[14]</a></sup>.‚Äù</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p2_4">162:2.4</a></small></sup>  The agents of the scribes wanted to lay hands upon him, but they feared the multitude, for many believed in him. Jesus‚Äô work since his baptism had become well known to all Jewry, and as many of these people recounted these things, they said among themselves: ‚ÄúEven though this teacher is from <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>, and even though he does not meet all of our expectations of the Messiah, we wonder if the deliverer, when he does come, will really do anything more wonderful than this Jesus of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> has already done<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b15"><a href="#fn_b15">[15]</a></sup>.‚Äù</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p2_5">162:2.5</a></small></sup>  When the <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> and their agents heard the people talking this way, they took counsel with their leaders and decided that something should be done forthwith to put a stop to these public appearances of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> in the <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a> courts<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b16"><a href="#fn_b16">[16]</a></sup>. The leaders of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>, in general, were disposed to avoid a clash with Jesus, believing that the Roman authorities had promised him immunity. They could not otherwise account for his boldness in coming at this time to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>; but the officers of the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> did not wholly believe this rumor. They reasoned that the Roman rulers would not do such a thing secretly and without the knowledge of the highest governing body of the Jewish nation.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p2_6">162:2.6</a></small></sup>  Accordingly, <a href="/en/topic/Eber">Eber</a>, the proper officer of the Sanhedrin, with two assistants was dispatched to arrest Jesus<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b17"><a href="#fn_b17">[17]</a></sup>. As Eber made his way toward Jesus, the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> said: ‚ÄúFear not to approach me. Draw near while you listen to my teaching.

<p id="p9_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p9_1">162:9.1</a></small></sup>  Throughout the week that followed the feast of tabernacles, scores of believers forgathered at <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a> and received instruction from the twelve <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a>.
