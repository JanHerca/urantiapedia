<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. TRANSITIONAL CULTURE WORLDS </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_1">45:1.1</a></small></sup>  The seven major worlds swinging around <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> are generally known as the transitional culture spheres. Their rulers are designated from time to time by the Jerusem supreme executive council. These spheres are numbered and named as follows:</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_2">45:1.2</a></small></sup>  <i>Number 1. The Finaliter World.</i> This is the headquarters of the <a href="/en/topic/finaliter_corps">finaliter corps</a> of the local system and is surrounded by the receiving worlds, the seven <a href="/en/topic/mansion_worlds">mansion worlds</a>, dedicated so fully to the scheme of mortal ascension. The finaliter world is accessible to the inhabitants of all seven mansion worlds. Transport <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> carry ascending personalities back and forth on these pilgrimages, which are designed to cultivate their faith in the ultimate destiny of transition <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a>. Although the <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliters</a> and their structures are not ordinarily perceptible to morontia <a href="/en/topic/vision_(sight)">vision</a>, you will be more than thrilled, from time to time, when the <a href="/en/topic/energy_transformers">energy transformers</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Morontia_Power_Supervisors">Morontia Power Supervisors</a> enable you momentarily to glimpse these high spirit personalities who have actually completed the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> ascension, and who have returned to the very worlds where you are beginning this long journey, as the pledge of assurance that you may and can complete the stupendous undertaking. All mansion world sojourners go to the finaliter sphere at least once a year for these assemblies of finaliter visualization.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_3">45:1.3</a></small></sup>  <i>Number 2. The Morontia World.</i> This planet is the headquarters of the supervisors of morontia life and is surrounded by the seven spheres whereon the morontia chiefs train their associates and helpers, both morontia beings and <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortals</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_4">45:1.4</a></small></sup>  In passing through the seven mansion worlds, you will also progress through these cultural and social spheres of increasing morontia contact. When you advance from <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> to the second mansion world, you will become eligible for a visitor’s permit to transitional headquarters number two, the <a href="/en/topic/morontia_world">morontia world</a>, and so on. And when present on any one of these six cultural spheres, you may, on invitation, become a visitor and <a href="/en/topic/Most_High_observer_of_Urantia">observer</a> on any of the seven surrounding worlds of associated group activities.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_5">45:1.5</a></small></sup>  <i>Number 3. The <a href="/en/topic/Angelic_World">Angelic World</a>.</i> This is the headquarters of all the <a href="/en/topic/seraphic_hosts">seraphic hosts</a> engaged in system activities and is surrounded by the seven worlds of angelic training and instruction. These are the seraphic social spheres.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_6">45:1.6</a></small></sup>  <i>Number 4. The Superangel World.</i> This sphere is the <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> home of the <a href="/en/topic/Brilliant_Evening_Stars">Brilliant Evening Stars</a> and a vast concourse of co-ordinate and near-co-ordinate beings. The seven satellites of this world are assigned to the seven major groups of these unnamed <a href="/en/topic/celestial_beings">celestial beings</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_7">45:1.7</a></small></sup>  <i>Number 5. The World of the Sons.</i> This planet is the headquarters of the divine Sons of all orders, including the <a href="/en/topic/creature-trinitized_sons">creature-trinitized sons</a>. The surrounding seven worlds are devoted to certain individual groupings of these divinely related sons.</p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_8">45:1.8</a></small></sup>  <i>Number 6. The World of the Spirit.</i> This sphere serves as the system rendezvous of the high personalities of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>. Its seven surrounding satellites are assigned to individual groups of these diverse orders. But on transition world number six there is no representation of the Spirit, neither is such a presence to be observed on the system capitals; the Divine Minister of <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> is <i>everywhere</i> in <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_9">45:1.9</a></small></sup>  <i>Number 7. The World of the Father.</i> This is the silent sphere of the system. No group of beings is domiciled on it. The great <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a> of light occupies a central place, but no one can be discerned therein. All beings of all the system worlds are welcomed as worshipers.</p>
<p id="p1_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_10">45:1.10</a></small></sup>  The seven satellites surrounding the <a href="/en/topic/Father’s_world">Father’s world</a> are variously utilized in the different systems. In <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> they are now used as the detention spheres for the interned groups of the <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">Lucifer rebellion</a>. The constellation capital, <a href="/en/topic/Edentia">Edentia</a>, has no analogous <a href="/en/topic/prison_worlds">prison worlds</a>; the few <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> and <a href="/en/topic/cherubim_and_sanobim">cherubim</a> who went over to the rebels in the Satania rebellion have been long since confined on these isolation worlds of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_11">45:1.11</a></small></sup>  As a sojourner on the seventh mansion world, you have access to the seventh transition world, the sphere of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>, and are also permitted to visit the Satania prison worlds surrounding this planet, whereon are now confined Lucifer and the majority of those personalities who followed him in rebellion against <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a>. And this sad spectacle has been observable during these recent ages and will continue to serve as a solemn warning to all <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> until the <a href="/en/topic/Ancients_of_Days">Ancients of Days</a> shall adjudicate the sin of Lucifer and his fallen associates who rejected the salvation proffered by <a href="/en/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a>, their universe Father.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. THE SYSTEM SOVEREIGN </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p2_1">45:2.1</a></small></sup>  The chief executive of a local system of inhabited worlds is a primary Lanonandek Son, the System Sovereign. In our local universe these sovereigns are intrusted with large executive responsibilities, unusual personal prerogatives. Not all universes, even in <a href="/en/topic/Orvonton_(superuniverse)">Orvonton</a>, are so organized as to permit the <a href="/en/topic/System_Sovereigns">System Sovereigns</a> to exercise such unusually wide powers of personal discretion in the direction of system affairs. But in all the history of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> these untrammeled executives have exhibited disloyalty only three times. The <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">Lucifer rebellion</a> in the system of <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> was <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> and the most widespread of all.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p2_2">45:2.2</a></small></sup>  In Satania, even after this disastrous upheaval, absolutely no changes have been made in the technique of system administration. The present System Sovereign possesses all the power and exercises all the authority that were invested in his unworthy predecessor except for certain matters now under the supervision of the <a href="/en/topic/Constellation_Fathers">Constellation Fathers</a> which the <a href="/en/topic/Ancients_of_Days">Ancients of Days</a> have not yet fully restored to <a href="/en/topic/Lanaforge">Lanaforge</a>, the successor of Lucifer.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p2_3">45:2.3</a></small></sup>  The present head of <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> is a gracious and brilliant ruler, and he is a rebellion-tested sovereign. When serving as an assistant System Sovereign, Lanaforge was faithful to <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a> in an earlier upheaval in the universe of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>. This mighty and brilliant Lord of Satania is a tried and tested administrator. At the time of the second system rebellion in Nebadon, when the System Sovereign stumbled and fell into darkness, Lanaforge, <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> assistant to the erring chief, seized the reins of government and so conducted the affairs of the system that comparatively few personalities were lost either on the headquarters worlds or on the inhabited planets of that unfortunate system. Lanaforge bears the distinction of being the only primary Lanonandek Son in all Nebadon who thus functioned loyally in the service of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a> and in the very presence of the default of his brother of superior authority and antecedent rank. Lanaforge will probably not be removed from <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> until all the results of the former folly have been overcome and the products of rebellion removed from Satania.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p2_4">45:2.4</a></small></sup>  While all the affairs of the isolated worlds of Satania have not been returned to his jurisdiction, <a href="/en/topic/Lanaforge">Lanaforge</a> discloses great interest in their welfare, and he is a frequent visitor on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. As in other and normal systems, the Sovereign presides over the <a href="/en/topic/council_of_Planetary_Princes">system council of world rulers</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Planetary_Princes">Planetary Princes</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/resident_governors_general">resident governors general</a> of the isolated worlds. This planetary council assembles from time to time on the headquarters of the system—“When the <a href="/en/topic/Sons_of_God">Sons of God</a> come together<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p2_5">45:2.5</a></small></sup>  Once a week, every ten days on <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a>, the Sovereign holds a conclave with some one group of the various orders of personalities domiciled on the headquarters world. These are the charmingly informal hours of Jerusem, and they are never-to-be-forgotten occasions. On Jerusem there exists the utmost fraternity between all the various orders of beings and between each of these groups and the System Sovereign.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p2_6">45:2.6</a></small></sup>  These unique assemblages occur on the sea of glass, the great gathering field of the system capital. They are purely social and spiritual occasions; nothing pertaining to the planetary administration or even to the ascendant plan is ever discussed. Ascending <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> come together at these times merely to enjoy themselves and to meet their fellow Jerusemites. Those groups which are not being entertained by the Sovereign at these weekly relaxations meet at their own headquarters.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. THE SYSTEM GOVERNMENT </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p3_1">45:3.1</a></small></sup>  The chief executive of a local system, the System Sovereign, is always supported by two or three <a href="/en/topic/Lanonandek_Sons">Lanonandek Sons</a>, who function as first and second assistants. But at the present time the system of <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> is administered by a staff of seven Lanonandeks:</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p3_2">45:3.2</a></small></sup>  1. <i>The System Sovereign—</i><a href="/en/topic/Lanaforge">Lanaforge</a>, number 2,709 of the primary order and successor to the apostate <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer">Lucifer</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p3_3">45:3.3</a></small></sup>  2. <i>The first assistant Sovereign—</i><a href="/en/topic/Mansurotia">Mansurotia</a>, number 17,841 of the tertiary Lanonandeks. He was dispatched to <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> along with Lanaforge.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1"><a href="#fn_a1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p3_4">45:3.4</a></small></sup>  3. <i>The second assistant Sovereign—</i><a href="/en/topic/Sadib">Sadib</a>, number 271,402 of the tertiary order. Sadib also came to Satania with <a href="/en/topic/Lanaforge">Lanaforge</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p3_5">45:3.5</a></small></sup>  4. <i>The custodian of the system—</i><a href="/en/topic/Holdant">Holdant</a>, number 19 of the tertiary corps, the holder and controller of all interned spirits above the order of mortal existence. Holdant likewise came to <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> with Lanaforge.</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p3_6">45:3.6</a></small></sup>  5. <i>The system recorder—</i><a href="/en/topic/Vilton">Vilton</a>, secretary of the Lanonandek ministry of Satania, number 374 of the third order. Vilton was a member of the original <a href="/en/topic/Lanaforge">Lanaforge</a> group.</p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p3_7">45:3.7</a></small></sup>  6. <i>The bestowal director—</i><a href="/en/topic/Fortant">Fortant</a>, number 319,847 of the reserves of the secondary Lanonandeks and temporary director of all universe activities transplanted to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> since <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a>’s bestowal on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. Fortant has been attached to the staff of Lanaforge for nineteen hundred years of Urantia time.</p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p3_8">45:3.8</a></small></sup>  7. <i>The high counselor—</i><a href="/en/topic/Hanavard">Hanavard</a>, number 67 of the primary <a href="/en/topic/Lanonandek_Sons">Lanonandek Sons</a> and a member of the high corps of universe counselors and co-ordinators. He functions as acting chairman of the executive council of <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a>. Hanavard is the twelfth of this order so to serve on Jerusem since the <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">Lucifer rebellion</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p3_9">45:3.9</a></small></sup>  This executive group of seven Lanonandeks constitutes the expanded emergency administration made necessary by the exigencies of the Lucifer rebellion. There are only minor courts on <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> since the system is the unit of administration, not adjudication, but the Lanonandek administration is supported by the Jerusem executive council, the supreme advisory body of Satania. This council consists of twelve members:</p>

<p id="p7_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p7_3">45:7.3</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_Sons">Melchizedek Sons</a> conduct upward of thirty different educational centers on <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a>. These training schools begin with the <a href="/en/topic/college_of_self-evaluation">college of self-evaluation</a> and end with the schools of Jerusem citizenship, wherein the <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a> and Daughters join with the Melchizedeks and others in their supreme effort to qualify the mortal survivors for the assumption of the high responsibilities of representative <a href="/en/topic/government">government</a>. The entire universe is organized and administered on the <i>representative</i> plan. Representative government is the divine ideal of self-government among nonperfect beings.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a16"><a href="#fn_a16">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p7_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p7_4">45:7.4</a></small></sup>  Every one hundred years of universe time each system selects its ten representatives to sit in the <a href="/en/topic/constellations">constellation</a> legislature. They are chosen by the Jerusem council of one thousand, an elective body charged with the duty of representing the system groups in all such delegated or appointive matters. All representatives or other delegates are selected by the council of one thousand electors, and they must be graduates of the highest school of the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_College_of_Administration">Melchizedek College of Administration</a>, as also are all of those who constitute this group of one thousand electors. This school is fostered by the Melchizedeks, latterly assisted by the <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliters</a>.</p>
<p id="p7_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p7_5">45:7.5</a></small></sup>  There are many elective bodies on <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a>, and they are voted into authority from time to time by three orders of citizenship—the <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a> and Daughters, the <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> and their associates, including midway creatures, and the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortals</a>. To receive nomination for representative honor a candidate must have gained requisite recognition from the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> schools of administration.</p>
<p id="p7_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p7_6">45:7.6</a></small></sup>  Suffrage is universal on Jerusem among these three groups of citizenship, but the vote is differentially cast in accordance with the recognized and duly registered personal possession of <a href="/en/topic/mota">mota</a>—morontia wisdom. The vote cast at a Jerusem election by any one personality has a value ranging from one up to one thousand. Jerusem citizens are thus classified in accordance with their mota achievement.</p>
<p id="p7_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p7_7">45:7.7</a></small></sup>  From time to time <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> citizens present themselves to the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> <a href="/en/topic/examinations">examiners</a>, who certify to their attainment of <a href="/en/topic/morontia">morontia</a> wisdom. Then they go before the examining corps of the <a href="/en/topic/Brilliant_Evening_Stars">Brilliant Evening Stars</a> or their designates, who ascertain the degree of spirit insight. Next they appear in the presence of the <a href="/en/topic/four_and_twenty_counselors">four and twenty counselors</a> and their associates, who pass upon their status of experiential attainment of socialization. These three factors are then carried to the <a href="/en/topic/citizenship_registrars">citizenship registrars</a> of representative government, who quickly compute the mota status and assign suffrage qualifications in accordance therewith.</p>
<p id="p7_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p7_8">45:7.8</a></small></sup>  Under the supervision of the Melchizedeks the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortals</a>, especially those who are tardy in their personality unification on the new morontia levels, are taken in hand by the <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a> and are given intensive training designed to rectify such deficiencies. No ascending mortal leaves the system headquarters for the more extensive and varied socialization career of the constellation until these Material Sons certify to the achievement of <a href="/en/topic/mota">mota</a> personality—an individuality combining the completed mortal existence in experiential association with the budding morontia career, both being duly blended by the spiritual overcontrol of the Thought Adjuster.</p>
