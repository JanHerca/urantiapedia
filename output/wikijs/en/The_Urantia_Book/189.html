These assembled sons of the local universe, the creatures of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a>, did this on their own responsibility; <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a> had not assembled them. By midnight they had arrived at the conclusion that the creature could do nothing to facilitate the resurrection of the Creator. They were disposed to accept the advice of Gabriel, who instructed them that, since <a href="/en/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a> had “laid down his life of his own free will, he also had power to take it up again in accordance with his own determination<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>.” Shortly after the adjournment of this council of the archangels, the <a href="/en/topic/Life_Carriers">Life Carriers</a>, and their various associates in the work of creature rehabilitation and morontia creation, the Personalized Adjuster of Jesus, being in personal command of the assembled celestial hosts then on Urantia, spoke these words to the anxious waiting watchers:</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p0_2">189:0.2</a></small></sup>  “Not one of you can do aught to assist your Creator-father in the return to life. As a mortal of the realm he has experienced mortal death; as the Sovereign of a universe he still lives. That which you observe is the mortal transit of Jesus of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> from life in the flesh to life in the morontia. The spirit transit of this Jesus was completed at the time I separated myself from his personality and became your temporary director. Your Creator-father has elected to pass through the whole of the experience of his mortal creatures, from birth on the material worlds, on through natural death and the resurrection of the morontia, into the status of true spirit existence. A certain phase of this experience you are about to observe, but you may not participate in it. Those things which you ordinarily do for the creature, you may not do for the Creator. A <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> has within himself the power to bestow himself in the likeness of any of his created sons; he has within himself the power to lay down his observable life and to take it up again; and he has this power because of the direct command of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Father, and I know whereof I speak<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p0_3">189:0.3</a></small></sup>  When they heard the Personalized Adjuster so speak, they all assumed the attitude of anxious expectancy, from <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a> down to the most humble <a href="/en/topic/cherubim_and_sanobim">cherubim</a>. They saw the mortal body of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> in the tomb; they detected evidences of the universe activity of their beloved Sovereign; and not understanding such phenomena, they waited patiently for developments.</p>

Neither was the stone before the entrance of the tomb in any way disturbed; the seal of Pilate was still unbroken; the soldiers were still on guard.

None of these watchers suspected that the object of their vigil had risen to a new and higher form of existence, and that the body which they were guarding was now a discarded outer covering which had no further connection with the delivered and resurrected morontia personality of Jesus.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_10"><a href="#fn_a1_2_10">[1]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_2_4"><a href="#fn_s1_2_4">[1]</a></sup></p>

On <a href="/en/topic/Fridays">Friday</a> he laid down his life as a mortal of the realm; on <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a> morning he took it up again as a morontia being of the system of <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> in <a href="/en/topic/Norlatiadek">Norlatiadek</a>. There is much about the resurrection of Jesus which we do not understand. But we know that it occurred as we have stated and at about the time indicated. We can also record that all known phenomena associated with this mortal transit, or morontia resurrection, occurred right there in <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>’s new tomb, where the mortal material remains of Jesus lay wrapped in burial cloths.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p1_5">189:1.5</a></small></sup>  We know that no creature of the local universe participated in this morontia awakening.

Just as soon as Jesus appeared beside <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a>, just above the tomb, the seven personalities from Paradise signalized their intention of immediate departure for <a href="/en/topic/Uversa">Uversa</a>.</p>

When Jesus came forth from the tomb, his body of flesh remained undisturbed in the sepulchre.

And the presence of the <a href="/en/topic/Michael_memorial_(on_Jerusem)">Michael memorial</a> in the center of the vast court of the resurrection halls of mansonia number one leads us to conjecture that the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s resurrection on Urantia was in some way fostered on this, the first of the system <a href="/en/topic/mansion_worlds">mansion worlds</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p1_10">189:1.10</a></small></sup>  The first act of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> on arising from the tomb was to greet <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a> and instruct him to continue in executive charge of universe affairs under <a href="/en/topic/Immanuel">Immanuel</a>, and then he directed the chief of the Melchizedeks to convey his brotherly greetings to Immanuel.

Said the morontia Jesus: “Having finished my life in the flesh, I would tarry here for a short time in transition form that I may more fully know the life of my ascendant creatures and further reveal the will of my Father in <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_10_4"><a href="#fn_s1_10_4">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_10_2"><a href="#fn_s1_10_2">[5]</a></sup></p>

And he has done all this through power inherent within himself; no personality has rendered him any assistance. He now lives as Jesus of morontia, and as he begins this morontia life, the material body of his flesh lies there undisturbed in the tomb.

And when Peter had come out, John also went in and saw it all for himself, and then they sat down on the stone to ponder the meaning of what they had seen and heard.

But John reasoned that the grave would hardly have been left so orderly if the body had been stolen, and he also raised the question as to how the bandages happened to be left behind, and so apparently intact. And again they both went back into the tomb more closely to examine the grave cloths. As they came out of the tomb the second time, they found <a href="/en/topic/Mary_Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a> returned and weeping before the entrance. Mary had gone to the apostles believing that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had risen from the grave, but when they all refused to believe her report, she became downcast and despairing.
