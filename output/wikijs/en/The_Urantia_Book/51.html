<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p0_1">51:0.1</a></small></sup>  DURING the dispensation of a Planetary Prince, primitive man reaches the limit of natural evolutionary development, and this biologic attainment signals the System Sovereign to dispatch to such a world the second order of sonship, the biologic uplifters. These Sons, for there are two of them—the Material Son and Daughter—are usually known on a planet as <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a>. The original Material Son of <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> is <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(village)">Adam</a>, and those who go to the system worlds as biologic uplifters always carry the name of this first and original Son of their unique order.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_1_10"><a href="#fn_a0_1_10">[1]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_1_2"><a href="#fn_s0_1_2">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s0_1_4"><a href="#fn_s0_1_4">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s0_1_1"><a href="#fn_s0_1_1">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s0_1_7"><a href="#fn_s0_1_7">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p0_2">51:0.2</a></small></sup>  These Sons are the material gift of the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> to the inhabited worlds. Together with the Planetary Prince, they remain on their planet of assignment throughout the evolutionary course of such a sphere. Such an adventure on a world having a Planetary Prince is not much of a hazard, but on an apostate planet, a realm without a spiritual ruler and deprived of interplanetary communication, such a mission is fraught with grave danger.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p0_3">51:0.3</a></small></sup>  Although you cannot hope to know all about the work of these Sons on all the worlds of <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> and other systems, other papers depict more fully the life and experiences of the interesting pair, <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a>, who came from the corps of the biologic uplifters of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> to upstep the <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> races. While there was a miscarriage of the ideal plans for improving your native races, still, <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(village)">Adam</a>’s mission was not in vain; Urantia has profited immeasurably from the gift of <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(original_of_Satania)">Adam</a> and Eve, and among their fellows and in the councils on high their work is not reckoned as a total loss.</p>

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p1_1">51:1.1</a></small></sup>  The material or sex Sons and Daughters are the offspring of the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a>; the Universe Mother Spirit does not participate in the production of these beings who are destined to function as physical uplifters on the evolutionary worlds.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_1_3"><a href="#fn_s1_1_3">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_1_5"><a href="#fn_s1_1_5">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p1_2">51:1.2</a></small></sup>  The material order of sonship is not uniform throughout the local universe. The Creator Son produces only one pair of these beings in each local system; these original pairs are diverse in nature, being attuned to the life pattern of their respective systems. This is a necessary provision since otherwise the reproductive potential of the Adams would be nonfunctional with that of the evolving mortal beings of the worlds of any one particular system. The <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> who came to <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> were descended from the original <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> pair of <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_2_9"><a href="#fn_s1_2_9">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p1_3">51:1.3</a></small></sup>  Material Sons vary in height from eight to ten feet, and their bodies glow with the brilliance of radiant <a href="/en/topic/light">light</a> of a violet hue. While material blood circulates through their material bodies, they are also surcharged with divine energy and saturated with celestial light. These Material Sons (the Adams) and <a href="/en/topic/Material_Daughters">Material Daughters</a> (the Eves) are equal to each other, differing only in reproductive nature and in certain chemical endowments. They are equal but differential, male and female—hence complemental—and are designed to serve on almost all assignments in pairs.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_3_5"><a href="#fn_a1_3_5">[2]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_3_5"><a href="#fn_s1_3_5">[6]</a></sup></p>

Should they fail on some mission of assignment or even consciously and deliberately rebel, this order of Sons becomes isolated, cut off from connection with the universe source of light and life. Thereupon they become practically material beings, destined to take the course of material life on the world of their assignment and compelled to look to the universe magistrates for adjudication. Material death will eventually terminate the planetary career of such an unfortunate and unwise Material Son or Daughter.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_4_9"><a href="#fn_s1_4_9">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_4_0"><a href="#fn_s1_4_0">[8]</a></sup></p>

This original couple cannot transmit unconditioned immortality to their procreated sons and daughters. Their progeny are dependent for continuing life on unbroken intellectual synchrony with the mind-gravity circuit of the Spirit. Since the inception of the system of <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a>, thirteen <a href="/en/topic/Planetary_Adams">Planetary Adams</a> have been lost in rebellion and default and 681,204 in the subordinate positions of trust.

These unique and wonderfully useful beings are the connecting links between the spiritual and physical worlds. They are concentrated on the system headquarters, where they reproduce and carry on as material citizens of the realm, and whence they are dispatched to the evolutionary worlds.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_6_3"><a href="#fn_s1_6_3">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_6_5"><a href="#fn_s1_6_5">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p1_7">51:1.7</a></small></sup>  Unlike the other created Sons of planetary service, the material order of sonship is not, by nature, invisible to material creatures like the inhabitants of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. These <a href="/en/topic/Sons_of_God">Sons of God</a> can be seen, understood, and can, in turn, actually mingle with the creatures of time, could even procreate with them, though this role of biologic upliftment usually falls to the progeny of the <a href="/en/topic/Planetary_Adams">Planetary Adams</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p1_8">51:1.8</a></small></sup>  On <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> the loyal children of any <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> are immortal, but the offspring of a Material Son and Daughter procreated subsequent to their arrival on an evolutionary planet are not thus immune to natural death. There occurs a change in the life-transmitting mechanism when these Sons are rematerialized for reproductive function on an evolutionary world. The <a href="/en/topic/Life_Carriers">Life Carriers</a> designedly deprive the Planetary Adams and Eves of the power of begetting undying sons and daughters.

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p2_1">51:2.1</a></small></sup>  Upon receipt of the news that another inhabited world has attained the height of physical evolution, the System Sovereign convenes the corps of <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a> and Daughters on the system capital; and following the discussion of the needs of such an evolutionary world, two of the volunteering group—an <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and an <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> of the senior corps of Material Sons—are selected to undertake the adventure, to submit to the deep sleep preparatory to being enseraphimed and transported from their home of associated service to the new realm of new opportunities and new dangers.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p2_2">51:2.2</a></small></sup>  Adams and Eves are semimaterial creatures and, as such, are not transportable by <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a>. They must undergo dematerialization on the system capital before they can be enseraphimed for transport to the world of assignment. The <a href="/en/topic/transport_seraphim">transport seraphim</a> are able to effect such changes in the Material Sons and in other semimaterial beings as enable them to be enseraphimed and thus to be transported through space from one world or system to another. About three days of standard time are consumed in this transport preparation, and it requires the co-operation of a Life Carrier to restore such a dematerialized creature to normal existence upon arrival at the end of the seraphic-transport journey.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p2_3">51:2.3</a></small></sup>  While there is this dematerializing technique for preparing the Adams for transit from <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> to the evolutionary worlds, there is no equivalent method for taking them away from such worlds unless the entire planet is to be emptied, in which event emergency installation of the <a href="/en/topic/dematerialization">dematerialization</a> technique is made for the entire salvable population. If some physical <a href="/en/topic/disaster">catastrophe</a> should doom the planetary residence of an evolving race, the Melchizedeks and the <a href="/en/topic/Life_Carriers">Life Carriers</a> would install the technique of dematerialization for all survivors, and by seraphic transport these beings would be carried away to the new world prepared for their continuing existence. The <a href="/en/topic/evolution">evolution</a> of a human race, once initiated on a world of space, must proceed quite independently of the physical survival of that planet, but during the evolutionary ages it is not otherwise intended that a Planetary <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> or <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> shall leave their chosen world.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_3_8"><a href="#fn_a2_3_8">[3]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_3_10"><a href="#fn_s2_3_10">[9]</a></sup></p>

This entire process takes ten to twenty-eight days of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> time. The unconsciousness of the seraphic slumber continues throughout this entire period of reconstruction. When the reassembly of the physical organism is completed, these <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a> and Daughters stand in their new homes and on their new worlds to all intents and purposes just as they were before submitting to the dematerializing process on Jerusem.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_4_7"><a href="#fn_s2_4_7">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p3_1">51:3.1</a></small></sup>  On the inhabited worlds the <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a> and Daughters construct their own <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a> homes, soon being assisted by their own children. Usually the site of the garden has been selected by the Planetary Prince, and his <a href="/en/topic/corporeal_staffs_of_Planetary_Princes">corporeal staff</a> do much of the preliminary work of preparation with the help of many of the higher types of native races.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p3_2">51:3.2</a></small></sup>  These <a href="/en/topic/Gardens_of_Eden">Gardens of Eden</a> are so named in honor of <a href="/en/topic/Edentia">Edentia</a>, the constellation capital, and because they are patterned after the botanic grandeur of the headquarters world of the <a href="/en/topic/Most_High">Most High</a> Fathers<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. Such garden homes are usually located in a secluded section and in a near-tropic zone. They are wonderful creations on an average world. You can <a href="/en/topic/Roman_magistrate_in_Rome">judge</a> nothing of these beautiful centers of culture by the fragmentary account of the aborted development of such an undertaking on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p3_3">51:3.3</a></small></sup>  A Planetary <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> are, in potential, the full gift of physical grace to the mortal races. The chief business of such an imported pair is to multiply and to uplift the children of time. But there is no immediate interbreeding between the people of the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a> and those of the world; for many generations <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(village)">Adam</a> and Eve remain biologically segregated from the evolutionary <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> while they build up a strong race of their order. This is the origin of the <a href="/en/topic/Adamites">violet race</a> on the inhabited worlds.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_3_2"><a href="#fn_a3_3_2">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p3_4">51:3.4</a></small></sup>  The plans for race upstepping are prepared by the Planetary Prince and his staff and are executed by Adam and Eve. And this was where your Material Son and his companion were placed at great disadvantage when they arrived on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia">Caligastia</a> offered crafty and effective opposition to the Adamic mission; and notwithstanding that the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_receivers">Melchizedek receivers</a> of Urantia had duly warned both Adam and Eve concerning the planetary dangers inherent in the presence of the rebellious Planetary Prince, this archrebel, by a wily stratagem, outmaneuvered the Edenic pair and entrapped them into a violation of the covenant of their trusteeship as the visible rulers of your world. The traitorous Planetary Prince did succeed in compromising your Adam and Eve, but he failed in his effort to involve them in the <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">Lucifer rebellion</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p3_5">51:3.5</a></small></sup>  The fifth order of <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a>, the planetary helpers, are attached to the Adamic mission, always accompanying the <a href="/en/topic/Planetary_Adams">Planetary Adams</a> on their world adventures. The corps of initial assignment is usually about one hundred thousand. When the work of the Urantia <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> was prematurely launched, when they departed from the ordained plan, it was one of the seraphic Voices of the Garden who remonstrated with them concerning their reprehensible conduct<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>. And your narrative of this occurrence well illustrates the manner in which your planetary traditions have tended to ascribe everything supernatural to the Lord <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. Because of this, Urantians have often become confused concerning the nature of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a> since the words and acts of all his associates and subordinates have been so generally attributed to him. In the case of <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(village)">Adam</a> and Eve, the angel of the Garden was none other than the chief of the planetary helpers then on duty.
