It was in midseason when the Garden was in the height of bloom that they arrived. At high noon and unannounced, the two seraphic transports, accompanied by the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> personnel intrusted with the <a href="/en/topic/transportation">transportation</a> of the biologic uplifters to Urantia, settled slowly to the surface of the revolving planet in the vicinity of the <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a> of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>. All the work of rematerializing the bodies of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> was carried on within the precincts of this newly created shrine. And from the time of their arrival ten days passed before they were re-created in dual human form for presentation as the world’s new rulers. They regained consciousness simultaneously.

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p1_1">74:1.1</a></small></sup>  The Planetary <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> were members of the senior corps of <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a> on <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a>, being jointly number 14,311.

<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p1_2">74:1.2</a></small></sup>  At the time Adam was chosen to come to Urantia, he was employed, with his mate, in the trial-and-testing physical laboratories of Jerusem. For more than fifteen thousand years they had been directors of the division of experimental energy as applied to the modification of living forms. Long before this they had been teachers in the citizenship schools for new arrivals on Jerusem. And all this should be borne in mind in connection with the narration of their subsequent conduct on Urantia.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p1_3">74:1.3</a></small></sup>  When the proclamation was issued calling for volunteers for the mission of Adamic adventure on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>, the entire senior corps of <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a> and Daughters volunteered. The <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> examiners, with the approval of <a href="/en/topic/Lanaforge">Lanaforge</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Most_Highs">Most Highs</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Edentia">Edentia</a>, finally selected the <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> who subsequently came to function as the biologic uplifters of Urantia.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p1_4">74:1.4</a></small></sup>  Adam and Eve had remained loyal to <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a> during the <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">Lucifer rebellion</a>; nevertheless, the pair were called before the System Sovereign and his entire cabinet for examination and instruction. The details of Urantia affairs were fully presented; they were exhaustively instructed as to the plans to be pursued in accepting the responsibilities of rulership on such a strife-torn world. They were put under joint <a href="/en/topic/oaths">oaths</a> of allegiance to the Most Highs of Edentia and to <a href="/en/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a>.

And they were all present in the beautiful <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a> of the <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a> attendant upon the farewell exercises associated with <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> ceremonies of the bestowal acceptance. These children accompanied their parents to the <a href="/en/topic/dematerialization">dematerialization</a> headquarters of their order and were the last to bid them farewell and divine speed as they fell asleep in the personality lapse of consciousness which precedes the preparation for seraphic transport. The children spent some time together at the family rendezvous rejoicing that their parents were soon to become the visible heads, in reality the sole rulers, of planet <a href="/en/topic/606_of_Satania">606</a> in the system of Satania.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_5_13"><a href="#fn_a1_5_13">[7]</a></sup></p>

These two heroes of the <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia">Caligastia</a> secession were <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> to welcome them in their new <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a> home.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_3"><a href="#fn_s2_1_3">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p2_2">74:2.2</a></small></sup>  The tongue of Eden was an Andonic dialect as spoken by Amadon. Van and Amadon had markedly improved this <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a> by creating a new alphabet of twenty-four letters, and they had hoped to see it become the tongue of Urantia as the Edenic culture would spread throughout the world. Adam and Eve had fully mastered this human dialect before they departed from Jerusem so that this son of <a href="/en/topic/Andon_and_Fonta">Andon</a> heard the exalted ruler of his world address him in his own tongue.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p2_3">74:2.3</a></small></sup>  And on that day there was great excitement and joy throughout Eden as the runners went in great haste to the rendezvous of the <a href="/en/topic/carrier_pigeons">carrier pigeons</a> assembled from near and far, shouting: “Let loose the birds; let them carry the word that the promised Son has come.” Hundreds of believer settlements had faithfully, year after year, kept up the supply of these home-reared pigeons for just such an occasion.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_3_3"><a href="#fn_s2_3_3">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_3_5"><a href="#fn_s2_3_5">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p2_4">74:2.4</a></small></sup>  As the news of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a>’s arrival spread abroad, thousands of the near-by tribesmen accepted the teachings of <a href="/en/topic/Van_(lake)">Van</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Amadon">Amadon</a>, while for months and months pilgrims continued to pour into Eden to welcome <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(village)">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> and to do homage to their unseen Father.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p2_5">74:2.5</a></small></sup>  Soon after their awakening, Adam and Eve were escorted to the formal reception on the great mound to the north of the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>. This natural hill had been enlarged and made ready for the installation of the world’s new rulers. Here, at noon, the <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> reception committee welcomed this Son and Daughter of the system of <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a>. Amadon was chairman of this committee, which consisted of twelve members embracing a representative of each of the six Sangik <a href="/en/topic/races">races</a>; the acting chief of the <a href="/en/topic/midwayers">midwayers</a>; <a href="/en/topic/Annan">Annan</a>, a loyal daughter and spokesman for the <a href="/en/topic/Nodites">Nodites</a>; <a href="/en/topic/Noah_(Garden_dweller)">Noah</a>, the son of the architect and builder of the Garden and executive of his deceased father’s plans; and the two resident <a href="/en/topic/Life_Carriers">Life Carriers</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_5_14"><a href="#fn_a2_5_14">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p2_6">74:2.6</a></small></sup>  The next act was the delivery of the charge of planetary custody to <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> by the senior <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a>, chief of the council of receivership on Urantia.

<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p2_7">74:2.7</a></small></sup>  And Adam and Eve were invested with kingly robes on this occasion, the time of their formal induction into world rulership. Not all of the arts of <a href="/en/topic/Dalamatia">Dalamatia</a> had been lost to the world; <a href="/en/topic/weaving">weaving</a> was still practiced in the days of Eden.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p2_8">74:2.8</a></small></sup>  Then was heard the <a href="/en/topic/archangels">archangels</a>’ proclamation, and the broadcast voice of <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a> decreed the second judgment roll call of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> and the resurrection of the sleeping survivors of the second dispensation of grace and mercy on <a href="/en/topic/606_of_Satania">606 of Satania</a>. The dispensation of the Prince has passed; the age of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a>, the third planetary epoch, opens amidst scenes of simple grandeur; and the new rulers of Urantia start their reign under seemingly favorable conditions, notwithstanding the world-wide confusion occasioned by lack of the co-operation of their predecessor in authority on the planet.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_8_0"><a href="#fn_a2_8_0">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_8_1"><a href="#fn_a2_8_1">[11]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_8_2"><a href="#fn_s2_8_2">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_8_3"><a href="#fn_s2_8_3">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. ADAM AND EVE LEARN ABOUT THE PLANET </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p3_1">74:3.1</a></small></sup>  And now, after their formal installation, <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> became painfully aware of their planetary <a href="/en/topic/isolation">isolation</a>. Silent were the familiar <a href="/en/topic/broadcasts_(celestial)">broadcasts</a>, and absent were all the circuits of extraplanetary communication. Their <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> fellows had gone to worlds running along smoothly with a well-established Planetary Prince and an experienced staff ready to receive them and competent to co-operate with them during their early experience on such worlds. But on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> rebellion had changed everything. Here the Planetary Prince was very much present, and though shorn of most of his power to work evil, he was still able to make the task of <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(village)">Adam</a> and Eve difficult and to some extent hazardous. It was a serious and disillusioned Son and Daughter of Jerusem who walked that night through the Garden under the shining of the full moon, discussing plans for the next day.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p3_2">74:3.2</a></small></sup>  Thus ended <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> day of Adam and Eve on isolated Urantia, the confused planet of the <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia">Caligastia</a> betrayal; and they walked and talked far into the night, their first night on earth—and it was so lonely.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p3_3">74:3.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a>’s second day on earth was spent in session with the planetary receivers and the advisory council. From the Melchizedeks, and their associates, <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(village)">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> learned more about the details of the Caligastia rebellion and the result of that upheaval upon the world’s progress. And it was, on the whole, a disheartening <a href="/en/topic/Genesis,_Book_of">story</a>, this long recital of the mismanagement of world affairs. They learned all the facts regarding the utter collapse of the Caligastia scheme for accelerating the process of social evolution. They also arrived at a full realization of the folly of attempting to achieve planetary advancement independently of the <a href="/en/topic/divine_plan">divine plan</a> of progression. And thus ended a sad but enlightening day—their second on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p3_4">74:3.4</a></small></sup>  The third day was devoted to an inspection of the Garden. From the large <a href="/en/topic/passenger_birds">passenger birds</a>—the fandors—Adam and Eve looked down upon the vast stretches of the Garden while being carried through the air over this, the most beautiful spot on earth. This day of inspection ended with an enormous banquet in honor of all who had labored to create this <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a> of Edenic beauty and grandeur. And again, late into the night of their third day, the Son and his mate walked in the Garden and talked about the immensity of their problems.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_4_6"><a href="#fn_a3_4_6">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_4_9"><a href="#fn_a3_4_9">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p3_5">74:3.5</a></small></sup>  On the fourth day <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> addressed the Garden assembly. From the inaugural mount they spoke to the people concerning their plans for the rehabilitation of the world and outlined the methods whereby they would seek to redeem the social culture of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> from the low levels to which it had fallen as a result of sin and rebellion. This was a great day, and it closed with a feast for the council of men and <a href="/en/topic/women">women</a> who had been selected to assume responsibilities in the new administration of world affairs. Take note! women as well as men were in this group, and that was <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> time such a thing had occurred on earth since the days of <a href="/en/topic/Dalamatia">Dalamatia</a>. It was an astounding innovation to behold Eve, a woman, sharing the honors and responsibilities of world affairs with a man. And thus ended the fourth day on earth.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_5_10"><a href="#fn_a3_5_10">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p3_6">74:3.6</a></small></sup>  The fifth day was occupied with the organization of the temporary government, the administration which was to function until the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_receivers">Melchizedek receivers</a> should leave Urantia.</p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p3_7">74:3.7</a></small></sup>  The sixth day was devoted to an inspection of the numerous types of men and animals. Along the walls eastward in Eden, <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> were escorted all day, viewing the animal life of the planet and arriving at a better understanding as to what must be done to bring order out of the confusion of a world inhabited by such a variety of living creatures.</p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p3_8">74:3.8</a></small></sup>  It greatly surprised those who accompanied Adam on this trip to observe how fully he understood the nature and function of the thousands upon thousands of animals shown him<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>. The instant he glanced at an animal, he would indicate its nature and behavior. Adam could give names descriptive of the origin, nature, and function of all material creatures on sight. Those who conducted him on this tour of inspection did not know that the world’s new ruler was one of the most expert anatomists of all <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a>; and Eve was equally proficient. Adam amazed his associates by describing hosts of living things too small to be seen by human eyes.</p>
<p id="p3_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p3_9">74:3.9</a></small></sup>  When the sixth day of their sojourn on earth was over, <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> rested for <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> time in their new home in “the east of Eden<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>.” The first six days of the <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> adventure had been very busy, and they looked forward with great pleasure to an entire day of freedom from all activities.</p>
<p id="p3_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p3_10">74:3.10</a></small></sup>  But circumstances dictated otherwise. The experience of the day just past in which Adam had so intelligently and so exhaustively discussed the animal life of Urantia, together with his masterly inaugural address and his charming manner, had so won the hearts and overcome the intellects of the Garden dwellers that they were not only wholeheartedly disposed to accept the newly arrived Son and Daughter of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> as rulers, but the majority were about ready to fall down and worship them as gods.</p>
<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 4. THE FIRST UPHEAVAL </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p4_1">74:4.1</a></small></sup>  That night, the night following the sixth day, while <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> slumbered, strange things were transpiring in the vicinity of the Father’s <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> in the central sector of Eden. There, under the rays of the mellow moon, hundreds of enthusiastic and excited men and women listened for hours to the impassioned pleas of their leaders. They meant well, but they simply could not understand the simplicity of the fraternal and democratic manner of their new rulers. And long before daybreak the new and temporary administrators of world affairs reached a virtually unanimous conclusion that <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(village)">Adam</a> and his mate were altogether too modest and unassuming. They decided that Divinity had descended to earth in bodily form, that <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(original_of_Satania)">Adam</a> and Eve were in reality gods or else so near such an estate as to be worthy of reverent worship.</p>

Adam had several times requested his advisers to remain on earth with him, but always were these petitions denied. The time had come when the <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a> must assume full responsibility for the conduct of world affairs.

Pursuant to the advice of the Melchizedeks, he began to foster the arts of manufacture with the idea of developing trade relations with the outside world. When Eden was disrupted, there were over one hundred primitive manufacturing plants in operation, and extensive trade relations with the near-by tribes had been established.</p>

Aside from the cream of the earth’s population, assembled in the Garden, only a few groups, here and there, were at all ready for the reception of the Adamic culture.</p>

He was still present on earth and able, at least to some extent, to resist all of Adam’s plans for the rehabilitation of human society.

<p id="p6_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p6_1">74:6.1</a></small></sup>  The Adamic family grounds embraced a little over five square miles.

Eve was the mother of five children before the Melchizedeks left—three sons and two daughters. The next two were twins. She bore sixty-three children, thirty-two daughters and thirty-one sons, before the default. When <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(village)">Adam</a> and Eve left the Garden, their family consisted of four generations numbering 1,647 pure-line descendants. They had forty-two children after leaving the Garden besides the two offspring of joint parentage with the mortal stock of earth.

<p id="p6_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p6_3">74:6.3</a></small></sup>  The Adamic children did not take milk from animals when they ceased to nurse the mother’s breast at one year of age. Eve had access to the milk of a great variety of nuts and to the juices of many fruits, and knowing full well the chemistry and energy of these foods, she suitably combined them for the nourishment of her children until the appearance of teeth.</p>
<p id="p6_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p6_4">74:6.4</a></small></sup>  While cooking was universally employed outside of the immediate Adamic sector of Eden, there was no cooking in <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a>’s household. They found their foods—fruits, nuts, and cereals—ready prepared as they ripened. They ate once a day, shortly after noontime. <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(village)">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> also imbibed “light and energy” direct from certain space emanations in conjunction with the ministry of the tree of life.</p>

The origin of the traditional <a href="/en/topic/halo">halo</a> encircling the heads of supposed pious and holy men dates back to the days of Adam and Eve. Since the light emanations of their bodies were so largely obscured by clothing, only the radiating glow from their heads was discernible. The descendants of <a href="/en/topic/Adamson">Adamson</a> always thus portrayed their concept of individuals believed to be extraordinary in spiritual development.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s6_5_2"><a href="#fn_s6_5_2">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s6_5_3"><a href="#fn_s6_5_3">[2]</a></sup></p>

This thought exchange was effected by means of the delicate gas chambers located in close proximity to their brain structures. By this mechanism they could send and receive thought oscillations. But this power was instantly suspended upon the mind’s surrender to the discord and <a href="/en/topic/Reformation">disruption</a> of evil.</p>
<p id="p6_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p6_7">74:6.7</a></small></sup>  The Adamic children attended their own schools until they were sixteen, the younger being taught by the elder.

Nevertheless, the more intelligent of the races of earth looked forward eagerly to the time when they would be permitted to intermarry with the superior children of the <a href="/en/topic/Adamites">violet race</a>. And what a different world <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> would have become if this great plan of uplifting the races had been carried out!

<p id="p8_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p8_1">74:8.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Genesis,_Book_of">story</a> of the <a href="/en/topic/creation">creation</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> in six days was based on the tradition that <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> had spent just six days in their initial survey of the Garden<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b11"><a href="#fn_b11">[11]</a></sup>. This circumstance lent almost sacred sanction to the <a href="/en/topic/time">time</a> period of the <a href="/en/topic/week">week</a>, which had been originally introduced by the Dalamatians<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b12"><a href="#fn_b12">[12]</a></sup>. <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(village)">Adam</a>’s spending six days inspecting the Garden and formulating preliminary plans for organization was not prearranged; it was worked out from day to day. The choosing of the seventh day for worship was wholly incidental to the facts herewith narrated.</p>
<p id="p8_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p8_2">74:8.2</a></small></sup>  The legend of the making of the world in six days was an afterthought, in fact, more than thirty thousand years afterwards. One feature of the narrative, the sudden appearance of the sun and moon, may have taken origin in the traditions of the onetime sudden emergence of the world from a dense space cloud of minute matter which had long obscured both sun and moon<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b13"><a href="#fn_b13">[13]</a></sup>.</p>

<p id="p8_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p8_4">74:8.4</a></small></sup>  The majority of the world’s peoples have been influenced by the tradition that Adam and Eve had physical forms created for them upon their arrival on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b15"><a href="#fn_b15">[15]</a></sup>. The belief in man’s having been created from <a href="/en/topic/clay">clay</a> was well-nigh universal in the Eastern Hemisphere; this tradition can be traced from the Philippine Islands around the world to <a href="/en/topic/Africa">Africa</a>. And many groups accepted this story of man’s clay origin by some form of special creation in the place of the earlier beliefs in progressive creation—<a href="/en/topic/evolution">evolution</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s8_4_4"><a href="#fn_s8_4_4">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p8_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p8_5">74:8.5</a></small></sup>  Away from the influences of <a href="/en/topic/Dalamatia">Dalamatia</a> and Eden, mankind tended toward the belief in the gradual ascent of the human race. The fact of evolution is not a modern discovery; the ancients understood the slow and evolutionary character of human progress. The early <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a> had clear ideas of this despite their proximity to <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>. Although the various races of earth became sadly mixed up in their notions of evolution, nevertheless, many of the primitive tribes believed and taught that they were the descendants of various <a href="/en/topic/animals">animals</a>. Primitive peoples made a practice of selecting for their “<a href="/en/topic/totems">totems</a>” the animals of their supposed ancestry. Certain North American Indian tribes believed they originated from <a href="/en/topic/beavers">beavers</a> and <a href="/en/topic/coyotes">coyotes</a>. Certain African tribes teach that they are descended from the hyena, a <a href="/en/topic/Malaysia">Malay</a> tribe from the lemur, a <a href="/en/topic/New_Guinea">New Guinea</a> group from the parrot.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s8_5_0"><a href="#fn_s8_5_0">[6]</a></sup></p>

They held to an aristocratic origin for the race which was incompatible with even the doctrine of creation out of clay.</p>
<p id="p8_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p8_7">74:8.7</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Old_Testament">Old Testament</a> account of creation dates from long after the time of <a href="/en/topic/Moses">Moses</a>; he never taught the <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a> such a distorted story. But he did present a simple and condensed narrative of creation to the <a href="/en/topic/Israelites">Israelites</a>, hoping thereby to augment his appeal to worship the Creator, the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>, whom he called the <a href="/en/topic/Lord_God_of_Israel">Lord God of Israel</a>.</p>
<p id="p8_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p8_8">74:8.8</a></small></sup>  In his early teachings, Moses very wisely did not attempt to go back of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a>’s time, and since Moses was the supreme teacher of the Hebrews, the stories of <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(village)">Adam</a> became intimately associated with those of <a href="/en/topic/creation">creation</a>. That the earlier traditions recognized pre-Adamic civilization is clearly shown by the fact that later editors, intending to eradicate all reference to human affairs before <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(original_of_Satania)">Adam</a>’s time, neglected to remove the telltale reference to <a href="/en/topic/Cain">Cain</a>’s emigration to the “land of <a href="/en/topic/Nod_(land_of)">Nod</a>,” where he took himself a wife<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b16"><a href="#fn_b16">[16]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p8_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p8_9">74:8.9</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a> had no written <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a> in general usage for a long time after they reached <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a>. They learned the use of an alphabet from the neighboring <a href="/en/topic/Philistines">Philistines</a>, who were political refugees from the higher civilization of <a href="/en/topic/Crete">Crete</a>. The Hebrews did little writing until about 900 B.C., and having no written language until such a late date, they had several different stories of creation in circulation, but after the <a href="/en/topic/Babylonian_captivity">Babylonian captivity</a> they inclined more toward accepting a modified Mesopotamian version.</p>
<p id="p8_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p8_10">74:8.10</a></small></sup>  Jewish tradition became crystallized about <a href="/en/topic/Moses">Moses</a>, and because he endeavored to trace the lineage of <a href="/en/topic/Abraham_(Old_Testament)">Abraham</a> back to <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> assumed that <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(village)">Adam</a> was <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> of all mankind<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b17"><a href="#fn_b17">[17]</a></sup>. <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a> was the creator, and since <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(original_of_Satania)">Adam</a> was supposed to be the first man, he must have made the world just prior to making Adam. And then the tradition of Adam’s six days got woven into the <a href="/en/topic/Genesis,_Book_of">story</a>, with the result that almost a thousand years after Moses’ sojourn on earth the tradition of <a href="/en/topic/creation">creation</a> in six days was written out and subsequently credited to him.</p>
<p id="p8_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p8_11">74:8.11</a></small></sup>  When the Jewish priests returned to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, they had already completed the writing of their narrative of the beginning of things. Soon they made claims that this recital was a recently discovered story of creation written by Moses<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b18"><a href="#fn_b18">[18]</a></sup>. But the contemporary <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a> of around 500 B.C. did not consider these writings to be divine revelations; they looked upon them much as later peoples regard mythological narratives.</p>
<p id="p8_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p8_12">74:8.12</a></small></sup>  This spurious document, reputed to be the teachings of <a href="/en/topic/Moses">Moses</a>, was brought to the attention of <a href="/en/topic/Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> king of <a href="/en/topic/Egypt">Egypt</a>, who had it translated into Greek by a commission of seventy scholars for his new library at <a href="/en/topic/Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. And so this account found its place among those writings which subsequently became a part of the later collections of the “sacred scriptures” of the Hebrew and Christian religions. And through identification with these theological systems, such concepts for a long time profoundly influenced the philosophy of many Occidental peoples.</p>
<p id="p8_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p8_13">74:8.13</a></small></sup>  The Christian teachers perpetuated the belief in the fiat <a href="/en/topic/creation">creation</a> of the human race, and all this led directly to the formation of the hypothesis of a onetime <a href="/en/topic/golden_age">golden age</a> of utopian bliss and the theory of the fall of man or superman which accounted for the nonutopian condition of society. These outlooks on life and man’s place in the universe were at best discouraging since they were predicated upon a belief in retrogression rather than progression, as well as implying a vengeful <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>, who had vented wrath upon the human race in retribution for the errors of certain onetime planetary administrators.</p>
