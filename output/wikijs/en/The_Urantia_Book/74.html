It was in midseason when the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">Garden</a> was in the height of bloom that they arrived.

All the work of <a href="/en/topic/dematerialization">rematerializing</a> the bodies of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> was carried on within the precincts of this newly created shrine. And from the time of their arrival ten days passed before they were re-created in dual human form for presentation as the world’s new rulers. They regained consciousness simultaneously.

For more than fifteen thousand years they had been directors of the division of experimental energy as applied to the modification of living forms. Long before this they had been teachers in the citizenship schools for new arrivals on Jerusem. And all this should be borne in mind in connection with the narration of their subsequent conduct on Urantia.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p1_3">74:1.3</a></small></sup>  When the proclamation was issued calling for volunteers for the mission of Adamic adventure on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>, the entire senior corps of <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a> and Daughters volunteered.

The details of Urantia affairs were fully presented; they were exhaustively instructed as to the plans to be pursued in accepting the responsibilities of rulership on such a strife-torn world.

These two heroes of the <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia">Caligastia</a> secession were <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> to welcome them in their new <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a> home.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_4"><a href="#fn_s2_1_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p2_2">74:2.2</a></small></sup>  The tongue of Eden was an <a href="/en/topic/Andonites">Andonic</a> dialect as spoken by Amadon. Van and Amadon had markedly improved this <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a> by creating a new alphabet of twenty-four letters, and they had hoped to see it become the tongue of Urantia as the Edenic culture would spread throughout the world. Adam and Eve had fully mastered this human dialect before they departed from Jerusem so that this son of <a href="/en/topic/Andon_and_Fonta">Andon</a> heard the exalted ruler of his world address him in his own tongue.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p2_3">74:2.3</a></small></sup>  And on that day there was great excitement and joy throughout Eden as the runners went in great haste to the rendezvous of the <a href="/en/topic/carrier_pigeons">carrier pigeons</a> assembled from near and far, shouting: “Let loose the birds; let them carry the word that the promised Son has come.” Hundreds of believer settlements had faithfully, year after year, kept up the supply of these home-reared pigeons for just such an occasion.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_3_13"><a href="#fn_a2_3_13">[21]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_3_4"><a href="#fn_s2_3_4">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_3_6"><a href="#fn_s2_3_6">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p2_4">74:2.4</a></small></sup>  As the news of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a>’s arrival spread abroad, thousands of the near-by tribesmen accepted the teachings of <a href="/en/topic/Van_(lake)">Van</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Amadon">Amadon</a>, while for months and months <a href="/en/topic/Havona_pilgrims">pilgrims</a> continued to pour into Eden to welcome <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(village)">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> and to do homage to their unseen Father.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p2_5">74:2.5</a></small></sup>  Soon after their awakening, Adam and Eve were escorted to the formal reception on the great mound to the north of the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>. This natural hill had been enlarged and made ready for the installation of the world’s new rulers. Here, at noon, the <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> reception committee welcomed this Son and Daughter of the system of <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a>.

<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p2_7">74:2.7</a></small></sup>  And Adam and Eve were invested with kingly robes on this occasion, the time of their formal induction into world rulership.

<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p2_8">74:2.8</a></small></sup>  Then was heard the <a href="/en/topic/archangels">archangels</a>’ proclamation, and the broadcast voice of <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a> decreed the second judgment roll call of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> and the resurrection of the sleeping survivors of the second dispensation of grace and mercy on <a href="/en/topic/606_of_Satania">606 of Satania</a>.

<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p3_1">74:3.1</a></small></sup>  And now, after their formal installation, <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> became painfully aware of their planetary <a href="/en/topic/isolation">isolation</a>. Silent were the familiar <a href="/en/topic/broadcasts_(celestial)">broadcasts</a>, and absent were all the circuits of extraplanetary communication. Their <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> fellows had gone to <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_worlds">worlds</a> running along smoothly with a well-established Planetary Prince and an experienced <a href="/en/topic/corporeal_staffs_of_Planetary_Princes">staff</a> ready to receive them and competent to co-operate with them during their early experience on such worlds. But on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">rebellion</a> had changed everything. Here the Planetary Prince was very much present, and though shorn of most of his power to work evil, he was still able to make the task of <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(village)">Adam</a> and Eve difficult and to some extent hazardous. It was a serious and disillusioned Son and Daughter of Jerusem who walked that night through the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">Garden</a> under the shining of the full moon, discussing plans for the next day.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p3_2">74:3.2</a></small></sup>  Thus ended <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> day of Adam and Eve on isolated Urantia, the confused planet of the <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia">Caligastia</a> betrayal; and they walked and talked far into the night, their first night on earth—and it was so lonely.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p3_3">74:3.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a>’s second day on earth was spent in session with the planetary receivers and the advisory council. From the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_Sons">Melchizedeks</a>, and their associates, <a href="/en/topic/Adam_(village)">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a> learned more about the details of the Caligastia <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">rebellion</a> and the result of that upheaval upon the world’s progress. And it was, on the whole, a disheartening story, this long recital of the mismanagement of world affairs. They learned all the facts regarding the utter collapse of the Caligastia scheme for accelerating the process of social evolution. They also arrived at a full realization of the folly of attempting to achieve planetary advancement independently of the <a href="/en/topic/divine_plan">divine plan</a> of progression.

<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p3_4">74:3.4</a></small></sup>  The third day was devoted to an inspection of the Garden.
