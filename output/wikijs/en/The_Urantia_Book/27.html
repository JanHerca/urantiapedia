<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p1_1">27:1.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/instigators_of_rest">instigators of rest</a> are the inspectors of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> who go forth from the central Isle to the inner circuit of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a>, there to collaborate with their colleagues, the <a href="/en/topic/complements_of_rest">complements of rest</a> of the secondary order of <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a>. The one essential to the enjoyment of Paradise is <a href="/en/topic/rest">rest</a>, divine rest; and these instigators of rest are the final instructors who make ready the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_pilgrims">pilgrims of time</a> for their introduction to eternity. They begin their work on the final attainment circle of the central universe and continue it when the pilgrim awakes from <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> transition sleep, the slumber which graduates a creature of space into the realm of the eternal.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p1_2">27:1.2</a></small></sup>  Rest is of a sevenfold nature: There is the rest of sleep and of play in the lower life orders, discovery in the higher beings, and worship in the highest type of spirit personality. There is also the normal rest of energy intake, the recharging of beings with physical or with spiritual energy. And then there is the transit sleep, the unconscious slumber when enseraphimed, when in passage from one sphere to another. Entirely different from all of these is the deep sleep of metamorphosis, the transition rest from one stage of being to another, from one life to another, from one state of existence to another, the sleep which ever attends transition from actual universe <i>status</i> in contrast to evolution through various <i>stages</i> of any one status.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_2_17"><a href="#fn_s1_2_17">[4]</a></sup></p>

The instigators and the <a href="/en/topic/complements_of_rest">complements of rest</a> are just as essential to this transcending metamorphosis as are the <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> and associated beings to the mortal creature’s survival of death.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_3_9"><a href="#fn_s1_3_9">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_3_12"><a href="#fn_s1_3_12">[6]</a></sup></p>

And as you there spiritually repersonalize, you will immediately recognize the instigator of rest who welcomes you to the eternal shores as the very primary <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a> who produced the final sleep on the innermost circuit of Havona; and you will recall the last grand stretch of faith as you once again made ready to commend the keeping of your <a href="/en/topic/identity">identity</a> into the hands of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_4_8"><a href="#fn_a1_4_8">[5]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_4_9"><a href="#fn_s1_4_9">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_4_12"><a href="#fn_s1_4_12">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_4_19"><a href="#fn_s1_4_19">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p2_1">27:2.1</a></small></sup>  This is the group designated from time to time by the <a href="/en/topic/chief_supernaphim">chief supernaphim</a>, “the original pattern angel,” to preside over the organization of all three orders of these <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a>—primary, secondary, and tertiary<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>. The <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a>, as a body, are wholly self-governing and self-regulatory except for the functions of their mutual chief, <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> angel of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>, who ever presides over all these spirit personalities.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_23"><a href="#fn_s2_1_23">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p2_2">27:2.2</a></small></sup>  The angels of assignment have much to do with glorified mortal residents of Paradise before they are admitted to the <a href="/en/topic/Corps_of_the_Finality">Corps of the Finality</a>. Study and instruction are not the exclusive occupations of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_arrivals">Paradise arrivals</a>; service also plays its essential part in the prefinaliter educational experiences of Paradise. And I have observed that, when the ascendant <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> have periods of leisure, they evince a predilection to fraternize with the reserve corps of the superaphic <a href="/en/topic/chiefs_of_assignment">chiefs of assignment</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p2_3">27:2.3</a></small></sup>  When you mortal <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascenders</a> attain <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>, your societal relationships involve a great deal more than contact with a host of exalted and divine beings and with a familiar multitude of glorified fellow mortals. You must also fraternize with upwards of three thousand different orders of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Citizens">Paradise Citizens</a>, with the various groups of the <a href="/en/topic/Transcendentalers">Transcendentalers</a>, and with numerous other types of Paradise inhabitants, permanent and transient, who have not been revealed on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. After sustained contact with these mighty intellects of Paradise, it is very restful to visit with the angelic types of mind; they remind the mortals of time of the <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> with whom they have had such long contact and such refreshing association.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_3_20"><a href="#fn_s2_3_20">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p3_1">27:3.1</a></small></sup>  The higher you ascend in the scale of life, the more attention must be paid to universe <a href="/en/topic/ethics">ethics</a>. Ethical awareness is simply the recognition by any individual of the rights inherent in the existence of any and all other individuals. But spiritual ethics far transcends the mortal and even the morontia concept of personal and group relations.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p3_2">27:3.2</a></small></sup>  Ethics has been duly taught and adequately learned by the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_pilgrims">pilgrims of time</a> in their long ascent to the glories of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>. As this inward-ascending career has unfolded from the nativity worlds of space, the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascenders</a> have continued to add group after group to their ever-widening circle of universe associates. Every new group of colleagues met with adds one more level of ethics to be recognized and complied with until, by the time the <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of ascent reach Paradise, they really need someone to provide helpful and friendly counsel regarding ethical interpretations. They do not need to be taught ethics, but they do need to have what they have so laboriously learned properly <i>interpreted</i> to them as they are brought face to face with the extraordinary task of contacting with so much that is new.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p3_3">27:3.3</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/interpreters_of_ethics">interpreters of ethics</a> are of inestimable assistance to the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_arrivals">Paradise arrivals</a> in helping them to adjust to numerous groups of majestic beings during that eventful period extending from the attainment of residential status to formal induction into the <a href="/en/topic/Corps_of_Mortal_Finaliters">Corps of Mortal Finaliters</a>. Many of the numerous types of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Citizens">Paradise Citizens</a> the ascendant pilgrims have already met on the seven circuits of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a>. The glorified mortals have also enjoyed intimate contact with the <a href="/en/topic/creature-trinitized_sons">creature-trinitized sons</a> of the conjoint corps on the inner Havona circuit, where these beings are receiving much of their education. And on the other circuits the ascending pilgrims have met numerous unrevealed residents of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise-Havona_system">Paradise-Havona system</a> who are there pursuing group training in preparation for the unrevealed assignments of the future.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_3_10"><a href="#fn_a3_3_10">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p3_4">27:3.4</a></small></sup>  All these celestial companionships are invariably mutual. As <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortals</a> you not only derive benefit from these successive universe companions and such numerous orders of increasingly divine associates, but you also impart to each of these fraternal beings something from your own personality and experience which forever makes every one of them different and better for having been associated with an ascending mortal from the evolutionary worlds of time and space.</p>

<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p4_1">27:4.1</a></small></sup>  Having already been fully instructed in the <a href="/en/topic/ethics">ethics</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> relationships—neither meaningless formalities nor the dictations of artificial castes but rather the inherent proprieties—the ascendant <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> find it helpful to receive the counsel of the superaphic <a href="/en/topic/directors_of_conduct">directors of conduct</a>, who instruct the new members of Paradise society in the usages of the perfect conduct of the high beings who sojourn on the central Isle of Light and Life.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p4_2">27:4.2</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/harmony">Harmony</a> is the keynote of the central universe, and detectable <a href="/en/topic/order">order</a> prevails on Paradise.

There is a divine technique in the approach to <a href="/en/topic/divinity">Divinity</a>; and the acquirement of this technique must await the pilgrims’ arrival on Paradise. The spirit of it has been imparted on the circles of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a>, but the final touches of the training of the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_pilgrims">pilgrims of time</a> can be applied only after they actually attain the Isle of Light.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_2_7"><a href="#fn_a4_2_7">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_2_15"><a href="#fn_a4_2_15">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_2_30"><a href="#fn_a4_2_30">[10]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_2_0"><a href="#fn_s4_2_0">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s4_2_15"><a href="#fn_s4_2_15">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s4_2_16"><a href="#fn_s4_2_16">[12]</a></sup></p>

But there still is a proper and perfect way of doing things on the eternal Isle, and the <a href="/en/topic/directors_of_conduct">directors of conduct</a> are ever by the side of the “strangers within the gates” to instruct them and so guide their steps as to put them at perfect ease and at the same time to enable the pilgrims to avoid that <a href="/en/topic/confusion">confusion</a> and uncertainty which would otherwise be inevitable<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>.

<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p4_4">27:4.4</a></small></sup>  These directors of conduct really serve as glorified teachers and guides. They are chiefly concerned with instructing the new mortal residents regarding the almost endless array of new situations and unfamiliar usages.

<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p5_2">27:5.2</a></small></sup>  These custodians conduct informal courses of instruction for the residents of the eternal Isle, but their chief function is that of reference and verification.

At the northern extremity of the Isle there are available the living finders of knowledge, who will designate the director of the group holding the information sought, and forthwith will appear the brilliant beings who <i>are</i> the very thing you wish to know.

Worship is the conscious and joyous act of recognizing and acknowledging the truth and fact of the intimate and personal relationships of the Creators with their creatures. The quality of <a href="/en/topic/worship">worship</a> is determined by the depth of creature perception; and as the knowledge of the infinite character of the Gods progresses, the act of worship becomes increasingly all-encompassing until it eventually attains the glory of the highest experiential delight and the most exquisite pleasure known to created beings.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a7_1_15"><a href="#fn_a7_1_15">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_1_0"><a href="#fn_a7_1_0">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_1_4"><a href="#fn_a7_1_4">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_1_9"><a href="#fn_a7_1_9">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_1_11"><a href="#fn_a7_1_11">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_1_12"><a href="#fn_a7_1_12">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_1_14"><a href="#fn_a7_1_14">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_1_17"><a href="#fn_a7_1_17">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_1_22"><a href="#fn_a7_1_22">[21]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_1_27"><a href="#fn_a7_1_27">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_1_28"><a href="#fn_a7_1_28">[23]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_1_31"><a href="#fn_a7_1_31">[24]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s7_1_10"><a href="#fn_s7_1_10">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s7_1_18"><a href="#fn_s7_1_18">[15]</a></sup></p>
