<p id="p6_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p6_1">59:6.1</a></small></sup>  This period marks the end of pivotal evolutionary development in <a href="/en/topic/marine_life">marine life</a> and the opening of the transition period leading to the subsequent ages of land animals.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s6_1_1"><a href="#fn_s6_1_1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s6_1_0"><a href="#fn_s6_1_0">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p6_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p6_2">59:6.2</a></small></sup>  This age was one of great <a href="/en/topic/life">life</a> impoverishment. Thousands of marine species perished, and life was hardly yet established on land. This was a time of biologic tribulation, the age when life nearly vanished from the face of the earth and from the depths of the oceans. Toward the close of the long marine-life era there were more than one hundred thousand species of living things on earth. At the close of this period of transition less than five hundred had survived.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s6_2_2"><a href="#fn_s6_2_2">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p6_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p6_3">59:6.3</a></small></sup>  The peculiarities of this new period were not due so much to the cooling of the earth’s crust or to the long absence of volcanic action as to an unusual combination of commonplace and pre-existing influences—restrictions of the seas and increasing elevation of enormous land masses. The mild marine <a href="/en/topic/climate">climate</a> of former times was disappearing, and the harsher continental type of weather was fast developing.</p>
<p id="p6_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p6_4">59:6.4</a></small></sup>  <i>170,000,000</i> years ago great evolutionary changes and adjustments were taking place over the entire face of the earth. Land was rising all over the world as the ocean beds were sinking. Isolated mountain ridges appeared. The eastern part of <a href="/en/topic/North_America">North America</a> was high above the sea; the west was slowly rising. The continents were covered by great and small salt lakes and numerous inland seas which were connected with the oceans by narrow straits. The strata of this transition period vary in thickness from 1,000 to 7,000 feet.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s6_4_0"><a href="#fn_s6_4_0">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p6_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p6_5">59:6.5</a></small></sup>  The earth’s crust folded extensively during these land elevations. This was a time of continental emergence except for the disappearance of certain <a href="/en/topic/land_bridges">land bridges</a>, including the continents which had so long connected <a href="/en/topic/South_America">South America</a> with <a href="/en/topic/Africa">Africa</a> and North America with <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a6_5_7"><a href="#fn_a6_5_7">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a6_5_9"><a href="#fn_a6_5_9">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a6_5_13"><a href="#fn_a6_5_13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p6_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p6_6">59:6.6</a></small></sup>  Gradually the inland lakes and seas were drying up all over the world. Isolated mountain and regional <a href="/en/topic/glaciers">glaciers</a> began to appear, especially over the Southern Hemisphere, and in many regions the glacial deposit of these local ice formations may be found even among some of the upper and later <a href="/en/topic/coal">coal</a> deposits. Two new climatic factors appeared—glaciation and aridity. Many of the earth’s higher regions had become arid and barren.</p>
<p id="p6_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p6_7">59:6.7</a></small></sup>  Throughout these times of climatic change, great variations also occurred in the land plants. The <i>seed plants</i> first appeared, and they afforded a better food supply for the subsequently increased land-animal life. The <a href="/en/topic/insects">insects</a> underwent a radical change. The <i>resting stages</i> evolved to meet the demands of suspended animation during winter and drought.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s6_7_1"><a href="#fn_s6_7_1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s6_7_0"><a href="#fn_s6_7_0">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p6_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p6_8">59:6.8</a></small></sup>  Among the land animals the <a href="/en/topic/frogs">frogs</a> reached their climax in the preceding age and rapidly declined, but they survived because they could long live even in the drying-up pools and ponds of these far-distant and extremely trying times. During this declining frog age, in <a href="/en/topic/Africa">Africa</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> step in the evolution of the frog into the reptile occurred. And since the land masses were still connected, this prereptilian creature, an air breather, spread over all the world. By this time the atmosphere had been so changed that it served admirably to support animal respiration. It was soon after the arrival of these prereptilian frogs that <a href="/en/topic/North_America">North America</a> was temporarily isolated, cut off from <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Asia">Asia</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/South_America">South America</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a6_8_1"><a href="#fn_a6_8_1">[1]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s6_8_1"><a href="#fn_s6_8_1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p6_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p6_9">59:6.9</a></small></sup>  The gradual cooling of the ocean waters contributed much to the destruction of oceanic life. The marine animals of those ages took temporary refuge in three favorable retreats: the present <a href="/en/topic/Gulf_of_Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> region, the <a href="/en/topic/Ganges">Ganges</a> Bay of <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a>, and the Sicilian Bay of the <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_region">Mediterranean</a> basin. And it was from these three regions that the new marine species, born to adversity, later went forth to replenish the seas.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s6_9_1"><a href="#fn_s6_9_1">[1]</a></sup></p>

Thus ends the period of marine-life curtailment and those testing times of biologic adversity which eliminated all forms of life except such as had <a href="/en/topic/survival_value">survival value</a>, and which were therefore entitled to function as the ancestors of the more rapidly developing and highly differentiated life of the ensuing ages of planetary <a href="/en/topic/evolution">evolution</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s6_10_1"><a href="#fn_s6_10_1">[1]</a></sup></p>
