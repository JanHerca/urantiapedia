Notwithstanding Lucifer’s transgression, subordinate intelligences refrained from showing him disrespect and disdain prior to <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a>’s bestowal on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>.

<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p2_2">53:2.2</a></small></sup>  There were no peculiar or special conditions in the system of <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> which suggested or favored rebellion. It is our belief that the idea took origin and form in Lucifer’s mind, and that he might have instigated such a rebellion no matter where he might have been stationed. Lucifer first announced his plans to Satan, but it required several months to corrupt the mind of his able and brilliant associate. However, when once converted to the rebel theories, he became a bold and earnest advocate of “self-assertion and liberty<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b13"><a href="#fn_b13">[13]</a></sup>.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_2_1"><a href="#fn_s2_2_1">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p2_3">53:2.3</a></small></sup>  No one ever suggested rebellion to <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer">Lucifer</a>. The idea of self-assertion in opposition to the will of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a> and to the plans of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>, as they are represented in <a href="/en/topic/Michael_(the_original)">Michael</a>, had its origin in his own mind. His relations with the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> had been intimate and always cordial. At no time prior to the exaltation of his own mind did Lucifer openly express dissatisfaction about the universe administration. Notwithstanding his silence, for more than one hundred years of standard time the Union of Days on <a href="/en/topic/Salvington">Salvington</a> had been reflectivating to <a href="/en/topic/Uversa">Uversa</a> that all was not at peace in Lucifer’s mind.

<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p2_4">53:2.4</a></small></sup>  Throughout this period Lucifer became increasingly critical of the entire plan of universe administration but always professed wholehearted loyalty to the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme_Rulers">Supreme Rulers</a>. His first outspoken disloyalty was manifested on the occasion of a visit of <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a> to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> just a few days before the open proclamation of the Lucifer <a href="/en/topic/Declaration_of_Liberty">Declaration of Liberty</a>.

<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p2_5">53:2.5</a></small></sup>  It is very difficult to point out the exact cause or causes which finally culminated in the <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">Lucifer rebellion</a>. We are certain of only one thing, and that is: Whatever these first beginnings were, they had their origin in <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer">Lucifer</a>’s mind. There must have been a <a href="/en/topic/pride">pride</a> of self that nourished itself to the point of <a href="/en/topic/self-deception">self-deception</a>, so that Lucifer for a time really persuaded himself that his contemplation of rebellion was actually for the good of the system, if not of the universe. By the time his plans had developed to the point of disillusionment, no doubt he had gone too far for his original and mischief-making pride to permit him to stop<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b14"><a href="#fn_b14">[14]</a></sup>. At some point in this experience he became insincere, and evil evolved into deliberate and willful <a href="/en/topic/sin">sin</a>. That this happened is proved by the subsequent conduct of this brilliant executive. He was long offered opportunity for repentance, but only some of his subordinates ever accepted the proffered mercy. The <a href="/en/topic/Faithful_of_Days_of_Edentia">Faithful of Days of Edentia</a>, on the request of the <a href="/en/topic/Constellation_Fathers">Constellation Fathers</a>, in person presented the plan of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a> for the saving of these flagrant rebels, but always was the mercy of the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> rejected and rejected with increasing contempt and disdain.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_5_2"><a href="#fn_s2_5_2">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_5_1"><a href="#fn_s2_5_1">[3]</a></sup></p>

He even intimated that the <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliters</a> were in collusion with the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Sons to foist fraud upon all creation since they never brought back a very clear-cut idea of the Father’s actual personality as it is discernible on Paradise. He traded on reverence as ignorance. The charge was sweeping, terrible, and blasphemous. It was this veiled attack upon the finaliters that no doubt influenced the ascendant citizens then on <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> to stand firm and remain steadfast in resistance to all the rebel’s proposals.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_2_1"><a href="#fn_a3_2_1">[1]</a></sup></p>

He asserted that the whole plan of worship was a clever scheme to aggrandize the Paradise Sons.

He exhorted his followers to believe that none of these rulers could do aught to interfere with the operation of complete home rule if men and <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a> only had the courage to assert themselves and boldly claim their rights.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p3_5">53:3.5</a></small></sup>  He contended that the <a href="/en/topic/divine_executioners">executioners</a> of the Ancients of Days could be debarred from functioning in the local systems if the native beings would only assert their independence.

All other supervision he disallowed. He promised the <a href="/en/topic/Planetary_Princes">Planetary Princes</a> that they should rule the worlds as supreme executives. He denounced the location of legislative activities on the <a href="/en/topic/constellations">constellation</a> headquarters and the conduct of judicial affairs on the universe capital.
