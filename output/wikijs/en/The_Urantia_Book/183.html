<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/183#p0_1">183:0.1</a></small></sup>  AFTER <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had finally awakened <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>, and John, he suggested that they go to their tents and seek sleep in preparation for the duties of the morrow. But by this time the three apostles were wide awake; they had been refreshed by their short naps, and besides, they were stimulated and aroused by the arrival on the scene of two excited <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> who inquired for <a href="/en/topic/David_Zebedee">David Zebedee</a> and quickly went in quest of him when <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Peter</a> informed them where he kept watch.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/183#p0_2">183:0.2</a></small></sup>  Although eight of the apostles were sound asleep, the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a> who were encamped alongside them were more fearful of trouble, so much so that they had posted a sentinel to give the alarm in case danger should arise. When these two messengers hurried into camp, the Greek sentinel proceeded to arouse all of his fellow countrymen, who streamed forth from their tents, fully dressed and fully armed. All the camp was now aroused except the eight apostles. Peter desired to call his associates, but Jesus definitely forbade him. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> mildly admonished them all to return to their tents, but they were reluctant to comply with his suggestion.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/183#p0_3">183:0.3</a></small></sup>  Failing to disperse his followers, the Master left them and walked down toward the <a href="/en/topic/olive_press">olive press</a> near the entrance to <a href="/en/topic/Gethsemane">Gethsemane</a> Park. Although the three apostles, the Greeks, and the other members of the camp hesitated immediately to follow him, <a href="/en/topic/John_Mark">John Mark</a> hastened around through the olive trees and secreted himself in a small shed near the olive press<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> withdrew from the camp and from his friends in order that his apprehenders, when they arrived, might arrest him without disturbing his apostles. The Master feared to have his apostles awake and present at the time of his arrest lest the spectacle of Judas’s betraying him should so arouse their animosity that they would offer resistance to the soldiers and would be taken into custody with him. He feared that, if they should be arrested with him, they might also perish with him.</p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/183#p0_4">183:0.4</a></small></sup>  Though Jesus knew that the plan for his death had its origin in the councils of the rulers of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>, he was also aware that all such nefarious schemes had the full approval of <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer">Lucifer</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Satan">Satan</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia">Caligastia</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.

<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. THE FATHER’S WILL </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/183#p1_1">183:1.1</a></small></sup>  There is great danger of misunderstanding the meaning of numerous sayings and many events associated with the termination of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s career in the flesh. The cruel treatment of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> by the ignorant servants and the calloused soldiers, the unfair conduct of his trials, and the unfeeling attitude of the professed religious leaders, must not be confused with the fact that Jesus, in patiently submitting to all this suffering and humiliation, was truly doing the will of the Father in <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>. It was, indeed and in truth, the will of the Father that his Son should drink to the full the cup of mortal experience, from birth to death, but the Father in heaven had nothing whatever to do with instigating the barbarous behavior of those supposedly civilized human beings who so brutally tortured the Master and so horribly heaped successive indignities upon his nonresisting person. These inhuman and shocking experiences which Jesus was called upon to endure in the final hours of his mortal life were not in any sense a part of the divine will of the Father, which his human nature had so triumphantly pledged to carry out at the time of the final surrender of man to <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> as signified in the threefold prayer which he indited in the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a> while his weary apostles slept the sleep of physical exhaustion.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_1_3"><a href="#fn_a1_1_3">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_1_5"><a href="#fn_a1_1_5">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/183#p1_2">183:1.2</a></small></sup>  The Father in heaven desired the bestowal Son to finish his earth career <i>naturally,</i> just as all <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> must finish up their lives on earth and in the flesh. Ordinary men and women cannot expect to have their last hours on earth and the supervening episode of death made easy by a special dispensation. Accordingly, Jesus elected to lay down his life in the flesh in the manner which was in keeping with the outworking of natural events, and he steadfastly refused to extricate himself from the cruel clutches of a wicked conspiracy of inhuman events which swept on with horrible certainty toward his unbelievable humiliation and ignominious death. And every bit of all this astounding manifestation of hatred and this unprecedented demonstration of cruelty was the work of evil men and wicked mortals. God in heaven did not will it, neither did the archenemies of Jesus dictate it, though they did much to insure that unthinking and evil mortals would thus reject the bestowal Son. Even the father of sin turned his face away from the excruciating horror of the scene of the crucifixion.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_1"><a href="#fn_a1_2_1">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_2_2"><a href="#fn_a1_2_2">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_2_4"><a href="#fn_a1_2_4">[5]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. JUDAS IN THE CITY </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/183#p2_1">183:2.1</a></small></sup>  After Judas so abruptly left the table while eating the <a href="/en/topic/Last_Supper">Last Supper</a>, he went directly to the home of his cousin, and then did the two go straight to the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_centurion_of_Jerusalem">captain</a> of the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple_guards">temple guards</a>. Judas requested the captain to assemble the guards and informed him that he was ready to lead them to <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. Judas having appeared on the scene a little before he was expected, there was some delay in getting started for the Mark home, where Judas expected to find Jesus still visiting with the apostles. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and the eleven left the home of <a href="/en/topic/Elijah_Mark">Elijah Mark</a> fully fifteen minutes before the betrayer and the guards arrived. By the time the apprehenders reached the Mark home, Jesus and the eleven were well outside the walls of the city and on their way to the <a href="/en/topic/Olivet">Olivet</a> camp.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/183#p2_2">183:2.2</a></small></sup>  Judas was much perturbed by this failure to find Jesus at the Mark residence and in the company of eleven men, only two of whom were armed for resistance. He happened to know that, in the afternoon when they had left camp, only <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Zelotes">Simon Zelotes</a> were girded with <a href="/en/topic/swords">swords</a>; Judas had hoped to take Jesus when the city was quiet, and when there was little chance of resistance. The betrayer feared that, if he waited for them to return to their camp, more than threescore of devoted disciples would be encountered, and he also knew that <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> Zelotes had an ample store of arms in his possession. Judas was becoming increasingly nervous as he meditated how the eleven loyal apostles would detest him, and he feared they would all seek to destroy him. He was not only disloyal, but he was a real coward at heart.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/183#p2_3">183:2.3</a></small></sup>  When they failed to find <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> in the upper chamber, Judas asked the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_centurion_of_Jerusalem">captain of the guard</a> to return to the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>. By this time the rulers had begun to assemble at the high priest’s home preparatory to receiving Jesus, seeing that their bargain with the traitor called for Jesus’ arrest by midnight of that day. Judas explained to his associates that they had missed Jesus at the Mark home, and that it would be necessary to go to <a href="/en/topic/Gethsemane">Gethsemane</a> to arrest him<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>. The betrayer then went on to state that more than threescore devoted followers were encamped with him, and that they were all well armed. The rulers of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> reminded Judas that Jesus had always preached nonresistance, but Judas replied that they could not depend upon all Jesus’ followers obeying such teaching. He really feared for himself and therefore made bold to ask for a company of forty armed soldiers. Since the Jewish authorities had no such force of armed men under their jurisdiction, they went at once to the fortress of <a href="/en/topic/Antonia_(fortress)">Antonia</a> and requested the Roman commander to give them this guard; but when he learned that they intended to arrest Jesus, he promptly refused to accede to their request and referred them to his superior officer. In this way more than an hour was consumed in going from one authority to another until they finally were compelled to go to Pilate himself in order to obtain permission to employ the armed Roman <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple_guards">guards</a>. It was late when they arrived at Pilate’s house, and he had retired to his private chambers with his wife. He hesitated to have anything to do with the enterprise, all the more so since his wife had asked him not to grant the request. But inasmuch as the presiding officer of the Jewish <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> was present and making personal request for this assistance, the governor thought it wise to grant the petition, thinking he could later on right any wrong they might be disposed to commit.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/183#p2_4">183:2.4</a></small></sup>  Accordingly, when <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a> started out from the temple, about half after eleven o’clock, he was accompanied by more than sixty persons—temple guards, Roman soldiers, and curious servants of the chief priests and rulers.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. THE MASTER’S ARREST </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/183#p3_1">183:3.1</a></small></sup>  As this company of armed soldiers and <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple_guards">guards</a>, carrying torches and lanterns, approached the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a>, Judas stepped well out in front of the band that he might be ready quickly to identify <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> so that the apprehenders could easily lay hands on him before his associates could rally to his defense<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>. And there was yet another reason why Judas chose to be ahead of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s enemies: He thought it would appear that he had arrived on the scene ahead of the soldiers so that the apostles and others gathered about Jesus might not directly connect him with the armed guards following so closely upon his heels. Judas had even thought to pose as having hastened out to warn them of the coming of the apprehenders, but this plan was thwarted by Jesus’ blighting greeting of the betrayer. Though the Master spoke to Judas kindly, he greeted him as a traitor.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/183#p3_2">183:3.2</a></small></sup>  As soon as <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>, and John, with some thirty of their fellow campers, saw the armed band with torches swing around the brow of the hill, they knew that these soldiers were coming to arrest Jesus, and they all rushed down to near the olive press where the Master was sitting in moonlit solitude. As the company of soldiers approached on one side, the three apostles and their associates approached on the other. As Judas strode forward to accost the Master, there the two groups stood, motionless, with the Master between them and Judas making ready to impress the traitorous kiss upon his brow.</p>

<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/183#p3_3">183:3.3</a></small></sup>  It had been the hope of the betrayer that he could, after leading the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple_guards">guards</a> to <a href="/en/topic/Gethsemane">Gethsemane</a>, simply point <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> out to the soldiers, or at most carry out the promise to greet him with a kiss, and then quickly retire from the scene<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>. Judas greatly feared that the apostles would all be present, and that they would concentrate their attack upon him in retribution for his daring to betray their beloved teacher. But when the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> greeted him as a betrayer, he was so confused that he made no attempt to flee.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/183#p3_4">183:3.4</a></small></sup>  Jesus made one last effort to save Judas from actually betraying him in that, before the traitor could reach him, he stepped to one side and, addressing the foremost soldier on the left, the <a href="/en/topic/captain">captain</a> of the <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a>, said, “Whom do you seek?” The captain answered, “Jesus of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>.” Then Jesus stepped up immediately in front of the officer and, standing there in the calm majesty of the <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> of all this creation, said, “I am he<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>.” Many of this armed band had heard Jesus teach in the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>, others had learned about his mighty works, and when they heard him thus boldly announce his identity, those in the front ranks fell suddenly backward. They were overcome with surprise at his calm and majestic announcement of identity. There was, therefore, no need for Judas to go on with his plan of <a href="/en/topic/betrayal">betrayal</a>. The Master had boldly revealed himself to his enemies, and they could have taken him without Judas’s assistance. But the traitor had to do something to account for his presence with this armed band, and besides, he wanted to make a show of carrying out his part of the betrayal bargain with the rulers of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> in order to be eligible for the great reward and honors which he believed would be heaped upon him in compensation for his promise to deliver Jesus into their hands.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_4_0"><a href="#fn_s3_4_0">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/183#p4_2">183:4.2</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> had been released from all responsibility in the group management of his fellow apostles; accordingly, in this greatest of all crises in their lives, he was silent. After a short informal discussion, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Zelotes">Simon Zelotes</a> stood up on the stone wall of the olive press and, making an impassioned plea for loyalty to the Master and the cause of the kingdom, exhorted his fellow apostles and the other disciples to hasten on after the mob and effect the rescue of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. The majority of the company would have been disposed to follow his aggressive leadership had it not been for the advice of <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a>, who stood up the moment Simon had finished speaking and called their attention to Jesus’ oft-repeated teachings regarding <a href="/en/topic/nonresistance">nonresistance</a>.

And <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_the_Pharisee">Nathaniel</a> was encouraged in this stand by James Zebedee, who now told how Peter and others drew their swords to defend the Master against arrest, and that Jesus bade Simon Peter and his fellow swordsmen sheathe their blades. Matthew and <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a> also made speeches, but nothing definite came of this discussion until Thomas, calling their attention to the fact that Jesus had counseled <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a> against exposing himself to death, pointed out that they could do nothing to save their Master inasmuch as he refused to allow his friends to defend him, and since he persisted in refraining from the use of his divine powers to frustrate his human enemies. Thomas persuaded them to scatter, every man for himself, with the understanding that <a href="/en/topic/David_Zebedee">David Zebedee</a> would remain at the camp to maintain a clearinghouse and messenger headquarters for the group.

Then the Roman captain said to the Jewish captain: “This man is neither a traitor nor a coward. I saw him in the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a>, and he did not draw a sword to resist us. He has the courage to come forward to be with his Master, and no man shall lay hands on him. The Roman law allows that any prisoner may have at least one friend to stand with him before the judgment bar, and this man shall not be prevented from standing by the side of his Master, the prisoner.” And when Judas heard this, he was so ashamed and humiliated that he dropped back behind the marchers, coming up to the palace of <a href="/en/topic/Annas">Annas</a> alone.</p>

John’s position of privilege was made all the more secure when, in turning Jesus over to the captain of the temple guards at the gate of Annas’s palace, the Roman, addressing his assistant, said: “Go along with this prisoner and see that these <a href="/en/topic/Jews_(ancient_Hebrews)">Jews</a> do not kill him without Pilate’s consent. Watch that they do not assassinate him, and see that his friend, the Galilean, is permitted to stand by and observe all that goes on.” And thus was John able to be near Jesus right on up to the time of his death on the cross, though the other ten apostles were compelled to remain in hiding. John was acting under Roman protection, and the Jews dared not molest him until after the Master’s death.</p>
