Not until they passed over the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> at the <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_beyond_Jordan">Bethany ford</a>, did the two apostles become aware that their <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> was going on to Jerusalem. When they perceived that he really intended to be present at the feast of dedication, they remonstrated with him most earnestly, and using every sort of argument, they sought to dissuade him. But their efforts were of no avail; Jesus was determined to visit Jerusalem. To all their entreaties and to all their warnings emphasizing the folly and danger of placing himself in the hands of the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a>, he would reply only, “I would give these teachers in <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a> another opportunity to see the light, before my hour comes.”</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p0_2">164:0.2</a></small></sup>  On they went toward Jerusalem, the two apostles continuing to express their feelings of fear and to voice their doubts about the wisdom of such an apparently presumptuous undertaking. They reached <a href="/en/topic/Jericho">Jericho</a> about half past four and prepared to lodge there for the night.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. STORY OF THE GOOD SAMARITAN </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p1_1">164:1.1</a></small></sup>  That evening a considerable company gathered about <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the two apostles to ask questions, many of which the apostles answered, while others the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> discussed. In the course of the evening a certain lawyer, seeking to entangle Jesus in a compromising disputation, said: “Teacher, I would like to ask you just what I should do to inherit eternal life?” Jesus answered, “What is written in the law and the prophets; how do you read the Scriptures?” The lawyer, knowing the teachings of both Jesus and the <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a>, answered: “To love the Lord <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and your neighbor as yourself<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>.” Then said Jesus: “You have answered right; this, if you really do, will lead to life everlasting<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_1_3"><a href="#fn_s1_1_3">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p1_2">164:1.2</a></small></sup>  But the lawyer was not wholly sincere in asking this question, and desiring to justify himself while also hoping to embarrass Jesus, he ventured to ask still another question. Drawing a little closer to the Master, he said, “But, Teacher, I should like you to tell me just who is my <a href="/en/topic/neighbor">neighbor</a>?” The lawyer asked this question hoping to entrap Jesus into making some statement that would contravene the Jewish law which defined one’s neighbor as “the children of one’s people<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>.” The <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> looked upon all others as “gentile dogs.” This lawyer was somewhat familiar with Jesus’ teachings and therefore well knew that the Master thought differently; thus he hoped to lead him into saying something which could be construed as an attack upon the sacred law<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_1"><a href="#fn_a1_2_1">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p1_3">164:1.3</a></small></sup>  But <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> discerned the lawyer’s motive, and instead of falling into the trap, he proceeded to tell his hearers <a href="/en/topic/good_Samaritan">a story</a>, a story which would be fully appreciated by any <a href="/en/topic/Jericho">Jericho</a> audience. Said Jesus: “A certain man was going down from <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> to Jericho, and he fell into the hands of cruel brigands, who robbed him, stripped him and beat him, and departing, left him half dead. Very soon, by chance, a certain priest was going down that way, and when he came upon the wounded man, seeing his sorry plight, he passed by on the other side of the road. And in like manner a Levite also, when he came along and saw the man, passed by on the other side. Now, about this time, a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed down to Jericho, came across this wounded man; and when he saw how he had been robbed and beaten, he was moved with compassion, and going over to him, he bound up his <a href="/en/topic/wounds">wounds</a>, pouring on <a href="/en/topic/oil_(petroleum)">oil</a> and <a href="/en/topic/wine">wine</a>, and setting the man upon his own beast, brought him here to the inn and took care of him. And on the morrow he took out some money and, giving it to the host, said: ‘Take good care of my friend, and if the expense is more, when I come back again, I will repay you.’ Now let me ask you: Which of these three turned out to be the neighbor of him who fell among the <a href="/en/topic/thieves">robbers</a>?” And when the lawyer perceived that he had fallen into his own snare, he answered, “He who showed mercy on him.” And Jesus said, “Go and do likewise<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_3_14"><a href="#fn_a1_3_14">[3]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_3_3"><a href="#fn_s1_3_3">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p1_4">164:1.4</a></small></sup>  The lawyer answered, “He who showed mercy,” that he might refrain from even speaking that odious word, Samaritan. The lawyer was forced to give the very answer to the question, “Who is my neighbor?” which Jesus wished given, and which, if Jesus had so stated, would have directly involved him in the charge of heresy. Jesus not only confounded the dishonest lawyer, but he told his hearers a story which was at the same time a beautiful admonition to all his followers and a stunning rebuke to all <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> regarding their attitude toward the <a href="/en/topic/Samaritans">Samaritans</a>. And this story has continued to promote brotherly love among all who have subsequently believed the gospel of Jesus.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. AT JERUSALEM </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p2_1">164:2.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had attended the feast of tabernacles that he might proclaim the gospel to the <a href="/en/topic/Havona_pilgrims">pilgrims</a> from all parts of the empire; he now went up to the feast of the dedication for just one purpose: to give the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> and the Jewish leaders another chance to see the light. The principal event of these few days in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> occurred on <a href="/en/topic/Fridays">Friday</a> night at the home of <a href="/en/topic/Nicodemus">Nicodemus</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>. Here were gathered together some twenty-five Jewish leaders who believed Jesus’ teaching. Among this group were fourteen men who were then, or had recently been, members of the Sanhedrin. This meeting was attended by <a href="/en/topic/Eber">Eber</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Matadormus">Matadormus</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Arimathea">Joseph of Arimathea</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_0"><a href="#fn_s2_1_0">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p2_2">164:2.2</a></small></sup>  On this occasion Jesus’ hearers were all learned men, and both they and his two apostles were amazed at the breadth and depth of the remarks which the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> made to this distinguished group. Not since the times when he had taught in <a href="/en/topic/Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a>, and in the islands of the <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_region">Mediterranean</a>, had he exhibited such learning and shown such a grasp of the affairs of men, both secular and religious.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p2_3">164:2.3</a></small></sup>  When this little meeting broke up, all went away mystified by the Master’s personality, charmed by his gracious manner, and in love with the man. They had sought to advise <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> concerning his desire to win the remaining members of the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a>. The Master listened attentively, but silently, to all their proposals. He well knew none of their plans would work. He surmised that the majority of the Jewish leaders never would accept the gospel of the kingdom; nevertheless, he gave them all this one more chance to choose. But when he went forth that night, with <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Thomas_Didymus">Thomas</a>, to lodge on the <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Olivet">Mount of Olives</a>, he had not yet decided upon the method he would pursue in bringing his work once more to the notice of the Sanhedrin.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p2_4">164:2.4</a></small></sup>  That night Nathaniel and Thomas slept little; they were too much amazed by what they had heard at <a href="/en/topic/Nicodemus">Nicodemus</a>’s house. They thought much over the final remark of Jesus regarding the offer of the former and present members of the Sanhedrin to go with him before the seventy. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> said: “No, my brethren, it would be to no purpose. You would multiply the wrath to be visited upon your own heads, but you would not in the least mitigate the hatred which they bear me. Go, each of you, about the <a href="/en/topic/Father’s_business">Father’s business</a> as the spirit leads you while I once more bring the kingdom to their notice in the manner which my Father may direct.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_4_1"><a href="#fn_s2_4_1">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p3_1">164:3.1</a></small></sup>  The next morning the three went over to <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(wife_of_Justus)">Martha</a>’s home at <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a> for breakfast and then went immediately into <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. This <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> morning, as <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and his two apostles drew near the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>, they encountered a well-known beggar, a man who had been born <a href="/en/topic/blind">blind</a>, sitting at his usual place<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>. Although these mendicants did not solicit or receive alms on the Sabbath day, they were permitted thus to sit in their usual places. Jesus paused and looked upon the beggar. As he gazed upon this man who had been born blind, the idea came into his mind as to how he would once more bring his mission on earth to the notice of the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> and the other Jewish leaders and religious teachers.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_1_0"><a href="#fn_a3_1_0">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_1_2"><a href="#fn_a3_1_2">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_1_5"><a href="#fn_a3_1_5">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_1_10"><a href="#fn_a3_1_10">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_1_13"><a href="#fn_a3_1_13">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_1_15"><a href="#fn_a3_1_15">[9]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_1_2"><a href="#fn_s3_1_2">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p3_2">164:3.2</a></small></sup>  As the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> stood there before the blind man, engrossed in deep thought, <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a>, pondering the possible cause of this man’s blindness, asked: “Master, who did sin, this man or his parents, that he should be born blind?”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p3_3">164:3.3</a></small></sup>  The rabbis taught that all such cases of blindness from birth were caused by sin. Not only were children conceived and born in sin, but a child could be born <a href="/en/topic/blind">blind</a> as a punishment for some specific sin committed by its father. They even taught that a child itself might sin before it was born into the world. They also taught that such defects could be caused by some sin or other indulgence of the mother while carrying the child.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p3_4">164:3.4</a></small></sup>  There was, throughout all these regions, a lingering belief in <a href="/en/topic/reincarnation">reincarnation</a>. The older Jewish teachers, together with <a href="/en/topic/Plato">Plato</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Philo_of_Alexandria">Philo</a>, and many of the <a href="/en/topic/Essenes">Essenes</a>, tolerated the theory that men may reap in one incarnation what they have sown in a previous existence; thus in one life they were believed to be expiating the sins committed in preceding lives. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> found it difficult to make men believe that their souls had not had previous existences.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_4_7"><a href="#fn_a3_4_7">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_4_9"><a href="#fn_a3_4_9">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_4_11"><a href="#fn_a3_4_11">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_4_16"><a href="#fn_a3_4_16">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p3_5">164:3.5</a></small></sup>  However, inconsistent as it seems, while such blindness was supposed to be the result of sin, the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> held that it was meritorious in a high degree to <a href="/en/topic/charity">give alms</a> to these <a href="/en/topic/blind">blind</a> beggars. It was the custom of these blind men constantly to chant to the passers-by, “O tenderhearted, gain merit by assisting the blind.”</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p3_6">164:3.6</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> entered into the discussion of this case with <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Thomas_Didymus">Thomas</a>, not only because he had already decided to use this blind man as the means of that day bringing his mission once more prominently to the notice of the Jewish leaders, but also because he always encouraged his apostles to seek for the true causes of all phenomena, natural or spiritual. He had often warned them to avoid the common tendency to assign spiritual causes to commonplace physical events.</p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p3_7">164:3.7</a></small></sup>  Jesus decided to use this beggar in his plans for that day’s work, but before doing anything for the <a href="/en/topic/blind">blind</a> man, <a href="/en/topic/Josiah_(king)">Josiah</a> by name, he proceeded to answer Nathaniel’s question. Said the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>: “Neither did this man sin nor his parents that the works of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> might be manifest in him<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b9"><a href="#fn_b9">[9]</a></sup>.

His friends, neighbors, and all who had known him aforetime, when they observed that he could see, all said, “Is this not <a href="/en/topic/Josiah_(king)">Josiah</a> the <a href="/en/topic/blind">blind</a> beggar?” Some said it was he, while others said, “No, it is one like him, but this man can see.” But when they asked the man himself, he answered, “I am he<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b11"><a href="#fn_b11">[11]</a></sup>.”</p>

<p id="p3_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p3_11">164:3.11</a></small></sup>  This is one of the strangest of all the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s miracles. This man did not ask for healing.

This man had little faith that he would receive his sight, but the people of that day had great faith in the efficacy of the <a href="/en/topic/spittle">spittle</a> of a great or holy man; and from Jesus’ conversation with <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Thomas_Didymus">Thomas</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Josiah_(king)">Josiah</a> had concluded that his would-be benefactor was a great man, a learned teacher or a holy prophet; accordingly he did as Jesus directed him.</p>

<p id="p3_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p3_13">164:3.13</a></small></sup>  1. This was not a miracle response to the individual’s faith. This was a wonder which Jesus chose to perform for a purpose of his own, but which he so arranged that this man might derive lasting benefit therefrom.</p>
<p id="p3_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p3_14">164:3.14</a></small></sup>  2. As the <a href="/en/topic/blind">blind</a> man had not asked for healing, and since the <a href="/en/topic/faith">faith</a> he had was slight, these material acts were suggested for the purpose of encouraging him. He did believe in the superstition of the efficacy of <a href="/en/topic/spittle">spittle</a>, and he knew the pool of <a href="/en/topic/Siloam_(pool)">Siloam</a> was a semisacred place. But he would hardly have gone there had it not been necessary to wash away the clay of his anointing. There was just enough <a href="/en/topic/ceremonies">ceremony</a> about the transaction to induce him to act.</p>
<p id="p3_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p3_15">164:3.15</a></small></sup>  3. But <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had a third reason for resorting to these material means in connection with this unique transaction: This was a miracle wrought purely in obedience to his own choosing, and thereby he desired to teach his followers of that day and all subsequent ages to refrain from despising or neglecting material means in the healing of the <a href="/en/topic/sick">sick</a>. He wanted to teach them that they must cease to regard miracles as the only method of curing human diseases.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_15_8"><a href="#fn_a3_15_8">[15]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p4_1">164:4.1</a></small></sup>  By midafternoon the healing of <a href="/en/topic/Josiah_(king)">Josiah</a> had raised such a discussion around the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> that the leaders of the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> decided to convene the council in its usual temple meeting place. And they did this in violation of a standing rule which forbade the meeting of the Sanhedrin on the <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> day. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> knew that Sabbath breaking would be one of the chief charges to be brought against him when the final test came, and he desired to be brought before the Sanhedrin for adjudication of the charge of having healed a blind man on the Sabbath day, when the very session of the high Jewish court sitting in judgment on him for this act of mercy would be deliberating on these matters on the Sabbath day and in direct violation of their own self-imposed laws.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p4_2">164:4.2</a></small></sup>  But they did not call Jesus before them; they feared to. Instead, they sent forthwith for Josiah. After some preliminary questioning, the spokesman for the Sanhedrin (about fifty members being present) directed Josiah to tell them what had happened to him.

So, when the Pharisees questioned him, he said: “This man came along, put clay upon my eyes, told me to go wash in <a href="/en/topic/Siloam_(pool)">Siloam</a>, and I do now see.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b14"><a href="#fn_b14">[14]</a></sup></p>

We know that one who is a common sinner cannot perform such miracles. We all know this beggar and that he was born blind; now he sees. Will you still say that this prophet does all these wonders by the power of the prince of devils?” And for every Pharisee who dared to accuse and denounce Jesus one would arise to ask entangling and embarrassing questions, so that a serious division arose among them<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b16"><a href="#fn_b16">[16]</a></sup>. The presiding officer saw whither they were drifting, and in order to allay the discussion, he prepared further to question the man himself. Turning to <a href="/en/topic/Josiah_(king)">Josiah</a>, he said: “What do you have to say about this man, this Jesus, whom you claim opened your eyes?” And <a href="/en/topic/Josiah_(blind_beggar)">Josiah</a> answered, “I think he is a prophet<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b17"><a href="#fn_b17">[17]</a></sup>.”</p>

<p id="p4_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p4_7">164:4.7</a></small></sup>  When, therefore, <a href="/en/topic/Josiah_(king)">Josiah</a>’s parents, poor and fear-burdened souls, appeared before the august <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a>, they were afraid to speak freely.

The officer of the court spoke to the former blind man, saying: “Why do you not give <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> the glory for this? why do you not tell us the whole truth about what happened? We all know that this man is a sinner. Why do you refuse to discern the truth? You know that both you and this man stand convicted of Sabbath breaking.

Would you by any chance also become his disciples?” When Josiah had thus spoken, the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> broke up in confusion, almost violence, for the leaders rushed upon Josiah, angrily exclaiming: “You may talk about being this man’s disciple, but we are disciples of <a href="/en/topic/Moses">Moses</a>, and we are the teachers of the laws of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>.
