The rapid revolutions of this enormous central core soon imparted a spiral appearance to these two projecting gas streams. The cooling and subsequent condensation of portions of these protruding arms eventually produced their knotted appearance. These denser portions were vast systems and subsystems of physical matter whirling through space in the midst of the gaseous cloud of the nebula while being held securely within the gravity grasp of the mother wheel.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_3_6"><a href="#fn_s3_3_6">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s3_3_2"><a href="#fn_s3_3_2">[2]</a></sup></p>

But this was only a temporary stage of nebular progression.
