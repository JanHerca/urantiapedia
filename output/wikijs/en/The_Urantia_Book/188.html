This period in the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s career began shortly before he was taken down from the cross by the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_soldiers_in_Jerusalem">Roman soldiers</a>.

The centurion ordered the other soldiers to leave the two thieves while they drove back this angry mob of infuriated <a href="/en/topic/Jews_(ancient_Hebrews)">Jews</a>. When order had been restored, the centurion read the permit from Pilate to the Jews and, stepping aside, said to <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_(father_of_Jesus)">Joseph</a>: “This body is yours to do with as you see fit.

The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s Personalized <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Adjuster</a> could in no sense be affected by his physical death on the cross. That which Jesus put in the Father’s hands for the time being must have been the spirit counterpart of the Adjuster’s early work in spiritizing the mortal mind so as to provide for the transfer of the transcript of the human experience to the mansion <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_worlds">worlds</a>.

<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p5_1">188:5.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/cross">cross</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> portrays the full measure of the supreme devotion of the true shepherd for even the unworthy members of his flock. It forever places all relations between <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and man upon the <a href="/en/topic/family">family</a> basis. God is the Father; man is his son. Love, the <a href="/en/topic/love">love</a> of a father for his son, becomes the central truth in the universe relations of Creator and creature—not the justice of a king which seeks satisfaction in the sufferings and punishment of the evil-doing subject.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_1_43"><a href="#fn_a5_1_43">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_1_49"><a href="#fn_a5_1_49">[30]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s5_1_1"><a href="#fn_s5_1_1">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s5_1_7"><a href="#fn_s5_1_7">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s5_1_0"><a href="#fn_s5_1_0">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p5_2">188:5.2</a></small></sup>  The cross forever shows that the attitude of Jesus toward sinners was neither condemnation nor condonation, but rather eternal and loving <a href="/en/topic/salvation">salvation</a>. Jesus is truly a <a href="/en/topic/savior">savior</a> in the sense that his life and death do win men over to <a href="/en/topic/goodness">goodness</a> and righteous survival. Jesus loves men so much that his love awakens the response of love in the human heart. Love is truly contagious and eternally creative. Jesus’ death on the cross exemplifies a love which is sufficiently strong and divine to forgive sin and swallow up all evil-doing. Jesus disclosed to this world a higher quality of righteousness than justice—mere technical right and wrong. Divine love does not merely forgive wrongs; it absorbs and actually destroys them. The <a href="/en/topic/forgiveness">forgiveness</a> of love utterly transcends the forgiveness of mercy. Mercy sets the guilt of evil-doing to one side; but love destroys forever the sin and all weakness resulting therefrom. Jesus brought a new method of living to <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. He taught us not to resist <a href="/en/topic/evil">evil</a> but to find through him a goodness which effectually destroys evil<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup>. The forgiveness of Jesus is not condonation; it is salvation from condemnation. Salvation does not slight wrongs; it <i>makes them right.</i> True love does not compromise nor condone hate; it destroys it. The love of Jesus is never satisfied with mere forgiveness. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s love implies <a href="/en/topic/rehabilitation">rehabilitation</a>, eternal survival.
