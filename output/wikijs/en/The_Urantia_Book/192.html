<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p0_1">192:0.1</a></small></sup>  BY THE time the apostles left <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> for <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>, the Jewish leaders had quieted down considerably. Since <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> appeared only to his family of kingdom believers, and since the apostles were in hiding and did no public preaching, the rulers of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> concluded that the gospel movement was, after all, effectually crushed. They were, of course, disconcerted by the increasing spread of rumors that Jesus had risen from the dead, but they depended upon the bribed <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple_guards">guards</a> effectively to counteract all such reports by their reiteration of the story that a band of his followers had removed the body<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p0_2">192:0.2</a></small></sup>  From this time on, until the <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a> were dispersed by the rising tide of persecution, <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> was the generally recognized head of the apostolic corps. Jesus never gave him any such authority, and his fellow apostles never formally elected him to such a position of responsibility; he naturally assumed it and held it by common consent and also because he was their chief preacher. From now on public preaching became the main business of the apostles. After their return from Galilee, <a href="/en/topic/Matthias">Matthias</a>, whom they chose to take the place of <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas</a>, became their treasurer<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p0_3">192:0.3</a></small></sup>  During the week they tarried in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> the mother of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> spent much of the time with the women believers who were stopping at the home of <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Arimathea">Joseph of Arimathea</a>.</p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p0_4">192:0.4</a></small></sup>  Early this Monday morning when the apostles departed for <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>, <a href="/en/topic/John_Mark">John Mark</a> went along. He followed them out of the city, and when they had passed well beyond <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a>, he boldly came up among them, feeling confident they would not send him back.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_4_6"><a href="#fn_s0_4_6">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p0_5">192:0.5</a></small></sup>  The apostles paused several times on the way to Galilee to tell the story of their risen <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and therefore did not arrive at <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a> until very late on <a href="/en/topic/Wednesday">Wednesday</a> night. It was noontime on <a href="/en/topic/Thursday">Thursday</a> before they were all awake and ready to partake of breakfast.</p>

<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p1_2">192:1.2</a></small></sup>  After the apostles had spent the afternoon and early evening of <a href="/en/topic/Thursday">Thursday</a> in waiting at the <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a> home, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a> suggested that they go fishing. When <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> proposed the fishing trip, all of the apostles decided to go along. All night they toiled with the nets but caught no fish<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>. They did not much mind the failure to make a catch, for they had many interesting experiences to talk over, things which had so recently happened to them at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. But when daylight came, they decided to return to Bethsaida. As they neared the shore, they saw someone on the beach, near the boat landing, standing by a fire<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>. At first they thought it was <a href="/en/topic/John_Mark">John Mark</a>, who had come down to welcome them back with their catch, but as they drew nearer the shore, they saw they were mistaken—the man was too tall for <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a>. It had occurred to none of them that the person on the shore was the Master. They did not altogether understand why <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> wanted to meet with them amidst the scenes of their earlier associations and out in the open in contact with nature, far away from the shut-in environment of Jerusalem with its tragic associations of fear, betrayal, and death. He had told them that, if they would go into Galilee, he would meet them there, and he was about to fulfill that promise.</p>

<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p1_3">192:1.3</a></small></sup>  As they dropped anchor and prepared to enter the small <a href="/en/topic/boats">boat</a> for going ashore, the man on the beach called to them, “Lads, have you caught anything?” And when they answered, “No,” he spoke again. “Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find <a href="/en/topic/fish">fish</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>.” While they did not know it was Jesus who had directed them, with one accord they cast in the net as they had been instructed, and immediately it was filled, so much so that they were hardly able to draw it up. Now, John Zebedee was quick of perception, and when he saw the heavy-laden net, he perceived that it was the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> who had spoken to them. When this thought came into his mind, he leaned over and whispered to Peter, “It is the Master.” Peter was ever a man of thoughtless action and impetuous devotion; so when John whispered this in his ear, he quickly arose and cast himself into the water that he might the sooner reach the Master’s side. His brethren came up close behind him, having come ashore in the small boat, hauling the net of fishes after them.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_3_16"><a href="#fn_a1_3_16">[4]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_3_3"><a href="#fn_s1_3_3">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p1_5">192:1.5</a></small></sup>  As Jesus talked with the young man, the ten were so astonished and surprised that they neglected to haul the net of fish in upon the beach. Now spoke Jesus: “Bring in your fish and prepare some for breakfast. Already we have the fire and much bread<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p1_6">192:1.6</a></small></sup>  While <a href="/en/topic/John_Mark">John Mark</a> had paid homage to the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> had for a moment been shocked at the sight of the coals of fire glowing there on the beach; the scene reminded him so vividly of the midnight fire of charcoal in the courtyard of <a href="/en/topic/Annas">Annas</a>, where he had disowned the Master, but he shook himself and, kneeling at the Master’s feet, exclaimed, “My Lord and my Master!”</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p1_7">192:1.7</a></small></sup>  Peter then joined his comrades as they hauled in the net. When they had landed their catch, they counted the <a href="/en/topic/fish">fish</a>, and there were 153 large ones. And again was the mistake made of calling this another miraculous catch of fish. There was no miracle connected with this episode<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>. It was merely an exercise of the Master’s preknowledge. He knew the fish were there and accordingly directed the apostles where to cast the net.</p>
