From the creature standpoint, that which is transcendental would appear to have eventuated as a consequence of the finite; from the eternity viewpoint, in anticipation of the finite; and there are those who have considered it as a “pre-echo” of the finite.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s7_1_15"><a href="#fn_s7_1_15">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s7_1_9"><a href="#fn_s7_1_9">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s7_1_16"><a href="#fn_s7_1_16">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s7_1_22"><a href="#fn_s7_1_22">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s7_1_6"><a href="#fn_s7_1_6">[23]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s7_1_10"><a href="#fn_s7_1_10">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p7_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/105#p7_2">105:7.2</a></small></sup>  That which is transcendental is not necessarily nondevelopmental, but it is superevolutional in the finite sense; neither is it nonexperiential, but it is superexperience as such is meaningful to creatures. Perhaps the best illustration of such a paradox is the central universe of perfection: It is hardly absolute—only the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Isle is truly absolute in the “materialized” sense. Neither is it a finite evolutionary creation as are the seven superuniverses. <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> is eternal but not changeless in the sense of being a universe of nongrowth. It is inhabited by creatures (<a href="/en/topic/Havona_natives">Havona natives</a>) who never were actually created, for they are eternally existent. Havona thus illustrates something which is not exactly finite nor yet absolute. Havona further acts as a buffer between absolute Paradise and finite creations, still further illustrating the function of transcendentals. But Havona itself is not a transcendental—it is Havona.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s7_2_15"><a href="#fn_s7_2_15">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s7_2_9"><a href="#fn_s7_2_9">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s7_2_22"><a href="#fn_s7_2_22">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s7_2_12"><a href="#fn_s7_2_12">[25]</a></sup></p>
