At the same time these disciples all became conscious of a new and profound sense of spiritual <a href="/en/topic/joy">joy</a>, <a href="/en/topic/assurance">security</a>, and confidence<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. This new consciousness of spiritual strength was immediately followed by a strong urge to go out and publicly proclaim the <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> of the kingdom and the good news that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had risen from the dead<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1"><a href="#fn_a1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2"><a href="#fn_a2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p0_2">194:0.2</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> stood up and declared that this must be the coming of the <a href="/en/topic/Spirit_of_Truth">Spirit of Truth</a> which the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> had promised them and proposed that they go to the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> and begin the proclamation of the good news committed to their hands. And they did just what <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Peter</a> suggested.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p0_3">194:0.3</a></small></sup>  These men had been trained and instructed that the <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> which they should preach was the fatherhood of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and the sonship of man, but at just this moment of spiritual ecstasy and personal triumph, the best tidings, the greatest news, these men could think of was the <i>fact</i> of the risen Master. And so they went forth, endowed with power from on high, preaching glad tidings to the people—even salvation through <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>—but they unintentionally stumbled into the error of substituting some of the facts associated with the gospel for the gospel message itself. Peter unwittingly led off in this mistake, and others followed after him on down to <a href="/en/topic/Paul">Paul</a>, who created a new religion out of the new version of the good news.</p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p0_4">194:0.4</a></small></sup>  The gospel of the kingdom is: the fact of the fatherhood of God, coupled with the resultant truth of the sonship-brotherhood of men. <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a>, as it developed from that day, is: the fact of God as the Father of the Lord Jesus <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a>, in association with the experience of believer-fellowship with the risen and glorified Christ.</p>
<p id="p0_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p0_5">194:0.5</a></small></sup>  It is not strange that these spirit-infused men should have seized upon this opportunity to express their feelings of triumph over the forces which had sought to destroy their <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and end the influence of his teachings. At such a time as this it was easier to remember their personal association with <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and to be thrilled with the assurance that the Master still lived, that their friendship had not ended, and that the spirit had indeed come upon them even as he had promised.</p>
<p id="p0_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p0_6">194:0.6</a></small></sup>  These believers felt themselves suddenly translated into another world, a new existence of joy, power, and glory<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>. The Master had told them the kingdom would come with power, and some of them thought they were beginning to discern what he meant.</p>
<p id="p0_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p0_7">194:0.7</a></small></sup>  And when all of this is taken into consideration, it is not difficult to understand how these men came to preach a <i>new <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> about <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a></i> in the place of their former message of the fatherhood of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and the brotherhood of men.</p>

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p1_1">194:1.1</a></small></sup>  The apostles had been in hiding for forty days. This day happened to be the Jewish festival of <a href="/en/topic/Pentecost_(bestowal_of_Spirit_of_Truth)">Pentecost</a>, and thousands of visitors from all parts of the world were in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>. Many arrived for this feast, but a majority had tarried in the city since the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a>. Now these frightened apostles emerged from their weeks of seclusion to appear boldly in the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>, where they began to preach the new message of a risen <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a>. And all the disciples were likewise conscious of having received some new spiritual endowment of insight and power.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3"><a href="#fn_a3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p1_2">194:1.2</a></small></sup>  It was about two o’clock when <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> stood up in that very place where his <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> had last taught in this temple, and delivered that impassioned appeal which resulted in the winning of more than two thousand souls<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>. The Master had gone, but they suddenly discovered that this <a href="/en/topic/Genesis,_Book_of">story</a> about him had great power with the people. No wonder they were led on into the further proclamation of that which vindicated their former devotion to <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and at the same time so constrained men to believe in him. Six of the apostles participated in this meeting: <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Peter</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a>, <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>, John, <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a>, and Matthew. They talked for more than an hour and a half and delivered messages in <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a>, Hebrew, and <a href="/en/topic/Aramaic">Aramaic</a>, as well as a few words in even other tongues with which they had a speaking acquaintance<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p1_3">194:1.3</a></small></sup>  The leaders of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> were astounded at the boldness of the apostles, but they feared to molest them because of the large numbers who believed their story.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p1_4">194:1.4</a></small></sup>  By half past four o’clock more than two thousand new believers followed the apostles down to the pool of <a href="/en/topic/Siloam_(pool)">Siloam</a>, where <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a>, <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>, and John baptized them in the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s name<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>. And it was dark when they had finished with baptizing this multitude.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p1_5">194:1.5</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Pentecost_(bestowal_of_Spirit_of_Truth)">Pentecost</a> was the great festival of baptism, the time for fellowshipping the proselytes of the gate, those gentiles who desired to serve <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a>. It was, therefore, the more easy for large numbers of both the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> and believing gentiles to submit to baptism on this day. In doing this, they were in no way disconnecting themselves from the Jewish faith. Even for some time after this the believers in <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> were a sect within <a href="/en/topic/Judaism">Judaism</a>. All of them, including the apostles, were still loyal to the essential requirements of the Jewish ceremonial system.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PENTECOST </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_1">194:2.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> lived on earth and taught a <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> which redeemed man from the superstition that he was a child of the <a href="/en/topic/devil">devil</a> and elevated him to the dignity of a faith son of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. Jesus’ message, as he preached it and lived it in his day, was an effective solvent for man’s spiritual <a href="/en/topic/difficulties">difficulties</a> in that day of its statement. And now that he has personally left the world, he sends in his place his <a href="/en/topic/Spirit_of_Truth">Spirit of Truth</a>, who is designed to live in man and, for each new generation, to restate the Jesus message so that every new group of <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> to appear upon the face of the earth shall have a new and up-to-date version of the gospel, just such personal enlightenment and group guidance as will prove to be an effective solvent for man’s ever-new and varied spiritual difficulties.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4"><a href="#fn_a4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5"><a href="#fn_a5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a6"><a href="#fn_a6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7"><a href="#fn_a7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a8"><a href="#fn_a8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a9"><a href="#fn_a9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_2">194:2.2</a></small></sup>  The first mission of this spirit is, of course, to foster and personalize <a href="/en/topic/truth">truth</a>, for it is the comprehension of truth that constitutes the highest form of human <a href="/en/topic/liberty">liberty</a>. Next, it is the purpose of this spirit to destroy the believer’s feeling of orphanhood. Jesus having been among men, all believers would experience a sense of loneliness had not the Spirit of Truth come to dwell in men’s hearts<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a10"><a href="#fn_a10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a11"><a href="#fn_a11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_3">194:2.3</a></small></sup>  This bestowal of the Son’s spirit effectively prepared all normal men’s minds for the subsequent universal bestowal of the Father’s spirit (the Adjuster) upon all mankind. In a certain sense, this <a href="/en/topic/Spirit_of_Truth">Spirit of Truth</a> is the spirit of both the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a12"><a href="#fn_a12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a13"><a href="#fn_a13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a14"><a href="#fn_a14">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a15"><a href="#fn_a15">[15]</a></sup></p>

The spirit never creates a consciousness of himself, only a consciousness of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a>, the Son.

<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_7">194:2.7</a></small></sup>  Thus it appears that the Spirit of Truth comes really to lead all <a href="/en/topic/believers">believers</a> into all truth, into the expanding knowledge of the experience of the living and growing spiritual consciousness of the reality of eternal and ascending sonship with God<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a31"><a href="#fn_a31">[31]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a32"><a href="#fn_a32">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_8">194:2.8</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> lived a life which is a revelation of man submitted to the Father’s will, not an <a href="/en/topic/example">example</a> for any man literally to attempt to follow. This life in the flesh, together with his death on the cross and subsequent resurrection, presently became a new gospel of the ransom which had thus been paid in order to purchase man back from the clutch of the <a href="/en/topic/devil">evil one</a>—from the condemnation of an offended <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. Nevertheless, even though the gospel did become greatly distorted, it remains a fact that this new message about Jesus carried along with it many of the fundamental truths and teachings of his earlier gospel of the kingdom. And, sooner or later, these concealed truths of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of men will emerge to effectually transform the civilization of all mankind.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a33"><a href="#fn_a33">[33]</a></sup></p>

Neither did this substitution of the <i>fact</i> of the resurrection of Jesus for the saving gospel <i>truth</i> of sonship with God in any way interfere with the rapid spread of their teachings; on the contrary, this overshadowing of Jesus’ message by the new teachings about his person and resurrection seemed greatly to facilitate the preaching of the good news.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a34"><a href="#fn_a34">[34]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a35"><a href="#fn_a35">[35]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a36"><a href="#fn_a36">[36]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a37"><a href="#fn_a37">[37]</a></sup></p>

The chief mission of this outpoured spirit of the Father and the Son is to teach men about the truths of the Father’s love and the Son’s mercy.

They took their food with gladness and singleness of heart, praising <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and having favor with all the people. They were all filled with the spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b33"><a href="#fn_b33">[33]</a></sup>. And the multitudes of those who believed were of one heart and soul; and not one of them said that aught of the things which he possessed was his own, and they had all things in common.”</p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p4_4">194:4.4</a></small></sup>  What has happened to these men whom <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had ordained to go forth preaching the <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> of the kingdom, the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man? They have a new gospel; they are on fire with a new experience; they are filled with a new spiritual energy<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b34"><a href="#fn_b34">[34]</a></sup>. Their message has suddenly shifted to the proclamation of the risen <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a>: “Jesus of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, a man God approved by mighty works and wonders; him, being delivered up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you did crucify and slay. The things which God foreshadowed by the mouth of all the prophets, he thus fulfilled. This Jesus did God raise up. God has made him both Lord and Christ. Being, by the right hand of God, exalted and having received from the Father the promise of the spirit, he has poured forth this which you see and hear. Repent, that your sins may be blotted out; that the Father may send the Christ, who has been appointed for you, even Jesus, whom the heaven must receive until the times of the restoration of all things.”</p>
<p id="p4_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p4_5">194:4.5</a></small></sup>  The gospel of the kingdom, the message of Jesus, had been suddenly changed into the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. They now proclaimed the facts of his life, death, and resurrection and preached the hope of his speedy return to this world to finish the work he began. Thus the message of the early believers had to do with preaching about the facts of his first coming and with teaching the hope of his second coming, an event which they deemed to be very near at hand.</p>
<p id="p4_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p4_6">194:4.6</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a> was about to become the creed of the rapidly forming church. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> lives; he died for men; he gave the spirit; he is coming again. Jesus filled all their thoughts and determined all their new concepts of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and everything else. They were too much enthused over the new doctrine that “God is the Father of the Lord Jesus” to be concerned with the old message that “God is the loving Father of all men,” even of every single individual<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b35"><a href="#fn_b35">[35]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b36"><a href="#fn_b36">[36]</a></sup>. True, a marvelous manifestation of brotherly love and unexampled good will did spring up in these early communities of believers. But it was a fellowship of believers in Jesus, not a fellowship of brothers in the family kingdom of the Father in heaven. Their good will arose from the love born of the concept of Jesus’ bestowal and not from the recognition of the brotherhood of mortal man. Nevertheless, they were filled with joy, and they lived such new and unique lives that all men were attracted to their teachings about Jesus. They made the great mistake of using the living and illustrative commentary on the gospel of the kingdom for that gospel, but even that represented the greatest religion mankind had ever known.</p>
<p id="p4_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p4_7">194:4.7</a></small></sup>  Unmistakably, a new fellowship was arising in the world. “The multitude who believed continued steadfastly in the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers.” They called each other brother and sister; they greeted one another with a holy <a href="/en/topic/kiss">kiss</a>; they ministered to the poor<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b37"><a href="#fn_b37">[37]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b38"><a href="#fn_b38">[38]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b39"><a href="#fn_b39">[39]</a></sup>. It was a fellowship of living as well as of worship<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b40"><a href="#fn_b40">[40]</a></sup>. They were not communal by decree but by the desire to share their goods with their fellow believers<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b41"><a href="#fn_b41">[41]</a></sup>. They confidently expected that Jesus would return to complete the establishment of the Father’s kingdom during their generation. This spontaneous sharing of earthly <a href="/en/topic/possessions">possessions</a> was not a direct feature of Jesus’ teaching; it came about because these men and women so sincerely and so confidently believed that he was to return any day to finish his work and to consummate the kingdom. But the final results of this well-meant experiment in thoughtless brotherly love were disastrous and sorrow-breeding. Thousands of earnest believers sold their property and disposed of all their capital goods and other productive assets<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b42"><a href="#fn_b42">[42]</a></sup>. With the passing of time, the dwindling resources of Christian “equal-sharing” came to an <i>end—</i>but the world did not. Very soon the believers at <a href="/en/topic/Antioch">Antioch</a> were taking up a collection to keep their fellow believers at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> from starving<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b43"><a href="#fn_b43">[43]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a74"><a href="#fn_a74">[74]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p4_8">194:4.8</a></small></sup>  In these days they celebrated the <a href="/en/topic/Lord’s_Supper">Lord’s Supper</a> after the manner of its establishment; that is, they assembled for a social meal of good fellowship and partook of the sacrament at the end of the meal.</p>
<p id="p4_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p4_9">194:4.9</a></small></sup>  At first they baptized in the name of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>; it was almost twenty years before they began to baptize in “the name of the Father, the Son, and the <a href="/en/topic/Holy_Spirit">Holy Spirit</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b44"><a href="#fn_b44">[44]</a></sup>.” Baptism was all that was required for admission into the fellowship of believers. They had no organization as yet; it was simply the Jesus brotherhood.</p>
<p id="p4_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p4_10">194:4.10</a></small></sup>  This Jesus sect was growing rapidly, and once more the <a href="/en/topic/Sadducees">Sadducees</a> took notice of them. The <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> were little bothered about the situation, seeing that none of the teachings in any way interfered with the observance of the Jewish laws. But the Sadducees began to put the leaders of the Jesus sect in jail until they were prevailed upon to accept the counsel of one of the leading rabbis, <a href="/en/topic/Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a>, who advised them: “Refrain from these men and let them alone, for if this counsel or this work is of men, it will be overthrown; but if it is of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, you will not be able to overthrow them, lest haply you be found even to be fighting against God<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b45"><a href="#fn_b45">[45]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b46"><a href="#fn_b46">[46]</a></sup>.” They decided to follow Gamaliel’s counsel, and there ensued a time of peace and quiet in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, during which the new gospel about Jesus spread rapidly<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b47"><a href="#fn_b47">[47]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a75"><a href="#fn_a75">[75]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p4_11">194:4.11</a></small></sup>  And so all went well in Jerusalem until the time of the coming of the <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a> in large numbers from <a href="/en/topic/Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. Two of the pupils of Rodan arrived in Jerusalem and made many converts from among the Hellenists. Among their early converts were <a href="/en/topic/Stephen">Stephen</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Barnabas">Barnabas</a>. These able Greeks did not so much have the Jewish viewpoint, and they did not so well conform to the Jewish mode of worship and other ceremonial practices. And it was the doings of these Greek believers that terminated the peaceful relations between the <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> brotherhood and the Pharisees and Sadducees. Stephen and his Greek associate began to preach more as Jesus taught, and this brought them into immediate conflict with the Jewish rulers. In one of Stephen’s public sermons, when he reached the objectionable part of the discourse, they dispensed with all formalities of trial and proceeded to stone him to death on the spot<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b48"><a href="#fn_b48">[48]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a76"><a href="#fn_a76">[76]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a77"><a href="#fn_a77">[77]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p4_12">194:4.12</a></small></sup>  Stephen, the leader of the Greek colony of Jesus’ believers in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, thus became <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> martyr to the new faith and the specific cause for the formal organization of the <a href="/en/topic/Christian_church,_early">early Christian church</a>. This new crisis was met by the recognition that believers could not longer go on as a sect within the Jewish faith. They all agreed that they must separate themselves from unbelievers; and within one month from the death of Stephen the church at Jerusalem had been organized under the leadership of <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> the brother of Jesus had been installed as its titular head.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a78"><a href="#fn_a78">[78]</a></sup></p>
