<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p0_1">138:0.1</a></small></sup>  AFTER preaching the sermon on “The Kingdom,” <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> called the six apostles together that afternoon and began to disclose his plans for visiting the cities around and about the <a href="/en/topic/Sea_of_Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a>. His brothers <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Jude">Jude</a> were very much hurt because they were not called to this conference. Up to this time they had regarded themselves as belonging to Jesus’ inner circle of associates. But Jesus planned to have no close relatives as members of this corps of apostolic directors of the kingdom. This failure to include James and Jude among the chosen few, together with his apparent aloofness from his mother ever since the experience at <a href="/en/topic/Cana">Cana</a>, was the starting point of an ever-widening gulf between Jesus and his family. This situation continued throughout his public ministry—they very nearly rejected him—and these differences were not fully removed until after his death and resurrection. His mother constantly wavered between attitudes of fluctuating faith and hope, and increasing emotions of disappointment, humiliation, and despair. Only <a href="/en/topic/Ruth_(Old_Testament)">Ruth</a>, the youngest, remained unswervingly loyal to her father-brother.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p0_2">138:0.2</a></small></sup>  Until after the resurrection, Jesus’ entire family had very little to do with his ministry.

<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. FINAL INSTRUCTIONS </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p1_1">138:1.1</a></small></sup>  The next day, <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a>, June 23, A.D. 26, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> imparted his final instructions to the six. He directed them to go forth, two and two, to teach the glad tidings of the kingdom. He forbade them to baptize and advised against public preaching. He went on to explain that later he would permit them to preach in public, but that for a season, and for many reasons, he desired them to acquire practical experience in dealing personally with their fellow men. Jesus purposed to make their first tour entirely one of <i>personal work.</i> Although this announcement was something of a disappointment to the apostles, still they saw, at least in part, Jesus’ reason for thus beginning the proclamation of the kingdom, and they started out in good heart and with confident enthusiasm. He sent them forth by twos, <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> and John going to <a href="/en/topic/Kheresa">Kheresa</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> to <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, while <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a> went to <a href="/en/topic/Tarichea">Tarichea</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p1_2">138:1.2</a></small></sup>  Before they began this first two weeks of service, Jesus announced to them that he desired to ordain twelve apostles to continue the work of the kingdom after his departure and authorized each of them to choose one man from among his early converts for membership in the projected corps of apostles. John spoke up, asking: “But, <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, will these six men come into our midst and share all things equally with us who have been with you since the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> and have heard all your teaching in preparation for this, our first labor for the kingdom?” And Jesus replied: “Yes, John, the men you choose shall become one with us, and you will teach them all that pertains to the kingdom, even as I have taught you.” After thus speaking, Jesus left them.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_4"><a href="#fn_a1_2_4">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p1_3">138:1.3</a></small></sup>  The six did not separate to go to their work until they had exchanged many words in discussion of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ instruction that each of them should choose a new apostle. <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a>’s counsel finally prevailed, and they went forth to their labors. In substance Andrew said: “The Master is right; we are too few to encompass this work. There is need for more teachers, and the Master has manifested great confidence in us inasmuch as he has intrusted us with the choosing of these six new apostles.” This morning, as they separated to go to their work, there was a bit of concealed depression in each heart. They knew they were going to miss Jesus, and besides their fear and timidity, this was not the way they had pictured the kingdom of heaven being inaugurated.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_3_22"><a href="#fn_a1_3_22">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p1_4">138:1.4</a></small></sup>  It had been arranged that the six were to labor for two weeks, after which they were to return to the home of <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a> for a conference. Meantime Jesus went over to <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> to visit with <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> and other members of his family living in that vicinity. Jesus did everything humanly possible, consistent with his dedication to the doing of his Father’s will, to retain the confidence and affection of his family. In this matter he did his full duty and more.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_4_2"><a href="#fn_a1_4_2">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p1_5">138:1.5</a></small></sup>  While the apostles were out on this mission, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> thought much about John, now in prison. It was a great temptation to use his potential powers to release him, but once more he resigned himself to “wait upon the Father’s will.”</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. CHOOSING THE SIX </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p2_1">138:2.1</a></small></sup>  This first missionary tour of the six was eminently successful. They all discovered the great value of direct and personal contact with men. They returned to <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> more fully realizing that, after all, <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> is purely and wholly a matter of <i>personal experience.</i> They began to sense how hungry were the common people to hear words of religious comfort and spiritual good cheer. When they assembled about Jesus, they all wanted to talk at once, but <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> assumed charge, and as he called upon them one by one, they made their formal reports to the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and presented their nominations for the six new apostles.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_1_13"><a href="#fn_a2_1_13">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p2_2">138:2.2</a></small></sup>  Jesus, after each man had presented his selection for the new apostleships, asked all the others to vote upon the nomination; thus all six of the new apostles were formally accepted by all of the older six. Then Jesus announced that they would all visit these candidates and give them the call to service.</p>

He was looking for employment in these regions when Jesus’ apostles found him, and chiefly because of his experience with finances, <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a> invited him to join their ranks. Judas Iscariot was the only Judean among the twelve apostles.</p>

And Jesus nodded his consent. <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> then took Matthew aside and explained that he had invited one <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> to join the apostles and secured his consent that <a href="/en/topic/Simon_of_Cyrene">Simon</a> be also bidden to this feast.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p3_3">138:3.3</a></small></sup>  After a noontide luncheon at Matthew’s house they all went with Peter to call upon Simon the Zealot, whom they found at his old place of business, which was now being conducted by his nephew. When Peter led <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> up to Simon, the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> greeted the fiery patriot and only said, “Follow me.”</p>

The Levi family had long been engaged in business and tax gathering; therefore many of the guests bidden to this banquet by Matthew would have been denominated “<a href="/en/topic/publicans_and_sinners">publicans and sinners</a>” by the <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>.</p>

<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p3_6">138:3.6</a></small></sup>  As the dinner progressed, the joy of the diners mounted to heights of good cheer, and everybody was having such a splendid time that the onlooking <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> began, in their hearts, to criticize Jesus for his participation in such a lighthearted and carefree affair. Later in the evening, when they were making speeches, one of the more malignant of the Pharisees went so far as to criticize Jesus’ conduct to <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, saying: “How dare you to teach that this man is righteous when he eats with publicans and <a href="/en/topic/sinners">sinners</a> and thus lends his presence to such scenes of careless pleasure making.” <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Peter</a> whispered this criticism to Jesus before he spoke the parting blessing upon those assembled.

<p id="p6_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p6_1">138:6.1</a></small></sup>  The next week was devoted to a program of intense training. Each day the six new apostles were put in the hands of their respective nominators for a thoroughgoing review of all they had learned and experienced in preparation for the work of the kingdom. The older apostles carefully reviewed, for the benefit of the younger six, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ teachings up to that hour.

<p id="p6_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p6_2">138:6.2</a></small></sup>  It was at this time that Jesus established the mid-week holiday for <a href="/en/topic/rest">rest</a> and <a href="/en/topic/recreation">recreation</a>. And they pursued this plan of relaxation for one day each week throughout the remainder of his material life. As a general rule, they never prosecuted their regular activities on <a href="/en/topic/Wednesday">Wednesday</a>. On this weekly holiday Jesus would usually take himself away from them, saying: “My children, go for a day of play. Rest yourselves from the arduous labors of the kingdom and enjoy the refreshment that comes from reverting to your former vocations or from discovering new sorts of recreational activity.” While Jesus, at this period of his earth life, did not actually require this day of rest, he conformed to this plan because he knew it was best for his human associates. Jesus was the teacher—the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>; his associates were his pupils—disciples.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s6_2_4"><a href="#fn_s6_2_4">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s6_2_7"><a href="#fn_s6_2_7">[3]</a></sup></p>

I have told you many times that I have not come to sit on <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a>’s throne, and now how is it that you are inquiring which place each of you will occupy in the Father’s kingdom? Can you not perceive that I have called you as ambassadors of a spiritual kingdom?

On this crucial forenoon they each sought to find <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, and each endeavored to cheer and strengthen the other, and they returned to Jesus as he had bidden them.</p>
<p id="p7_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p7_3">138:7.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> now recounted for them the coming of John, the baptism in the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a>, the marriage feast at <a href="/en/topic/Cana">Cana</a>, the recent choosing of the six, and the withdrawal from them of his own brothers in the flesh, and warned them that the <a href="/en/topic/enemy">enemy</a> of the kingdom would seek also to draw them away. After this short but earnest talk the apostles all arose, under <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>’s leadership, to declare their undying devotion to their <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and to pledge their unswerving loyalty to the kingdom, as Thomas expressed it, “To this coming kingdom, no matter what it is and even if I do not fully understand it.” They all truly <i>believed in Jesus,</i> even though they did not fully comprehend his teaching.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s7_3_7"><a href="#fn_s7_3_7">[3]</a></sup></p>

When it developed that they had hardly sufficient funds to maintain themselves for two weeks, he said: “It is not the will of my Father that we begin our work in this way.

And they all so much enjoyed Jesus! He was a good fisherman, a cheerful companion, and an inspiring friend; the more they worked with him, the more they loved him.

<p id="p9_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p9_1">138:9.1</a></small></sup>  This somewhat monotonous period of alternate fishing and personal work proved to be a grueling experience for the twelve apostles, but they endured the test. With all of their grumblings, doubts, and transient dissatisfactions they remained true to their vows of devotion and loyalty to the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>. It was their personal association with <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> during these months of testing that so endeared him to them that they all (save <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>) remained loyal and true to him even in the dark hours of the trial and crucifixion. Real men simply could not actually desert a revered teacher who had lived so close to them and had been so devoted to them as had Jesus. Through the dark hours of the Master’s death, in the hearts of these apostles all reason, judgment, and logic were set aside in deference to just one extraordinary human emotion—the supreme sentiment of friendship-loyalty. These five months of work with Jesus led these apostles, each one of them, to regard him as the best <i>friend</i> he had in all the world. And it was this human sentiment, and not his superb teachings or marvelous doings, that held them together until after the resurrection and the renewal of the proclamation of the gospel of the kingdom.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a9_1_18"><a href="#fn_a9_1_18">[35]</a></sup></p>
