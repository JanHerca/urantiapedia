<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p0_1">138:0.1</a></small></sup>  AFTER preaching the sermon on “The Kingdom,” <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> called the six apostles together that afternoon and began to disclose his plans for visiting the cities around and about the <a href="/en/topic/Sea_of_Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a>. His brothers <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Jude">Jude</a> were very much hurt because they were not called to this conference. Up to this time they had regarded themselves as belonging to Jesus’ inner circle of associates. But Jesus planned to have no close relatives as members of this corps of apostolic directors of the kingdom. This failure to include James and Jude among the chosen few, together with his apparent aloofness from his mother ever since the experience at <a href="/en/topic/Cana">Cana</a>, was the starting point of an ever-widening gulf between Jesus and his family. This situation continued throughout his public ministry—they very nearly rejected him—and these differences were not fully removed until after his death and resurrection. His mother constantly wavered between attitudes of fluctuating faith and hope, and increasing emotions of disappointment, humiliation, and despair. Only <a href="/en/topic/Ruth_(Old_Testament)">Ruth</a>, the youngest, remained unswervingly loyal to her father-brother.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p0_2">138:0.2</a></small></sup>  Until after the resurrection, Jesus’ entire family had very little to do with his ministry. If a prophet is not without honor save in his own country, he is not without understanding appreciation save in his own family<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. FINAL INSTRUCTIONS </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p1_1">138:1.1</a></small></sup>  The next day, <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a>, June 23, A.D. 26, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> imparted his final instructions to the six. He directed them to go forth, two and two, to teach the glad tidings of the kingdom. He forbade them to baptize and advised against public preaching. He went on to explain that later he would permit them to preach in public, but that for a season, and for many reasons, he desired them to acquire practical experience in dealing personally with their fellow men. Jesus purposed to make their first tour entirely one of <i>personal work.</i> Although this announcement was something of a disappointment to the apostles, still they saw, at least in part, Jesus’ reason for thus beginning the proclamation of the kingdom, and they started out in good heart and with confident enthusiasm. He sent them forth by twos, <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> and John going to <a href="/en/topic/Kheresa">Kheresa</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> to <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, while <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a> went to <a href="/en/topic/Tarichea">Tarichea</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p1_2">138:1.2</a></small></sup>  Before they began this first two weeks of service, Jesus announced to them that he desired to ordain twelve apostles to continue the work of the kingdom after his departure and authorized each of them to choose one man from among his early converts for membership in the projected corps of apostles. John spoke up, asking: “But, <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, will these six men come into our midst and share all things equally with us who have been with you since the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> and have heard all your teaching in preparation for this, our first labor for the kingdom?” And Jesus replied: “Yes, John, the men you choose shall become one with us, and you will teach them all that pertains to the kingdom, even as I have taught you.” After thus speaking, Jesus left them.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1"><a href="#fn_a1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p1_3">138:1.3</a></small></sup>  The six did not separate to go to their work until they had exchanged many words in discussion of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ instruction that each of them should choose a new apostle. <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a>’s counsel finally prevailed, and they went forth to their labors. In substance Andrew said: “The Master is right; we are too few to encompass this work. There is need for more teachers, and the Master has manifested great confidence in us inasmuch as he has intrusted us with the choosing of these six new apostles.” This morning, as they separated to go to their work, there was a bit of concealed depression in each heart. They knew they were going to miss Jesus, and besides their fear and timidity, this was not the way they had pictured the kingdom of heaven being inaugurated.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2"><a href="#fn_a2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p1_4">138:1.4</a></small></sup>  It had been arranged that the six were to labor for two weeks, after which they were to return to the home of <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a> for a conference. Meantime Jesus went over to <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> to visit with <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> and other members of his family living in that vicinity. Jesus did everything humanly possible, consistent with his dedication to the doing of his Father’s will, to retain the confidence and affection of his family. In this matter he did his full duty and more.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3"><a href="#fn_a3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p1_5">138:1.5</a></small></sup>  While the apostles were out on this mission, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> thought much about John, now in prison. It was a great temptation to use his potential powers to release him, but once more he resigned himself to “wait upon the Father’s will.”</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. CHOOSING THE SIX </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p2_1">138:2.1</a></small></sup>  This first missionary tour of the six was eminently successful. They all discovered the great value of direct and personal contact with men. They returned to <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> more fully realizing that, after all, <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> is purely and wholly a matter of <i>personal experience.</i> They began to sense how hungry were the common people to hear words of religious comfort and spiritual good cheer. When they assembled about Jesus, they all wanted to talk at once, but <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> assumed charge, and as he called upon them one by one, they made their formal reports to the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and presented their nominations for the six new apostles.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p2_2">138:2.2</a></small></sup>  Jesus, after each man had presented his selection for the new apostleships, asked all the others to vote upon the nomination; thus all six of the new apostles were formally accepted by all of the older six. Then Jesus announced that they would all visit these candidates and give them the call to service.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p2_3">138:2.3</a></small></sup>  The newly selected apostles were:<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup></p>

Before joining the Zealots, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> had been a merchant. He was selected by <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>.</p>

He had become attached to <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John the Baptist</a>, and his Sadducee parents had disowned him. He was looking for employment in these regions when Jesus’ apostles found him, and chiefly because of his experience with finances, <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a> invited him to join their ranks. Judas Iscariot was the only Judean among the twelve apostles.</p>
<p id="p2_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p2_10">138:2.10</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> spent a full day with the six, answering their questions and listening to the details of their reports, for they had many interesting and profitable experiences to relate. They now saw the wisdom of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s plan of sending them out to labor in a quiet and personal manner before the launching of their more pretentious public efforts.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. THE CALL OF MATTHEW AND SIMON </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p3_1">138:3.1</a></small></sup>  The next day <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the six went to call upon Matthew, the customs collector<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>. Matthew was awaiting them, having balanced his books and made ready to turn the affairs of his office over to his brother. As they approached the toll house, <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> stepped forward with Jesus, who, looking into Matthew’s face, said, “Follow me.” And he arose and went to his house with Jesus and the apostles.</p>

<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p3_2">138:3.2</a></small></sup>  Matthew told Jesus of the banquet he had arranged for that evening, at least that he wished to give such a dinner to his family and friends if Jesus would approve and consent to be the guest of honor. And Jesus nodded his consent. <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> then took Matthew aside and explained that he had invited one <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> to join the apostles and secured his consent that <a href="/en/topic/Simon_of_Cyrene">Simon</a> be also bidden to this feast.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p3_3">138:3.3</a></small></sup>  After a noontide luncheon at Matthew’s house they all went with Peter to call upon Simon the Zealot, whom they found at his old place of business, which was now being conducted by his nephew. When Peter led <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> up to Simon, the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> greeted the fiery patriot and only said, “Follow me.”</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p3_4">138:3.4</a></small></sup>  They all returned to Matthew’s home, where they talked much about politics and religion until the hour of the evening meal<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>. The Levi family had long been engaged in business and tax gathering; therefore many of the guests bidden to this banquet by Matthew would have been denominated “<a href="/en/topic/publicans_and_sinners">publicans and sinners</a>” by the <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>.</p>

Accordingly, most of the <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> Pharisees were present on this occasion to observe <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ conduct at this unusual social gathering.</p>

<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p3_6">138:3.6</a></small></sup>  As the dinner progressed, the joy of the diners mounted to heights of good cheer, and everybody was having such a splendid time that the onlooking <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> began, in their hearts, to criticize Jesus for his participation in such a lighthearted and carefree affair. Later in the evening, when they were making speeches, one of the more malignant of the Pharisees went so far as to criticize Jesus’ conduct to <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, saying: “How dare you to teach that this man is righteous when he eats with publicans and <a href="/en/topic/sinners">sinners</a> and thus lends his presence to such scenes of careless pleasure making.” <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Peter</a> whispered this criticism to Jesus before he spoke the parting blessing upon those assembled. When Jesus began to speak, he said: “In coming here tonight to welcome Matthew and <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> to our fellowship, I am glad to witness your lightheartedness and social good cheer, but you should rejoice still more because many of you will find entrance into the coming kingdom of the spirit, wherein you shall more abundantly enjoy the good things of the kingdom of heaven. And to you who stand about criticizing me in your hearts because I have come here to make merry with these friends, let me say that I have come to proclaim joy to the socially downtrodden and spiritual liberty to the moral captives.

No man may close the door of mercy in the face of any hungry soul who may seek to gain an entrance thereto. We will sit at meat with all who desire to hear of the kingdom.

One would grasp one point and one would comprehend another, but none of them could encompass the whole of his teaching. Always would they make the mistake of trying to fit Jesus’ new <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> into their old forms of religious belief. They could not grasp the idea that Jesus had come to proclaim a new gospel of salvation and to establish a new way of finding <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>; they did not perceive that he <i>was</i> a new revelation of the Father in heaven.</p>

<p id="p6_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p6_1">138:6.1</a></small></sup>  The next week was devoted to a program of intense training. Each day the six new apostles were put in the hands of their respective nominators for a thoroughgoing review of all they had learned and experienced in preparation for the work of the kingdom. The older apostles carefully reviewed, for the benefit of the younger six, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ teachings up to that hour. Evenings they all assembled in <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a>’s <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a> to receive Jesus’ instruction.</p>
<p id="p6_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p6_2">138:6.2</a></small></sup>  It was at this time that Jesus established the mid-week holiday for <a href="/en/topic/rest">rest</a> and <a href="/en/topic/recreation">recreation</a>. And they pursued this plan of relaxation for one day each week throughout the remainder of his material life. As a general rule, they never prosecuted their regular activities on <a href="/en/topic/Wednesday">Wednesday</a>. On this weekly holiday Jesus would usually take himself away from them, saying: “My children, go for a day of play. Rest yourselves from the arduous labors of the kingdom and enjoy the refreshment that comes from reverting to your former vocations or from discovering new sorts of recreational activity.” While Jesus, at this period of his earth life, did not actually require this day of rest, he conformed to this plan because he knew it was best for his human associates. Jesus was the teacher—the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>; his associates were his pupils—disciples.</p>
<p id="p6_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p6_3">138:6.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> endeavored to make clear to his apostles the difference between his teachings and his <i>life among them</i> and the teachings which might subsequently spring up <i>about</i> him. Said Jesus: “My kingdom and the <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> related thereto shall be the burden of your message. Be not sidetracked into preaching <i>about</i> me and <i>about</i> my teachings. Proclaim the gospel of the kingdom and portray my revelation of the Father in heaven but do not be misled into the bypaths of creating legends and building up a cult having to do with beliefs and teachings <i>about</i> my beliefs and teachings<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>.” But again they did not understand why he thus spoke, and no man dared to ask why he so taught them.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5"><a href="#fn_a5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a6"><a href="#fn_a6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7"><a href="#fn_a7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p6_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p6_4">138:6.4</a></small></sup>  In these early teachings Jesus sought to avoid controversies with his apostles as far as possible excepting those involving wrong concepts of his Father in heaven. In all such matters he never hesitated to correct erroneous beliefs. There was just <i>one</i> motive in Jesus’ postbaptismal life on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>, and that was a better and truer revelation of his <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Father; he was the pioneer of the new and better way to <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, the way of faith and love<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b9"><a href="#fn_b9">[9]</a></sup>.

He was engaged in a mission of enormous dramatic possibilities, but he insisted on going about his <a href="/en/topic/Father’s_business">Father’s business</a> in the most quiet and undramatic manner; he studiously avoided all display of power. And he now planned to work quietly, at least for several months, with his twelve apostles around about the <a href="/en/topic/Sea_of_Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p7" class="toc-header"><a href="#p7" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 7. ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT </h2>
<p id="p7_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p7_1">138:7.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had planned for a quiet missionary campaign of five months’ personal work. He did not tell the apostles how long this was to last; they worked from week to week. And early on this <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">first day</a> of the week, just as he was about to announce this to his twelve apostles, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a>, <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James Zebedee</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a> came to have private converse with him. Taking Jesus aside, <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> made bold to say: “<a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, we come at the behest of our associates to inquire whether the time is not now ripe to enter into the kingdom. And will you proclaim the kingdom at <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, or are we to move on to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>? And when shall we learn, each of us, the positions we are to occupy with you in the establishment of the kingdom—” and Peter would have gone on asking further questions, but Jesus raised an admonitory hand and stopped him. And beckoning the other apostles standing near by to join them, Jesus said: “My little children, how long shall I bear with you! Have I not made it plain to you that my kingdom is not of this world? I have told you many times that I have not come to sit on <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a>’s throne, and now how is it that you are inquiring which place each of you will occupy in the Father’s kingdom? Can you not perceive that I have called you as ambassadors of a spiritual kingdom? Do you not understand that soon, very soon, you are to represent me in the world and in the proclamation of the kingdom, even as I now represent my Father who is in heaven? Can it be that I have chosen you and instructed you as <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> of the kingdom, and yet you do not comprehend the nature and significance of this coming kingdom of divine pre-eminence in the hearts of men? My friends, hear me once more. Banish from your minds this idea that my kingdom is a rule of <a href="/en/topic/power">power</a> or a reign of glory. Indeed, all power in heaven and on earth will presently be given into my hands, but it is not the Father’s will that we use this divine endowment to glorify ourselves during this age. In another age you shall indeed sit with me in power and glory, but it behooves us now to submit to the will of the Father and to go forth in humble obedience to execute his bidding on earth.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a11"><a href="#fn_a11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a12"><a href="#fn_a12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a13"><a href="#fn_a13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p7_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p7_2">138:7.2</a></small></sup>  Once more were his associates shocked, stunned. Jesus sent them away two and two to pray, asking them to return to him at noontime. On this crucial forenoon they each sought to find <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, and each endeavored to cheer and strengthen the other, and they returned to Jesus as he had bidden them.</p>
<p id="p7_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p7_3">138:7.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> now recounted for them the coming of John, the baptism in the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a>, the marriage feast at <a href="/en/topic/Cana">Cana</a>, the recent choosing of the six, and the withdrawal from them of his own brothers in the flesh, and warned them that the <a href="/en/topic/enemy">enemy</a> of the kingdom would seek also to draw them away. After this short but earnest talk the apostles all arose, under <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>’s leadership, to declare their undying devotion to their <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and to pledge their unswerving loyalty to the kingdom, as Thomas expressed it, “To this coming kingdom, no matter what it is and even if I do not fully understand it.” They all truly <i>believed in Jesus,</i> even though they did not fully comprehend his teaching.</p>
<p id="p7_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p7_4">138:7.4</a></small></sup>  Jesus now asked them how much money they had among them; he also inquired as to what provision had been made for their families. When it developed that they had hardly sufficient funds to maintain themselves for two weeks, he said: “It is not the will of my Father that we begin our work in this way. We will remain here by the sea two weeks and fish or do whatever our hands find to do; and in the meantime, under the guidance of <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> chosen apostle, you shall so organize yourselves as to provide for everything needful in your future work, both for the present personal ministry and also when I shall subsequently ordain you to preach the gospel and instruct believers.” They were all greatly cheered by these words; this was their first clear-cut and positive intimation that Jesus designed later on to enter upon more aggressive and pretentious public efforts.</p>
<p id="p7_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p7_5">138:7.5</a></small></sup>  The apostles spent the remainder of the day perfecting their organization and completing arrangements for <a href="/en/topic/boats">boats</a> and nets for embarking on the morrow’s fishing as they had all decided to devote themselves to fishing; most of them had been <a href="/en/topic/fishermen">fishermen</a>, even <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was an experienced boatman and fisherman. Many of the boats which they used the next few years had been built by Jesus’ own hands. And they were good and trustworthy boats.</p>
<p id="p7_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p7_6">138:7.6</a></small></sup>  Jesus enjoined them to devote themselves to fishing for two weeks, adding, “And then will you go forth to become fishers of men<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup>.” They fished in three groups, Jesus going out with a different group each night. And they all so much enjoyed Jesus! He was a good fisherman, a cheerful companion, and an inspiring friend; the more they worked with him, the more they loved him. Said Matthew one day: “The more you understand some people, the less you admire them, but of this man, even the less I comprehend him, the more I love him.”</p>
<p id="p7_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p7_7">138:7.7</a></small></sup>  This plan of fishing two weeks and going out to do personal work in behalf of the kingdom for two weeks was followed for more than five months, even to the end of this year of A.D. 26, until after the cessation of those special persecutions which had been directed against John’s disciples subsequent to his imprisonment.</p>
<h2 id="p8" class="toc-header"><a href="#p8" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 8. FIRST WORK OF THE TWELVE </h2>
<p id="p8_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p8_1">138:8.1</a></small></sup>  After disposing of the fish catches of two weeks, <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>, the one chosen to act as treasurer of the twelve, divided the apostolic funds into six equal portions, funds for the care of dependent families having been already provided.

The first two weeks <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> went out with Andrew and <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, the second two weeks with <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> and John, and so on with the other couples in the order of their choosing. In this way he was able to go out at least once with each couple before he called them together for the beginning of their public ministry.</p>

<p id="p8_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p8_6">138:8.6</a></small></sup>  They had wonderful times throughout these five or six months during which they worked as fishermen every alternate two weeks, thereby earning enough money to support themselves in the field for each succeeding two weeks of missionary work for the kingdom.</p>
<p id="p8_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p8_7">138:8.7</a></small></sup>  The common people marveled at the teaching and ministry of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and his apostles. The rabbis had long taught the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> that the ignorant could not be pious or righteous.

<p id="p8_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p8_8">138:8.8</a></small></sup>  Jesus made plain to his apostles the difference between the <a href="/en/topic/repentance">repentance</a> of so-called good works as taught by the Jews and the change of mind by <a href="/en/topic/faith">faith</a>—the new birth—which he required as the price of admission to the kingdom<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b13"><a href="#fn_b13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b14"><a href="#fn_b14">[14]</a></sup>. He taught his apostles that <i>faith</i> was the only requisite to entering the Father’s kingdom.

He seemed to speak of himself as one having authority. Jesus sought to divert their minds from miracle seeking to the finding of a real and personal experience in the satisfaction and assurance of the indwelling of God’s spirit of love and saving grace.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a15"><a href="#fn_a15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a16"><a href="#fn_a16">[16]</a></sup></p>

He would pause in the midst of a profound discourse that he might go out in the road to speak good cheer to a passing woman laden with her burden of body and soul.

Real men simply could not actually desert a revered teacher who had lived so close to them and had been so devoted to them as had Jesus. Through the dark hours of the Master’s death, in the hearts of these apostles all reason, judgment, and logic were set aside in deference to just one extraordinary human emotion—the supreme sentiment of friendship-loyalty. These five months of work with Jesus led these apostles, each one of them, to regard him as the best <i>friend</i> he had in all the world. And it was this human sentiment, and not his superb teachings or marvelous doings, that held them together until after the resurrection and the renewal of the proclamation of the gospel of the kingdom.</p>

<p id="p10_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p10_5">138:10.5</a></small></sup>  4. <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a> watched over the needs of the families of the twelve. He received regular reports as to the requirements of each apostle’s family and, making requisition on Judas, the treasurer, would send funds each week to those in need.</p>
<p id="p10_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p10_6">138:10.6</a></small></sup>  5. Matthew was the fiscal agent of the apostolic corps. It was his duty to see that the budget was balanced, the treasury replenished. If the funds for mutual support were not forthcoming, if donations sufficient to maintain the party were not received, Matthew was empowered to order the twelve back to their nets for a season. But this was never necessary after they began their public work; he always had sufficient funds in the treasurer’s hands to finance their activities.</p>
<p id="p10_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p10_7">138:10.7</a></small></sup>  6. Thomas was manager of the itinerary. It devolved upon him to arrange lodgings and in a general way select places for teaching and preaching, thereby insuring a smooth and expeditious travel schedule.</p>
<p id="p10_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p10_8">138:10.8</a></small></sup>  7. <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> and Judas the twin sons of <a href="/en/topic/Alpheus">Alpheus</a> were assigned to the management of the multitudes. It was their task to deputize a sufficient number of assistant ushers to enable them to maintain order among the crowds during the preaching.</p>
<p id="p10_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p10_9">138:10.9</a></small></sup>  8. <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Zelotes">Simon Zelotes</a> was given charge of recreation and play. He managed the <a href="/en/topic/Wednesday">Wednesday</a> programs and also sought to provide for a few hours of relaxation and diversion each day.</p>
<p id="p10_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p10_10">138:10.10</a></small></sup>  9. <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a> was appointed treasurer. He carried the bag<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b17"><a href="#fn_b17">[17]</a></sup>. He paid all expenses and kept the books. He made budget estimates for Matthew from week to week and also made weekly reports to <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a>. Judas paid out funds on Andrew’s authorization.</p>
<p id="p10_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p10_11">138:10.11</a></small></sup>  In this way the twelve functioned from their early organization up to the time of the reorganization made necessary by the desertion of Judas, the betrayer. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and his disciple-apostles went on in this simple manner until <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a>, January 12, A.D. 27, when he called them together and formally ordained them as ambassadors of the kingdom and preachers of its glad tidings. And soon thereafter they prepared to start for <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Judea">Judea</a> on their first public preaching tour.</p>
