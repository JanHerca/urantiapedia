His brothers <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Jude">Jude</a> were very much hurt because they were not called to this conference. Up to this time they had regarded themselves as belonging to Jesus‚Äô inner circle of associates. But Jesus planned to have no close relatives as members of this corps of apostolic directors of the kingdom. This failure to include <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> and Jude among the chosen few, together with his apparent aloofness from his mother ever since the experience at <a href="/en/topic/Cana">Cana</a>, was the starting point of an ever-widening gulf between Jesus and his family. This situation continued throughout his public ministry‚Äîthey very nearly rejected him‚Äîand these differences were not fully removed until after his death and resurrection. His mother constantly wavered between attitudes of fluctuating faith and hope, and increasing emotions of disappointment, humiliation, and despair. Only <a href="/en/topic/Ruth_(Old_Testament)">Ruth</a>, the youngest, remained unswervingly loyal to her father-brother.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p0_2">138:0.2</a></small></sup>  Until after the resurrection, Jesus‚Äô entire family had very little to do with his ministry.

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p1_1">138:1.1</a></small></sup>  The next day, <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a>, June 23, A.D. 26, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> imparted his final instructions to the six. He directed them to go forth, <a href="/en/topic/two-and-two">two and two</a>, to teach the glad tidings of the kingdom. He forbade them to baptize and advised against public preaching. He went on to explain that later he would permit them to preach in public, but that for a season, and for many reasons, he desired them to acquire practical experience in dealing personally with their fellow men. Jesus purposed to make their first tour entirely one of <i>personal work.</i> Although this announcement was something of a disappointment to the <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a>, still they saw, at least in part, Jesus‚Äô reason for thus beginning the proclamation of the kingdom, and they started out in good heart and with confident enthusiasm. He sent them forth by twos, <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James</a> and <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a> going to <a href="/en/topic/Kheresa">Kheresa</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> to <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, while <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a> went to <a href="/en/topic/Tarichea">Tarichea</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_1_27"><a href="#fn_a1_1_27">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p1_2">138:1.2</a></small></sup>  Before they began this first two weeks of service, Jesus announced to them that he desired to ordain twelve apostles to continue the work of the kingdom after his departure and authorized each of them to choose one man from among his early converts for membership in the projected corps of apostles. John spoke up, asking: ‚ÄúBut, <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, will these six men come into our midst and share all things equally with us who have been with you since the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> and have heard all your teaching in preparation for this, our first labor for the kingdom?‚Äù And Jesus replied: ‚ÄúYes, John, the men you choose shall become one with us, and you will teach them all that pertains to the kingdom, even as I have taught you.‚Äù After thus speaking, Jesus left them.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_4"><a href="#fn_a1_2_4">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_2_40"><a href="#fn_a1_2_40">[3]</a></sup></p>

In substance Andrew said: ‚ÄúThe Master is right; we are too few to encompass this work. There is need for more teachers, and the Master has manifested great confidence in us inasmuch as he has intrusted us with the choosing of these six new <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a>.‚Äù This morning, as they separated to go to their work, there was a bit of concealed depression in each heart. They knew they were going to miss Jesus, and besides their fear and timidity, this was not the way they had pictured the kingdom of heaven being inaugurated.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_3_41"><a href="#fn_a1_3_41">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p1_4">138:1.4</a></small></sup>  It had been arranged that the six were to labor for two weeks, after which they were to return to the home of <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a> for a conference.

Jesus did everything humanly possible, consistent with his dedication to the doing of his Father‚Äôs will, to retain the confidence and affection of his family. In this matter he did his full duty and more.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_4_2"><a href="#fn_a1_4_2">[5]</a></sup></p>

It was a great temptation to use his potential powers to release him, but once more he resigned himself to ‚Äúwait upon the Father‚Äôs will.‚Äù</p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p2_1">138:2.1</a></small></sup>  This first missionary tour of the six was eminently successful.

When they assembled about Jesus, they all wanted to talk at once, but <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> assumed charge, and as he called upon them one by one, they made their formal reports to the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and presented their nominations for the six new <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_1_18"><a href="#fn_a2_1_18">[6]</a></sup></p>
