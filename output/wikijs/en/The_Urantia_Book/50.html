<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p0_1">50:0.1</a></small></sup>  WHILE belonging to the order of <a href="/en/topic/Lanonandek_Sons">Lanonandek Sons</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Planetary_Princes">Planetary Princes</a> are so specialized in service that they are commonly regarded as a distinct group. After their <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> certification as secondary Lanonandeks, these local universe Sons are assigned to the reserves of their order on the constellation headquarters. From here they are assigned to various duties by the System Sovereign and eventually commissioned as Planetary Princes and sent forth to rule the evolving inhabited worlds.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p0_2">50:0.2</a></small></sup>  The signal for a System Sovereign to act in the matter of assigning a ruler to a given planet is the reception of a request from the <a href="/en/topic/Life_Carriers">Life Carriers</a> for the dispatch of an administrative head to function on this planet whereon they have established life and developed intelligent evolutionary beings. All <a href="/en/topic/planets">planets</a> which are inhabited by evolutionary mortal creatures have assigned to them a planetary ruler of this order of sonship.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_2_3"><a href="#fn_a0_2_3">[1]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_2_7"><a href="#fn_s0_2_7">[1]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. MISSION OF THE PRINCES </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p1_1">50:1.1</a></small></sup>  The Planetary Prince and his assistant brethren represent the nearest personalized approach (aside from incarnation) that the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> can make to the lowly creatures of time and space. True, the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> touches the creatures of the realms through his spirit, but the Planetary Prince is <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> of the orders of personal Sons extending out from Paradise to the children of men. The <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a> comes very near in the persons of the <a href="/en/topic/guardians_of_destiny">guardians of destiny</a> and other angelic beings; the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a> lives in man by the prepersonal presence of the <a href="/en/topic/Mystery_Monitors">Mystery Monitors</a>; but the Planetary Prince represents the last effort of the Eternal Son and his Sons to draw near you. On a newly inhabited world the Planetary Prince is the sole representative of complete divinity, springing from the Creator Son (the offspring of the Universal Father and the Eternal Son) and the <a href="/en/topic/local_universe_Mother_Spirits">Divine Minister</a> (the universe Daughter of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite">Infinite</a> Spirit).</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p1_2">50:1.2</a></small></sup>  The prince of a newly inhabited world is surrounded by a loyal corps of helpers and assistants and by large numbers of the <a href="/en/topic/ministering_spirits">ministering spirits</a>. But the directing corps of such new worlds must be of the lower orders of the administrators of a system in order to be innately sympathetic with, and understanding of, the planetary problems and difficulties. And all of this effort to provide sympathetic rulership for the evolutionary worlds entails the increased liability that these near-human personalities may be led astray by the exaltation of their own minds over and above the will of the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme_Rulers">Supreme Rulers</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p1_3">50:1.3</a></small></sup>  Being quite alone as representatives of divinity on the individual planets, these Sons are tested severely, and <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a> has suffered the misfortune of several rebellions. In the creation of the <a href="/en/topic/System_Sovereigns">System Sovereigns</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Planetary_Princes">Planetary Princes</a> there occurs the personalization of a concept that has been getting farther and farther away from the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a>, and there is an increasing danger of losing the sense of proportion as to one’s <a href="/en/topic/self-importance">self-importance</a> and a greater likelihood of failure to keep a proper grasp of the values and relationships of the numerous orders of divine beings and their gradations of authority. That the Father is not personally present in the local universe also imposes a certain test of <a href="/en/topic/faith">faith</a> and loyalty on all these Sons.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p1_4">50:1.4</a></small></sup>  But not often do these world princes fail in their missions of organizing and administering the inhabited spheres, and their success greatly facilitates the subsequent missions of the <a href="/en/topic/Material_Sons">Material Sons</a>, who come to engraft the higher forms of creature life on the primitive men of the worlds. Their rule also does much to prepare the planets for the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Sons_of_God">Paradise Sons of God</a>, who subsequently come to <a href="/en/topic/Roman_magistrate_in_Rome">judge</a> the worlds and to inaugurate successive dispensations.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_4_4"><a href="#fn_a1_4_4">[3]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. PLANETARY ADMINISTRATION </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p2_1">50:2.1</a></small></sup>  All <a href="/en/topic/Planetary_Princes">Planetary Princes</a> are under the universe administrative jurisdiction of <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a>, the chief executive of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a>, while in immediate authority they are subject to the executive mandates of the <a href="/en/topic/System_Sovereigns">System Sovereigns</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p2_2">50:2.2</a></small></sup>  The Planetary Princes may at any time seek the counsel of the Melchizedeks, their former instructors and sponsors, but they are not arbitrarily required to ask for such assistance, and if such aid is not voluntarily requested, the Melchizedeks do not interfere with the planetary administration. These world rulers may also avail themselves of the advice of the <a href="/en/topic/four_and_twenty_counselors">four and twenty counselors</a>, assembled from the bestowal worlds of the system. In <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> these counselors are at present all natives of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. And there is an analogous <a href="/en/topic/council_of_seventy">council of seventy</a> at the <a href="/en/topic/constellations">constellation</a> headquarters also selected from the evolutionary beings of the realms.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p2_3">50:2.3</a></small></sup>  The rule of the evolutionary planets in their early and unsettled careers is largely autocratic. The <a href="/en/topic/Planetary_Princes">Planetary Princes</a> organize their specialized groups of assistants from among their corps of planetary aids. They usually surround themselves with a <a href="/en/topic/Supreme_Lanonandek_councils">supreme council</a> of twelve, but this is variously chosen and diversely constituted on the different worlds. A Planetary Prince may also have as assistants one or more of the third order of his own group of sonship and sometimes, on certain worlds, one of his own order, a secondary Lanonandek associate.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p2_4">50:2.4</a></small></sup>  The entire <a href="/en/topic/corporeal_staffs_of_Planetary_Princes">staff</a> of a world ruler consists of personalities of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a> and certain types of higher evolved beings and <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortals</a> from other worlds. Such a staff averages about one thousand, and as the planet progresses, this corps of helpers may be increased up to one hundred thousand or more. At any time need is felt for more helpers, the Planetary Princes have only to make request of their brothers, the <a href="/en/topic/System_Sovereigns">System Sovereigns</a>, and the petition is granted forthwith.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_4_33"><a href="#fn_a2_4_33">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p2_5">50:2.5</a></small></sup>  Planets vary greatly in nature and organization and in administration, but all provide for tribunals of <a href="/en/topic/justice">justice</a>. The judicial system of the local universe has its beginnings in the tribunals of a Planetary Prince, which are presided over by a member of his personal staff; the decrees of such courts reflect a highly fatherly and discretionary attitude. All problems involving more than the regulation of the planetary inhabitants are subject to appeal to the higher tribunals, but the affairs of his world domain are largely adjusted in accordance with the personal discretion of the prince.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p2_6">50:2.6</a></small></sup>  The roving commissions of conciliators serve and supplement the planetary tribunals, and both spirit and physical controllers are subject to the findings of these conciliators. But no arbitrary execution is ever carried out without the consent of the <a href="/en/topic/Constellation_Fathers">Constellation Father</a>, for the “<a href="/en/topic/Most_Highs">Most Highs</a> rule in the kingdoms of men<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_6_22"><a href="#fn_a2_6_22">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p2_7">50:2.7</a></small></sup>  The controllers and <a href="/en/topic/transformers">transformers</a> of planetary assignment are also able to collaborate with <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a> and other orders of <a href="/en/topic/celestial_beings">celestial beings</a> in rendering these latter personalities visible to mortal creatures. On special occasions the seraphic helpers and even the Melchizedeks can and do make themselves visible to the inhabitants of the evolutionary worlds. The principal reason for bringing mortal <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascenders</a> from the system capital as a part of the <a href="/en/topic/corporeal_staffs_of_Planetary_Princes">staff</a> of the Planetary Prince is to facilitate communication with the inhabitants of the realm.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_7_3"><a href="#fn_a2_7_3">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_7_33"><a href="#fn_a2_7_33">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_7_5"><a href="#fn_a2_7_5">[6]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. THE PRINCE’S CORPOREAL STAFF </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p3_1">50:3.1</a></small></sup>  On going to a young world, a Planetary Prince usually takes with him a group of volunteer ascending beings from the local system headquarters. These <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascenders</a> accompany the prince as advisers and helpers in the work of early race improvement. This corps of material helpers constitutes the connecting link between the prince and the world races. The <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> Prince, <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia">Caligastia</a>, had a <a href="/en/topic/corporeal_staffs_of_Planetary_Princes">corps of one hundred</a> such helpers.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_1_4"><a href="#fn_s3_1_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p3_2">50:3.2</a></small></sup>  Such volunteer assistants are citizens of a system capital, and none of them have fused with their indwelling Adjusters. The status of the Adjusters of such volunteer servers remains as of the residential standing on the system headquarters while these <a href="/en/topic/morontia_progressors">morontia progressors</a> temporarily revert to a former material state.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p3_3">50:3.3</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Life_Carriers">Life Carriers</a>, the architects of form, provide such volunteers with new physical bodies, which they occupy for the periods of their planetary sojourn. These personality forms, while exempt from the ordinary diseases of the realms, are, like the early morontia bodies, subject to certain accidents of a mechanical nature.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_3_2"><a href="#fn_s3_3_2">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p3_4">50:3.4</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/corporeal_staffs_of_Planetary_Princes">prince’s corporeal staff</a> are usually removed from the planet in connection with the next adjudication at the time of the second Son’s arrival on the sphere. Before leaving, they customarily assign their various duties to their mutual offspring and to certain superior native volunteers. On those worlds where these helpers of the prince have been permitted to mate with the superior groups of the native races, such offspring usually succeed them.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_4_18"><a href="#fn_a3_4_18">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p3_5">50:3.5</a></small></sup>  These assistants to the Planetary Prince seldom mate with the world races, but they do always mate among themselves. Two classes of beings result from these unions: the primary type of midway creatures and certain high types of material beings who remain attached to the prince’s staff after their parents have been removed from the planet at the time of the arrival of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a>. These children do not mate with the mortal races except in certain emergencies and then only by direction of the Planetary Prince. In such an event, their children—the grandchildren of the corporeal staff—are in status as of the superior races of their day and generation. All the offspring of these semimaterial assistants of the Planetary Prince are Adjuster indwelt.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_5_19"><a href="#fn_a3_5_19">[8]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_5_4"><a href="#fn_s3_5_4">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s3_5_2"><a href="#fn_s3_5_2">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p3_6">50:3.6</a></small></sup>  At the end of the prince’s dispensation, when the time comes for this “reversion <a href="/en/topic/corporeal_staffs_of_Planetary_Princes">staff</a>” to be returned to the system headquarters for the resumption of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> career, these <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascenders</a> present themselves to the <a href="/en/topic/Life_Carriers">Life Carriers</a> for the purpose of yielding up their material bodies. They enter the transition slumber and awaken delivered from their mortal investment and clothed with morontia forms, ready for seraphic <a href="/en/topic/transportation">transportation</a> back to the system capital, where their detached Adjusters await them. They are a whole dispensation behind their <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> class, but they have gained a unique and extraordinary experience, a rare chapter in the career of an ascending mortal.</p>
<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 4. THE PLANETARY HEADQUARTERS AND SCHOOLS </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p4_1">50:4.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/corporeal_staffs_of_Planetary_Princes">prince’s corporeal staff</a> early organize the planetary schools of training and culture, wherein the cream of the evolutionary races are instructed and then sent forth to teach these better ways to their people. These schools of the prince are located at the material headquarters of the planet.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p4_2">50:4.2</a></small></sup>  Much of the physical work connected with the establishment of this headquarters city is performed by the corporeal staff. Such headquarters cities, or settlements, of the early times of the Planetary Prince are very different from what a <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> mortal might imagine. They are, in comparison with later ages, simple, being characterized by mineral embellishment and by relatively advanced material construction. And all of this stands in contrast with the Adamic regime centering around a <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a> headquarters, from which their work in behalf of the races is prosecuted during the second dispensation of the universe Sons.</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p4_3">50:4.3</a></small></sup>  In the headquarters settlement on your world every human habitation was provided with abundance of land. Although the remote tribes continued in hunting and food foraging, the students and teachers in the Prince’s schools were all agriculturists and horticulturists. The time was about equally divided between the following pursuits:<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_3_21"><a href="#fn_a4_3_21">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_3_26"><a href="#fn_a4_3_26">[10]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_3_4"><a href="#fn_s4_3_4">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s4_3_3"><a href="#fn_s4_3_3">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p4_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p4_9">50:4.9</a></small></sup>  A Planetary Prince is not visible to mortal beings; it is a test of faith to believe the representations of the semimaterial beings of his <a href="/en/topic/corporeal_staffs_of_Planetary_Princes">staff</a>. But these schools of culture and training are well adapted to the needs of each planet, and there soon develops a keen and laudatory <a href="/en/topic/rivalry">rivalry</a> among the races of men in their efforts to gain entrance to these various institutions of learning.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_9_33"><a href="#fn_a4_9_33">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p4_10">50:4.10</a></small></sup>  From such a world center of culture and achievement there gradually radiates to all peoples an uplifting and civilizing influence which slowly and certainly transforms the evolutionary races. Meantime the <a href="/en/topic/education">educated</a> and spiritualized children of the surrounding peoples who have been adopted and trained in the prince’s schools are returning to their native groups and, to the best of their ability, are there establishing new and potent centers of learning and culture which they carry on according to the plan of the prince’s schools.</p>
<p id="p4_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p4_11">50:4.11</a></small></sup>  On <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> these plans for planetary progress and cultural advancement were well under way, proceeding most satisfactorily, when the whole enterprise was brought to a rather sudden and most inglorious end by <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia">Caligastia</a>’s adherence to the <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">Lucifer rebellion</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_11_23"><a href="#fn_a4_11_23">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_11_25"><a href="#fn_a4_11_25">[12]</a></sup></p>

The wreck of these schools was speedy and complete.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_12_6"><a href="#fn_s4_12_6">[5]</a></sup></p>

These loyalists were encouraged by the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_receivers">Melchizedek receivers</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>, and in later times their descendants did much to uphold the planetary concepts of truth and righteousness. The work of these loyal evangels helped to prevent the total obliteration of spiritual truth on Urantia. These courageous souls and their descendants kept alive some knowledge of the Father’s rule and preserved for the world races the concept of the successive planetary dispensations of the various orders of divine Sons.</p>

<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p5_1">50:5.1</a></small></sup>  The loyal princes of the inhabited worlds are permanently attached to the planets of their original assignment. <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Paradise Sons</a> and their dispensations may come and go, but a successful Planetary Prince continues on as the ruler of his realm.

<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p5_2">50:5.2</a></small></sup>  The progress of civilization is hardly alike on any two planets.

These evolving beings spend their waking hours either in seeking food or in fighting, offensively or defensively. The food quest is paramount in the minds of these early ancestors of subsequent <a href="/en/topic/civilization">civilization</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_4_29"><a href="#fn_a5_4_29">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_4_36"><a href="#fn_a5_4_36">[15]</a></sup></p>

More and more attention is devoted to the technique of war. Homes are fortified, and the <a href="/en/topic/clans">clans</a> are solidified by mutual fear and by the inculcation of hate for foreign groups. Self-preservation is a pursuit which always follows <a href="/en/topic/self-maintenance">self-maintenance</a>.</p>
<p id="p5_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p5_6">50:5.6</a></small></sup>  3. <i>The material-comfort era.</i> After food problems have been partially solved and some degree of security has been attained, the additional leisure is utilized to promote personal comfort. <a href="/en/topic/luxuries">Luxury</a> vies with necessity in occupying the center of the stage of human activities. Such an age is all too often characterized by tyranny, intolerance, gluttony, and drunkenness. The weaker elements of the races incline towards excesses and brutality. Gradually these pleasure-seeking weaklings are subjugated by the more strong and truth-loving elements of the advancing <a href="/en/topic/civilization">civilization</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_6_2"><a href="#fn_a5_6_2">[16]</a></sup></p>

The effort to execute knowledge results in wisdom, and when a culture has learned how to profit and improve by experience, civilization has really arrived. Food, security, and material comfort still dominate society, but many forward-looking individuals are hungering for knowledge and thirsting for wisdom.

The society of this age becomes ethical, and the mortals of such an era are truly becoming moral beings. Wise moral beings are capable of establishing human brotherhood on such a progressing world.

Religion is completing the ascent from the emotional domains of fear and superstition to the high levels of cosmic wisdom and personal spiritual experience. Education aspires to the attainment of meanings, and culture grasps at cosmic relationships and true values.
