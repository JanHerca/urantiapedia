This discourse was intended to be his last appeal to the Jewish people and the final indictment of his vehement enemies and would-be destroyers—the scribes, <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Sadducees">Sadducees</a>, and the chief rulers of <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a>.

The money-changers and the merchandisers had not dared again to enter the temple since Jesus and the aroused multitude had driven them out the previous day. Before beginning the discourse, Jesus tenderly looked down upon this audience which was so soon to hear his farewell public address of mercy to mankind coupled with his last denunciation of the false teachers and the bigoted rulers of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>.</p>

We have persistently sought peace, but the leaders of Israel will not have it. By rejecting the truth of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and the light of heaven, they are aligning themselves on the side of error and darkness. There cannot be peace between light and darkness, between life and death, between truth and error.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_3"><a href="#fn_a1_2_3">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_2_8"><a href="#fn_a1_2_8">[4]</a></sup></p>

This people was called to become the light of the world, to show forth the spiritual glory of a God-knowing race, but you have so far departed from the fulfillment of your divine privileges that your leaders are about to commit the supreme folly of all the ages in that they are on the verge of finally rejecting the gift of God to all men and for all ages—the revelation of the love of the Father in heaven for all his creatures on earth.</p>

In the name of the Father who sent me, I solemnly warn you that you are about to lose your position in the world as the standard-bearers of eternal truth and the custodians of the divine law. I am just now offering you your last chance to come forward and repent, to signify your intention to seek God with all your hearts and to enter, like little children and by sincere faith, into the security and salvation of the kingdom of heaven.</p>

He did not hear this last offer of mercy to the Jewish rulers because he was still in conference with a certain group of Sadducean relatives and friends with whom he had lunched, and with whom he was conferring as to the most fitting manner of dissociating himself from Jesus and his fellow apostles. It was while listening to the Master’s final indictment of the Jewish leaders and rulers that Judas finally and fully made up his mind to forsake the gospel movement and wash his hands of the whole enterprise. Nevertheless, he left the temple in company with the twelve, went with them to <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Olivet">Mount Olivet</a>, where, with his fellow apostles, he listened to that fateful discourse on the destruction of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and the end of the Jewish nation, and remained with them that Tuesday night at the new camp near <a href="/en/topic/Gethsemane">Gethsemane</a>.</p>
