But on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> the Planetary Prince arrived almost half a million years after the appearance of human will.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_1_4"><a href="#fn_s0_1_4">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p0_2">66:0.2</a></small></sup>  About five hundred thousand years ago and concurrent with the appearance of the six colored or Sangik races, <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia">Caligastia</a>, the Planetary Prince, arrived on Urantia. There were almost one-half billion primitive human beings on earth at the time of the Prince’s arrival, and they were well scattered over <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Asia">Asia</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Africa">Africa</a>.

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p1_1">66:1.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia">Caligastia</a> was a Lanonandek Son, number 9,344 of the secondary order<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. He was experienced in the administration of the affairs of the local universe in general and, during later ages, with the management of the local system of <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> in particular.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_1_4"><a href="#fn_s1_1_4">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p1_2">66:1.2</a></small></sup>  Prior to the reign of <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer">Lucifer</a> in Satania, Caligastia had been attached to the council of the Life Carrier advisers on <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a>. Lucifer elevated Caligastia to a position on his personal staff, and he acceptably filled five successive assignments of honor and trust.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p1_3">66:1.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia">Caligastia</a> very early sought a commission as Planetary Prince, but repeatedly, when his request came up for approval in the constellation councils, it would fail to receive the assent of the <a href="/en/topic/Constellation_Fathers">Constellation Fathers</a>. Caligastia seemed especially desirous of being sent as planetary ruler to a decimal or life-modification world. His petition had several times been disapproved before he was finally assigned to <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p1_4">66:1.4</a></small></sup>  Caligastia went forth from <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> to his trust of world dominion with an enviable record of loyalty and devotion to the welfare of the universe of his origin and sojourn, notwithstanding a certain characteristic restlessness coupled with a tendency to disagree with the established order in certain minor matters.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p1_5">66:1.5</a></small></sup>  I was present on Jerusem when the brilliant <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia">Caligastia</a> departed from the system capital. No prince of the planets ever embarked upon a career of world rulership with a richer preparatory experience or with better prospects than did Caligastia on that eventful day one-half million years ago. One thing is certain: As I executed my assignment of putting the narrative of that event on the <a href="/en/topic/broadcasts_(celestial)">broadcasts</a> of the local universe, I never for one moment entertained even in the slightest degree any idea that this noble Lanonandek would so shortly betray his sacred trust of planetary custody and so horribly stain the fair name of his exalted order of universe sonship. I really regarded <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> as being among the five or six most fortunate planets in all <a href="/en/topic/Satania">Satania</a> in that it was to have such an experienced, brilliant, and original mind at the helm of world affairs. I did not then comprehend that Caligastia was insidiously falling in love with himself; I did not then so fully understand the subtleties of personality <a href="/en/topic/pride">pride</a>.</p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p2_1">66:2.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Planetary_Prince_of_Urantia">Planetary Prince of Urantia</a> was not sent out on his mission alone but was accompanied by the usual corps of assistants and administrative helpers.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p2_2">66:2.2</a></small></sup>  At the head of this group was <a href="/en/topic/Daligastia">Daligastia</a>, the associate-assistant of the Planetary Prince. Daligastia was also a secondary Lanonandek Son, being number 319,407 of that order. He ranked as an assistant at the time of his assignment as <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia">Caligastia</a>’s associate.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_2_4"><a href="#fn_s2_2_4">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p2_3">66:2.3</a></small></sup>  The planetary staff included a large number of angelic co-operators and a host of other <a href="/en/topic/celestial_beings">celestial beings</a> assigned to advance the interests and promote the welfare of the human races. But from your standpoint the most interesting group of all were the corporeal members of the Prince’s staff—sometimes referred to as <i>the <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia_one_hundred">Caligastia one hundred</a>.</i><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_3_3"><a href="#fn_s2_3_3">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p2_4">66:2.4</a></small></sup>  These one hundred rematerialized members of the Prince’s staff were chosen by <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia">Caligastia</a> from over 785,000 ascendant citizens of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> who volunteered for embarkation on the <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> adventure. Each one of the chosen one hundred was from a different planet, and none of them were from Urantia.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_4_30"><a href="#fn_a2_4_30">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_4_29"><a href="#fn_a2_4_29">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p2_5">66:2.5</a></small></sup>  These Jerusemite volunteers were brought by seraphic transport direct from the system capital to Urantia, and upon arrival they were held enseraphimed until they could be provided with personality forms of the dual nature of special planetary service, literal bodies consisting of flesh and blood but also attuned to the life circuits of the system.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p2_6">66:2.6</a></small></sup>  Sometime before the arrival of these one hundred <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> citizens, the two supervising <a href="/en/topic/Life_Carriers">Life Carriers</a> resident on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>, having previously perfected their plans, petitioned Jerusem and <a href="/en/topic/Edentia">Edentia</a> for permission to transplant the <a href="/en/topic/life_plasm">life plasm</a> of one hundred selected survivors of the <a href="/en/topic/Andon_and_Fonta">Andon and Fonta</a> stock into the material bodies to be projected for the corporeal members of the Prince’s staff. The request was granted on Jerusem and approved on Edentia.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_6_3"><a href="#fn_s2_6_3">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p2_7">66:2.7</a></small></sup>  Accordingly, fifty males and fifty females of the Andon and Fonta posterity, representing the survival of the best strains of that unique race, were chosen by the Life Carriers. With one or two exceptions these <a href="/en/topic/Andonites">Andonite</a> contributors to the advancement of the race were strangers to one another. They were assembled from widely separated places by co-ordinated Thought Adjuster direction and seraphic guidance at the threshold of the planetary headquarters of the Prince. Here the one hundred human subjects were given into the hands of the highly skilled volunteer commission from <a href="/en/topic/Avalon">Avalon</a>, who directed the material extraction of a portion of the life plasm of these Andon descendants. This living material was then transferred to the <a href="/en/topic/body,_human">material bodies</a> constructed for the use of the one hundred Jerusemite members of the Prince’s staff. Meantime, these newly arrived citizens of the system capital were held in the sleep of seraphic transport.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_7_33"><a href="#fn_a2_7_33">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p2_8">66:2.8</a></small></sup>  These transactions, together with the literal creation of special bodies for the <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia_one_hundred">Caligastia one hundred</a>, gave origin to numerous legends, many of which subsequently became confused with the later traditions concerning the planetary installation of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_8_3"><a href="#fn_s2_8_3">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p2_9">66:2.9</a></small></sup>  The entire transaction of repersonalization, from the time of the arrival of the seraphic transports bearing the one hundred <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a> volunteers until they became conscious, threefold beings of the realm, consumed exactly ten days.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. DALAMATIA—THE CITY OF THE PRINCE </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p3_1">66:3.1</a></small></sup>  The headquarters of the Planetary Prince was situated in the <a href="/en/topic/Persian_Gulf">Persian Gulf</a> region of those days, in the district corresponding to later <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p3_2">66:3.2</a></small></sup>  The climate and landscape in the Mesopotamia of those times were in every way favorable to the undertakings of the Prince’s staff and their assistants, very different from conditions which have sometimes since prevailed. It was necessary to have such a favoring climate as a part of the natural environment designed to induce primitive Urantians to make certain initial advances in culture and <a href="/en/topic/civilization">civilization</a>. The one great task of those ages was to transform man from a hunter to a herder, with the hope that later on he would evolve into a peace-loving, home-abiding farmer.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_2_5"><a href="#fn_a3_2_5">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p3_3">66:3.3</a></small></sup>  The headquarters of the Planetary Prince on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> was typical of such stations on a young and developing sphere. The nucleus of the Prince’s settlement was a very simple but beautiful city, enclosed within a wall forty feet high. This world center of culture was named <a href="/en/topic/Dalamatia">Dalamatia</a> in honor of <a href="/en/topic/Daligastia">Daligastia</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p3_4">66:3.4</a></small></sup>  The city was laid out in ten subdivisions with the headquarters mansions of the ten councils of the <a href="/en/topic/corporeal_staffs_of_Planetary_Princes">corporeal staff</a> situated at the centers of these subdivisions. Centermost in the city was the <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a> of the unseen Father. The administrative headquarters of the Prince and his associates was arranged in twelve chambers immediately grouped about the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> itself.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p3_5">66:3.5</a></small></sup>  The buildings of <a href="/en/topic/Dalamatia">Dalamatia</a> were all one <a href="/en/topic/Genesis,_Book_of">story</a> except the council headquarters, which were two stories, and the central temple of the Father of all, which was small but three stories in height.</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p3_6">66:3.6</a></small></sup>  The city represented the best practices of those early days in building material—<a href="/en/topic/brick">brick</a>. Very little stone or wood was used. Home building and village architecture among the surrounding peoples were greatly improved by the Dalamatian example.</p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p3_7">66:3.7</a></small></sup>  Near the Prince’s headquarters there dwelt all colors and strata of human beings. And it was from these near-by tribes that <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> students of the Prince’s schools were recruited. Although these early schools of <a href="/en/topic/Dalamatia">Dalamatia</a> were crude, they provided all that could be done for the men and women of that primitive age.</p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p3_8">66:3.8</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Prince’s_corporeal_staff">Prince’s corporeal staff</a> continuously gathered about them the superior individuals of the surrounding tribes and, after training and inspiring these students, sent them back as teachers and leaders of their respective peoples.</p>
<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 4. EARLY DAYS OF THE ONE HUNDRED </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p4_1">66:4.1</a></small></sup>  The arrival of the Prince’s staff created a profound impression. While it required almost a thousand years for the news to spread abroad, those tribes near the Mesopotamian headquarters were tremendously influenced by the teachings and conduct of the one hundred new sojourners on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. And much of your subsequent mythology grew out of the garbled legends of these early days when these members of the Prince’s staff were repersonalized on Urantia as <a href="/en/topic/supermen">supermen</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p4_2">66:4.2</a></small></sup>  The serious obstacle to the good influence of such extraplanetary teachers is the tendency of <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> to regard them as gods, but aside from the technique of their appearance on earth the <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia_one_hundred">Caligastia one hundred</a>—fifty men and fifty women—did not resort to supernatural methods nor superhuman manipulations.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_2_14"><a href="#fn_a4_2_14">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p4_3">66:4.3</a></small></sup>  But the <a href="/en/topic/corporeal_staffs_of_Planetary_Princes">corporeal staff</a> were nonetheless superhuman. They began their mission on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> as extraordinary threefold beings:</p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p4_4">66:4.4</a></small></sup>  1. They were corporeal and relatively human, for they embodied the actual <a href="/en/topic/life_plasm">life plasm</a> of one of the human races, the Andonic life plasm of Urantia.</p>
<p id="p4_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p4_5">66:4.5</a></small></sup>  These one hundred members of the Prince’s staff were divided equally as to sex and in accordance with their previous mortal status. Each person of this group was capable of becoming coparental to some new order of physical being, but they had been carefully instructed to resort to parenthood only under certain conditions. It is customary for the <a href="/en/topic/corporeal_staffs_of_Planetary_Princes">corporeal staff</a> of a Planetary Prince to procreate their successors sometime prior to retiring from special planetary service. Usually this is at, or shortly after, the time of the arrival of the Planetary <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Eve">Eve</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p4_6">66:4.6</a></small></sup>  These special beings therefore had little or no idea as to what type of material creature would be produced by their sexual union. And they never did know; before the time for such a step in the prosecution of their world work the entire regime was upset by rebellion, and those who later functioned in the parental role had been isolated from the life currents of the system.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_6_3"><a href="#fn_s4_6_3">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p4_7">66:4.7</a></small></sup>  In skin color and <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a> these materialized members of <a href="/en/topic/corporeal_staffs_of_Planetary_Princes">Caligastia’s staff</a> followed the Andonic race. They partook of food as did the <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of the realm with this difference: The re-created bodies of this group were fully satisfied by a nonflesh diet. This was one of the considerations which determined their residence in a warm region abounding in fruits and nuts. The practice of subsisting on a nonflesh diet dates from the times of the <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia_one_hundred">Caligastia one hundred</a>, for this custom spread near and far to affect the eating habits of many surrounding tribes, groups of origin in the once exclusively meat-eating evolutionary races.</p>
<p id="p4_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p4_8">66:4.8</a></small></sup>  2. The one hundred were material but superhuman beings, having been reconstituted on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> as unique men and women of a high and special order.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_8_3"><a href="#fn_s4_8_3">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p4_9">66:4.9</a></small></sup>  This group, while enjoying provisional citizenship on <a href="/en/topic/Jerusem">Jerusem</a>, were as yet unfused with their <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Thought Adjusters</a>; and when they volunteered and were accepted for planetary service in liaison with the descending orders of sonship, their Adjusters were detached. But these Jerusemites were superhuman beings—they possessed souls of ascendant growth. During the mortal life in the flesh the <a href="/en/topic/soul">soul</a> is of embryonic estate; it is born (resurrected) in the morontia life and experiences growth through the successive morontia worlds. And the souls of the <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia_one_hundred">Caligastia one hundred</a> had thus expanded through the progressive experiences of the seven mansion worlds to citizenship status on Jerusem.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_9_33"><a href="#fn_a4_9_33">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p4_10">66:4.10</a></small></sup>  In conformity to their instructions the staff did not engage in sexual reproduction, but they did painstakingly study their personal constitutions, and they carefully explored every imaginable phase of intellectual (mind) and morontia (soul) liaison. And it was during the thirty-third year of their sojourn in <a href="/en/topic/Dalamatia">Dalamatia</a>, long before the wall was completed, that number two and number seven of the Danite group accidentally discovered a phenomenon attendant upon the liaison of their morontia selves (supposedly nonsexual and nonmaterial); and the result of this adventure proved to be <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> of the primary midway creatures. This new being was wholly visible to the planetary staff and to their celestial associates but was not visible to the men and women of the various human tribes. Upon authority of the Planetary Prince the entire <a href="/en/topic/corporeal_staffs_of_Planetary_Princes">corporeal staff</a> undertook the production of similar beings, and all were successful, following the instructions of the pioneer Danite pair. Thus did the Prince’s staff eventually bring into being the original corps of 50,000 primary <a href="/en/topic/midwayers">midwayers</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_10_17"><a href="#fn_a4_10_17">[9]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_10_3"><a href="#fn_s4_10_3">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s4_10_5"><a href="#fn_s4_10_5">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p4_11">66:4.11</a></small></sup>  These mid-type creatures were of great service in carrying on the affairs of the world’s headquarters. They were invisible to human beings, but the primitive sojourners at Dalamatia were taught about these unseen semispirits, and for ages they constituted the sum total of the spirit world to these evolving <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a>.</p>

<p id="p5_20"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p5_20">66:5.20</a></small></sup>  The great obstacle in the way of promoting hygiene among these ignorant peoples consisted in the fact that the real causes of many diseases were too small to be seen by the naked eye, and also because they all held <a href="/en/topic/fire">fire</a> in superstitious regard. It required thousands of years to persuade them to burn refuse. In the meantime they were urged to bury their decaying rubbish.
