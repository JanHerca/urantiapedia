<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p0_1">179:0.1</a></small></sup>  DURING the afternoon of this <a href="/en/topic/Thursday">Thursday</a>, when <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a> reminded the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> about the approaching <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> and inquired concerning his plans for its celebration, he had in mind the Passover supper which was due to be eaten on the evening of the next day, <a href="/en/topic/Fridays">Friday</a>. It was the custom to begin the preparations for the celebration of the Passover not later than noon of the preceding day. And since the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> reckoned the day as beginning at sunset, this meant that Saturday’s Passover supper would be eaten on Friday night, sometime before the midnight hour.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_1_2"><a href="#fn_a0_1_2">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_1_21"><a href="#fn_a0_1_21">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p0_2">179:0.2</a></small></sup>  The apostles were, therefore, entirely at a loss to understand the Master’s announcement that they would celebrate the Passover one day early. They thought, at least some of them did, that he knew he would be placed under arrest before the time of the Passover supper on Friday night and was therefore calling them together for a special supper on this Thursday evening. Others thought that this was merely a special occasion which was to precede the regular Passover celebration.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p0_3">179:0.3</a></small></sup>  The apostles knew that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had celebrated other Passovers without the lamb; they knew that he did not personally participate in any sacrificial service of the Jewish system. He had many times partaken of the paschal lamb as a guest, but always, when he was the host, no lamb was served. It would not have been a great surprise to the apostles to have seen the lamb omitted even on <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> night, and since this supper was given one day earlier, they thought nothing of its absence.</p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p0_4">179:0.4</a></small></sup>  After receiving the greetings of welcome extended by the father and mother of <a href="/en/topic/John_Mark">John Mark</a>, the apostles went immediately to the upper chamber while Jesus lingered behind to talk with the Mark family.</p>
<p id="p0_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p0_5">179:0.5</a></small></sup>  It had been understood beforehand that the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> was to celebrate this occasion alone with his twelve apostles; therefore no servants were provided to wait upon them.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. THE DESIRE FOR PREFERENCE </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p1_1">179:1.1</a></small></sup>  When the apostles had been shown upstairs by <a href="/en/topic/John_Mark">John Mark</a>, they beheld a large and commodious chamber, which was completely furnished for the supper, and observed that the bread, <a href="/en/topic/wine">wine</a>, water, and herbs were all in readiness on one end of the table. Except for the end on which rested the bread and wine, this long table was surrounded by thirteen reclining couches, just such as would be provided for the celebration of the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> in a well-to-do Jewish household.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p1_2">179:1.2</a></small></sup>  As the twelve entered this upper chamber, they noticed, just inside the door, the pitchers of water, the basins, and towels for laving their dusty <a href="/en/topic/feet">feet</a>; and since no servant had been provided to render this service, the apostles began to look at one another as soon as John Mark had left them, and each began to think within himself, Who shall wash our feet? And each likewise thought that it would not be he who would thus seem to act as the servant of the others.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p1_3">179:1.3</a></small></sup>  As they stood there, debating in their hearts, they surveyed the seating arrangement of the table, taking note of the higher divan of the host with one couch on the right and eleven arranged around the table on up to opposite this second seat of honor on the host’s right.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p1_4">179:1.4</a></small></sup>  They expected the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> to arrive any moment, but they were in a quandary as to whether they should seat themselves or await his coming and depend on him to assign them their places. While they hesitated, <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas</a> stepped over to the seat of honor, at the left of the host, and signified that he intended there to recline as the preferred guest. This act of Judas immediately stirred up a heated dispute among the other apostles. Judas had no sooner seized the seat of honor than <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John Zebedee</a> laid claim to the next preferred seat, the one on the right of the host. <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a> was so enraged at this assumption of choice positions by Judas and <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John</a> that, as the other angry apostles looked on, he marched clear around the table and took his place on the lowest couch, the end of the seating order and just opposite to that chosen by John <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a>. Since others had seized the high seats, <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> thought to choose the lowest, and he did this, not merely in protest against the unseemly pride of his brethren, but with the hope that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, when he should come and see him in the place of least honor, would call him up to a higher one, thus displacing one who had presumed to honor himself.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p1_5">179:1.5</a></small></sup>  With the highest and the lowest positions thus occupied, the rest of the apostles chose places, some near Judas and some near Peter, until all were located. They were seated about the U-shaped table on these reclining divans in the following order: on the right of the Master, John; on the left, Judas, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Zelotes">Simon Zelotes</a>, Matthew, <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James Zebedee</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Alpheus_twins">Alpheus twins</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a>, Thomas, and Simon Peter.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_5_24"><a href="#fn_a1_5_24">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p1_6">179:1.6</a></small></sup>  They are gathered together to celebrate, at least in spirit, an institution which antedated even <a href="/en/topic/Moses">Moses</a> and referred to the times when their fathers were slaves in <a href="/en/topic/Egypt">Egypt</a>. This supper is their last rendezvous with <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, and even in such a solemn setting, under the leadership of <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas</a> the <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a> are led once more to give way to their old predilection for honor, <a href="/en/topic/preference">preference</a>, and personal exaltation.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p1_7">179:1.7</a></small></sup>  They were still engaged in voicing angry recriminations when the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> appeared in the doorway, where he hesitated a moment as a look of disappointment slowly crept over his face. Without comment he went to his place, and he did not disturb their seating arrangement<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p1_8">179:1.8</a></small></sup>  They were now ready to begin the supper, except that their <a href="/en/topic/feet">feet</a> were still unwashed, and they were in anything but a pleasant frame of mind. When the Master arrived, they were still engaged in making uncomplimentary remarks about one another, to say nothing of the thoughts of some who had sufficient emotional control to refrain from publicly expressing their feelings.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. BEGINNING THE SUPPER </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p2_1">179:2.1</a></small></sup>  For a few moments after the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> had gone to his place, not a word was spoken. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> looked them all over and, relieving the tension with a smile, said: “I have greatly desired to eat this <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> with you. I wanted to eat with you once more before I suffered, and realizing that my hour has come, I arranged to have this supper with you tonight, for, as concerns the morrow, we are all in the hands of the Father, whose will I have come to execute. I shall not again eat with you until you sit down with me in the kingdom which my Father will give me when I have finished that for which he sent me into this world<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>.”</p>

<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p2_2">179:2.2</a></small></sup>  After the <a href="/en/topic/wine">wine</a> and the water had been mixed, they brought the cup to Jesus, who, when he had received it from the hand of <a href="/en/topic/Thaddeus">Thaddeus</a>, held it while he offered thanks. And when he had finished offering thanks, he said: “Take this cup and divide it among yourselves and, when you partake of it, realize that I shall not again drink with you the fruit of the vine since this is our last supper. When we sit down again in this manner, it will be in the kingdom to come<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p2_3">179:2.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> began thus to talk to his apostles because he knew that his hour had come. He understood that the time had come when he was to return to the Father, and that his work on earth was almost finished<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> knew he had revealed the Father’s love on earth and had shown forth his mercy to mankind, and that he had completed that for which he came into the world, even to the receiving of all power and authority in heaven and on earth. Likewise, he knew <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a> had fully made up his mind to deliver him that night into the hands of his enemies. He fully realized that this traitorous betrayal was the work of Judas, but that it also pleased <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer">Lucifer</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Satan">Satan</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia">Caligastia</a> the <a href="/en/topic/devil">prince of darkness</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>. But he feared none of those who sought his spiritual overthrow any more than he feared those who sought to accomplish his physical death. The Master had but one anxiety, and that was for the safety and salvation of his chosen followers. And so, with the full knowledge that the Father had put all things under his authority, the Master now prepared to enact the parable of brotherly love.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_3_0"><a href="#fn_a2_3_0">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_3_37"><a href="#fn_a2_3_37">[5]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. WASHING THE APOSTLES’ FEET </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p3_1">179:3.1</a></small></sup>  After drinking <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> cup of the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a>, it was the Jewish custom for the host to arise from the table and wash his <a href="/en/topic/hands">hands</a>. Later on in the meal and after the second cup, all of the guests likewise rose up and washed their hands. Since the apostles knew that their <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> never observed these rites of <a href="/en/topic/ceremonies">ceremonial</a> hand <a href="/en/topic/washing">washing</a>, they were very curious to know what he intended to do when, after they had partaken of this first cup, he arose from the table and silently made his way over to near the door, where the water pitchers, basins, and towels had been placed. And their curiosity grew into astonishment as they saw the Master remove his outer garment, gird himself with a towel, and begin to pour water into one of the foot basins. Imagine the amazement of these twelve men, who had so recently refused to wash one another’s <a href="/en/topic/feet">feet</a>, and who had engaged in such unseemly disputes about positions of honor at the table, when they saw him make his way around the unoccupied end of the table to the lowest seat of the feast, where <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a> reclined, and, kneeling down in the attitude of a servant, make ready to wash <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a>’s feet. As the Master knelt, all twelve arose as one man to their feet; even the traitorous <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas</a> so far forgot his infamy for a moment as to arise with his fellow apostles in this expression of surprise, respect, and utter amazement.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p3_2">179:3.2</a></small></sup>  There stood Simon Peter, looking down into the upturned face of his Master. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> said nothing; it was not necessary that he should speak. His attitude plainly revealed that he was minded to wash Simon Peter’s feet. Notwithstanding his frailties of the flesh, Peter loved the Master. This Galilean fisherman was the first human being wholeheartedly to believe in the divinity of Jesus <i>and</i> to make full and public confession of that belief<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>. And Peter had never since really doubted the divine nature of the Master. Since Peter so revered and honored Jesus in his heart, it was not strange that his soul resented the thought of Jesus’ kneeling there before him in the attitude of a menial servant and proposing to wash his feet as would a slave. When Peter presently collected his wits sufficiently to address the Master, he spoke the heart feelings of all his fellow apostles.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p3_3">179:3.3</a></small></sup>  After a few moments of this great embarrassment, <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> said, “<a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, do you really mean to wash my <a href="/en/topic/feet">feet</a>?” And then, looking up into Peter’s face, Jesus said: “You may not fully understand what I am about to do, but hereafter you will know the meaning of all these things.” Then <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a>, drawing a long breath, said, “Master, you shall never wash my feet!” And each of the apostles nodded their approval of Peter’s firm declaration of refusal to allow Jesus thus to humble himself before them<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b9"><a href="#fn_b9">[9]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p3_4">179:3.4</a></small></sup>  The dramatic appeal of this unusual scene at first touched the heart of even <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>; but when his vainglorious intellect passed judgment upon the spectacle, he concluded that this gesture of humility was just one more episode which conclusively proved that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> would never qualify as <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a>’s <a href="/en/topic/Deliverer">deliverer</a>, and that he had made no mistake in the decision to desert the Master’s cause.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p3_5">179:3.5</a></small></sup>  As they all stood there in breathless amazement, Jesus said: “<a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, I declare that, if I do not wash your <a href="/en/topic/feet">feet</a>, you will have no part with me in that which I am about to perform.” When Peter heard this declaration, coupled with the fact that Jesus continued kneeling there at his feet, he made one of those decisions of blind acquiescence in compliance with the wish of one whom he respected and loved. As it began to dawn on <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a> that there was attached to this proposed enactment of <a href="/en/topic/service">service</a> some signification that determined one’s future connection with the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s work, he not only became reconciled to the thought of allowing Jesus to wash his feet but, in his characteristic and impetuous manner, said: “Then, Master, wash not my feet only but also my hands and my head<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p3_6">179:3.6</a></small></sup>  As the Master made ready to begin <a href="/en/topic/washing">washing</a> Peter’s feet, he said: “He who is already clean needs only to have his feet washed. You who sit with me tonight are clean—but not all. But the dust of your feet should have been washed away before you sat down at meat with me. And besides, I would perform this service for you as a parable to illustrate the meaning of a new commandment which I will presently give you<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b11"><a href="#fn_b11">[11]</a></sup>.”</p>

When <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had finished washing the feet of the twelve, he donned his cloak, returned to his place as host, and after looking over his bewildered apostles, said:<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b12"><a href="#fn_b12">[12]</a></sup></p>

If, then, the Master has washed your feet, why was it that you were unwilling to wash one another’s feet?
