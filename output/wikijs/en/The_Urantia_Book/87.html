<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p0_1">87:0.1</a></small></sup>  THE ghost cult evolved as an offset to the hazards of bad luck; its primitive religious observances were the outgrowth of anxiety about bad luck and of the inordinate fear of the dead. None of these early religions had much to do with the recognition of <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> or with reverence for the superhuman; their rites were mostly negative, designed to avoid, expel, or coerce <a href="/en/topic/ghosts">ghosts</a>. The ghost cult was nothing more nor less than <a href="/en/topic/insurance">insurance</a> against disaster; it had nothing to do with investment for higher and future returns.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p0_2">87:0.2</a></small></sup>  Man has had a long and bitter struggle with the ghost cult. Nothing in human <a href="/en/topic/history">history</a> is designed to excite more pity than this picture of man’s abject slavery to ghost-spirit fear. With the birth of this very fear mankind started on the upgrade of religious evolution. Human imagination cast off from the shores of self and will not again find anchor until it arrives at the concept of a true Deity, a real <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_2_6"><a href="#fn_s0_2_6">[1]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. GHOST FEAR </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p1_1">87:1.1</a></small></sup>  Death was feared because <a href="/en/topic/death">death</a> meant the liberation of another <a href="/en/topic/ghosts">ghost</a> from its physical body. The ancients did their best to prevent death, to avoid the trouble of having to contend with a new ghost. They were always anxious to induce the ghost to leave the scene of death, to embark on the journey to <a href="/en/topic/deadland">deadland</a>. The ghost was feared most of all during the supposed transition period between its emergence at the time of death and its later departure for the ghost homeland, a vague and primitive concept of pseudo <a href="/en/topic/heaven">heaven</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_1_6"><a href="#fn_s1_1_6">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_1_4"><a href="#fn_s1_1_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p1_2">87:1.2</a></small></sup>  Though the savage credited ghosts with supernatural powers, he hardly conceived of them as having supernatural intelligence. Many tricks and stratagems were practiced in an effort to hoodwink and deceive the ghosts; civilized man still pins much faith on the hope that an outward manifestation of piety will in some manner deceive even an omniscient <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p1_3">87:1.3</a></small></sup>  The primitives feared sickness because they observed it was often a harbinger of <a href="/en/topic/death">death</a>. If the tribal medicine man failed to cure an afflicted individual, the sick man was usually removed from the family hut, being taken to a smaller one or left in the open air to die alone. A house in which death had occurred was usually destroyed; if not, it was always avoided, and this fear prevented early man from building substantial dwellings. It also militated against the establishment of permanent villages and <a href="/en/topic/cities">cities</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p1_4">87:1.4</a></small></sup>  The savages sat up all night and talked when a member of the clan died; they feared they too would die if they fell asleep in the vicinity of a corpse. Contagion from the corpse substantiated the fear of the dead, and all peoples, at one time or another, have employed elaborate purification <a href="/en/topic/ceremonies">ceremonies</a> designed to cleanse an individual after contact with the dead. The ancients believed that light must be provided for a corpse; a dead body was never permitted to remain in the dark. In the twentieth century, <a href="/en/topic/candles">candles</a> are still burned in death chambers, and men still sit up with the dead. So-called civilized man has hardly yet completely eliminated the fear of dead bodies from his philosophy of life.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_4_6"><a href="#fn_s1_4_6">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p1_5">87:1.5</a></small></sup>  But despite all this fear, men still sought to trick the ghost. If the death hut was not destroyed, the corpse was removed through a hole in the wall, never by way of the door. These measures were taken to confuse the ghost, to prevent its tarrying, and to insure against its return. Mourners also returned from a funeral by a different road, lest the ghost follow. Backtracking and scores of other tactics were practiced to insure that the ghost would not return from the grave. The sexes often exchanged clothes in order to deceive the ghost. Mourning costumes were designed to disguise survivors; later on, to show respect for the dead and thus appease the <a href="/en/topic/ghosts">ghosts</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. GHOST PLACATION </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p2_1">87:2.1</a></small></sup>  In <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> the negative program of <a href="/en/topic/ghosts">ghost</a> <a href="/en/topic/placation">placation</a> long preceded the positive program of spirit coercion and supplication. The first acts of human worship were phenomena of defense, not reverence. Modern man deems it wise to insure against fire; so the savage thought it the better part of wisdom to provide insurance against ghost bad luck. The effort to secure this protection constituted the techniques and rituals of the ghost cult.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_6"><a href="#fn_s2_1_6">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p2_2">87:2.2</a></small></sup>  It was once thought that the great desire of a ghost was to be quickly “laid” so that it might proceed undisturbed to <a href="/en/topic/deadland">deadland</a>. Any error of commission or omission in the acts of the living in the ritual of laying the ghost was sure to delay its progress to ghostland. This was believed to be displeasing to the ghost, and an angered ghost was supposed to be a source of calamity, misfortune, and unhappiness.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p2_3">87:2.3</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/funerals">funeral</a> service originated in man’s effort to induce the <a href="/en/topic/ghosts">ghost</a> soul to depart for its future home, and the funeral sermon was originally designed to instruct the new ghost how to get there. It was the custom to provide food and clothes for the ghost’s journey, these articles being placed in or near the grave. The savage believed that it required from three days to a year to “lay the ghost”—to get it away from the vicinity of the grave. The <a href="/en/topic/Eskimos">Eskimos</a> still believe that the soul stays with the body three days.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_3_6"><a href="#fn_s2_3_6">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_3_4"><a href="#fn_s2_3_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p2_4">87:2.4</a></small></sup>  Silence or <a href="/en/topic/mourning">mourning</a> was observed after a death so that the ghost would not be attracted back home. Self-torture—wounds—was a common form of mourning. Many advanced teachers tried to stop this, but they failed. Fasting and other forms of <a href="/en/topic/self-denial">self-denial</a> were thought to be pleasing to the ghosts, who took pleasure in the discomfort of the living during the transition period of lurking about before their actual departure for <a href="/en/topic/deadland">deadland</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p2_5">87:2.5</a></small></sup>  Long and frequent periods of mourning inactivity were one of the great obstacles to civilization’s advancement. Weeks and even months of each year were literally wasted in this nonproductive and useless mourning. The fact that professional mourners were hired for funeral occasions indicates that mourning was a ritual, not an evidence of sorrow. Moderns may mourn the dead out of respect and because of bereavement, but the ancients did this because of <i>fear.</i></p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p2_6">87:2.6</a></small></sup>  The names of the <a href="/en/topic/dead">dead</a> were never spoken. In fact, they were often banished from the <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a>. These names became taboo, and in this way the languages were constantly impoverished. This eventually produced a multiplication of symbolic speech and figurative expression, such as “the name or day one never mentions.”</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p2_7">87:2.7</a></small></sup>  The ancients were so anxious to get rid of a <a href="/en/topic/ghosts">ghost</a> that they offered it everything which might have been desired during life. Ghosts wanted wives and servants; a well-to-do savage expected that at least one slave wife would be buried alive at his death. It later became the custom for a widow to commit suicide on her husband’s grave. When a child died, the mother, aunt, or grandmother was often strangled in order that an adult ghost might accompany and care for the child ghost. And those who thus gave up their lives usually did so willingly; indeed, had they lived in violation of custom, their fear of ghost wrath would have denuded life of such few pleasures as the primitives enjoyed.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p2_8">87:2.8</a></small></sup>  It was customary to dispatch a large number of subjects to accompany a dead chief; <a href="/en/topic/slaves">slaves</a> were killed when their master died that they might serve him in ghostland. The <a href="/en/topic/Borneans">Borneans</a> still provide a courier companion; a slave is speared to death to make the ghost journey with his deceased master. Ghosts of murdered persons were believed to be delighted to have the ghosts of their murderers as slaves; this notion motivated men to head hunting.</p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p2_9">87:2.9</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/ghosts">Ghosts</a> supposedly enjoyed the smell of <a href="/en/topic/food">food</a>; food offerings at funeral feasts were once universal. The primitive method of saying <a href="/en/topic/grace_(God’s_mercy)">grace</a> was, before eating, to throw a bit of food into the fire for the purpose of appeasing the spirits, while mumbling a magic formula.</p>
<p id="p2_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p2_10">87:2.10</a></small></sup>  The dead were supposed to use the ghosts of the tools and weapons that were theirs in life. To break an article was to “kill it,” thus releasing its ghost to pass on for service in ghostland. Property sacrifices were also made by burning or burying. Ancient <a href="/en/topic/funerals">funeral</a> wastes were enormous. Later races made paper models and substituted drawings for real objects and persons in these death sacrifices. It was a great advance in civilization when the inheritance of kin replaced the burning and burying of property. The <a href="/en/topic/Iroquois">Iroquois</a> <a href="/en/topic/Indians_(American)">Indians</a> made many reforms in funeral waste. And this conservation of property enabled them to become the most powerful of the northern red men. Modern man is not supposed to fear ghosts, but custom is strong, and much terrestrial wealth is still consumed on funeral rituals and death ceremonies.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. ANCESTOR WORSHIP </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p3_1">87:3.1</a></small></sup>  The advancing ghost cult made <a href="/en/topic/ancestor_worship">ancestor worship</a> inevitable since it became the connecting link between common <a href="/en/topic/ghosts">ghosts</a> and the higher spirits, the evolving gods. The early gods were simply glorified departed humans.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_1_6"><a href="#fn_s3_1_6">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s3_1_4"><a href="#fn_s3_1_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p3_2">87:3.2</a></small></sup>  Ancestor worship was originally more of a fear than a worship, but such beliefs did definitely contribute to the further spread of ghost fear and worship. Devotees of the early ancestor-ghost cults even feared to <a href="/en/topic/yawn">yawn</a> lest a malignant ghost enter their bodies at such a time.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p3_3">87:3.3</a></small></sup>  The custom of <a href="/en/topic/adoption">adopting children</a> was to make sure that someone would provide offerings after death for the peace and progress of the soul. The savage lived in fear of the <a href="/en/topic/ghosts">ghosts</a> of his fellows and spent his spare time planning for the safe conduct of his own ghost after death.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p3_4">87:3.4</a></small></sup>  Most tribes instituted an all-souls’ feast at least once a year. The <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a> had twelve ghost feasts and accompanying <a href="/en/topic/ceremonies">ceremonies</a> each year. Half the days of the year were dedicated to some sort of ceremony associated with these ancient cults. One Roman emperor tried to reform these practices by reducing the number of feast days to 135 a year.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p3_5">87:3.5</a></small></sup>  The ghost cult was in continuous evolution. As <a href="/en/topic/ghosts">ghosts</a> were envisioned as passing from the incomplete to the higher phase of existence, so did the cult eventually progress to the worship of spirits, and even gods. But regardless of varying beliefs in more advanced spirits, all tribes and races once believed in ghosts.</p>
<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 4. GOOD AND BAD SPIRIT GHOSTS </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p4_1">87:4.1</a></small></sup>  Ghost fear was the fountainhead of all <a href="/en/topic/Roman_Catholic_Church">world religion</a>; and for ages many tribes clung to the old belief in one class of <a href="/en/topic/ghosts">ghosts</a>. They taught that man had good <a href="/en/topic/luck">luck</a> when the ghost was pleased, bad luck when he was angered.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_1_22"><a href="#fn_a4_1_22">[1]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_1_6"><a href="#fn_s4_1_6">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s4_1_4"><a href="#fn_s4_1_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p4_2">87:4.2</a></small></sup>  As the cult of ghost fear expanded, there came about the recognition of higher types of spirits, spirits not definitely identifiable with any individual human. They were graduate or glorified ghosts who had progressed beyond the domain of ghostland to the higher realms of spiritland.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_2_6"><a href="#fn_s4_2_6">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p4_3">87:4.3</a></small></sup>  The notion of two kinds of spirit <a href="/en/topic/ghosts">ghosts</a> made slow but sure progress throughout the world. This new <a href="/en/topic/dual_spiritism">dual spiritism</a> did not have to spread from tribe to tribe; it sprang up independently all over the world. In influencing the expanding evolutionary mind, the power of an idea lies not in its reality or reasonableness but rather in its <i>vividness</i> and the universality of its ready and simple application.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_3_4"><a href="#fn_a4_3_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p4_4">87:4.4</a></small></sup>  Still later the imagination of man envisioned the concept of both good and bad supernatural agencies; some ghosts never evolved to the level of good spirits. The early monospiritism of ghost fear was gradually evolving into a dual spiritism, a new concept of the invisible control of earthly affairs. At last good <a href="/en/topic/luck">luck</a> and bad luck were pictured as having their respective controllers. And of the two classes, the group that brought bad luck were believed to be the more active and numerous.</p>
<p id="p4_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p4_5">87:4.5</a></small></sup>  When the doctrine of good and bad spirits finally matured, it became the most widespread and persistent of all religious beliefs. This dualism represented a great religio-philosophic advance because it enabled man to account for both good luck and bad luck while at the same time believing in supermortal beings who were to some extent consistent in their behavior. The spirits could be counted on to be either good or bad; they were not thought of as being completely temperamental as the early <a href="/en/topic/ghosts">ghosts</a> of the monospiritism of most primitive religions had been conceived to be. Man was at last able to conceive of supermortal forces that were consistent in behavior, and this was one of the most momentous discoveries of truth in the entire <a href="/en/topic/history">history</a> of the evolution of <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> and in the expansion of human philosophy.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_5_22"><a href="#fn_a4_5_22">[1]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_5_6"><a href="#fn_s4_5_6">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p4_6">87:4.6</a></small></sup>  Evolutionary religion has, however, paid a terrible price for the concept of <a href="/en/topic/dual_spiritism">dual spiritism</a>. Man’s early philosophy was able to reconcile spirit constancy with the vicissitudes of temporal fortune only by postulating two kinds of spirits, one good and the other bad. And while this belief did enable man to reconcile the variables of chance with a concept of unchanging supermortal forces, this doctrine has ever since made it difficult for religionists to conceive of cosmic unity. The gods of evolutionary religion have generally been opposed by the forces of darkness.</p>
<p id="p4_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p4_7">87:4.7</a></small></sup>  The tragedy of all this lies in the fact that, when these ideas were taking root in the primitive mind of man, there really were no bad or disharmonious spirits in all the world. Such an unfortunate situation did not develop until after the Caligastic rebellion and only persisted until <a href="/en/topic/Pentecost_(bestowal_of_Spirit_of_Truth)">Pentecost</a>. The concept of good and evil as cosmic co-ordinates is, even in the twentieth century, very much alive in human philosophy; most of the world’s religions still carry this cultural birthmark of the long-gone days of the emerging <a href="/en/topic/ghosts">ghost</a> cults.</p>
<h2 id="p5" class="toc-header"><a href="#p5" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 5. THE ADVANCING GHOST CULT </h2>
<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p5_1">87:5.1</a></small></sup>  Primitive man viewed the spirits and <a href="/en/topic/ghosts">ghosts</a> as having almost unlimited rights but no duties; the spirits were thought to regard man as having manifold duties but no rights. The spirits were believed to look down upon man as constantly failing in the discharge of his spiritual duties. It was the general belief of mankind that ghosts levied a continuous tribute of service as the price of noninterference in human affairs, and the least mischance was laid to ghost activities. Early humans were so afraid they might overlook some honor due the gods that, after they had sacrificed to all known spirits, they did another turn to the “unknown gods,” just to be thoroughly safe<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s5_1_6"><a href="#fn_s5_1_6">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s5_1_4"><a href="#fn_s5_1_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p5_2">87:5.2</a></small></sup>  And now the simple ghost cult is followed by the practices of the more advanced and relatively complex spirit-ghost cult, the service and worship of the higher spirits as they evolved in man’s primitive imagination. Religious ceremonial must keep pace with spirit evolution and progress. The expanded cult was but the art of self-maintenance practiced in relation to belief in supernatural beings, self-adjustment to spirit environment. Industrial and military organizations were adjustments to natural and social environments. And as marriage arose to meet the demands of bisexuality, so did religious organization evolve in response to the belief in higher spirit forces and spiritual beings. Religion represents man’s adjustment to his illusions of the mystery of chance. Spirit fear and subsequent worship were adopted as insurance against misfortune, as prosperity policies.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_2_3"><a href="#fn_a5_2_3">[3]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s5_2_6"><a href="#fn_s5_2_6">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s5_2_2"><a href="#fn_s5_2_2">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s5_2_5"><a href="#fn_s5_2_5">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p5_3">87:5.3</a></small></sup>  The savage visualizes the good spirits as going about their business, requiring little from human beings. It is the bad <a href="/en/topic/ghosts">ghosts</a> and spirits who must be kept in good humor. Accordingly, primitive peoples paid more attention to their malevolent ghosts than to their benign spirits.</p>
<p id="p5_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p5_4">87:5.4</a></small></sup>  Human prosperity was supposed to be especially provocative of the envy of evil spirits, and their method of retaliation was to strike back through a human agency and by the technique of the <i><a href="/en/topic/evil_eye">evil eye</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.</i> That phase of the cult which had to do with spirit avoidance was much concerned with the machinations of the evil eye. The fear of it became almost world-wide. Pretty women were veiled to protect them from the evil eye; subsequently many women who desired to be considered beautiful adopted this practice<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>. Because of this fear of bad spirits, children were seldom allowed out after dark, and the early prayers always included the petition, “deliver us from the evil eye.”</p>
<p id="p5_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p5_5">87:5.5</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Koran">Koran</a> contains a whole chapter devoted to the evil eye and magic spells, and the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> fully believed in them. The whole <a href="/en/topic/phallic_cult">phallic cult</a> grew up as a defense against the evil eye. The organs of reproduction were thought to be the only fetish which could render it powerless. The evil eye gave origin to <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> superstitions respecting <a href="/en/topic/birthmarks">prenatal marking</a> of children, maternal impressions, and the cult was at one time well-nigh universal.</p>

<p id="p6_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p6_1">87:6.1</a></small></sup>  When men believed in <a href="/en/topic/ghosts">ghosts</a> only, religious ritual was more personal, less organized, but the recognition of higher spirits necessitated the employment of “higher spiritual methods” in dealing with them. This attempt to improve upon, and to elaborate, the technique of spirit propitiation led directly to the creation of defenses against the spirits. Man felt helpless indeed before the uncontrollable forces operating in terrestrial life, and his feeling of inferiority drove him to attempt to find some compensating adjustment, some technique for evening the odds in the one-sided struggle of man versus the cosmos.</p>
<p id="p6_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p6_2">87:6.2</a></small></sup>  In the early days of the cult, man’s efforts to influence ghost action were confined to <a href="/en/topic/propitiation">propitiation</a>, attempts by bribery to buy off ill <a href="/en/topic/luck">luck</a>.

Man’s <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> no longer was completely negativistic, nor did he stop with the effort to win good luck; he shortly began to devise schemes whereby he could compel spirit co-operation. No longer does the religionist stand defenseless before the unceasing demands of the spirit phantasms of his own devising; the savage is beginning to invent weapons wherewith he may coerce spirit action and compel spirit assistance.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s6_2_6"><a href="#fn_s6_2_6">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p6_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p6_3">87:6.3</a></small></sup>  Man’s first efforts at defense were directed against the <a href="/en/topic/ghosts">ghosts</a>. As the ages passed, the living began to devise methods of resisting the dead. Many techniques were developed for frightening ghosts and driving them away, among which may be cited the following:</p>
<p id="p6_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p6_4">87:6.4</a></small></sup>  1. Cutting off the head and tying up the body in the grave.</p>

<p id="p6_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p6_7">87:6.7</a></small></sup>  4. Burying under stones, one origin of the modern tombstone.</p>
<p id="p6_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p6_8">87:6.8</a></small></sup>  5. Cremation, a later-day invention to prevent <a href="/en/topic/ghosts">ghost</a> trouble.</p>
<p id="p6_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p6_9">87:6.9</a></small></sup>  6. Casting the body into the sea.</p>
<p id="p6_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p6_10">87:6.10</a></small></sup>  7. Exposure of the body to be eaten by wild animals.</p>
<p id="p6_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p6_11">87:6.11</a></small></sup>  Ghosts were supposed to be disturbed and frightened by <a href="/en/topic/noise">noise</a>; shouting, bells, and drums drove them away from the living; and these ancient methods are still in vogue at “wakes” for the dead. Foul-smelling concoctions were utilized to banish unwelcome spirits. Hideous images of the spirits were constructed so that they would flee in haste when they beheld themselves. It was believed that <a href="/en/topic/dogs">dogs</a> could detect the approach of <a href="/en/topic/ghosts">ghosts</a>, and that they gave warning by howling; that cocks would crow when they were near. The use of a cock as a weather vane is in perpetuation of this superstition.</p>
<p id="p6_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p6_12">87:6.12</a></small></sup>  Water was regarded as the best protection against ghosts. Holy <a href="/en/topic/water">water</a> was superior to all other forms, water in which the priests had washed their feet. Both <a href="/en/topic/fire">fire</a> and water were believed to constitute impassable barriers to ghosts. The <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a> carried water three times around the corpse; in the twentieth century the body is sprinkled with <a href="/en/topic/holy_water">holy water</a>, and hand washing at the cemetery is still a Jewish ritual. Baptism was a feature of the later water ritual; primitive <a href="/en/topic/bathing">bathing</a> was a religious ceremony<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>. Only in recent times has bathing become a sanitary practice.</p>
<p id="p6_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p6_13">87:6.13</a></small></sup>  But man did not stop with ghost <a href="/en/topic/coercion">coercion</a>; through religious ritual and other practices he was soon attempting to compel spirit action. <a href="/en/topic/exorcism">Exorcism</a> was the employment of one spirit to control or banish another, and these tactics were also utilized for frightening <a href="/en/topic/ghosts">ghosts</a> and spirits. The dual-spiritism concept of good and bad forces offered man ample opportunity to attempt to pit one agency against another, for, if a powerful man could vanquish a weaker one, then certainly a strong spirit could dominate an inferior ghost. Primitive <a href="/en/topic/cursing">cursing</a> was a coercive practice designed to overawe minor spirits. Later this custom expanded into the pronouncing of curses upon enemies.</p>
<p id="p6_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p6_14">87:6.14</a></small></sup>  It was long believed that by reverting to the usages of the more ancient mores the spirits and demigods could be forced into desirable action. Modern man is guilty of the same procedure. You address one another in common, everyday <a href="/en/topic/Latin">language</a>, but when you engage in <a href="/en/topic/prayer">prayer</a>, you resort to the older style of another generation, the so-called solemn style.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a6_14_10"><a href="#fn_a6_14_10">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p6_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p6_15">87:6.15</a></small></sup>  This doctrine also explains many religious-ritual reversions of a sex nature, such as <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> <a href="/en/topic/prostitution">prostitution</a>. These reversions to primitive customs were considered sure <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple_guards">guards</a> against many calamities. And with these simple-minded peoples all such performances were entirely free from what modern man would term promiscuity.</p>
<p id="p6_16"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p6_16">87:6.16</a></small></sup>  Next came the practice of ritual vows, soon to be followed by religious pledges and sacred <a href="/en/topic/oaths">oaths</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>.

Self-denial was subsequently looked upon as being a sure coercive; this was especially true in the matter of sex suppression.

No <a href="/en/topic/cults">cult</a> can survive unless it embodies some masterful mystery and conceals some worthful unattainable. Again, the new symbolism must not only be significant for the group but also meaningful to the individual. The forms of any serviceable symbolism must be those which the individual can carry out on his own initiative, and which he can also enjoy with his fellows. If the new cult could only be dynamic instead of static, it might really contribute something worth while to the progress of mankind, both temporal and spiritual.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a7_9_11"><a href="#fn_a7_9_11">[48]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_9_24"><a href="#fn_a7_9_24">[49]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_9_42"><a href="#fn_a7_9_42">[50]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_9_14"><a href="#fn_a7_9_14">[53]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_9_25"><a href="#fn_a7_9_25">[54]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_9_40"><a href="#fn_a7_9_40">[57]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s7_9_6"><a href="#fn_s7_9_6">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s7_9_4"><a href="#fn_s7_9_4">[2]</a></sup></p>

Every effective <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> unerringly develops a worthy symbolism, and its devotees would do well to prevent the crystallization of such a ritual into cramping, deforming, and stifling stereotyped ceremonials which can only handicap and retard all social, moral, and spiritual progress. No cult can survive if it retards moral growth and fails to foster spiritual progress.
