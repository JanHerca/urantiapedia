<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p2_1">151:2.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> and the group about him came to the conclusion that the parable of the <a href="/en/topic/sower">sower</a> was an allegory, that each feature had some hidden meaning, and so they decided to go to <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and ask for an explanation. Accordingly, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Peter</a> approached the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, saying: “We are not able to penetrate the meaning of this parable, and we desire that you explain it to us since you say it is given us to know the mysteries of the kingdom.” And when Jesus heard this, he said to Peter: “My son, I desire to withhold nothing from you, but first suppose you tell me what you have been talking about; what is your interpretation of the parable?”</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p2_2">151:2.2</a></small></sup>  After a moment of silence, Peter said: “Master, we have talked much concerning the parable, and this is the interpretation I have decided upon: The sower is the gospel preacher; the seed is the word of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. The seed which fell by the wayside represents those who do not understand the gospel teaching. The birds which snatched away the seed that fell upon the hardened ground represent <a href="/en/topic/Satan">Satan</a>, or the evil one, who steals away that which has been sown in the hearts of these ignorant ones. The seed which fell upon the rocky places, and which sprang up so suddenly, represents those superficial and unthinking persons who, when they hear the glad tidings, receive the message with joy; but because the <a href="/en/topic/truth">truth</a> has no real root in their deeper understanding, their devotion is short-lived in the face of tribulation and persecution. When trouble comes, these believers stumble; they fall away when tempted. The seed which fell among <a href="/en/topic/thorns">thorns</a> represents those who hear the word willingly, but who allow the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches to choke the word of truth so that it becomes unfruitful. Now the seed which fell on good ground and sprang up to bear, some thirty, some sixty, and some a hundredfold, represents those who, when they have heard the truth, receive it with varying degrees of appreciation—owing to their differing intellectual endowments—and hence manifest these varying degrees of religious experience<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p2_3">151:2.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, after listening to <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>’s interpretation of the parable, asked the other apostles if they did not also have suggestions to offer. To this invitation only <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a> responded. Said he: “<a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, while I recognize many good things about <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a>’s interpretation of the parable, I do not fully agree with him. My idea of this parable would be: The seed represents the gospel of the kingdom, while the <a href="/en/topic/sower">sower</a> stands for the <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> of the kingdom. The seed which fell by the wayside on hardened ground represents those who have heard but little of the gospel, along with those who are indifferent to the message, and who have hardened their hearts. The birds of the sky that snatched away the seed which fell by the wayside represent one’s habits of life, the temptation of evil, and the desires of the flesh. The seed which fell among the rocks stands for those emotional souls who are quick to receive new teaching and equally quick to give up the truth when confronted with the difficulties and realities of living up to this truth; they lack spiritual perception. The seed which fell among the thorns represents those who are attracted to the truths of the gospel; they are minded to follow its teachings, but they are prevented by the pride of life, jealousy, envy, and the anxieties of human existence<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>. The seed which fell on good soil, springing up to bear, some thirty, some sixty, and some a hundredfold, represents the natural and varying degrees of ability to comprehend truth and respond to its spiritual teachings by men and women who possess diverse endowments of spirit illumination.”</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p2_4">151:2.4</a></small></sup>  When Nathaniel had finished speaking, the apostles and their associates fell into serious discussion and engaged in earnest debate, some contending for the correctness of Peter’s interpretation, while almost an equal number sought to defend Nathaniel’s explanation of the parable. Meanwhile Peter and Nathaniel had withdrawn to the house, where they were involved in a vigorous and determined effort the one to convince and change the mind of the other.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p2_5">151:2.5</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> permitted this <a href="/en/topic/confusion">confusion</a> to pass the point of most intense expression; then he clapped his hands and called them about him. When they had all gathered around him once more, he said, “Before I tell you about this parable, do any of you have aught to say?” Following a moment of silence, <a href="/en/topic/Thomas_Didymus">Thomas</a> spoke up: “Yes, Master, I wish to say a few words. I remember that you once told us to beware of this very thing. You instructed us that, when using illustrations for our preaching, we should employ true stories, not <a href="/en/topic/fables">fables</a>, and that we should select a story best suited to the illustration of the one central and vital truth which we wished to teach the people, and that, having so used the story, we should not attempt to make a spiritual application of all the minor details involved in the telling of the story. I hold that <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a> are both wrong in their attempts to interpret this parable. I admire their ability to do these things, but I am equally sure that all such attempts to make a natural parable yield spiritual analogies in all its features can only result in confusion and serious misconception of the true purpose of such a parable. That I am right is fully proved by the fact that, whereas we were all of one mind an hour ago, now are we divided into two separate groups who hold different opinions concerning this parable and hold such opinions so earnestly as to interfere, in my opinion, with our ability fully to grasp the great truth which you had in mind when you presented this parable to the multitude and subsequently asked us to make comment upon it.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_5_25"><a href="#fn_a2_5_25">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_5_10"><a href="#fn_a2_5_10">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p2_6">151:2.6</a></small></sup>  The words which Thomas spoke had a quieting effect on all of them. He caused them to recall what <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had taught them on former occasions, and before Jesus resumed speaking, <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> arose, saying: “I am persuaded that Thomas is right, and I would like to have him tell us what meaning he attaches to the parable of the <a href="/en/topic/sower">sower</a>.” After Jesus had beckoned Thomas to speak, he said: “My brethren, I did not wish to prolong this discussion, but if you so desire, I will say that I think this parable was spoken to teach us one great truth. And that is that our teaching of the <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> of the kingdom, no matter how faithfully and efficiently we execute our divine commissions, is going to be attended by varying degrees of success; and that all such differences in results are directly due to conditions inherent in the circumstances of our ministry, conditions over which we have little or no control.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_6_25"><a href="#fn_a2_6_25">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_6_17"><a href="#fn_a2_6_17">[11]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p3_1">151:3.1</a></small></sup>  The apostles were parable-minded, so much so that the whole of the next evening was devoted to the further discussion of parables. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> introduced the evening’s conference by saying: “My beloved, you must always make a difference in teaching so as to suit your presentation of truth to the minds and hearts before you. When you stand before a multitude of varying intellects and temperaments, you cannot speak different words for each class of hearers, but you can tell a story to convey your teaching; and each group, even each individual, will be able to make his own interpretation of your parable in accordance with his own intellectual and spiritual endowments.

There are steep gorges leading up from the lake into the hills, and as the heated air rises in a pocket over the lake during the day, there is a tendency after sunset for the cooling air of the gorges to rush down upon the lake. These gales come on quickly and sometimes go away just as suddenly.</p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p5_3">151:5.3</a></small></sup>  It was just such an evening gale that caught the boat carrying <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> over to the other side on this <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a> evening.

Many of these niches were ancient sepulchres. About halfway up the hillside on a small, relatively level spot was the <a href="/en/topic/cemetery">cemetery</a> of the little village of <a href="/en/topic/Kheresa">Kheresa</a>. As Jesus and his associates passed near this burial ground, a lunatic who lived in these hillside caverns rushed up to them<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b25"><a href="#fn_b25">[25]</a></sup>.

<p id="p6_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p6_3">151:6.3</a></small></sup>  This man, whose name was <a href="/en/topic/Amos_(Prophet)">Amos</a>, was afflicted with a periodic form of insanity. There were considerable spells when he would find some clothing and deport himself fairly well among his fellows. During one of these lucid intervals he had gone over to <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a>, where he heard the preaching of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the apostles, and at that time had become a halfhearted believer in the gospel of the kingdom. But soon a stormy phase of his trouble appeared, and he fled to the tombs, where he moaned, cried out aloud, and so conducted himself as to terrorize all who chanced to meet him<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b27"><a href="#fn_b27">[27]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s6_3_3"><a href="#fn_s6_3_3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s6_3_2"><a href="#fn_s6_3_2">[5]</a></sup></p>

His troubles were mostly emotional—his brain was not grossly diseased.</p>
<p id="p6_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p6_5">151:6.5</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, looking down upon the man crouching like an animal at his feet, reached down and, taking him by the hand, stood him up and said to him: “<a href="/en/topic/Amos_(Prophet)">Amos</a>, you are not possessed of a devil; you have already heard the good news that you are a son of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. I command you to come out of this spell.” And when <a href="/en/topic/Amos_(brother_of_Jesus)">Amos</a> heard Jesus speak these words, there occurred such a transformation in his intellect that he was immediately restored to his right mind and the normal control of his emotions<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b29"><a href="#fn_b29">[29]</a></sup>.

<p id="p6_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p6_6">151:6.6</a></small></sup>  As the <a href="/en/topic/swine">swine</a> herders rushed into the village to spread the news of the taming of the lunatic, the <a href="/en/topic/dogs">dogs</a> charged upon a small and untended herd of about thirty swine and drove most of them over a precipice into the sea. And it was this incidental occurrence, in connection with the presence of Jesus and the supposed miraculous curing of the lunatic, that gave origin to the legend that Jesus had cured <a href="/en/topic/Amos_(Kheresa_lunatic)">Amos</a> by casting a legion of devils out of him, and that these devils had entered into the herd of swine, causing them forthwith to rush headlong to their destruction in the sea below. Before the day was over, this episode was published abroad by the swine tenders, and the whole village believed it. Amos most certainly believed this story; he saw the swine tumbling over the brow of the hill shortly after his troubled mind had quieted down, and he always believed that they carried with them the very evil spirits which had so long tormented and afflicted him. And this had a good deal to do with the permanency of his cure. It is equally true that all of Jesus’ apostles (save <a href="/en/topic/Thomas_Didymus">Thomas</a>) believed that the episode of the swine was directly connected with the cure of Amos<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b31"><a href="#fn_b31">[31]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a6_6_7"><a href="#fn_a6_6_7">[32]</a></sup></p>

Most of that day he was thronged by those who came in response to the word that <a href="/en/topic/Amos_(Prophet)">Amos</a> had been cured, and who were attracted by the story that the demons had gone out of the lunatic into the herd of swine. And so, after only one night of rest, early Tuesday morning Jesus and his friends were awakened by a delegation of these swine-raising gentiles who had come to urge that he depart from their midst. Said their spokesman to <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a>: “Fishermen of <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>, depart from us and take your prophet with you. We know he is a holy man, but the gods of our country do not know him, and we stand in danger of losing many swine. The fear of you has descended upon us, so that we pray you to go hence.” And when Jesus heard them, he said to Andrew, “Let us return to our place<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b32"><a href="#fn_b32">[32]</a></sup>.”</p>

Return to your own people and show them what great things God has done for you.” And Amos went about publishing that Jesus had cast a legion of devils out of his troubled soul, and that these evil spirits had entered into a herd of swine, driving them to quick destruction.
