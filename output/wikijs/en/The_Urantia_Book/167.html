<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p0_1">167:0.1</a></small></sup>  THROUGHOUT this period of the Perean ministry, when mention is made of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the apostles visiting the various localities where the seventy were at work, it should be recalled that, as a rule, only ten were with him since it was the practice to leave at least two of the apostles at <a href="/en/topic/Pella">Pella</a> to instruct the multitude. As Jesus prepared to go on to <a href="/en/topic/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a> and his brother, <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a>, returned to the Pella encampment to teach the crowds there assembled. When the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> left the camp at Pella to visit about <a href="/en/topic/Perea">Perea</a>, it was not uncommon for from three to five hundred of the campers to follow him. When he arrived at Philadelphia, he was accompanied by over six hundred followers.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p0_2">167:0.2</a></small></sup>  No miracles had attended the recent preaching tour through the <a href="/en/topic/Decapolis">Decapolis</a>, and, excepting the cleansing of the ten lepers, thus far there had been no miracles on this Perean mission. This was a period when the gospel was proclaimed with power, without miracles, and most of the time without the personal presence of Jesus or even of his apostles.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p0_3">167:0.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the ten apostles arrived at <a href="/en/topic/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> on <a href="/en/topic/Wednesday">Wednesday</a>, February 22, and spent <a href="/en/topic/Thursday">Thursday</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Fridays">Friday</a> resting from their recent travels and labors. That Friday night <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James</a> spoke in the synagogue, and a <a href="/en/topic/general_council">general council</a> was called for the following evening. They were much rejoiced over the progress of the gospel at Philadelphia and among the near-by villages. The <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> of <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a> also brought word of the further advancement of the kingdom throughout <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a>, as well as good news from <a href="/en/topic/Alexandria">Alexandria</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Damascus">Damascus</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. BREAKFAST WITH THE PHARISEES </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p1_1">167:1.1</a></small></sup>  There lived in <a href="/en/topic/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> a very wealthy and influential Pharisee who had accepted the teachings of <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a>, and who invited <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> to his house <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> morning for breakfast<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. It was known that Jesus was expected in Philadelphia at this time; so a large number of visitors, among them many <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a>, had come over from <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and from elsewhere. Accordingly, about forty of these leading men and a few lawyers were bidden to this breakfast, which had been arranged in honor of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p1_2">167:1.2</a></small></sup>  As Jesus lingered by the door, speaking with Abner, and after the host had seated himself, there came into the room one of the leading Pharisees of Jerusalem, a member of the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a>, and as was his habit, he made straight for the seat of honor at the left of the host<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>. But since this place had been reserved for the Master and that on the right for Abner, the host beckoned the Jerusalem Pharisee to sit four seats to the left, and this dignitary was much offended because he did not receive the seat of honor.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p1_3">167:1.3</a></small></sup>  Soon they were all seated and enjoying the visiting among themselves since the majority of those present were disciples of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> or else were friendly to the gospel. Only his enemies took notice of the fact that he did not observe the <a href="/en/topic/ceremonies">ceremonial</a> <a href="/en/topic/washing">washing</a> of his <a href="/en/topic/hands">hands</a> before he sat down to eat<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>. <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a> washed his hands at the beginning of the meal but not during the serving.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p1_4">167:1.4</a></small></sup>  Near the end of the meal there came in from the street a man long afflicted with a chronic disease and now in a dropsical condition. This man was a believer, having recently been baptized by Abner’s associates. He made no request of Jesus for healing, but the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> knew full well that this afflicted man came to this breakfast hoping thereby to escape the crowds which thronged him and thus be more likely to engage his attention. This man knew that few miracles were then being performed; however, he had reasoned in his heart that his sorry plight might possibly appeal to the Master’s compassion. And he was not mistaken, for, when he entered the room, both Jesus and the self-righteous Pharisee from <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> took notice of him. The Pharisee was not slow to voice his resentment that such a one should be permitted to enter the room. But Jesus looked upon the sick man and smiled so benignly that he drew near and sat down upon the floor. As the meal was ending, the Master looked over his fellow guests and then, after glancing significantly at the man with <a href="/en/topic/dropsy">dropsy</a>, said: “My friends, teachers in <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a> and learned lawyers, I would like to ask you a question: Is it lawful to heal the sick and afflicted on the <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> day, or not?” But those who were there present knew Jesus too well; they held their peace; they answered not his question<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_4_16"><a href="#fn_a1_4_16">[3]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_4_7"><a href="#fn_s1_4_7">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p1_5">167:1.5</a></small></sup>  Then went <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> over to where the sick man sat and, taking him by the hand, said: “Arise and go your way. You have not asked to be healed, but I know the desire of your heart and the faith of your soul<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>.” Before the man left the room, Jesus returned to his seat and, addressing those at the table, said: “Such works my Father does, not to tempt you into the kingdom, but to reveal himself to those who are already in the kingdom<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>. You can perceive that it would be like the Father to do just such things because which one of you, having a favorite animal that fell in the well on the Sabbath day, would not go right out and draw him up?” And since no one would answer him, and inasmuch as his host evidently approved of what was going on, Jesus stood up and spoke to all present: “My brethren, when you are bidden to a <a href="/en/topic/marriage_feast">marriage feast</a>, sit not down in the <a href="/en/topic/chief_seat">chief seat</a>, lest, perchance, a more honored man than you has been invited, and the host will have to come to you and request that you give your place to this other and honored guest. In this event, with shame you will be required to take a lower place at the table. When you are bidden to a feast, it would be the part of wisdom, on arriving at the festive table, to seek for the lowest place and take your seat therein, so that, when the host looks over the guests, he may say to you: ‘My friend, why sit in the seat of the least? come up higher’; and thus will such a one have glory in the presence of his fellow guests. Forget not, every one who exalts himself shall be humbled, while he who truly humbles himself shall be exalted<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>. Therefore, when you entertain at dinner or give a supper, invite not always your friends, your brethren, your kinsmen, or your rich neighbors that they in return may bid you to their feasts, and thus will you be recompensed. When you give a <a href="/en/topic/banquets">banquet</a>, sometimes bid the <a href="/en/topic/poor">poor</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/maimed">maimed</a>, and the <a href="/en/topic/blind">blind</a>. In this way you shall be blessed in your heart, for you well know that the <a href="/en/topic/lame">lame</a> and the halt cannot repay you for your loving ministry.”</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. PARABLE OF THE GREAT SUPPER </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p2_1">167:2.1</a></small></sup>  As <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> finished speaking at the breakfast table of the Pharisee, one of the lawyers present, desiring to relieve the silence, thoughtlessly said: “Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>”—that being a common saying of those days<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b9"><a href="#fn_b9">[9]</a></sup>. And then Jesus spoke a parable, which even his friendly host was compelled to take to heart. He said:<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_8"><a href="#fn_s2_1_8">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p2_2">167:2.2</a></small></sup>  “A certain ruler gave a <a href="/en/topic/great_supper">great supper</a>, and having bidden many guests, he dispatched his servants at suppertime to say to those who were invited, ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’ And they all with one accord began to make excuses. The first said, ‘I have just bought a farm, and I must needs go to prove it<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📘" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d8.svg"><sup id="cite_c2_2_0"><a href="#fn_c2_2_0">[1]</a></sup>; I pray you have me excused.’ Another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I must go to receive them; I pray you have me excused.’ And another said, ‘I have just married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.’ So the servants went back and reported this to their master. When the master of the house heard this, he was very angry, and turning to his servants, he said: ‘I have made ready this marriage feast; the fatlings are killed, and all is in readiness for my guests, but they have spurned my invitation; they have gone every man after his lands and his merchandise, and they even show disrespect to my servants who bid them come to my feast. Go out quickly, therefore, into the streets and lanes of the city, out into the highways and the byways, and bring hither the poor and the outcast, the blind and the lame, that the marriage feast may have guests.’ And the servants did as their lord commanded, and even then there was room for more guests. Then said the lord to his servants: ‘Go now out into the roads and the countryside and constrain those who are there to come in that my house may be filled. I declare that none of those who were first bidden shall taste of my supper.’ And the servants did as their master commanded, and the house was filled.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_2_31"><a href="#fn_a2_2_31">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p2_3">167:2.3</a></small></sup>  And when they heard these words, they departed; every man went to his own place. At least one of the sneering <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> present that morning comprehended the meaning of this parable, for he was baptized that day and made public confession of his faith in the gospel of the kingdom. <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a> preached on this parable that night at the <a href="/en/topic/general_council">general council</a> of believers.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p2_4">167:2.4</a></small></sup>  The next day all of the apostles engaged in the philosophic exercise of endeavoring to interpret the meaning of this parable of the <a href="/en/topic/great_supper">great supper</a>. Though <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> listened with interest to all of these differing interpretations, he steadfastly refused to offer them further help in understanding the parable. He would only say, “Let every man find out the meaning for himself and in his own soul.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_4_36"><a href="#fn_a2_4_36">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p3_1">167:3.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a> had arranged for the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> to teach in the synagogue on this <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> day, <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> time <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had appeared in a synagogue since they had all been closed to his teachings by order of the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a>. At the conclusion of the service Jesus looked down before him upon an elderly woman who wore a downcast expression, and who was much bent in form. This woman had long been fear-ridden, and all joy had passed out of her life. As Jesus stepped down from the pulpit, he went over to her and, touching her bowed-over form on the shoulder, said: “Woman, if you would only believe, you could be wholly loosed from your spirit of infirmity.” And this woman, who had been bowed down and bound up by the depressions of fear for more than eighteen years, believed the words of the Master and by faith straightened up immediately. When this woman saw that she had been made straight, she lifted up her voice and glorified <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b11"><a href="#fn_b11">[11]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_1_7"><a href="#fn_s3_1_7">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s3_1_3"><a href="#fn_s3_1_3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s3_1_11"><a href="#fn_s3_1_11">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p3_2">167:3.2</a></small></sup>  Notwithstanding that this woman’s affliction was wholly mental, her bowed-over form being the result of her depressed mind, the people thought that Jesus had healed a real <a href="/en/topic/disease">physical disorder</a>. Although the congregation of the synagogue at <a href="/en/topic/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> was friendly toward the teachings of Jesus, the chief ruler of the synagogue was an unfriendly Pharisee. And as he shared the opinion of the congregation that Jesus had healed a physical disorder, and being indignant because Jesus had presumed to do such a thing on the Sabbath, he stood up before the congregation and said: “Are there not six days in which men should do all their work? In these working days come, therefore, and be healed, but not on the Sabbath day.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b12"><a href="#fn_b12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p3_3">167:3.3</a></small></sup>  When the unfriendly ruler had thus spoken, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> returned to the speaker’s platform and said: “Why play the part of hypocrites? Does not every one of you, on the <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a>, loose his ox from the stall and lead him forth for watering? If such a service is permissible on the Sabbath day, should not this woman, a daughter of <a href="/en/topic/Abraham_the_Pharisee">Abraham</a> who has been bound down by evil these eighteen years, be loosed from this bondage and led forth to partake of the waters of liberty and life, even on this Sabbath day?” And as the woman continued to glorify <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, his critic was put to shame, and the congregation rejoiced with her that she had been healed<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b13"><a href="#fn_b13">[13]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p3_4">167:3.4</a></small></sup>  As a result of his public criticism of Jesus on this Sabbath the chief ruler of the synagogue was deposed, and a follower of Jesus was put in his place.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p3_5">167:3.5</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> frequently delivered such victims of <a href="/en/topic/fear">fear</a> from their spirit of infirmity, from their depression of mind, and from their bondage of fear.

<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p3_6">167:3.6</a></small></sup>  Jesus taught again in the synagogue on <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a>, and many were baptized by <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a> at noon on that day in the river which flowed south of the city.

<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p4_2">167:4.2</a></small></sup>  Jesus was very fond of Martha, Mary, and their brother, <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a>; he loved them with a fervent affection<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b16"><a href="#fn_b16">[16]</a></sup>. His first and human thought was to go to their assistance at once, but another idea came into his combined mind. He had almost given up hope that the Jewish leaders at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> would ever accept the kingdom, but he still loved his people, and there now occurred to him a plan whereby the scribes and <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> of Jerusalem might have one more chance to accept his teachings; and he decided, his Father willing, to make this last appeal to Jerusalem the most profound and stupendous outward working of his entire earth career. The <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> clung to the idea of a wonder-working <a href="/en/topic/Deliverer">deliverer</a>. And though he refused to stoop to the performance of material wonders or to the enactment of temporal exhibitions of political power, he did now ask the Father’s consent for the manifestation of his hitherto unexhibited power over life and death.</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p4_3">167:4.3</a></small></sup>  The Jews were in the habit of burying their <a href="/en/topic/dead">dead</a> on the day of their demise; this was a necessary practice in such a warm climate.

The child should be introduced to worship in nature’s outdoors and later accompany his parents to public houses of religious assembly which are at least as materially attractive and artistically beautiful as the home in which he is daily domiciled.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a6_6_9"><a href="#fn_a6_6_9">[32]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a6_6_34"><a href="#fn_a6_6_34">[33]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a6_6_40"><a href="#fn_a6_6_40">[34]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s6_6_5"><a href="#fn_s6_6_5">[8]</a></sup></p>
