<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p0_1">127:0.1</a></small></sup>  AS JESUS entered upon his adolescent years, he found himself the head and sole support of a large family. Within a few years after his father’s death all their property was gone. As time passed, he became increasingly conscious of his pre-existence; at the same time he began more fully to realize that he was present on earth and in the flesh for the express purpose of revealing his <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Father to the children of men.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_1_2"><a href="#fn_s0_1_2">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p0_2">127:0.2</a></small></sup>  No adolescent youth who has lived or ever will live on this world or any other world has had or ever will have more weighty problems to resolve or more intricate difficulties to untangle. No youth of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> will ever be called upon to pass through more testing conflicts or more trying situations than <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> himself endured during those strenuous years from fifteen to twenty.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_2_24"><a href="#fn_a0_2_24">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_2_34"><a href="#fn_a0_2_34">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_2_36"><a href="#fn_a0_2_36">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p0_3">127:0.3</a></small></sup>  Having thus tasted the actual experience of living these adolescent years on a world beset by evil and distraught by sin, the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> became possessed of full knowledge about the life experience of the youth of all the realms of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>, and thus forever he became the understanding refuge for the distressed and perplexed adolescents of all ages and on all worlds throughout the local universe.</p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p0_4">127:0.4</a></small></sup>  Slowly, but certainly and by actual experience, this divine Son is <i>earning</i> the right to become sovereign of his universe, the unquestioned and supreme ruler of all created intelligences on all local universe worlds, the understanding refuge of the beings of all ages and of all degrees of personal endowment and experience.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. THE SIXTEENTH YEAR (A.D. 10) </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p1_1">127:1.1</a></small></sup>  The incarnated Son passed through infancy and experienced an uneventful childhood. Then he emerged from that testing and trying transition stage between childhood and young manhood—he became the adolescent <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p1_2">127:1.2</a></small></sup>  This year he attained his full physical growth. He was a virile and comely youth. He became increasingly sober and serious, but he was kind and sympathetic. His eye was kind but searching; his smile was always engaging and reassuring. His voice was musical but authoritative; his greeting cordial but unaffected. Always, even in the most commonplace of contacts, there seemed to be in evidence the touch of a twofold nature, the human and the divine. Ever he displayed this combination of the sympathizing friend and the authoritative teacher. And these personality traits began early to become manifest, even in these adolescent years.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_30"><a href="#fn_a1_2_30">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p1_3">127:1.3</a></small></sup>  This physically strong and robust youth also acquired the full growth of his human intellect, not the full experience of human thinking but the fullness of capacity for such intellectual development. He possessed a healthy and well-proportioned body, a keen and analytical mind, a kind and sympathetic disposition, a somewhat fluctuating but aggressive temperament, all of which were becoming organized into a strong, striking, and attractive personality.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_3_0"><a href="#fn_a1_3_0">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_3_15"><a href="#fn_a1_3_15">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_3_21"><a href="#fn_a1_3_21">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_3_47"><a href="#fn_a1_3_47">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p1_4">127:1.4</a></small></sup>  As time went on, it became more difficult for his mother and his brothers and sisters to understand him; they stumbled over his sayings and misinterpreted his doings. They were all unfitted to comprehend their eldest brother’s life because their mother had given them to understand that he was destined to become the <a href="/en/topic/Deliverer">deliverer</a> of the Jewish people. After they had received from <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> such intimations as family secrets, imagine their confusion when <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> would make frank denials of all such ideas and intentions.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p1_5">127:1.5</a></small></sup>  This year <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> started to school, and they were compelled to sell another house. <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James</a> now took charge of the teaching of his three sisters, two of whom were old enough to begin serious study. As soon as <a href="/en/topic/Ruth_(Old_Testament)">Ruth</a> grew up, she was taken in hand by <a href="/en/topic/Miriam_(Old_Testament)">Miriam</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(wife_of_Justus)">Martha</a>. Ordinarily the girls of Jewish families received little education, but Jesus maintained (and his mother agreed) that girls should go to school the same as boys, and since the synagogue school would not receive them, there was nothing to do but conduct a home school especially for them.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_5_11"><a href="#fn_a1_5_11">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p1_6">127:1.6</a></small></sup>  Throughout this year <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was closely confined to the workbench. Fortunately he had plenty of work; his was of such a superior grade that he was never idle no matter how slack work might be in that region. At times he had so much to do that James would help him.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p1_7">127:1.7</a></small></sup>  By the end of this year he had just about made up his mind that he would, after rearing his family and seeing them married, enter publicly upon his work as a teacher of truth and as a revealer of the heavenly Father to the world. He knew he was not to become the expected Jewish <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a>, and he concluded that it was next to useless to discuss these matters with his mother; he decided to allow her to entertain whatever ideas she might choose since all he had said in the past had made little or no impression upon her and he recalled that his father had never been able to say anything that would change her mind. From this year on he talked less and less with his mother, or anyone else, about these problems. His was such a peculiar mission that no one living on earth could give him advice concerning its prosecution.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_7_23"><a href="#fn_a1_7_23">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_7_27"><a href="#fn_a1_7_27">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p1_8">127:1.8</a></small></sup>  He was a real though youthful father to the family; he spent every possible hour with the youngsters, and they truly loved him. His mother grieved to see him work so hard; she sorrowed that he was day by day toiling at the carpenter’s bench earning a living for the family instead of being, as they had so fondly planned, at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> studying with the rabbis. While there was much about her son that <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> could not understand, she did love him, and she most thoroughly appreciated the willing manner in which he shouldered the responsibility of the home.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_8_34"><a href="#fn_a1_8_34">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. THE SEVENTEENTH YEAR (A.D. 11) </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p2_1">127:2.1</a></small></sup>  At about this time there was considerable agitation, especially at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and in <a href="/en/topic/Judea">Judea</a>, in favor of <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">rebellion</a> against the payment of taxes to <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a>. There was coming into existence a strong nationalist party, presently to be called the <a href="/en/topic/Zealots">Zealots</a>. The Zealots, unlike the <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a>, were not willing to await the coming of the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a>. They proposed to bring things to a head through political revolt.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_1_12"><a href="#fn_a2_1_12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p2_2">127:2.2</a></small></sup>  A group of organizers from Jerusalem arrived in <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> and were making good headway until they reached <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>. When they came to see <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, he listened carefully to them and asked many questions but refused to join the party. He declined fully to disclose his reasons for not enlisting, and his refusal had the effect of keeping out many of his youthful fellows in Nazareth.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_2_1"><a href="#fn_s2_2_1">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p2_3">127:2.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> did her best to induce him to enlist, but she could not budge him. She went so far as to intimate that his refusal to espouse the nationalist cause at her behest was insubordination, a violation of his pledge made upon their return from <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> that he would be subject to his parents; but in answer to this insinuation he only laid a kindly hand on her shoulder and, looking into her face, said: “My mother, how could you?” And <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Clopas)">Mary</a> withdrew her statement.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_3_0"><a href="#fn_s2_3_0">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p2_4">127:2.4</a></small></sup>  One of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ uncles (Mary’s brother <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a>) had already joined this group, subsequently becoming an officer in the Galilean division. And for several years there was something of an estrangement between Jesus and his uncle.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_4_20"><a href="#fn_a2_4_20">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p2_5">127:2.5</a></small></sup>  But trouble began to brew in <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>. Jesus’ attitude in these matters had resulted in creating a division among the Jewish youths of the city. About half had joined the nationalist organization, and the other half began the formation of an opposing group of more moderate patriots, expecting Jesus to assume the leadership. They were amazed when he refused the honor offered him, pleading as an excuse his heavy family responsibilities, which they all allowed. But the situation was still further complicated when, presently, a wealthy Jew, <a href="/en/topic/Isaac_(Old_Testament)">Isaac</a>, a moneylender to the gentiles, came forward agreeing to support Jesus’ family if he would lay down his tools and assume leadership of these Nazareth patriots.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_5_2"><a href="#fn_s2_5_2">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p2_6">127:2.6</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, then scarcely seventeen years of age, was confronted with one of the most delicate and difficult situations of his early life. Patriotic issues, especially when complicated by tax-gathering foreign oppressors, are always difficult for spiritual leaders to relate themselves to, and it was doubly so in this case since the <a href="/en/topic/Jewish_religion">Jewish religion</a> was involved in all this agitation against <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_6_1"><a href="#fn_s2_6_1">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p2_7">127:2.7</a></small></sup>  Jesus’ position was made more difficult because his mother and uncle, and even his younger brother <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James</a>, all urged him to join the nationalist cause. All the better <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> had enlisted, and those young men who had not joined the movement would all enlist the moment Jesus changed his mind. He had but one wise counselor in all Nazareth, his old teacher, the <a href="/en/topic/chazan_of_Nazareth_synagogue">chazan</a>, who counseled him about his reply to the citizens’ committee of Nazareth when they came to ask for his answer to the public appeal which had been made. In all Jesus’ young life this was the very first time he had consciously resorted to public strategy. Theretofore, always had he depended upon a frank statement of truth to clarify the situation, but now he could not declare the full truth. He could not intimate that he was more than a man; he could not disclose his idea of the mission which awaited his attainment of a riper manhood. Despite these limitations his religious fealty and national loyalty were directly challenged. His family was in a turmoil, his youthful friends in division, and the entire Jewish contingent of the town in a hubbub. And to think that he was to blame for it all! And how innocent he had been of all intention to make trouble of any kind, much less a disturbance of this sort.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_7_2"><a href="#fn_a2_7_2">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p2_8">127:2.8</a></small></sup>  Something had to be done. He must state his position, and this he did bravely and diplomatically to the satisfaction of many, but not all. He adhered to the terms of his original plea, maintaining that his first duty was to his <a href="/en/topic/family">family</a>, that a widowed mother and eight brothers and sisters needed something more than mere <a href="/en/topic/money">money</a> could buy—the physical necessities of life—that they were entitled to a father’s watchcare and guidance, and that he could not in clear conscience release himself from the obligation which a cruel accident had thrust upon him. He paid compliment to his mother and eldest brother for being willing to release him but reiterated that loyalty to a dead father forbade his leaving the family no matter how much money was forthcoming for their material support, making his never-to-be-forgotten statement that “money cannot <a href="/en/topic/love">love</a>.” In the course of this address <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> made several veiled references to his “life mission” but explained that, regardless of whether or not it might be inconsistent with the military idea, it, along with everything else in his life, had been given up in order that he might be able to discharge faithfully his obligation to his family. Everyone in Nazareth well knew he was a good father to his family, and this was a matter so near the heart of every noble Jew that Jesus’ plea found an appreciative response in the hearts of many of his hearers; and some of those who were not thus minded were disarmed by a speech made by James, which, while not on the program, was delivered at this time. That very day the chazan had rehearsed James in his speech, but that was their secret.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_8_2"><a href="#fn_s2_8_2">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_8_0"><a href="#fn_s2_8_0">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p2_9">127:2.9</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James</a> stated that he was sure Jesus would help to liberate his people if he (<a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>) were only old enough to assume responsibility for the family, and that, if they would only consent to allow Jesus to remain “with us, to be our father and teacher, then you will have not just one leader from <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>’s family, but presently you will have five loyal nationalists, for are there not five of us boys to grow up and come forth from our brother-father’s guidance to serve our nation?” And thus did the lad bring to a fairly happy ending a very tense and threatening situation.</p>
<p id="p2_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p2_10">127:2.10</a></small></sup>  The crisis for the time being was over, but never was this incident forgotten in <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>. The agitation persisted; not again was <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> in universal favor; the division of sentiment was never fully overcome. And this, augmented by other and subsequent occurrences, was one of the chief reasons why he moved to <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> in later years. Henceforth Nazareth maintained a division of sentiment regarding the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_10_22"><a href="#fn_a2_10_22">[15]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_10_1"><a href="#fn_s2_10_1">[3]</a></sup></p>

He had become a clever worker with tools and now took over the making of yokes and plows while Jesus began to do more house finishing and expert cabinet work.</p>
<p id="p2_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p2_12">127:2.12</a></small></sup>  This year <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> made great progress in the organization of his mind. Gradually he had brought his divine and human natures together, and he accomplished all this organization of intellect by the force of his own <i><a href="/en/topic/decisions">decisions</a></i> and with only the aid of his indwelling Monitor, just such a Monitor as all normal <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> on all postbestowal-Son worlds have within their minds.

The last piece of <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> property (except an equity in one other), already mortgaged, was sold.

On this journey they talked over many of their problems, personal, family, and national. James was a very religious type of lad, and while he did not fully agree with his mother regarding the little he knew of the plans concerning Jesus’ lifework, he did look forward to the time when he would be able to assume responsibility for the family so that Jesus could begin his mission. He was very appreciative of Jesus’ taking him up to the Passover, and they talked over the future more fully than ever before.</p>

When her father agreed to such a plan, Rebecca had further conferences with Mary and Miriam, and when she failed to win their support, she made bold to go directly to Jesus.

<p id="p6_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p6_1">127:6.1</a></small></sup>  The story of <a href="/en/topic/Rebecca_(daughter_of_Ezra)">Rebecca</a>’s <a href="/en/topic/love">love</a> for <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was whispered about <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> and later on at <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, so that, while in the years to follow many women loved Jesus even as men loved him, not again did he have to reject the personal proffer of another good woman’s devotion. From this time on human affection for Jesus partook more of the nature of worshipful and adoring regard. Both men and women loved him devotedly and for what he was, not with any tinge of self-satisfaction or desire for affectionate possession. But for many years, whenever the story of Jesus’ human personality was recited, the devotion of <a href="/en/topic/Rebecca_(daughter_of_Joseph_of_Arimathea)">Rebecca</a> was recounted.</p>

<p id="p6_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p6_3">127:6.3</a></small></sup>  Although they could hardly afford it, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had a strange longing to go up to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> for the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a>. His mother, knowing of his recent experience with <a href="/en/topic/Rebecca_(daughter_of_Ezra)">Rebecca</a>, wisely urged him to make the journey. He was not markedly conscious of it, but what he most wanted was an opportunity to talk with <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a> and to visit with <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(wife_of_Justus)">Martha</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a>.

Not knowing Jesus was coming, Lazarus had arranged to celebrate the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> with friends in an adjoining village down the <a href="/en/topic/Jericho">Jericho</a> road. Jesus now proposed that they celebrate the feast where they were, at Lazarus’s house. “But,” said Lazarus, “we have no paschal lamb.” And then Jesus entered upon a prolonged and convincing dissertation to the effect that the Father in heaven was not truly concerned with such childlike and meaningless rituals. After solemn and fervent prayer they rose, and Jesus said: “Let the childlike and darkened minds of my people serve their <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> as <a href="/en/topic/Moses">Moses</a> directed; it is better that they do, but let us who have seen the light of life no longer approach our Father by the darkness of death.

It was his custom to engage in this sacramental ritual whenever he paid subsequent visits to <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a>. When he returned home, he told all this to his mother. She was shocked at first but came gradually to see his viewpoint; nevertheless, she was greatly relieved when Jesus assured her that he did not intend to introduce this new idea of the Passover in their family.
