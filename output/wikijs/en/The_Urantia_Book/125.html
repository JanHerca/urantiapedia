<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p0_1">125:0.1</a></small></sup>  NO INCIDENT in all <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>‚Äô eventful earth career was more engaging, more humanly thrilling, than this, his first remembered visit to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. He was especially stimulated by the experience of attending the <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a> discussions by himself, and it long stood out in his memory as the great event of his later childhood and early youth. This was his first opportunity to enjoy a few days of independent living, the exhilaration of going and coming without restraint and restrictions. This brief period of undirected living, during the week following the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a>, was <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> complete freedom from responsibility he had ever enjoyed. And it was many years subsequent to this before he again had a like period of freedom from all sense of responsibility, even for a short time.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_1_3"><a href="#fn_s0_1_3">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p0_2">125:0.2</a></small></sup>  Women seldom went to the Passover feast at Jerusalem; they were not required to be present. Jesus, however, virtually refused to go unless his mother would accompany them. And when his mother decided to go, many other <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> <a href="/en/topic/women">women</a> were led to make the journey, so that the Passover company contained the largest number of <a href="/en/topic/mothers">women</a>, in proportion to men, ever to go up to the Passover from Nazareth. Ever and anon, on the way to Jerusalem, they chanted <a href="/en/topic/Caligastia_one_hundred">the one hundred</a> and thirtieth Psalm.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_2_13"><a href="#fn_a0_2_13">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p0_3">125:0.3</a></small></sup>  From the time they left Nazareth until they reached the summit of the <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Olivet">Mount of Olives</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> experienced one long stress of expectant anticipation. All through a joyful childhood he had reverently heard of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and its <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a>; now he was soon to behold them in reality. From the <a href="/en/topic/Mount_of_Olives">Mount of Olives</a> and from the outside, on closer inspection, the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> had been all and more than Jesus had expected; but when he once entered its sacred portals, the great disillusionment began.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_3_3"><a href="#fn_a0_3_3">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p0_4">125:0.4</a></small></sup>  In company with his parents Jesus passed through the temple precincts on his way to join that group of new sons of the law who were about to be consecrated as citizens of <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a>. He was a little disappointed by the general demeanor of the temple throngs, but <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> great shock of the day came when his mother took leave of them on her way to the <a href="/en/topic/court_of_women">women‚Äôs gallery</a>. It had never occurred to Jesus that his mother was not to accompany him to the consecration ceremonies, and he was thoroughly indignant that she was made to suffer from such unjust discrimination. While he strongly resented this, aside from a few remarks of protest to his father, he said nothing. But he thought, and thought deeply, as his questions to the scribes and teachers a week later disclosed.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_4_4"><a href="#fn_s0_4_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p0_5">125:0.5</a></small></sup>  He passed through the consecration rituals but was disappointed by their perfunctory and routine natures. He missed that personal interest which characterized the ceremonies of the synagogue at <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>. He then returned to greet his mother and prepared to accompany his father on his first trip about the <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a> and its various courts, galleries, and corridors. The <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> precincts could accommodate over two hundred thousand worshipers at one time, and while the vastness of these buildings‚Äîin comparison with any he had ever seen‚Äîgreatly impressed his mind, he was more intrigued by the contemplation of the spiritual significance of the temple ceremonies and their associated worship.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_5_3"><a href="#fn_s0_5_3">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p0_6">125:0.6</a></small></sup>  Though many of the temple rituals very touchingly impressed his sense of the beautiful and the symbolic, he was always disappointed by the explanation of the real meanings of these ceremonies which his parents would offer in answer to his many searching inquiries. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> simply would not accept explanations of worship and religious devotion which involved belief in the <a href="/en/topic/wrath">wrath</a> of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> or the <a href="/en/topic/anger">anger</a> of the <a href="/en/topic/Almighty">Almighty</a>. In further discussion of these questions, after the conclusion of the temple visit, when his father became mildly insistent that he acknowledge acceptance of the orthodox Jewish beliefs, Jesus turned suddenly upon his parents and, looking appealingly into the eyes of his father, said: ‚ÄúMy father, it cannot be true‚Äîthe Father in heaven cannot so regard his erring children on earth. The heavenly Father cannot love his children less than you love me. And I well know, no matter what unwise thing I might do, you would never pour out wrath upon me nor vent anger against me. If you, my earthly father, possess such human reflections of the Divine, how much more must the heavenly Father be filled with goodness and overflowing with mercy. I refuse to believe that my Father in heaven loves me less than my father on earth.‚Äù<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_6_3"><a href="#fn_a0_6_3">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_6_5"><a href="#fn_a0_6_5">[3]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_6_3"><a href="#fn_s0_6_3">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s0_6_4"><a href="#fn_s0_6_4">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s0_6_1"><a href="#fn_s0_6_1">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s0_6_2"><a href="#fn_s0_6_2">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p1_1">125:1.1</a></small></sup>  Everywhere <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> went throughout the <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a> courts, he was shocked and sickened by the spirit of irreverence which he observed. He deemed the conduct of the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> throngs to be inconsistent with their presence in ‚Äúhis <a href="/en/topic/Fathers_house">Father‚Äôs house</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>.‚Äù But he received the shock of his young life when his father escorted him into the <a href="/en/topic/court_of_gentiles">court of the gentiles</a> with its noisy jargon, loud talking and cursing, mingled indiscriminately with the bleating of sheep and the babble of noises which betrayed the presence of the <a href="/en/topic/money-changers">money-changers</a> and the vendors of sacrificial animals and sundry other commercial commodities.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_1_3"><a href="#fn_a1_1_3">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_1_0"><a href="#fn_a1_1_0">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_1_4"><a href="#fn_a1_1_4">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_1_8"><a href="#fn_a1_1_8">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p1_2">125:1.2</a></small></sup>  But most of all was his sense of propriety outraged by the sight of the frivolous courtesans parading about within this precinct of the temple, just such painted women as he had so recently seen when on a visit to <a href="/en/topic/Sepphoris">Sepphoris</a>. This profanation of the temple fully aroused all his youthful indignation, and he did not hesitate to express himself freely to <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p1_3">125:1.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> admired the sentiment and service of the <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a>, but he was shocked by the spiritual ugliness which he beheld on the faces of so many of the unthinking worshipers.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p1_4">125:1.4</a></small></sup>  They now passed down to the <a href="/en/topic/court_of_priests">priests‚Äô court</a> beneath the rock ledge in front of the temple, where the altar stood, to observe the killing of the droves of animals and the washing away of the <a href="/en/topic/blood">blood</a> from the hands of the officiating slaughter priests at the bronze fountain. The bloodstained pavement, the gory hands of the priests, and the sounds of the dying animals were more than this nature-loving lad could stand. The terrible sight sickened this boy of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>; he clutched his father‚Äôs arm and begged to be taken away. They walked back through the <a href="/en/topic/court_of_gentiles">court of the gentiles</a>, and even the coarse laughter and profane jesting which he there heard were a relief from the sights he had just beheld.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_4_8"><a href="#fn_a1_4_8">[6]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_4_3"><a href="#fn_s1_4_3">[1]</a></sup></p>

During this stroll <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_(Old_Testament)">Joseph</a> explained to Jesus that only the inhabitants of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> were permitted to witness the daily sacrifices in the temple, and that the dwellers in <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> came up only three times a year to participate in the temple worship: at the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a>, at the feast of <a href="/en/topic/Pentecost_(bestowal_of_Spirit_of_Truth)">Pentecost</a> (seven weeks after Passover), and at the feast of tabernacles in October.

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p2_1">125:2.1</a></small></sup>  Five <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> families were guests of, or associates with, the family of <a href="/en/topic/Simon_of_Bethany">Simon of Bethany</a> in the celebration of the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> having purchased the paschal lamb for the company. It was the slaughter of these lambs in such enormous numbers that had so affected <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> on his <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a> visit. It had been the plan to eat the Passover with <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a>‚Äôs relatives, but Jesus persuaded his parents to accept the invitation to go to <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_2"><a href="#fn_s2_1_2">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p2_2">125:2.2</a></small></sup>  That night they assembled for the Passover rites, eating the roasted flesh with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. Jesus, being a new son of the covenant, was asked to recount the origin of the Passover, and this he well did, but he somewhat disconcerted his parents by the inclusion of numerous remarks mildly reflecting the impressions made on his youthful but thoughtful mind by the things which he had so recently seen and heard. This was the beginning of the seven-day ceremonies of the feast of the Passover.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p2_3">125:2.3</a></small></sup>  Even at this early date, though he said nothing about such matters to his parents, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had begun to turn over in his mind the propriety of celebrating the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> without the slaughtered lamb. He felt assured in his own mind that the Father in heaven was not pleased with this spectacle of sacrificial offerings, and as the years passed, he became increasingly determined someday to establish the celebration of a bloodless Passover.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_3_17"><a href="#fn_a2_3_17">[8]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_3_3"><a href="#fn_s2_3_3">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p2_4">125:2.4</a></small></sup>  Jesus slept very little that night. His rest was greatly disturbed by revolting <a href="/en/topic/dreams">dreams</a> of slaughter and suffering. His mind was distraught and his heart torn by the inconsistencies and absurdities of the theology of the whole Jewish ceremonial system. His parents likewise slept little. They were greatly disconcerted by the events of the day just ended. They were completely upset in their own hearts by the lad‚Äôs, to them, strange and determined attitude. <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> became nervously agitated during the fore part of the night, but <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> remained calm, though he was equally puzzled. Both of them feared to talk frankly with the lad about these problems, though Jesus would gladly have talked with his parents if they had dared to encourage him.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_4_3"><a href="#fn_a2_4_3">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_4_20"><a href="#fn_a2_4_20">[9]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_4_3"><a href="#fn_s2_4_3">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p2_5">125:2.5</a></small></sup>  The next day‚Äôs services at the <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a> were more acceptable to <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and did much to relieve the unpleasant memories of the previous day. The following morning young <a href="/en/topic/Lazarus_(of_Bethany)">Lazarus</a> took Jesus in hand, and they began a systematic exploration of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and its environs. Before the day was over, Jesus discovered the various places about the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> where teaching and question conferences were in progress; and aside from a few visits to the <a href="/en/topic/holy_of_holies">holy of holies</a> to gaze in wonder as to what really was behind the veil of separation, he spent most of his time about the temple at these teaching conferences.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p2_6">125:2.6</a></small></sup>  Throughout the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> week, Jesus kept his place among the new <a href="/en/topic/son_of_commandment">sons of the commandment</a>, and this meant that he must seat himself outside the rail which segregated all persons who were not full citizens of <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a>. Being thus made conscious of his youth, he refrained from asking the many questions which surged back and forth in his mind; at least he refrained until the Passover celebration had ended and these restrictions on the newly consecrated youths were lifted.</p>

They had never seen him behave like this, and not knowing how much he was confused in mind and troubled in spirit by the experience through which he was passing, they were sorely perplexed; they did not know what to do. They welcomed the passing of the days of the Passover week and longed to have their strangely acting son safely back in <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_9_3"><a href="#fn_a2_9_3">[2]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_9_4"><a href="#fn_s2_9_4">[2]</a></sup></p>

Jesus accompanied his parents and teacher on their visits to the school, but they were all distressed to observe how indifferent he seemed to all they said and did. <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Clopas)">Mary</a> was deeply pained at his reactions to the Jerusalem visit, and <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_(Old_Testament)">Joseph</a> was profoundly perplexed at the lad‚Äôs strange remarks and unusual conduct.</p>
<p id="p2_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/125#p2_12">125:2.12</a></small></sup>  After all, <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> week had been a great event in Jesus‚Äô life. He had enjoyed the opportunity of meeting scores of boys about his own age, fellow candidates for the consecration, and he utilized such contacts as a means of learning how people lived in <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Turkestan">Turkestan</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Parthia">Parthia</a>, as well as in the Far-Western provinces of <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a>.
