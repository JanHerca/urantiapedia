<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. THE SALEM TEACHINGS IN VEDIC INDIA </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p1_1">94:1.1</a></small></sup>  In the days of <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a>, <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a> was a cosmopolitan country which had recently come under the political and religious dominance of the Aryan-Andite invaders from the north and west. At this time only the northern and western portions of the peninsula had been extensively permeated by the <a href="/en/topic/Aryans">Aryans</a>. These Vedic newcomers had brought along with them their many tribal deities. Their religious forms of worship followed closely the ceremonial practices of their earlier <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andite</a> forebears in that the father still functioned as a priest and the mother as a priestess, and the family <a href="/en/topic/hearth">hearth</a> was still utilized as an <a href="/en/topic/altars">altar</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p1_2">94:1.2</a></small></sup>  The Vedic cult was then in process of growth and metamorphosis under the direction of the <a href="/en/topic/Brahman">Brahman</a> caste of teacher-priests, who were gradually assuming control over the expanding ritual of worship. The amalgamation of the onetime thirty-three Aryan deities was well under way when the <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> missionaries penetrated the north of India.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p1_3">94:1.3</a></small></sup>  The polytheism of these <a href="/en/topic/Aryans">Aryans</a> represented a degeneration of their earlier monotheism occasioned by their separation into tribal units, each tribe having its venerated god. This devolution of the original monotheism and trinitarianism of <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andite</a> <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> was in process of resynthesis in the early centuries of the second millennium before <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a>. The many gods were organized into a pantheon under the triune leadership of <a href="/en/topic/Dyaus_pitar">Dyaus pitar</a>, the lord of heaven; <a href="/en/topic/Indra">Indra</a>, the tempestuous lord of the atmosphere; and <a href="/en/topic/Agni">Agni</a>, the three-headed <a href="/en/topic/fire_god">fire god</a>, lord of the earth and the vestigial symbol of an earlier <a href="/en/topic/Trinity">Trinity</a> concept.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p1_4">94:1.4</a></small></sup>  Definite henotheistic developments were paving the way for an evolved monotheism. Agni, the most ancient deity, was often exalted as the father-head of the entire pantheon. The deity-father principle, sometimes called <a href="/en/topic/Prajapati">Prajapati</a>, sometimes termed <a href="/en/topic/Brahma">Brahma</a>, was submerged in the theologic battle which the <a href="/en/topic/Brahmanism">Brahman priests</a> later fought with the <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> teachers. <i>The <a href="/en/topic/Brahman">Brahman</a></i> was conceived as the energy-divinity principle activating the entire Vedic pantheon.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p1_5">94:1.5</a></small></sup>  The Salem missionaries preached the one <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Most_High">Most High</a> of heaven. This portrayal was not altogether disharmonious with the emerging concept of the <a href="/en/topic/Father-Brahma">Father-Brahma</a> as the source of all gods, but the Salem doctrine was nonritualistic and hence ran directly counter to the dogmas, traditions, and teachings of the Brahman priesthood. Never would the Brahman priests accept the Salem teaching of salvation through <a href="/en/topic/faith">faith</a>, favor with God apart from ritualistic observances and sacrificial ceremonials.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_5_34"><a href="#fn_a1_5_34">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p1_6">94:1.6</a></small></sup>  The rejection of the Melchizedek gospel of trust in God and salvation through faith marked a vital turning point for <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a>. The <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> missionaries had contributed much to the loss of faith in all the ancient Vedic gods, but the leaders, the priests of Vedism, refused to accept the Melchizedek teaching of one God and one simple faith.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_6_2"><a href="#fn_s1_6_2">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p1_7">94:1.7</a></small></sup>  The Brahmans culled the sacred writings of their day in an effort to combat the Salem teachers, and this compilation, as later revised, has come on down to modern times as the <a href="/en/topic/Rig-Veda">Rig-Veda</a>, one of the most ancient of sacred books. The second, third, and fourth <a href="/en/topic/Vedas">Vedas</a> followed as the Brahmans sought to crystallize, formalize, and fix their rituals of worship and sacrifice upon the peoples of those days. Taken at their best, these writings are the equal of any other body of similar character in beauty of concept and truth of discernment. But as this superior religion became contaminated with the thousands upon thousands of superstitions, cults, and rituals of southern India, it progressively metamorphosed into the most variegated system of theology ever developed by mortal man. An examination of the Vedas will disclose some of the highest and some of the most debased concepts of <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> ever to be conceived.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. BRAHMANISM </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p2_1">94:2.1</a></small></sup>  As the <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> missionaries penetrated southward into the <a href="/en/topic/Dravidians">Dravidian</a> <a href="/en/topic/Deccan">Deccan</a>, they encountered an increasing caste system, the scheme of the <a href="/en/topic/Aryans">Aryans</a> to prevent loss of racial identity in the face of a rising tide of the secondary Sangik peoples. Since the <a href="/en/topic/Brahman">Brahman</a> priest caste was the very essence of this system, this social order greatly retarded the progress of the Salem teachers. This caste system failed to save the Aryan race, but it did succeed in perpetuating the Brahmans, who, in turn, have maintained their religious hegemony in <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a> to the present time.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_1_34"><a href="#fn_a2_1_34">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p2_2">94:2.2</a></small></sup>  And now, with the weakening of Vedism through the rejection of higher truth, the cult of the Aryans became subject to increasing inroads from the Deccan. In a desperate effort to stem the tide of racial extinction and religious obliteration, the Brahman caste sought to exalt themselves above all else. They taught that the sacrifice to deity in itself was all-efficacious, that it was all-compelling in its potency. They proclaimed that, of the two essential divine principles of the universe, one was Brahman the deity, and the other was the Brahman priesthood. Among no other <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> peoples did the priests presume to exalt themselves above even their gods, to relegate to themselves the honors due their gods. But they went so absurdly far with these presumptuous claims that the whole precarious system collapsed before the debasing cults which poured in from the surrounding and less advanced civilizations. The vast <a href="/en/topic/Vedic_priesthood">Vedic priesthood</a> itself floundered and sank beneath the black flood of inertia and pessimism which their own selfish and unwise presumption had brought upon all India.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p2_3">94:2.3</a></small></sup>  The undue concentration on <a href="/en/topic/self">self</a> led certainly to a fear of the nonevolutionary perpetuation of self in an endless round of successive incarnations as man, beast, or weeds. And of all the contaminating beliefs which could have become fastened upon what may have been an emerging monotheism, none was so stultifying as this belief in <a href="/en/topic/transmigration">transmigration</a>—the doctrine of the <a href="/en/topic/reincarnation">reincarnation</a> of souls—which came from the <a href="/en/topic/Dravidians">Dravidian</a> <a href="/en/topic/Deccan">Deccan</a>. This belief in the weary and monotonous round of repeated transmigrations robbed struggling <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of their long-cherished hope of finding that deliverance and spiritual advancement in death which had been a part of the earlier Vedic faith.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_3_30"><a href="#fn_a2_3_30">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p2_4">94:2.4</a></small></sup>  This philosophically debilitating teaching was soon followed by the invention of the doctrine of the eternal escape from self by submergence in the universal rest and peace of absolute union with <a href="/en/topic/Brahman">Brahman</a>, the oversoul of all creation. Mortal desire and human <a href="/en/topic/ambitions">ambition</a> were effectually ravished and virtually destroyed. For more than two thousand years the better minds of <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a> have sought to escape from all desire, and thus was opened wide the door for the entrance of those later cults and teachings which have virtually shackled the souls of many Hindu peoples in the chains of spiritual hopelessness. Of all civilizations, the Vedic-Aryan paid the most terrible price for its rejection of the <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> gospel.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p2_5">94:2.5</a></small></sup>  Caste alone could not perpetuate the <a href="/en/topic/Aryans">Aryan</a> religio-cultural system, and as the inferior religions of the <a href="/en/topic/Deccan">Deccan</a> permeated the north, there developed an age of despair and hopelessness. It was during these dark days that the <a href="/en/topic/cult_of_taking_no_life">cult of taking no life</a> arose, and it has ever since persisted. Many of the new <a href="/en/topic/cults">cults</a> were frankly <a href="/en/topic/atheism">atheistic</a>, claiming that such salvation as was attainable could come only by man’s own unaided efforts. But throughout a great deal of all this unfortunate philosophy, distorted remnants of the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> and even the Adamic teachings can be traced.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p2_6">94:2.6</a></small></sup>  These were the times of the compilation of the later scriptures of the Hindu faith, the <a href="/en/topic/Brahmanas">Brahmanas</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Upanishads">Upanishads</a>. Having rejected the teachings of personal religion through the personal faith experience with the one <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, and having become contaminated with the flood of debasing and debilitating cults and creeds from the Deccan, with their anthropomorphisms and reincarnations, the Brahmanic priesthood experienced a violent reaction against these vitiating beliefs; there was a definite effort to seek and to find <i>true reality.</i> The Brahmans set out to deanthropomorphize the Indian concept of deity, but in so doing they stumbled into the grievous error of depersonalizing the concept of God, and they emerged, not with a lofty and spiritual ideal of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Father, but with a distant and metaphysical idea of an all-encompassing <a href="/en/topic/Absolute">Absolute</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p2_7">94:2.7</a></small></sup>  In their efforts at self-preservation the Brahmans had rejected the one God of <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a>, and now they found themselves with the hypothesis of <a href="/en/topic/Brahman">Brahman</a>, that indefinite and illusive philosophic self, that impersonal and impotent <i>it</i> which has left the spiritual life of <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a> helpless and prostrate from that unfortunate day to the twentieth century.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_7_2"><a href="#fn_s2_7_2">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p2_8">94:2.8</a></small></sup>  It was during the times of the writing of the <a href="/en/topic/Upanishads">Upanishads</a> that <a href="/en/topic/Buddhism">Buddhism</a> arose in India. But despite its successes of a thousand years, it could not compete with later <a href="/en/topic/Hinduism">Hinduism</a>; despite a higher morality, its early portrayal of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> was even less well-defined than was that of Hinduism, which provided for lesser and personal deities. Buddhism finally gave way in northern India before the onslaught of a militant <a href="/en/topic/Islam">Islam</a> with its clear-cut concept of <a href="/en/topic/Allah">Allah</a> as the supreme God of the universe.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. BRAHMANIC PHILOSOPHY </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p3_1">94:3.1</a></small></sup>  While the highest phase of <a href="/en/topic/Brahmanism">Brahmanism</a> was hardly a religion, it was truly one of the most noble reaches of the mortal mind into the domains of philosophy and metaphysics. Having started out to discover final reality, the Indian mind did not stop until it had speculated about almost every phase of theology excepting the essential dual concept of religion: the existence of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a> of all universe creatures and the fact of the ascending experience in the universe of these very creatures as they seek to attain the eternal Father, who has commanded them to be perfect, even as he is perfect.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p3_2">94:3.2</a></small></sup>  In the concept of <a href="/en/topic/Brahman">Brahman</a> the minds of those days truly grasped at the idea of some all-pervading <a href="/en/topic/Absolute">Absolute</a>, for this postulate was at one and the same time identified as creative energy and cosmic reaction. Brahman was conceived to be beyond all definition, capable of being comprehended only by the successive negation of all finite qualities. It was definitely a belief in an absolute, even an infinite, being, but this concept was largely devoid of personality attributes and was therefore not experiencible by individual religionists.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p3_3">94:3.3</a></small></sup>  Brahman-Narayana was conceived as the Absolute, the infinite IT IS, the primordial creative potency of the potential cosmos, the Universal Self existing static and potential throughout all eternity. Had the philosophers of those days been able to make the next advance in deity conception, had they been able to conceive of the Brahman as associative and creative, as a personality approachable by created and evolving beings, then might such a teaching have become the most advanced portraiture of <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> since it would have encompassed <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> five levels of total deity function and might possibly have envisioned the remaining two.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_3_8"><a href="#fn_a3_3_8">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p3_4">94:3.4</a></small></sup>  In certain phases the concept of the One <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Oversoul">Universal Oversoul</a> as the totality of the summation of all creature existence led the Indian philosophers very close to the truth of the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme">Supreme</a> Being, but this truth availed them naught because they failed to evolve any reasonable or rational personal approach to the attainment of their theoretic monotheistic goal of Brahman-Narayana.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_4_1"><a href="#fn_a3_4_1">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p3_5">94:3.5</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/karma">karma</a> principle of causality continuity is, again, very close to the truth of the repercussional synthesis of all time-space actions in the <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> presence of the Supreme; but this postulate never provided for the co-ordinate personal attainment of Deity by the individual religionist, only for the ultimate engulfment of all personality by the Universal Oversoul.</p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p3_6">94:3.6</a></small></sup>  The philosophy of <a href="/en/topic/Brahmanism">Brahmanism</a> also came very near to the realization of the indwelling of the <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Thought Adjusters</a>, only to become perverted through the misconception of truth. The teaching that the soul is the indwelling of the <a href="/en/topic/Brahman">Brahman</a> would have paved the way for an advanced religion had not this concept been completely vitiated by the belief that there is no human individuality apart from this indwelling of the Universal One.</p>
<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p3_7">94:3.7</a></small></sup>  In the doctrine of the merging of the self-soul with the Oversoul, the theologians of <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a> failed to provide for the survival of something human, something new and unique, something born of the union of the will of man and the will of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. The teaching of the <a href="/en/topic/soul">soul</a>’s return to the Brahman is closely parallel to the truth of the Adjuster’s return to the bosom of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>, but there is something distinct from the Adjuster which also survives, the morontial counterpart of mortal personality. And this vital concept was fatally absent from Brahmanic philosophy.</p>
<p id="p3_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p3_8">94:3.8</a></small></sup>  Brahmanic philosophy has approximated many of the facts of the universe and has approached numerous cosmic truths, but it has all too often fallen victim to the error of failing to differentiate between the several levels of reality, such as absolute, transcendental, and finite. It has failed to take into account that what may be finite-illusory on the absolute level may be absolutely real on the finite level. And it has also taken no cognizance of the essential personality of the Universal Father, who is personally contactable on all levels from the evolutionary creature’s limited experience with God on up to the limitless experience of the <a href="/en/topic/Eternal_Son">Eternal Son</a> with the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Father.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_8_22"><a href="#fn_a3_8_22">[6]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p5_1">94:5.1</a></small></sup>  As the <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> missionaries passed through <a href="/en/topic/Asia">Asia</a>, spreading the doctrine of the <a href="/en/topic/Most_High">Most High</a> <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and salvation through faith, they absorbed much of the philosophy and religious thought of the various countries traversed. But the teachers commissioned by <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> and his successors did not default in their trust; they did penetrate to all peoples of the Eurasian continent, and it was in the middle of the second millennium before <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a> that they arrived in <a href="/en/topic/China">China</a>. At <a href="/en/topic/See_Fuch">See Fuch</a>, for more than one hundred years, the Salemites maintained their headquarters, there training <a href="/en/topic/Chinese">Chinese</a> teachers who taught throughout all the domains of the yellow race.</p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p5_2">94:5.2</a></small></sup>  It was in direct consequence of this teaching that the earliest form of <a href="/en/topic/Taoism">Taoism</a> arose in China, a vastly different religion than the one which bears that name today. Early or proto-Taoism was a compound of the following factors:</p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p5_3">94:5.3</a></small></sup>  1. The lingering teachings of <a href="/en/topic/Singlangton">Singlangton</a>, which persisted in the concept of <a href="/en/topic/Shang-ti">Shang-ti</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> of Heaven. In the times of Singlangton the <a href="/en/topic/Chinese">Chinese</a> people became virtually monotheistic; they concentrated their worship on the <a href="/en/topic/One_Truth">One Truth</a>, later known as the Spirit of Heaven, the universe ruler. And the yellow race never fully lost this early concept of <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>, although in subsequent centuries many subordinate gods and spirits insidiously crept into their <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a>.</p>
<p id="p5_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p5_4">94:5.4</a></small></sup>  2. The <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> religion of a <a href="/en/topic/Most_High">Most High</a> Creator Deity who would bestow his favor upon mankind in response to man’s faith. But it is all too true that, by the time the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> missionaries had penetrated to the lands of the yellow race, their original message had become considerably changed from the simple doctrines of Salem in the days of Machiventa.</p>
<p id="p5_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p5_5">94:5.5</a></small></sup>  3. The Brahman-Absolute concept of the Indian philosophers, coupled with the desire to escape all evil. Perhaps the greatest extraneous influence in the eastward spread of the Salem religion was exerted by the Indian teachers of the Vedic faith, who injected their conception of the <a href="/en/topic/Brahman">Brahman</a>—the <a href="/en/topic/Absolute">Absolute</a>—into the salvationistic thought of the Salemites.</p>
<p id="p5_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p5_6">94:5.6</a></small></sup>  This composite belief spread through the lands of the yellow and brown races as an underlying influence in religio-philosophic thought. In <a href="/en/topic/Japan">Japan</a> this proto-Taoism was known as <a href="/en/topic/Shinto">Shinto</a>, and in this country, far-distant from <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a>, the peoples learned of the incarnation of <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Machiventa Melchizedek</a>, who dwelt upon earth that the name of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> might not be forgotten by mankind.</p>
<p id="p5_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p5_7">94:5.7</a></small></sup>  In <a href="/en/topic/China">China</a> all of these beliefs were later confused and compounded with the ever-growing cult of <a href="/en/topic/ancestor_worship">ancestor worship</a>. But never since the time of <a href="/en/topic/Singlangton">Singlangton</a> have the <a href="/en/topic/Chinese">Chinese</a> fallen into helpless slavery to priestcraft. The yellow race was <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> to emerge from barbaric bondage into orderly civilization because it was the first to achieve some measure of freedom from the abject fear of the gods, not even fearing the ghosts of the dead as other races feared them. China met her defeat because she failed to progress beyond her early emancipation from priests; she fell into an almost equally calamitous error, the worship of ancestors.</p>
<p id="p5_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p5_8">94:5.8</a></small></sup>  But the Salemites did not labor in vain.

<p id="p6_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p6_5">94:6.5</a></small></sup>  He taught the return of the creature to the Creator and pictured life as the emergence of a personality from the cosmic potentials, while death was like the returning home of this creature personality.

<p id="p7_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p7_1">94:7.1</a></small></sup>  Contemporary with <a href="/en/topic/Lao-tse">Lao-tse</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Confucius">Confucius</a> in <a href="/en/topic/China">China</a>, another great teacher of truth arose in <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a>. <a href="/en/topic/Gautama_Siddhartha">Gautama Siddhartha</a> was born in the sixth century before <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a> in the north Indian province of <a href="/en/topic/Nepal">Nepal</a>.

<p id="p7_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p7_2">94:7.2</a></small></sup>  Gautama formulated those theories which grew into the philosophy of <a href="/en/topic/Buddhism">Buddhism</a> after six years of the futile practice of <a href="/en/topic/Yoga">Yoga</a>. Siddhartha made a determined but unavailing fight against the growing caste system. There was a lofty sincerity and a unique unselfishness about this young prophet prince that greatly appealed to the men of those days.

He denounced gods, priests, and their sacrifices, but he too failed to perceive the <i>personality</i> of the One Universal. Not believing in the existence of individual human souls, Gautama, of course, made a valiant fight against the time-honored belief in transmigration of the soul. He made a noble effort to deliver men from fear, to make them feel at ease and at home in the great universe, but he failed to show them the pathway to that real and supernal home of <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortals</a>—<a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>—and to the expanding service of eternal existence.</p>

It was more representative of the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> truths than any other religious system to be found throughout eastern <a href="/en/topic/Asia">Asia</a>. But Buddhism did not become widespread as a religion until it was espoused in self-protection by the low-caste monarch <a href="/en/topic/Asoka">Asoka</a>, who, next to <a href="/en/topic/Ikhnaton">Ikhnaton</a> in <a href="/en/topic/Egypt">Egypt</a>, was one of the most remarkable civil rulers between Melchizedek and <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a>. Asoka built a great Indian empire through the propaganda of his Buddhist missionaries. During a period of twenty-five years he trained and sent forth more than seventeen thousand missionaries to the farthest frontiers of all the known world. In one generation he made Buddhism the dominant religion of one half the world. It soon became established in <a href="/en/topic/Tibet">Tibet</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Kashmir">Kashmir</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Ceylon">Ceylon</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Burma">Burma</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Java">Java</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Siam">Siam</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Korea">Korea</a>, <a href="/en/topic/China">China</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Japan">Japan</a>.

<p id="p9_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p9_2">94:9.2</a></small></sup>  The spread of Buddhism from its homeland in India to all of Asia is one of the thrilling stories of the spiritual devotion and missionary persistence of sincere religionists. The teachers of Gautama’s gospel not only braved the perils of the overland caravan routes but faced the dangers of the <a href="/en/topic/China_Seas">China Seas</a> as they pursued their mission over the Asiatic continent, bringing to all peoples the message of their faith. But this Buddhism was no longer the simple doctrine of Gautama; it was the miraculized gospel which made him a god. And the farther Buddhism spread from its highland home in India, the more unlike the teachings of Gautama it became, and the more like the religions it supplanted, it grew to be.</p>

This new synthetic religion with its temples of worship and definite religious ceremonial soon became the generally accepted cult of the peoples of China, <a href="/en/topic/Korea">Korea</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Japan">Japan</a>.</p>
<p id="p11_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p11_2">94:11.2</a></small></sup>  While in some respects it is unfortunate that Buddhism was not carried to the world until after Gautama’s followers had so perverted the traditions and teachings of the cult as to make of him a divine being, nonetheless this myth of his human life, embellished as it was with a multitude of miracles, proved very appealing to the auditors of the northern or Mahayana gospel of Buddhism.</p>
<p id="p11_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p11_3">94:11.3</a></small></sup>  Some of his later followers taught that <a href="/en/topic/Sakyamuni_Buddha">Sakyamuni Buddha</a>’s spirit returned periodically to earth as a living <a href="/en/topic/Buddha">Buddha</a>, thus opening the way for an indefinite perpetuation of Buddha images, temples, rituals, and impostor “living Buddhas.” Thus did the religion of the great Indian protestant eventually find itself shackled with those very ceremonial practices and ritualistic incantations against which he had so fearlessly fought, and which he had so valiantly denounced.</p>
<p id="p11_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p11_4">94:11.4</a></small></sup>  The great advance made in Buddhist philosophy consisted in its comprehension of the relativity of all <a href="/en/topic/truth">truth</a>. Through the mechanism of this hypothesis <a href="/en/topic/Buddhism">Buddhists</a> have been able to reconcile and correlate the divergencies within their own religious scriptures as well as the differences between their own and many others.

And this teaching is one of the clearest presentations of the truth of the indwelling Adjusters ever to be made by a Urantian religion.</p>
<p id="p11_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p11_6">94:11.6</a></small></sup>  But a great limitation in the original gospel of <a href="/en/topic/Siddhartha">Siddhartha</a>, as it was interpreted by his followers, was that it attempted the complete liberation of the human self from all the limitations of the mortal nature by the technique of isolating the self from objective <a href="/en/topic/reality">reality</a>. True cosmic <a href="/en/topic/self-realization">self-realization</a> results from identification with cosmic reality and with the finite cosmos of energy, mind, and spirit, bounded by space and conditioned by time.</p>

Through more than two thousand years, many of the best minds of <a href="/en/topic/Asia">Asia</a> have concentrated upon the problem of ascertaining absolute truth and the truth of the <a href="/en/topic/Absolute">Absolute</a>.</p>
<p id="p11_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p11_8">94:11.8</a></small></sup>  The evolution of a high concept of the Absolute was achieved through many channels of thought and by devious paths of reasoning. The upward ascent of this doctrine of infinity was not so clearly defined as was the evolution of the <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> concept in Hebrew theology. Nevertheless, there were certain broad levels which the minds of the Buddhists reached, tarried upon, and passed through on their way to the envisioning of the Primal Source of universes:</p>
<p id="p11_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p11_9">94:11.9</a></small></sup>  1. <i>The Gautama legend.</i> At the base of the concept was the historic fact of the life and teachings of <a href="/en/topic/Siddhartha">Siddhartha</a>, the prophet prince of <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a>. This legend grew in myth as it traveled through the centuries and across the broad lands of <a href="/en/topic/Asia">Asia</a> until it surpassed the status of the idea of Gautama as the enlightened one and began to take on additional attributes.</p>
<p id="p11_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p11_10">94:11.10</a></small></sup>  2. <i>The many Buddhas.</i> It was reasoned that, if Gautama had come to the peoples of India, then, in the remote past and in the remote future, the races of mankind must have been, and undoubtedly would be, blessed with other teachers of truth. This gave rise to the teaching that there were many Buddhas, an unlimited and infinite number, even that anyone could aspire to become one—to attain the divinity of a <a href="/en/topic/Buddha">Buddha</a>.</p>
<p id="p11_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p11_11">94:11.11</a></small></sup>  3. <i>The <a href="/en/topic/Absolute_Buddha">Absolute Buddha</a>.</i> By the time the number of Buddhas was approaching infinity, it became necessary for the minds of those days to reunify this unwieldy concept. Accordingly it began to be taught that all Buddhas were but the manifestation of some higher essence, some Eternal One of infinite and unqualified existence, some <a href="/en/topic/Absolute">Absolute</a> Source of all reality. From here on, the <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> concept of <a href="/en/topic/Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, in its highest form, becomes divorced from the human person of <a href="/en/topic/Gautama_Siddhartha">Gautama Siddhartha</a> and casts off from the anthropomorphic limitations which have held it in leash.

The concept of Buddha, to an enlightened Buddhist, is no more the human personality of Gautama than the concept of <a href="/en/topic/Jehovah">Jehovah</a> is identical with the spirit demon of <a href="/en/topic/Horeb">Horeb</a> to an enlightened Christian. Paucity of terminology, together with the sentimental retention of olden nomenclature, is often provocative of the failure to understand the true significance of the evolution of religious concepts.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a12_1_23"><a href="#fn_a12_1_23">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p12_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p12_2">94:12.2</a></small></sup>  Gradually the concept of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, as contrasted with the <a href="/en/topic/Absolute">Absolute</a>, began to appear in Buddhism. Its sources are back in the early days of this differentiation of the followers of the <a href="/en/topic/Lesser_Road">Lesser Road</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Greater_Road">Greater Road</a>. It was among the latter division of Buddhism that the dual conception of God and the Absolute finally matured. Step by step, century by century, the God concept has evolved until, with the teachings of <a href="/en/topic/Ryonin">Ryonin</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Honen_Shonin">Honen Shonin</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Shinran">Shinran</a> in <a href="/en/topic/Japan">Japan</a>, this concept finally came to fruit in the belief in <a href="/en/topic/Amida_Buddha">Amida Buddha</a>.</p>
<p id="p12_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p12_3">94:12.3</a></small></sup>  Among these believers it is taught that the soul, upon experiencing death, may elect to enjoy a sojourn in <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> prior to entering <a href="/en/topic/Nirvana">Nirvana</a>, the ultimate of existence. It is proclaimed that this new <a href="/en/topic/salvation">salvation</a> is attained by faith in the divine mercies and loving care of Amida, God of the Paradise in the west. In their philosophy, the <a href="/en/topic/Amidist">Amidists</a> hold to an <a href="/en/topic/Infinite">Infinite</a> Reality which is beyond all finite mortal comprehension; in their religion, they cling to faith in the all-merciful Amida, who so loves the world that he will not suffer one mortal who calls on his name in true faith and with a pure heart to fail in the attainment of the supernal happiness of Paradise.</p>
<p id="p12_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p12_4">94:12.4</a></small></sup>  The great strength of <a href="/en/topic/Buddhism">Buddhism</a> is that its adherents are free to choose truth from all religions; such freedom of choice has seldom characterized a Urantian faith. In this respect the Shin sect of <a href="/en/topic/Japan">Japan</a> has become one of the most progressive religious groups in the world; it has revived the ancient missionary spirit of Gautama’s followers and has begun to send teachers to other peoples. This willingness to appropriate truth from any and all sources is indeed a commendable tendency to appear among religious believers during <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> half of the twentieth century after <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a>.</p>
<p id="p12_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p12_5">94:12.5</a></small></sup>  Buddhism itself is undergoing a twentieth-century renaissance. Through contact with <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a> the social aspects of Buddhism have been greatly enhanced. The desire to learn has been rekindled in the hearts of the monk priests of the brotherhood, and the spread of education throughout this faith will be certainly provocative of new advances in religious evolution.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a12_5_3"><a href="#fn_a12_5_3">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p12_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p12_6">94:12.6</a></small></sup>  At the time of this writing, much of <a href="/en/topic/Asia">Asia</a> rests its hope in <a href="/en/topic/Buddhism">Buddhism</a>. Will this noble faith, that has so valiantly carried on through the dark ages of the past, once again receive the truth of expanded cosmic realities even as the disciples of the great teacher in <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a> once listened to his proclamation of new truth? Will this ancient faith respond once more to the invigorating stimulus of the presentation of new concepts of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Absolute">Absolute</a> for which it has so long searched?<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a12_6_10"><a href="#fn_a12_6_10">[33]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a12_6_28"><a href="#fn_a12_6_28">[34]</a></sup></p>
