But since the bestowal of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a>, they are assigned in accordance with human intelligence, spirituality, and destiny. Intellectually, mankind is divided into three classes:<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_25"><a href="#fn_a1_2_25">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_2_26"><a href="#fn_a1_2_26">[3]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_2_1"><a href="#fn_s1_2_1">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_2_7"><a href="#fn_s1_2_7">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p1_3">113:1.3</a></small></sup>  1. The subnormal minded—those who do not exercise normal will power; those who do not make average decisions. This class embraces those who cannot comprehend <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>; they lack capacity for the intelligent worship of <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>. The subnormal beings of Urantia have a corps of seraphim, one company, with one battalion of <a href="/en/topic/cherubim_and_sanobim">cherubim</a>, assigned to minister to them and to witness that justice and mercy are extended to them in the life struggles of the sphere.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_3_25"><a href="#fn_a1_3_25">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_3_15"><a href="#fn_a1_3_15">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p1_4">113:1.4</a></small></sup>  2. The average, normal type of human mind. From the standpoint of seraphic ministry, most men and women are grouped in seven classes in accordance with their status in making the circles of human progress and spiritual development.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p1_5">113:1.5</a></small></sup>  3. The supernormal minded—those of great decision and undoubted potential of spiritual achievement; men and women who enjoy more or less contact with their indwelling Adjusters; members of the various <a href="/en/topic/reserve_corps_of_destiny">reserve corps of destiny</a>. No matter in what circle a human happens to be, if such an individual becomes enrolled in any of the several reserve corps of destiny, right then and there, personal <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> are assigned, and from that time until the earthly career is finished, that mortal will enjoy the continuous ministry and unceasing watchcare of a guardian angel. Also, when any human being makes <i>the</i> supreme decision, when there is a real betrothal with the Adjuster, a <a href="/en/topic/guardians_of_destiny">personal guardian</a> is immediately assigned to that soul.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p1_6">113:1.6</a></small></sup>  In the ministry to so-called normal beings, seraphic assignments are made in accordance with the human attainment of the circles of intellectuality and spirituality. You start out in your mind of mortal investment in the seventh circle and journey inward in the task of self-understanding, self-conquest, and self-mastery; and circle by circle you advance until (if natural death does not terminate your career and transfer your struggles to the mansion worlds) you reach <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> or inner circle of relative contact and communion with the indwelling Adjuster.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_6_24"><a href="#fn_a1_6_24">[5]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_6_7"><a href="#fn_s1_6_7">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p1_7">113:1.7</a></small></sup>  Human beings in the initial or seventh circle have one guardian angel with one company of assisting <a href="/en/topic/cherubim_and_sanobim">cherubim</a> assigned to the watchcare and custody of one thousand <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a>. In the sixth circle, a seraphic pair with one company of cherubim is assigned to guide these <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortals</a> in groups of five hundred. When the fifth circle is attained, human beings are grouped in companies of approximately one hundred, and a pair of guardian <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> with a group of cherubim is placed in charge. Upon attainment of the fourth circle, mortal beings are assembled in groups of ten, and again charge is given to a pair of seraphim, assisted by one company of cherubim.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_7_24"><a href="#fn_a1_7_24">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_7_17"><a href="#fn_a1_7_17">[6]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_7_7"><a href="#fn_s1_7_7">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_7_0"><a href="#fn_s1_7_0">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p2_1">113:2.1</a></small></sup>  Seraphim are not known as <a href="/en/topic/guardians_of_destiny">guardians of destiny</a> until such time as they are assigned to the association of a human soul who has realized one or more of three achievements: has made a supreme decision to become Godlike, has entered the third circle, or has been mustered into one of the <a href="/en/topic/reserve_corps_of_destiny">reserve corps of destiny</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_1_22"><a href="#fn_a2_1_22">[8]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_1"><a href="#fn_s2_1_1">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p2_2">113:2.2</a></small></sup>  In the evolution of races a guardian of destiny is assigned to the very first being who attains the requisite circle of conquest. On <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> mortal to secure a personal guardian was <a href="/en/topic/Rantowoc">Rantowoc</a>, a wise man of the <a href="/en/topic/red_race">red race</a> of long ago.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p2_3">113:2.3</a></small></sup>  All angelic assignments are made from a group of volunteering <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a>, and these appointments are always in accordance with human needs and with regard to the status of the angelic pair—in the light of seraphic experience, skill, and wisdom. Only seraphim of long service, the more experienced and tested types, are assigned as destiny <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple_guards">guards</a>. Many guardians have gained much valuable experience on those worlds which are of the non-Adjuster fusion series. Like the Adjusters, the seraphim attend these beings for a single lifetime and then are liberated for new assignment. Many guardians on Urantia have had this previous practical experience on other worlds.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_3_1"><a href="#fn_s2_3_1">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p2_4">113:2.4</a></small></sup>  When human beings fail to survive, their personal or group guardians may repeatedly serve in similar capacities on the same planet. The seraphim develop a sentimental regard for individual worlds and entertain a special affection for certain races and types of mortal creatures with whom they have been so closely and intimately associated.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_4_22"><a href="#fn_a2_4_22">[8]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_4_1"><a href="#fn_s2_4_1">[2]</a></sup></p>

Divested of material bodies, given spirit forms, you would be very near the angels in many attributes of personality. They share most of your emotions and experience some additional ones. The only emotion actuating you which is somewhat difficult for them to comprehend is the legacy of animal <a href="/en/topic/fear">fear</a> that bulks so large in the mental life of the average inhabitant of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>. The angels really find it hard to understand why you will so persistently allow your higher intellectual powers, even your religious faith, to be so dominated by fear, so thoroughly demoralized by the thoughtless panic of dread and <a href="/en/topic/anxiety">anxiety</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_5_15"><a href="#fn_a2_5_15">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_5_7"><a href="#fn_a2_5_7">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_5_9"><a href="#fn_a2_5_9">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_5_13"><a href="#fn_a2_5_13">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_5_32"><a href="#fn_a2_5_32">[12]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_5_1"><a href="#fn_s2_5_1">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p2_6">113:2.6</a></small></sup>  All seraphim have individual names, but in the records of assignment to world service they are frequently designated by their planetary numbers. At the universe headquarters they are registered by name and number. The destiny guardian of the human subject used in this contactual communication is number 3 of group 17, of company 126, of battalion 4, of unit 384, of legion 6, of host 37, of the 182,314<sup>th</sup> seraphic army of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>. The current planetary assignment number of this seraphim on Urantia and to this human subject is 3,641,852.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p2_7">113:2.7</a></small></sup>  In the ministry of personal guardianship, the assignment of <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a> as destiny guardians, <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> always volunteer their services. In the city of this visitation a certain mortal was recently admitted to the <a href="/en/topic/reserve_corps_of_destiny">reserve corps of destiny</a>, and since all such humans are personally attended by <a href="/en/topic/guardian_angels">guardian angels</a>, more than one hundred qualified seraphim sought the assignment. The planetary director selected twelve of the more experienced individuals and subsequently appointed the seraphim whom they selected as best adapted to guide this human being through his life journey. That is, they selected a certain pair of equally qualified seraphim; one of this seraphic pair will always be on duty.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p2_8">113:2.8</a></small></sup>  Seraphic tasks may be unremitting, but either of the angelic pair can discharge all ministering responsibilities. Like <a href="/en/topic/cherubim_and_sanobim">cherubim</a>, seraphim usually serve in pairs, but unlike their less advanced associates, the seraphim sometimes work singly. In practically all their contacts with human beings they can function as individuals. Both angels are required only for communication and service on the higher circuits of the universes.</p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p2_9">113:2.9</a></small></sup>  When a seraphic pair accept guardian assignment, they serve for the remainder of the life of that human being. The <a href="/en/topic/complement_of_being">complement of being</a> (one of the two <a href="/en/topic/angels">angels</a>) becomes the recorder of the undertaking. These complemental <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> are the recording angels of the <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of the evolutionary worlds. The <a href="/en/topic/records">records</a> are kept by the pair of cherubim (a cherubim and a <a href="/en/topic/sanobim">sanobim</a>) who are always associated with the seraphic guardians, but these records are always sponsored by one of the seraphim.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_9_1"><a href="#fn_s2_9_1">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_9_7"><a href="#fn_s2_9_7">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p2_10">113:2.10</a></small></sup>  For purposes of <a href="/en/topic/rest">rest</a> and recharging with the life energy of the universe circuits, the guardian is periodically relieved by her complement, and during her absence the associated <a href="/en/topic/cherubim_and_sanobim">cherubim</a> functions as the recorder, as is also the case when the complemental seraphim is similarly absent.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. RELATION TO OTHER SPIRIT INFLUENCES </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p3_1">113:3.1</a></small></sup>  One of the most important things a destiny guardian does for her mortal subject is to effect a personal co-ordination of the numerous impersonal spirit influences which indwell, surround, and impinge upon the mind and soul of the evolving material creature. Human beings are personalities, and it is exceedingly difficult for nonpersonal spirits and prepersonal entities to make direct contact with such highly material and discretely personal minds. In the ministry of the guarding angel all of these influences are more or less unified and made more nearly appreciable by the expanding moral nature of the evolving human personality.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_1_1"><a href="#fn_s3_1_1">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p3_2">113:3.2</a></small></sup>  More especially can and does this seraphic guardian correlate the manifold agencies and influences of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a>, ranging from the domains of the physical controllers and the <a href="/en/topic/adjutant_mind-spirits">adjutant mind-spirits</a> up to the <a href="/en/topic/Holy_Spirit">Holy Spirit</a> of the Divine Minister and to the Omnipresent Spirit presence of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> <a href="/en/topic/Third_Source_and_Center">Third Source and Center</a>. Having thus unified and made more personal these vast ministries of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite">Infinite</a> Spirit, the <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> then undertakes to correlate this integrated influence of the <a href="/en/topic/Conjoint_Actor">Conjoint Actor</a> with the spirit presences of the Father and the Son.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_2_1"><a href="#fn_s3_2_1">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s3_2_7"><a href="#fn_s3_2_7">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p3_3">113:3.3</a></small></sup>  The Adjuster is the presence of the Father; the <a href="/en/topic/Spirit_of_Truth">Spirit of Truth</a>, the presence of the Sons. These divine endowments are unified and co-ordinated on the lower levels of human spiritual experience by the ministry of the guardian seraphim. The angelic servers are gifted in combining the love of the Father and the mercy of the Son in their ministry to mortal creatures.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_3_22"><a href="#fn_a3_3_22">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_3_29"><a href="#fn_a3_3_29">[13]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_3_1"><a href="#fn_s3_3_1">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p3_4">113:3.4</a></small></sup>  And herein is revealed the reason why the seraphic guardian eventually becomes the personal custodian of the mind patterns, memory formulas, and soul realities of the mortal survivor during that interval between physical death and morontia resurrection. None but the ministering children of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite_Spirit">Infinite Spirit</a> could thus function in behalf of the human creature during this phase of transition from one level of the universe to another and higher level. Even when you engage in your terminal transition slumber, when you pass from time to eternity, a high <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a> likewise shares the transit with you as the custodian of creature identity and the surety of personal integrity.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_4_1"><a href="#fn_s3_4_1">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s3_4_7"><a href="#fn_s3_4_7">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p3_5">113:3.5</a></small></sup>  On the spiritual level, <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> make personal many otherwise impersonal and prepersonal ministries of the universe; they are co-ordinators. On the intellectual level they are the correlators of mind and morontia; they are interpreters.
