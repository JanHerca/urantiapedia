There was a great contrast between <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. John was an eager and earnest worker, but Jesus was a calm and happy laborer; only a few times in his entire life was he ever in a <a href="/en/topic/haste">hurry</a>. Jesus was a comforting consolation to the world and somewhat of an <a href="/en/topic/example">example</a>; John was hardly a comfort or an example. He preached the <a href="/en/topic/kingdom_of_heaven">kingdom of heaven</a> but hardly entered into the happiness thereof. Though Jesus spoke of John as the greatest of the <a href="/en/topic/prophets">prophets</a> of the old order, he also said that the least of those who saw the great light of the new way and entered thereby into the kingdom of heaven was indeed greater than John<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_1_14"><a href="#fn_a0_1_14">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_1_19"><a href="#fn_a0_1_19">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_1_23"><a href="#fn_a0_1_23">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_1_29"><a href="#fn_a0_1_29">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_1_30"><a href="#fn_a0_1_30">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_1_31"><a href="#fn_a0_1_31">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_1_41"><a href="#fn_a0_1_41">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_1_46"><a href="#fn_a0_1_46">[8]</a></sup></p>

When Jesus began to preach, there remained the exhortation to <a href="/en/topic/repentance">repentance</a>, but such a message was always followed by the <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a>, the good tidings of the joy and liberty of the new kingdom.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p1_1">136:1.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> entertained many ideas about the expected <a href="/en/topic/Deliverer">deliverer</a>, and each of these different schools of Messianic teaching was able to point to statements in the <a href="/en/topic/Hebrew_language">Hebrew</a> scriptures as proof of their contentions. In a general way, the <a href="/en/topic/Jews_(ancient_Hebrews)">Jews</a> regarded their national history as beginning with <a href="/en/topic/Abraham_the_Pharisee">Abraham</a> and culminating in the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a> and the new age of the kingdom of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. In earlier times they had envisaged this deliverer as “the servant of the Lord,” then as “the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>,” while latterly some even went so far as to refer to the Messiah as the “<a href="/en/topic/Son_of_God">Son of God</a>.” But no matter whether he was called the “seed of <a href="/en/topic/Abraham_(Old_Testament)">Abraham</a>” or “the son of <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a>,” all were agreed that he was to be the Messiah, the “anointed one.” Thus did the concept evolve from the “servant of the Lord” to the “son of <a href="/en/topic/David_Zebedee">David</a>,” “Son of Man,” and “Son of God<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_1_16"><a href="#fn_a1_1_16">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_1_22"><a href="#fn_a1_1_22">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p1_2">136:1.2</a></small></sup>  In the days of <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> the more learned Jews had developed an idea of the coming Messiah as the perfected and representative Israelite, combining in himself as the “servant of the Lord” the threefold office of prophet, priest, and king.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_8"><a href="#fn_a1_2_8">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p1_3">136:1.3</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> devoutly believed that, as <a href="/en/topic/Moses">Moses</a> had delivered their fathers from Egyptian bondage by miraculous wonders, so would the coming <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a> deliver the Jewish people from Roman domination by even greater miracles of power and marvels of racial triumph. The rabbis had gathered together almost five hundred passages from the Scriptures which, notwithstanding their apparent contradictions, they averred were prophetic of the coming Messiah. And amidst all these details of time, technique, and function, they almost completely lost sight of the <i>personality</i> of the promised Messiah. They were looking for a restoration of Jewish national glory—<a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a>’s temporal exaltation—rather than for the salvation of the world. It therefore becomes evident that Jesus of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> could never satisfy this materialistic Messianic concept of the Jewish mind. Many of their reputed Messianic predictions, had they but viewed these prophetic utterances in a different light, would have very naturally prepared their minds for a recognition of Jesus as the terminator of one age and the inaugurator of a new and better dispensation of mercy and salvation for all nations.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_3_10"><a href="#fn_a1_3_10">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_3_18"><a href="#fn_a1_3_18">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_3_20"><a href="#fn_a1_3_20">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p1_4">136:1.4</a></small></sup>  The Jews had been brought up to believe in the doctrine of the <i><a href="/en/topic/Shekinah">Shekinah</a>.</i> But this reputed symbol of the Divine Presence was not to be seen in the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>. They believed that the coming of the Messiah would effect its restoration. They held confusing ideas about racial sin and the supposed evil nature of man. Some taught that <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a>’s sin had cursed the human race, and that the Messiah would remove this curse and restore man to divine favor. Others taught that <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, in creating man, had put into his being both good and evil natures; that when he observed the outworking of this arrangement, he was greatly disappointed, and that “He repented that he had thus made man<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>.” And those who taught this believed that the Messiah was to come in order to redeem man from this inherent evil nature.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p1_5">136:1.5</a></small></sup>  The majority of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> believed that they continued to languish under Roman rule because of their national sins and because of the halfheartedness of the gentile proselytes. The Jewish nation had not wholeheartedly <i>repented;</i> therefore did the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a> delay his coming. There was much talk about <a href="/en/topic/repentance">repentance</a>; wherefore the mighty and immediate appeal of <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a>’s preaching, “Repent and be baptized, for the <a href="/en/topic/kingdom_of_heaven">kingdom of heaven</a> is at hand<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>.” And the kingdom of heaven could mean only one thing to any devout Jew: The coming of the Messiah.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p1_6">136:1.6</a></small></sup>  There was one feature of the bestowal of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a> which was utterly foreign to the Jewish conception of the Messiah, and that was the <i>union</i> of the two natures, the human and the divine. The Jews had variously conceived of the Messiah as perfected human, superhuman, and even as divine, but they never entertained the concept of the <i>union</i> of the human and the divine. And this was the great stumbling block of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ early disciples. They grasped the human concept of the Messiah as the son of <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a>, as presented by the earlier prophets; as the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>, the superhuman idea of <a href="/en/topic/Daniel">Daniel</a> and some of the later prophets; and even as the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_God">Son of God</a>, as depicted by the author of the <a href="/en/topic/apocrypha">Book of Enoch</a> and by certain of his contemporaries; but never had they for a single moment entertained the true concept of the union in one earth personality of the two natures, the human and the divine<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>. The incarnation of the Creator in the form of the creature had not been revealed beforehand. It was revealed only in Jesus; the world knew nothing of such things until the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> was made flesh and dwelt among the <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of the realm.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b9"><a href="#fn_b9">[9]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_6_3"><a href="#fn_a1_6_3">[15]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p2_1">136:2.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was baptized at the very height of <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a>’s preaching when <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a> was aflame with the expectancy of his message—“the kingdom of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> is at hand”—when all Jewry was engaged in serious and solemn self-examination<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b11"><a href="#fn_b11">[11]</a></sup>. The Jewish sense of racial solidarity was very profound. The <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> not only believed that the sins of the father might afflict his children, but they firmly believed that the <a href="/en/topic/sin">sin</a> of one individual might curse the nation. Accordingly, not all who submitted to <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John</a>’s baptism regarded themselves as being guilty of the specific sins which John denounced. Many devout souls were baptized by John for the good of <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a>. They feared lest some sin of ignorance on their part might delay the coming of the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b12"><a href="#fn_b12">[12]</a></sup>. They felt themselves to belong to a guilty and sin-cursed nation, and they presented themselves for baptism that they might by so doing manifest fruits of race penitence. It is therefore evident that Jesus in no sense received John’s baptism as a rite of repentance or for the remission of sins. In accepting baptism at the hands of John, Jesus was only following the example of many pious <a href="/en/topic/Israelites">Israelites</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_1_19"><a href="#fn_a2_1_19">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_1_46"><a href="#fn_a2_1_46">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_1_38"><a href="#fn_a2_1_38">[16]</a></sup></p>

He stood in the Jordan that day a perfected mortal of the evolutionary <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_worlds">worlds</a> of time and space. Perfect synchrony and full communication had become established between the mortal mind of Jesus and the indwelling spirit <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Adjuster</a>, the divine gift of his Father in <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>.

<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p2_3">136:2.3</a></small></sup>  Ordinarily, when a mortal of the realm attains such high levels of personality perfection, there occur those preliminary phenomena of spiritual elevation which terminate in eventual <a href="/en/topic/fusion">fusion</a> of the matured soul of the mortal with its associated divine Adjuster. And such a change was apparently due to take place in the personality experience of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> of Nazareth on that very day when he went down into the Jordan with his two brothers to be baptized by <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a>. This <a href="/en/topic/ceremonies">ceremony</a> was the final act of his purely human life on Urantia, and many superhuman observers expected to witness the fusion of the Adjuster with its indwelt mind, but they were all destined to suffer disappointment. Something new and even greater occurred. As <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John</a> laid his hands upon Jesus to baptize him, the indwelling Adjuster took final leave of the perfected human soul of <a href="/en/topic/Joshua_ben_Joseph">Joshua ben Joseph</a>. And in a few moments this divine entity returned from <a href="/en/topic/Divinington">Divinington</a> as a Personalized Adjuster and chief of his kind throughout the entire local universe of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b13"><a href="#fn_b13">[13]</a></sup>. Thus did Jesus observe his own former divine spirit descending on its return to him in personalized form. And he heard this same spirit of Paradise origin now speak, saying, “This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b14"><a href="#fn_b14">[14]</a></sup>.” And John, with Jesus’ two brothers, also heard these words. John’s disciples, standing by the water’s edge, did not hear these words, neither did they see the apparition of the Personalized Adjuster. Only the eyes of Jesus beheld the Personalized Adjuster.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_3_7"><a href="#fn_a2_3_7">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_3_9"><a href="#fn_a2_3_9">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_3_44"><a href="#fn_a2_3_44">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_3_53"><a href="#fn_a2_3_53">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_3_6"><a href="#fn_a2_3_6">[24]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_3_26"><a href="#fn_a2_3_26">[25]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_3_43"><a href="#fn_a2_3_43">[26]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_3_2"><a href="#fn_s2_3_2">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_3_1"><a href="#fn_s2_3_1">[3]</a></sup></p>

His was the baptism of consecration to the performance of the will of the heavenly Father. At his baptism he heard the unmistakable call of his Father, the final summons to be about his <a href="/en/topic/Fathers_business">Father’s business</a>, and he went away into private seclusion for forty days to think over these manifold problems. In thus retiring for a season from active personality contact with his earthly associates, Jesus, as he was and on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>, was following the very procedure that obtains on the morontia <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_worlds">worlds</a> whenever an <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortal</a> fuses with the inner presence of the Universal Father.</p>

<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p4_1">136:4.1</a></small></sup>  Day by day, up in the hills, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> formulated the plans for the remainder of his <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> bestowal. He first decided not to teach contemporaneously with <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a>. He planned to remain in comparative retirement until the work of <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John</a> achieved its purpose, or until John was suddenly stopped by imprisonment. Jesus well knew that John’s fearless and tactless preaching would presently arouse the fears and enmity of the civil rulers. In view of John’s precarious situation, Jesus began definitely to plan his program of <a href="/en/topic/public_work">public labors</a> in behalf of his people and the world, in behalf of every inhabited world throughout his vast universe. <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a>’s mortal bestowal was <i>on</i> Urantia but <i>for</i> all <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_worlds">worlds</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p4_2">136:4.2</a></small></sup>  The first thing Jesus did, after thinking through the general plan of co-ordinating his program with John’s movement, was to review in his mind the instructions of <a href="/en/topic/Immanuel">Immanuel</a>. Carefully he thought over the advice given him concerning his methods of labor, and that he was to leave no permanent <a href="/en/topic/writing">writing</a> on the planet. Never again did Jesus write on anything except sand. On his next visit to <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, much to the sorrow of his brother <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>, Jesus destroyed all of his writing that was preserved on the boards about the carpenter shop, and which hung upon the walls of the old home.

The longest period he went without food was his first two days in the hills when he was so engrossed with his thinking that he forgot all about eating. But on the third day he went in search of food. Neither was he <i>tempted</i> during this time by any evil spirits or rebel personalities of station on this world or from any other world<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b21"><a href="#fn_b21">[21]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_3_45"><a href="#fn_a4_3_45">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p4_4">136:4.4</a></small></sup>  These forty days were the occasion of the final conference between the human and the divine minds, or rather <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> real functioning of these two minds as now made one. The results of this momentous season of meditation demonstrated conclusively that the divine mind has triumphantly and spiritually dominated the human intellect. The mind of man has become the mind of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> from this time on, and though the selfhood of the mind of man is ever present, always does this spiritualized human mind say, “Not my will but yours be done<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b22"><a href="#fn_b22">[22]</a></sup>.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_4_13"><a href="#fn_a4_4_13">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p4_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p4_5">136:4.5</a></small></sup>  The transactions of this eventful time were not the fantastic visions of a starved and weakened mind, neither were they the confused and puerile symbolisms which afterward gained record as the “temptations of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> in the wilderness<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b23"><a href="#fn_b23">[23]</a></sup>.” Rather was this a season for thinking over the whole eventful and varied career of the <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> bestowal and for the careful laying of those plans for further ministry which would best serve this world while also contributing something to the betterment of all other rebellion-isolated spheres. Jesus thought over the whole span of human life on Urantia, from the days of <a href="/en/topic/Andon_and_Fonta">Andon and Fonta</a>, down through <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a>’s default, and on to the ministry of the <a href="/en/topic/Machiventa_Melchizedek">Melchizedek</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p4_6">136:4.6</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a> had reminded Jesus that there were two ways in which he might manifest himself to the world in case he should choose to tarry on Urantia for a time. And it was made clear to Jesus that his choice in this matter would have nothing to do with either his universe sovereignty or the termination of the <a href="/en/topic/Lucifer_rebellion">Lucifer rebellion</a>. These two ways of world ministry were:</p>
<p id="p4_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p4_7">136:4.7</a></small></sup>  1. His own <a href="/en/topic/way">way</a>—the way that might seem most pleasant and profitable from the standpoint of the immediate needs of this world and the present edification of his own universe.</p>
<p id="p4_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p4_8">136:4.8</a></small></sup>  2. The <a href="/en/topic/Fathers_Way">Father’s way</a>—the exemplification of a farseeing ideal of creature life visualized by the high personalities of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> administration of the universe of universes.</p>
<p id="p4_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p4_9">136:4.9</a></small></sup>  It was thus made clear to <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> that there were two ways in which he could order the remainder of his earth life. Each of these ways had something to be said in its favor as it might be regarded in the light of the immediate situation. The <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> clearly saw that his choice between these two modes of conduct would have nothing to do with his reception of universe sovereignty; that was a matter already settled and sealed on the records of the universe of universes and only awaited his demand in person. But it was indicated to Jesus that it would afford his Paradise brother, <a href="/en/topic/Immanuel">Immanuel</a>, great satisfaction if he, Jesus, should see fit to finish up his earth career of incarnation as he had so nobly begun it, always subject to the Father’s will. On the third day of this <a href="/en/topic/isolation">isolation</a> Jesus promised himself he would go back to the world to finish his earth career, and that in a situation involving any two ways he would always choose the Father’s will. And he lived out the remainder of his earth life always true to that resolve.

Subsequently the tradition of a great temptation became attached to this period of isolation through confusion with the fragmentary <a href="/en/topic/Urantia_Papers">narratives</a> of the <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Hermon">Mount Hermon</a> struggles, and further because it was the custom to have all great prophets and human leaders begin their public careers by undergoing these supposed seasons of fasting and prayer.

<p id="p4_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p4_11">136:4.11</a></small></sup>  In all this planning for the remainder of his earth life, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was always torn in his human heart by two opposing courses of conduct:</p>
<p id="p4_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p4_12">136:4.12</a></small></sup>  1. He entertained a strong desire to win his people—and the whole world—to believe in him and to accept his new spiritual kingdom.

<p id="p4_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p4_13">136:4.13</a></small></sup>  2.

<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p5_3">136:5.3</a></small></sup>  Before coming down from the forty days’ retreat in the hills, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> assigned the immediate command of this attendant host of universe personalities to his recently Personalized <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Adjuster</a>, and for more than four years of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> time did these selected personalities from every division of universe intelligences obediently and respectfully function under the wise guidance of this exalted and experienced Personalized Mystery Monitor. In assuming command of this mighty assembly, the Adjuster, being a onetime part and essence of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Father, assured Jesus that in no case would these superhuman agencies be permitted to serve, or manifest themselves in connection with, or in behalf of, his earth career unless it should develop that the Father willed such intervention. Thus by one great <a href="/en/topic/decisions">decision</a> Jesus voluntarily deprived himself of all superhuman co-operation in all matters having to do with the remainder of his mortal career unless the Father might independently choose to participate in some certain act or episode of the Son’s earth labors.</p>

Accordingly was Jesus admonished that, while the Adjuster’s control of the living intelligences placed under his command would be complete and perfect as to all matters involving <i>space,</i> there could be no such perfect limitations imposed regarding <i>time.</i> Said the Adjuster: “I will, as you have directed, enjoin the employment of this attendant host of universe intelligences in any manner in connection with your earth career except in those cases where the Paradise Father directs me to release such agencies in order that his divine will of your choosing may be accomplished, and in those instances where you may engage in any choice or act of your divine-human will which shall only involve departures from the natural earth order as to <i>time.</i> In all such events I am powerless, and your creatures here assembled in perfection and unity of power are likewise helpless. If your united natures once entertain such desires, these mandates of your choice will be forthwith executed. Your wish in all such matters will constitute the abridgment of time, and the thing projected <i>is</i> existent. Under my command this constitutes the fullest possible limitation which can be imposed upon your potential sovereignty. In my self-consciousness time is nonexistent, and therefore I cannot limit your creatures in anything related thereto.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s5_4_2"><a href="#fn_s5_4_2">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s5_4_5"><a href="#fn_s5_4_5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s5_4_6"><a href="#fn_s5_4_6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s5_4_7"><a href="#fn_s5_4_7">[7]</a></sup></p>

He had by a single decision excluded all of his attendant universe hosts of varied intelligences from participating in his ensuing public ministry except in such matters as concerned <i>time</i> only. It therefore becomes evident that any possible supernatural or supposedly superhuman accompaniments of Jesus’ ministry pertained wholly to the elimination of time unless the Father in heaven specifically ruled otherwise. No miracle, ministry of mercy, or any other possible event occurring in connection with Jesus’ remaining earth labors could possibly be of the nature or character of an act transcending the natural laws established and regularly working in the affairs of man as he lives on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> <i>except</i> in this expressly stated matter of <i>time.</i> No limits, of course, could be placed upon the manifestations of “the Father’s will.” The elimination of time in connection with the expressed desire of this potential Sovereign of a universe could only be avoided by the direct and explicit act of the <i>will</i> of this God-man to the effect that time, as related to the act or event in question, <i>should not be shortened or eliminated.</i> In order to prevent the appearance of apparent <i>time <a href="/en/topic/miracles">miracles</a>,</i> it was necessary for Jesus to remain constantly time conscious. Any lapse of time consciousness on his part, in connection with the entertainment of definite desire, was equivalent to the enactment of the thing conceived in the mind of this <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a>, and without the intervention of time.</p>

<p id="p6_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p6_1">136:6.1</a></small></sup>  Having settled his policy concerning all personalities of all classes of his created intelligences, so far as this could be determined in view of the inherent potential of his new status of divinity, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> now turned his thoughts toward himself. What would he, now the fully self-conscious creator of all things and beings existent in this universe, do with these creator prerogatives in the recurring life situations which would immediately confront him when he returned to <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> to resume his work among men? In fact, already, and right where he was in these lonely hills, had this problem forcibly presented itself in the matter of obtaining food. By the third day of his solitary meditations the human body grew hungry. Should he go in quest of food as any ordinary man would, or should he merely exercise his normal creative powers and produce suitable bodily nourishment ready at hand? And this great <a href="/en/topic/decisions">decision</a> of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> has been portrayed to you as a temptation—as a challenge by supposed enemies that he “command that these stones become <a href="/en/topic/loaves">loaves</a> of <a href="/en/topic/bread">bread</a>.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b26"><a href="#fn_b26">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p6_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p6_2">136:6.2</a></small></sup>  Jesus thus settled upon another and consistent policy for the remainder of his earth labors. As far as his personal necessities were concerned, and in general even in his relations with other personalities, he now deliberately chose to pursue the path of normal earthly existence; he definitely decided against a policy which would transcend, violate, or outrage his own established natural laws. But he could not promise himself, as he had already been warned by his Personalized <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Adjuster</a>, that these natural laws might not, in certain conceivable circumstances, be greatly <i>accelerated.</i> In principle, Jesus decided that his lifework should be organized and prosecuted in accordance with <a href="/en/topic/natural_law">natural law</a> and in harmony with the existing social organization. The Master thereby chose a program of living which was the equivalent of deciding against miracles and wonders. Again he decided in favor of “the Father’s will”; again he surrendered everything into the hands of his <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Father.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a6_2_37"><a href="#fn_a6_2_37">[38]</a></sup></p>

But Jesus was not concerned merely with this world and its creatures; he was living a life designed to instruct and inspire the manifold creatures of a far-flung universe.</p>
<p id="p6_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p6_4">136:6.4</a></small></sup>  Before his baptismal illumination he had lived in perfect <a href="/en/topic/submission">submission</a> to the will and guidance of his heavenly Father. He emphatically <a href="/en/topic/decisions">decided</a> to continue on in just such implicit mortal dependence on the Father’s will. He purposed to follow the unnatural course—he decided not to seek self-preservation. He chose to go on pursuing the policy of refusing to defend himself. He formulated his conclusions in the words of Scripture familiar to his human mind: “Man shall not live by <a href="/en/topic/bread">bread</a> alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b27"><a href="#fn_b27">[27]</a></sup>.” In reaching this conclusion in regard to the appetite of the physical nature as expressed in hunger for food, the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> made his final declaration concerning all other urges of the flesh and the natural impulses of human nature.</p>
<p id="p6_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p6_5">136:6.5</a></small></sup>  His superhuman power he might possibly use for others, but for himself, never.

Jesus looked upon such a course of expected miracle working as a harking back to the olden days of ignorant magic and the degraded practices of the savage medicine men. Possibly, for the salvation of his creatures, he might accelerate natural law, but to transcend his own laws, either for the benefit of himself or the overawing of his fellow men, that he would not do. And the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s <a href="/en/topic/decisions">decision</a> was final.</p>
<p id="p6_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p6_7">136:6.7</a></small></sup>  Jesus sorrowed for his people; he fully understood how they had been led up to the expectation of the coming Messiah, the time when “the earth will yield its fruits ten thousandfold, and on one vine there will be a thousand branches, and each branch will produce a thousand clusters, and each cluster will produce a thousand grapes, and each grape will produce a gallon of wine<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b29"><a href="#fn_b29">[29]</a></sup>.” The Jews believed the Messiah would usher in an era of miraculous plenty.

<p id="p7_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p7_1">136:7.1</a></small></sup>  Having made his <a href="/en/topic/decisions">decisions</a> regarding such matters as food and physical ministration to the needs of his material body, the care of the health of himself and his associates, there remained yet other problems to solve. What would be his attitude when confronted by personal <a href="/en/topic/danger">danger</a>? He decided to exercise normal watchcare over his human safety and to take reasonable precaution to prevent the untimely termination of his career in the flesh but to refrain from all superhuman intervention when the crisis of his life in the flesh should come. As he was formulating this decision, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was seated under the shade of a tree on an overhanging ledge of rock with a <a href="/en/topic/precipice">precipice</a> right there before him.

Well had he been taught that Scripture: “There shall no evil befall you, neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.
