<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p1_1">163:1.1</a></small></sup>  The seventy were ordained by <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> on <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> afternoon, November 19, at the Magadan Camp, and <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a> was placed at the head of these gospel preachers and teachers. This corps of seventy consisted of Abner and ten of the former apostles of John, fifty-one of the earlier <a href="/en/topic/evangelists">evangelists</a>, and eight other disciples who had distinguished themselves in the service of the kingdom.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p1_2">163:1.2</a></small></sup>  About two o’clock on this Sabbath afternoon, between showers of rain, a company of believers, augmented by the arrival of <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a> and the majority of his <a href="/en/topic/messenger_corps_(Lanonandek)">messenger corps</a> and numbering over four hundred, assembled on the shore of the lake of <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> to witness the ordination of the seventy.</p>

And you do this because the laborer is worthy of his sustenance. Move not from house to house because a better lodging may be offered.

<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p1_6">163:1.6</a></small></sup>  Early the next morning Abner sent the seventy <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> into all the cities of <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Samaria">Samaria</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Judea">Judea</a>.

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p2_1">163:2.1</a></small></sup>  Over fifty disciples who sought ordination and appointment to membership in the seventy were rejected by the committee appointed by <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> to select these candidates. This committee consisted of <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a>, and the acting head of the evangelistic corps. In all cases where this committee of three were not unanimous in agreement, they brought the candidate to Jesus, and while the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> never rejected a single person who craved ordination as a gospel messenger, there were more than a dozen who, when they had talked with Jesus, no more desired to become gospel <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p2_2">163:2.2</a></small></sup>  One earnest <a href="/en/topic/disciples">disciple</a> came to Jesus, saying: “Master, I would be one of your new apostles, but my father is very old and near death; could I be permitted to return home to bury him?” To this man Jesus said: “My son, the <a href="/en/topic/foxes">foxes</a> have holes, and the birds of heaven have nests, but the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> has nowhere to lay his head<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b15"><a href="#fn_b15">[15]</a></sup>. You are a faithful disciple, and you can remain such while you return home to minister to your loved ones, but not so with my gospel messengers. They have forsaken all to follow me and proclaim the kingdom. If you would be an ordained teacher, you must let others bury the <a href="/en/topic/dead">dead</a> while you go forth to publish the good news.” And this man went away in great disappointment.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3"><a href="#fn_a3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p2_3">163:2.3</a></small></sup>  Another disciple came to the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and said: “I would become an ordained messenger, but I would like to go to my home for a short while to comfort my family<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b16"><a href="#fn_b16">[16]</a></sup>.” And <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> replied: “If you would be ordained, you must be willing to forsake all. The gospel <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> cannot have divided affections. No man, having put his hand to the <a href="/en/topic/plough">plough</a>, if he <a href="/en/topic/backsliding">turns back</a>, is worthy to become a messenger of the kingdom.”</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p2_4">163:2.4</a></small></sup>  Then <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> brought to Jesus a certain rich young man who was a devout believer, and who desired to receive ordination. This young man, <a href="/en/topic/Matadormus">Matadormus</a>, was a member of the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a>; he had heard Jesus teach and had been subsequently instructed in the <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> of the kingdom by <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> and the other apostles<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b17"><a href="#fn_b17">[17]</a></sup>. Jesus talked with Matadormus concerning the requirements of ordination and requested that he defer decision until after he had thought more fully about the matter. Early the next morning, as Jesus was going for a walk, this young man accosted him and said: “Master, I would know from you the assurances of eternal life. Seeing that I have observed all the <a href="/en/topic/commandments">commandments</a> from my youth, I would like to know what more I must do to gain eternal life?” In answer to this question Jesus said: “If you keep all the commandments—do not commit <a href="/en/topic/adultery">adultery</a>, do not kill, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not defraud, honor your <a href="/en/topic/parents">parents</a>—you do well, but <a href="/en/topic/salvation">salvation</a> is the reward of <a href="/en/topic/faith">faith</a>, not merely of works<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b18"><a href="#fn_b18">[18]</a></sup>. Do you believe this gospel of the kingdom?” And Matadormus answered: “Yes, Master, I do believe everything you and your apostles have taught me.” And Jesus said, “Then are you indeed my disciple and a <a href="/en/topic/children">child</a> of the kingdom.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4"><a href="#fn_a4">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p2_5">163:2.5</a></small></sup>  Then said the young man: “But, <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, I am not content to be your disciple; I would be one of your new <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a>.” When <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> heard this, he looked down upon him with a great love and said: “I will have you to be one of my messengers if you are willing to pay the price, if you will supply the one thing which you lack.” Matadormus replied: “Master, I will do anything if I may be allowed to follow you.” Jesus, kissing the kneeling young man on the forehead, said: “If you would be my messenger, go and sell all that you have and, when you have bestowed the proceeds upon the poor or upon your brethren, come and follow me, and you shall have treasure in the kingdom of heaven<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b19"><a href="#fn_b19">[19]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p2_6">163:2.6</a></small></sup>  When <a href="/en/topic/Matadormus">Matadormus</a> heard this, his countenance fell. He arose and went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. This wealthy young Pharisee had been raised to believe that <a href="/en/topic/wealth">wealth</a> was the token of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>’s favor. Jesus knew that he was not free from the love of himself and his riches. The Master wanted to deliver him from the <i>love</i> of wealth, not necessarily from the wealth<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b20"><a href="#fn_b20">[20]</a></sup>. While the disciples of Jesus did not part with all their worldly goods, the apostles and the seventy did. Matadormus desired to be one of the seventy new messengers, and that was the reason for Jesus’ requiring him to part with all of his temporal possessions.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p2_7">163:2.7</a></small></sup>  Almost every human being has some one thing which is held on to as a <a href="/en/topic/pet_evil">pet evil</a>, and which the entrance into the <a href="/en/topic/kingdom_of_heaven">kingdom of heaven</a> requires as a part of the price of admission. If Matadormus had parted with his wealth, it probably would have been put right back into his hands for administration as treasurer of the seventy. For later on, after the establishment of the church at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, he did obey the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s injunction, although it was then too late to enjoy membership in the seventy, and he became the treasurer of the Jerusalem church, of which <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> the Lord’s brother in the flesh was the head.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5"><a href="#fn_a5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p2_8">163:2.8</a></small></sup>  Thus always it was and forever will be: Men must arrive at their own <a href="/en/topic/decisions">decisions</a>. There is a certain range of the freedom of choice which <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> may exercise. The forces of the spiritual world will not coerce man; they allow him to go the way of his own choosing.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a6"><a href="#fn_a6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p2_9">163:2.9</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> foresaw that <a href="/en/topic/Matadormus">Matadormus</a>, with his riches, could not possibly become an ordained associate of men who had forsaken all for the gospel; at the same time, he saw that, without his riches, he would become the ultimate leader of all of them. But, like Jesus’ own brethren, he never became great in the kingdom because he deprived himself of that intimate and personal association with the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> which might have been his experience had he been willing to do at this time the very thing which Jesus asked, and which, several years subsequently, he actually did.</p>
<p id="p2_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p2_10">163:2.10</a></small></sup>  Riches have nothing directly to do with entrance into the kingdom of heaven, but the <i>love of <a href="/en/topic/wealth">wealth</a> does<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b21"><a href="#fn_b21">[21]</a></sup>.</i> The spiritual loyalties of the kingdom are incompatible with servility to materialistic <a href="/en/topic/mammon">mammon</a>.

<p id="p2_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p2_11">163:2.11</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> never taught that it was wrong to have wealth. He required only the twelve and the seventy to dedicate all of their worldly possessions to the common cause. Even then, he provided for the profitable liquidation of their property, as in the case of the Apostle Matthew. Jesus many times advised his well-to-do disciples as he taught the <a href="/en/topic/rich_man_of_Rome">rich man of Rome</a>. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> regarded the wise investment of excess earnings as a legitimate form of <a href="/en/topic/insurance">insurance</a> against future and unavoidable adversity. When the apostolic treasury was overflowing, Judas put funds on deposit to be used subsequently when they might suffer greatly from a diminution of income. This Judas did after consultation with <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a>. Jesus never personally had anything to do with the apostolic finances except in the disbursement of alms. But there was one economic abuse which he many times condemned, and that was the unfair <a href="/en/topic/exploitation">exploitation</a> of the weak, unlearned, and less fortunate of men by their strong, keen, and more intelligent fellows. Jesus declared that such inhuman treatment of men, women, and children was incompatible with the ideals of the brotherhood of the kingdom of heaven.</p>

Shall all who have riches be kept out of the kingdom?” And Jesus replied: “No, Peter, but all who put their trust in riches shall hardly enter into the spiritual life that leads to eternal progress. But even then, much which is impossible to man is not beyond the reach of the Father in heaven; rather should we recognize that with God all things are possible<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b23"><a href="#fn_b23">[23]</a></sup>.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a9"><a href="#fn_a9">[9]</a></sup></p>

And when they had walked down by the lake, they sat there beside the water, and <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, speaking for the twelve (who were all present by this time), said: “We are troubled by your words to the rich young man. Shall we require those who would follow you to give up all their worldly goods?” And Jesus said: “No, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Peter</a>, only those who would become apostles, and who desire to live with me as you do and as one family.

<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p4_4">163:4.4</a></small></sup>  3. Proclaim a spiritual brotherhood of the sons of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, not an outward kingdom of worldly power and material glory.</p>
<p id="p4_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p4_5">163:4.5</a></small></sup>  4.

<p id="p4_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p4_6">163:4.6</a></small></sup>  5. If <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> house to be selected for a headquarters proves to be a worthy <a href="/en/topic/home">home</a>, abide there throughout the sojourn in that city.</p>
<p id="p4_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p4_7">163:4.7</a></small></sup>  6. Make clear to all faithful believers that the time for an open break with the religious leaders of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> has now come.</p>
<p id="p4_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p4_8">163:4.8</a></small></sup>  7.

(This they were to teach as man’s whole duty in place of the 613 rules of <a href="/en/topic/living">living</a> expounded by the <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a>.)</p>
<p id="p4_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p4_9">163:4.9</a></small></sup>  When <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had talked thus to the seventy in the presence of all the apostles and disciples, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a> took them off by themselves and preached to them their ordination sermon, which was an elaboration of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s charge given at the time he laid his hands upon them and set them apart as <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> of the kingdom. <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> exhorted the seventy to cherish in their experience the following virtues:</p>
<p id="p4_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p4_10">163:4.10</a></small></sup>  1. <i>Consecrated devotion.</i> To pray always for more <a href="/en/topic/laborers">laborers</a> to be sent forth into the gospel harvest. He explained that, when one so prays, he will the more likely say, “Here am I; send me<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b31"><a href="#fn_b31">[31]</a></sup>.” He admonished them to neglect not their daily <a href="/en/topic/worship">worship</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p4_11">163:4.11</a></small></sup>  2. <i>True courage.</i> He warned them that they would encounter hostility and be certain to meet with <a href="/en/topic/persecution">persecution</a>. <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> told them their mission was no undertaking for cowards and advised those who were afraid to step out before they started. But none withdrew.</p>
<p id="p4_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p4_12">163:4.12</a></small></sup>  3. <i><a href="/en/topic/faith">Faith</a> and trust.</i> They must go forth on this short mission wholly unprovided for; they must trust the Father for food and shelter and all other things needful.</p>
<p id="p4_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p4_13">163:4.13</a></small></sup>  4. <i>Zeal and initiative.</i> They must be possessed with zeal and intelligent <a href="/en/topic/enthusiasm">enthusiasm</a>; they must attend strictly to their <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s business. Oriental salutation was a lengthy and elaborate <a href="/en/topic/ceremonies">ceremony</a>; therefore had they been instructed to “salute no man by the way,” which was a common method of exhorting one to go about his business without the waste of time<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b32"><a href="#fn_b32">[32]</a></sup>. It had nothing to do with the matter of friendly greeting.</p>
<p id="p4_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p4_14">163:4.14</a></small></sup>  5. <i>Kindness and <a href="/en/topic/courtesy">courtesy</a>.</i> The Master had instructed them to avoid unnecessary waste of time in social ceremonies, but he enjoined courtesy toward all with whom they should come in contact. They were to show every kindness to those who might entertain them in their homes. They were strictly warned against leaving a modest <a href="/en/topic/home">home</a> to be entertained in a more comfortable or influential one.</p>
<p id="p4_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p4_15">163:4.15</a></small></sup>  6. <i>Ministry to the <a href="/en/topic/sick">sick</a>.</i> The seventy were charged by <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> to search out the sick in mind and body and to do everything in their power to bring about the alleviation or cure of their maladies.</p>
<p id="p4_16"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p4_16">163:4.16</a></small></sup>  And when they had been thus charged and instructed, they started out, two and two, on their mission in <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Samaria">Samaria</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Judea">Judea</a>.</p>
<p id="p4_17"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p4_17">163:4.17</a></small></sup>  Although the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> had a peculiar regard for the number seventy, sometimes considering the nations of heathendom as being seventy in number, and although these seventy <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> were to go with the gospel to all peoples, still as far as we can discern, it was only coincidental that this group happened to number just seventy. Certain it was that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> would have accepted no less than half a dozen others, but they were unwilling to pay the price of forsaking wealth and families.</p>
<h2 id="p5" class="toc-header"><a href="#p5" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 5. MOVING THE CAMP TO PELLA </h2>
<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p5_1">163:5.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the twelve now prepared to establish their last headquarters in <a href="/en/topic/Perea">Perea</a>, near <a href="/en/topic/Pella">Pella</a>, where the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> was baptized in the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a>. The last ten days of November were spent in council at Magadan, and on Tuesday, December 6, the entire company of almost three hundred started out at daybreak with all their effects to lodge that night near Pella by the river. This was the same site, by the spring, that <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John the Baptist</a> had occupied with his camp several years before.</p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p5_2">163:5.2</a></small></sup>  After the breaking up of the Magadan Camp, <a href="/en/topic/David_Zebedee">David Zebedee</a> returned to <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a> and began immediately to curtail the messenger service. The kingdom was taking on a new phase. Daily, pilgrims arrived from all parts of <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a> and even from remote regions of the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_Empire">Roman Empire</a>. Believers occasionally came from <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and from the lands east of the <a href="/en/topic/Tigris_River">Tigris</a>. Accordingly, on <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a>, December 18, <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a>, with the help of his <a href="/en/topic/messenger_corps_(Lanonandek)">messenger corps</a>, loaded on to the pack animals the camp equipage, then stored in his father’s house, with which he had formerly conducted the camp of Bethsaida by the lake. Bidding farewell to Bethsaida for the time being, he proceeded down the lake shore and along the Jordan to a point about one-half mile north of the apostolic camp; and in less than a week he was prepared to offer hospitality to almost fifteen hundred pilgrim visitors. The apostolic camp could accommodate about five hundred. This was the rainy season in Palestine, and these accommodations were required to take care of the ever-increasing number of inquirers, mostly earnest, who came into Perea to see Jesus and to hear his teaching.</p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p5_3">163:5.3</a></small></sup>  David did all this on his own initiative, though he had taken counsel with <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a> and Matthew at Magadan. He employed the larger part of his former messenger corps as his helpers in conducting this camp; he now used less than twenty men on regular messenger duty. Near the end of December and before the return of the seventy, almost eight hundred visitors were gathered about the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, and they found lodging in David’s camp.</p>
<h2 id="p6" class="toc-header"><a href="#p6" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 6. THE RETURN OF THE SEVENTY </h2>
<p id="p6_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p6_1">163:6.1</a></small></sup>  On <a href="/en/topic/Fridays">Friday</a>, December 30, while <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was away in the near-by hills with <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>, and John, the seventy <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> were arriving by couples, accompanied by numerous believers, at the <a href="/en/topic/Pella">Pella</a> headquarters<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b33"><a href="#fn_b33">[33]</a></sup>. All seventy were assembled at the teaching site about five o’clock when Jesus returned to the camp. The evening meal was delayed for more than an hour while these enthusiasts for the gospel of the kingdom related their experiences. <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a>’s messengers had brought much of this news to the apostles during previous weeks, but it was truly inspiring to hear these newly ordained teachers of the gospel personally tell how their message had been received by hungry <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> and gentiles. At last Jesus was able to see men going out to spread the good news without his personal presence. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> now knew that he could leave this world without seriously hindering the progress of the kingdom.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a20"><a href="#fn_a20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a21"><a href="#fn_a21">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p6_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p6_2">163:6.2</a></small></sup>  When the seventy related how “even the devils were subject” to them, they referred to the wonderful cures they had wrought in the cases of victims of nervous disorders<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b34"><a href="#fn_b34">[34]</a></sup>. Nevertheless, there had been a few cases of real <a href="/en/topic/demon_possession">spirit possession</a> relieved by these ministers, and referring to these, Jesus said: “It is not strange that these disobedient minor spirits should be subject to you, seeing that I beheld <a href="/en/topic/Satan">Satan</a> falling as lightning from heaven. But rejoice not so much over this, for I declare to you that, as soon as I return to my Father, we will send forth our spirits into the very minds of men so that no more can these few lost spirits enter the minds of unfortunate <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a>. I rejoice with you that you have power with men, but be not lifted up because of this experience but the rather rejoice that your names are written on the rolls of heaven, and that you are thus to go forward in an endless career of spiritual conquest.”</p>
<p id="p6_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p6_3">163:6.3</a></small></sup>  And it was at this time, just before partaking of the evening meal, that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> experienced one of those rare moments of emotional ecstasy which his followers had occasionally witnessed. He said: “I thank you, my Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that, while this wonderful <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> was hidden from the wise and self-righteous, the spirit has revealed these spiritual glories to these children of the kingdom<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b35"><a href="#fn_b35">[35]</a></sup>. Yes, my Father, it must have been pleasing in your sight to do this, and I rejoice to know that the good news will spread to all the world even after I shall have returned to you and the work which you have given me to perform. I am mightily moved as I realize you are about to deliver all authority into my hands, that only you really know who I am, and that only I really know you, and those to whom I have revealed you. And when I have finished this revelation to my brethren in the flesh, I will continue the revelation to your creatures on high.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a22"><a href="#fn_a22">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p6_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p6_4">163:6.4</a></small></sup>  When Jesus had thus spoken to the Father, he turned aside to speak to his apostles and ministers: “Blessed are the eyes which see and the ears which hear these things. Let me say to you that many <a href="/en/topic/prophets">prophets</a> and many of the great men of the past ages have desired to behold what you now see, but it was not granted them.

<p id="p6_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p6_5">163:6.5</a></small></sup>  Then, speaking to all the disciples, he said: “You have heard how many cities and villages have received the good news of the kingdom, and how my ministers and teachers have been received by both the Jew and the gentile. And blessed indeed are these communities which have elected to believe the gospel of the kingdom. But woe upon the light-rejecting inhabitants of <a href="/en/topic/Chorazin">Chorazin</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida-Julias">Bethsaida-Julias</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, the cities which did not well receive these <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b37"><a href="#fn_b37">[37]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b38"><a href="#fn_b38">[38]</a></sup>.

<p id="p6_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p6_6">163:6.6</a></small></sup>  The next day being the <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> went apart with the seventy and said to them: “I did indeed rejoice with you when you came back bearing the good tidings of the reception of the gospel of the kingdom by so many people scattered throughout <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Samaria">Samaria</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Judea">Judea</a>.

<p id="p7_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p7_1">163:7.1</a></small></sup>  The next few days were busy times in the <a href="/en/topic/Pella">Pella</a> camp; preparations for the Perean mission were being completed. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and his associates were about to enter upon their last mission, the three months’ tour of all <a href="/en/topic/Perea">Perea</a>, which terminated only upon the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s entering <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> for his final labors on earth. Throughout this period the headquarters of Jesus and the twelve apostles was maintained here at the Pella camp.</p>
<p id="p7_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p7_2">163:7.2</a></small></sup>  It was no longer necessary for Jesus to go abroad to teach the people. They now came to him in increasing numbers each week and from all parts, not only from <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a> but from the whole Roman world and from the Near East. Although the Master participated with the seventy in the tour of Perea, he spent much of his time at the Pella camp, teaching the multitude and instructing the twelve. Throughout this three months’ period at least ten of the apostles remained with Jesus.</p>
<p id="p7_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p7_3">163:7.3</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/women’s_corps">women’s corps</a> also prepared to go out, two and two, with the seventy to labor in the larger cities of <a href="/en/topic/Perea">Perea</a>. This original group of twelve women had recently trained a larger corps of fifty women in the work of home visitation and in the art of ministering to the <a href="/en/topic/sick">sick</a> and the afflicted. <a href="/en/topic/Perpetua">Perpetua</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a>’s wife, became a member of this new division of the women’s corps and was intrusted with the leadership of the enlarged women’s work under <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a>. After <a href="/en/topic/Pentecost_(bestowal_of_Spirit_of_Truth)">Pentecost</a> she remained with her illustrious husband, accompanying him on all of his missionary tours; and on the day <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> was crucified in <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a>, she was fed to the wild beasts in the arena. This new women’s corps also had as members the wives of <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a> and Matthew and the mother of <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> and John.</p>
<p id="p7_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p7_4">163:7.4</a></small></sup>  The work of the kingdom now prepared to enter upon its terminal phase under the personal leadership of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. And this present phase was one of spiritual depth in contrast with the miracle-minded and wonder-seeking multitudes who followed after the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> during the former days of popularity in <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>. However, there were still any number of his followers who were material-minded, and who failed to grasp the truth that the <a href="/en/topic/kingdom_of_heaven">kingdom of heaven</a> is the spiritual brotherhood of man founded on the eternal fact of the universal fatherhood of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>.</p>
