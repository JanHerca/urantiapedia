This corps of seventy consisted of Abner and ten of the former apostles of John, fifty-one of the earlier <a href="/en/topic/evangelists">evangelists</a>, and eight other disciples who had distinguished themselves in the service of the kingdom.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p1_2">163:1.2</a></small></sup>  About two o’clock on this Sabbath afternoon, between showers of rain, a company of believers, augmented by the arrival of <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a> and the majority of his <a href="/en/topic/messenger_corps_(Lanonandek)">messenger corps</a> and numbering over four hundred, assembled on the shore of the lake of <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> to witness the ordination of the seventy.</p>

In all cases where this committee of three were not unanimous in agreement, they brought the candidate to Jesus, and while the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> never rejected a single person who craved ordination as a gospel messenger, there were more than a dozen who, when they had talked with Jesus, no more desired to become gospel <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_2"><a href="#fn_s2_1_2">[2]</a></sup></p>

You are a faithful disciple, and you can remain such while you return home to minister to your loved ones, but not so with my gospel messengers. They have forsaken all to follow me and proclaim the kingdom. If you would be an ordained teacher, you must let others bury the <a href="/en/topic/dead">dead</a> while you go forth to publish the good news.” And this man went away in great disappointment.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_2_3"><a href="#fn_a2_2_3">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p2_4">163:2.4</a></small></sup>  Then <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> brought to Jesus a certain rich young man who was a devout believer, and who desired to receive ordination. This young man, <a href="/en/topic/Matadormus">Matadormus</a>, was a member of the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a>; he had heard Jesus teach and had been subsequently instructed in the <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a> of the kingdom by <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> and the other apostles<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b17"><a href="#fn_b17">[17]</a></sup>. Jesus talked with Matadormus concerning the requirements of ordination and requested that he defer decision until after he had thought more fully about the matter. Early the next morning, as Jesus was going for a walk, this young man accosted him and said: “Master, I would know from you the assurances of eternal life. Seeing that I have observed all the <a href="/en/topic/commandments">commandments</a> from my youth, I would like to know what more I must do to gain eternal life?” In answer to this question Jesus said: “If you keep all the commandments—do not commit <a href="/en/topic/adultery">adultery</a>, do not kill, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not defraud, honor your <a href="/en/topic/parents">parents</a>—you do well, but <a href="/en/topic/salvation">salvation</a> is the reward of <a href="/en/topic/faith">faith</a>, not merely of works<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b18"><a href="#fn_b18">[18]</a></sup>.

<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p2_5">163:2.5</a></small></sup>  Then said the young man: “But, <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, I am not content to be your disciple; I would be one of your new <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a>.” When <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> heard this, he looked down upon him with a great love and said: “I will have you to be one of my messengers if you are willing to pay the price, if you will supply the one thing which you lack.” Matadormus replied: “Master, I will do anything if I may be allowed to follow you.” Jesus, kissing the kneeling young man on the forehead, said: “If you would be my messenger, go and sell all that you have and, when you have bestowed the proceeds upon the poor or upon your brethren, come and follow me, and you shall have treasure in the kingdom of heaven<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b19"><a href="#fn_b19">[19]</a></sup>.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_5_23"><a href="#fn_a2_5_23">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p2_6">163:2.6</a></small></sup>  When <a href="/en/topic/Matadormus">Matadormus</a> heard this, his countenance fell. He arose and went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. This wealthy young Pharisee had been raised to believe that <a href="/en/topic/wealth">wealth</a> was the token of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>’s favor. Jesus knew that he was not free from the love of himself and his riches. The Master wanted to deliver him from the <i>love</i> of wealth, not necessarily from the wealth<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b20"><a href="#fn_b20">[20]</a></sup>. While the disciples of Jesus did not part with all their worldly goods, the apostles and the seventy did. Matadormus desired to be one of the seventy new messengers, and that was the reason for Jesus’ requiring him to part with all of his temporal possessions.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p2_7">163:2.7</a></small></sup>  Almost every human being has some one thing which is held on to as a <a href="/en/topic/pet_evil">pet evil</a>, and which the entrance into the <a href="/en/topic/kingdom_of_heaven">kingdom of heaven</a> requires as a part of the price of admission. If Matadormus had parted with his wealth, it probably would have been put right back into his hands for administration as treasurer of the seventy. For later on, after the establishment of the church at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, he did obey the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s injunction, although it was then too late to enjoy membership in the seventy, and he became the treasurer of the Jerusalem church, of which <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> the Lord’s brother in the flesh was the head.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_7_0"><a href="#fn_a2_7_0">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_7_10"><a href="#fn_a2_7_10">[8]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_7_0"><a href="#fn_s2_7_0">[3]</a></sup></p>

But, like Jesus’ own brethren, he never became great in the kingdom because he deprived himself of that intimate and personal association with the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> which might have been his experience had he been willing to do at this time the very thing which Jesus asked, and which, several years subsequently, he actually did.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_9_23"><a href="#fn_a2_9_23">[6]</a></sup></p>

He required only the twelve and the seventy to dedicate all of their worldly possessions to the common cause. Even then, he provided for the profitable liquidation of their property, as in the case of the Apostle Matthew. Jesus many times advised his well-to-do disciples as he taught the <a href="/en/topic/rich_man_of_Rome">rich man of Rome</a>. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> regarded the wise investment of excess earnings as a legitimate form of <a href="/en/topic/insurance">insurance</a> against future and unavoidable adversity. When the apostolic treasury was overflowing, Judas put funds on deposit to be used subsequently when they might suffer greatly from a diminution of income. This Judas did after consultation with <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a>. Jesus never personally had anything to do with the apostolic finances except in the disbursement of alms. But there was one economic abuse which he many times condemned, and that was the unfair <a href="/en/topic/exploitation">exploitation</a> of the weak, unlearned, and less fortunate of men by their strong, keen, and more intelligent fellows. Jesus declared that such inhuman treatment of men, women, and children was incompatible with the ideals of the brotherhood of the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p id="p7_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p7_1">163:7.1</a></small></sup>  The next few days were busy times in the <a href="/en/topic/Pella">Pella</a> camp; preparations for the Perean mission were being completed. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and his associates were about to enter upon their last mission, the three months’ tour of all <a href="/en/topic/Perea">Perea</a>, which terminated only upon the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s entering <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> for his final labors on earth. Throughout this period the headquarters of Jesus and the twelve apostles was maintained here at the Pella camp.</p>
<p id="p7_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p7_2">163:7.2</a></small></sup>  It was no longer necessary for Jesus to go abroad to teach the people. They now came to him in increasing numbers each week and from all parts, not only from <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a> but from the whole Roman world and from the Near East. Although the Master participated with the seventy in the tour of Perea, he spent much of his time at the Pella camp, teaching the multitude and instructing the twelve. Throughout this three months’ period at least ten of the apostles remained with Jesus.</p>

This original group of twelve women had recently trained a larger corps of fifty women in the work of home visitation and in the art of ministering to the <a href="/en/topic/sick">sick</a> and the afflicted. <a href="/en/topic/Perpetua">Perpetua</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a>’s wife, became a member of this new division of the women’s corps and was intrusted with the leadership of the enlarged women’s work under <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a>. After <a href="/en/topic/Pentecost_(bestowal_of_Spirit_of_Truth)">Pentecost</a> she remained with her illustrious husband, accompanying him on all of his missionary tours; and on the day <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> was crucified in <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a>, she was fed to the wild beasts in the arena.
