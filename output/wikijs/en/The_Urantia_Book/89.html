<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p0_1">89:0.1</a></small></sup>  PRIMITIVE man regarded himself as being in debt to the spirits, as standing in need of <a href="/en/topic/redemption">redemption</a>. As the savages looked at it, in justice the spirits might have visited much more bad luck upon them. As time passed, this concept developed into the doctrine of sin and salvation. The soul was looked upon as coming into the world under forfeit—<a href="/en/topic/original_sin_doctrine">original sin</a>. The soul must be ransomed; a scapegoat must be provided. The <a href="/en/topic/head-hunters">head-hunter</a>, in addition to practicing the cult of skull worship, was able to provide a substitute for his own life, a <a href="/en/topic/scapemen">scapeman</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_1_1"><a href="#fn_s0_1_1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s0_1_4"><a href="#fn_s0_1_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p0_2">89:0.2</a></small></sup>  The savage was early possessed with the notion that spirits derive supreme satisfaction from the sight of human misery, <a href="/en/topic/suffering">suffering</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/humiliation">humiliation</a>. At first, man was only concerned with sins of commission, but later he became exercised over sins of omission. And the whole subsequent sacrificial system grew up around these two ideas<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. This new ritual had to do with the observance of the <a href="/en/topic/propitiation">propitiation</a> ceremonies of <a href="/en/topic/sacrifice">sacrifice</a>. Primitive man believed that something special must be done to win the favor of the gods; only advanced civilization recognizes a consistently even-tempered and benevolent <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. Propitiation was insurance against immediate ill luck rather than investment in future bliss. And the rituals of <a href="/en/topic/avoidance">avoidance</a>, <a href="/en/topic/exorcism">exorcism</a>, <a href="/en/topic/coercion">coercion</a>, and propitiation all merge into one another.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_2_4"><a href="#fn_s0_2_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. THE TABOO </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p1_1">89:1.1</a></small></sup>  Observance of a taboo was man’s effort to dodge ill luck, to keep from offending the spirit ghosts by the avoidance of something. The <a href="/en/topic/taboos">taboos</a> were at first nonreligious, but they early acquired ghost or spirit sanction, and when thus reinforced, they became lawmakers and institution builders<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>. The taboo is the source of ceremonial standards and the ancestor of primitive self-control. It was the earliest form of societal regulation and for a long time the only one; it is still a basic unit of the social regulative structure.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_1_21"><a href="#fn_a1_1_21">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p1_2">89:1.2</a></small></sup>  The respect which these prohibitions commanded in the mind of the savage exactly equaled his <a href="/en/topic/fear">fear</a> of the powers who were supposed to enforce them<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>. Taboos first arose because of chance experience with ill luck; later they were proposed by chiefs and <a href="/en/topic/shamans">shamans</a>—fetish men who were thought to be directed by a spirit ghost, even by a god. The fear of spirit retribution is so great in the mind of a primitive that he sometimes dies of fright when he has violated a taboo, and this dramatic episode enormously strengthens the hold of the taboo on the minds of the survivors.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p1_3">89:1.3</a></small></sup>  Among the earliest prohibitions were restrictions on the appropriation of women and other property. As religion began to play a larger part in the evolution of the taboo, the article resting under ban was regarded as unclean, subsequently as unholy. The records of the <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a> are full of the mention of things clean and unclean, holy and unholy, but their beliefs along these lines were far less cumbersome and extensive than were those of many other peoples.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p1_4">89:1.4</a></small></sup>  The seven <a href="/en/topic/commandments">commandments</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Dalamatia">Dalamatia</a> and Eden, as well as the ten injunctions of the Hebrews, were definite <a href="/en/topic/taboos">taboos</a>, all expressed in the same negative form as were the most ancient prohibitions<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>. But these newer codes were truly emancipating in that they took the place of thousands of pre-existent taboos. And more than this, these later commandments definitely promised something in return for obedience.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p1_5">89:1.5</a></small></sup>  The early food taboos originated in fetishism and totemism. The <a href="/en/topic/swine">swine</a> was sacred to the <a href="/en/topic/Phoenicians">Phoenicians</a>, the cow to the <a href="/en/topic/Hindus">Hindus</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>. The Egyptian taboo on pork has been perpetuated by the Hebraic and <a href="/en/topic/Islam">Islamic</a> faiths. A variant of the food taboo was the belief that a pregnant woman could think so much about a certain food that the child, when born, would be the echo of that food. Such viands would be taboo to the child.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p1_6">89:1.6</a></small></sup>  Methods of eating soon became taboo, and so originated ancient and modern table <a href="/en/topic/etiquette">etiquette</a>. <a href="/en/topic/caste_systems">Caste</a> systems and social levels are vestigial remnants of olden prohibitions. The <a href="/en/topic/taboos">taboos</a> were highly effective in organizing society, but they were terribly burdensome; the negative-ban system not only maintained useful and constructive regulations but also obsolete, outworn, and useless taboos.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p1_7">89:1.7</a></small></sup>  There would, however, be no civilized society to sit in criticism upon primitive man except for these far-flung and multifarious taboos, and the taboo would never have endured but for the upholding sanctions of primitive <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a>. Many of the essential factors in man’s <a href="/en/topic/evolution">evolution</a> have been highly expensive, have cost vast treasure in effort, sacrifice, and self-denial, but these achievements of <a href="/en/topic/self-control">self-control</a> were the real rungs on which man climbed civilization’s <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending</a> ladder.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. THE CONCEPT OF SIN </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p2_1">89:2.1</a></small></sup>  The fear of chance and the dread of bad luck literally drove man into the invention of primitive <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> as supposed insurance against these calamities. From magic and ghosts, religion evolved through spirits and fetishes to taboos<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>. Every primitive tribe had its tree of <a href="/en/topic/forbidden_fruit">forbidden fruit</a>, literally the <a href="/en/topic/apple">apple</a> but figuratively consisting of a thousand branches hanging heavy with all sorts of taboos<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>. And the forbidden tree always said, “Thou shalt not.”</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p2_2">89:2.2</a></small></sup>  As the savage mind evolved to that point where it envisaged both good and bad spirits, and when the taboo received the solemn sanction of evolving religion, the stage was all set for the appearance of the new conception of <i><a href="/en/topic/sin">sin</a>.</i> The idea of sin was universally established in the world before revealed religion ever made its entry. It was only by the concept of sin that natural <a href="/en/topic/death">death</a> became logical to the primitive mind<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>. <a href="/en/topic/Sin_(god)">Sin</a> was the transgression of taboo, and death was the penalty of sin.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_2_1"><a href="#fn_s2_2_1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_2_4"><a href="#fn_s2_2_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p2_3">89:2.3</a></small></sup>  Sin was ritual, not rational; an act, not a thought. And this entire concept of sin was fostered by the lingering traditions of <a href="/en/topic/Dilmun">Dilmun</a> and the days of a little paradise on earth. The tradition of <a href="/en/topic/Adam">Adam</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">Garden of Eden</a> also lent substance to the dream of a onetime “<a href="/en/topic/golden_age">golden age</a>” of the dawn of the races. And all this confirmed the ideas later expressed in the belief that man had his origin in a special creation, that he started his career in perfection, and that transgression of the taboos—sin—brought him down to his later sorry plight<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b9"><a href="#fn_b9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b10"><a href="#fn_b10">[10]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_3_1"><a href="#fn_s2_3_1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_3_4"><a href="#fn_s2_3_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p2_4">89:2.4</a></small></sup>  The habitual violation of a taboo became a vice; primitive law made vice a crime; religion made it a <a href="/en/topic/sin">sin</a>. Among the early tribes the violation of a taboo was a combined crime and sin. Community calamity was always regarded as punishment for tribal sin<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b11"><a href="#fn_b11">[11]</a></sup>. To those who believed that prosperity and righteousness went together, the apparent prosperity of the wicked occasioned so much worry that it was necessary to invent <a href="/en/topic/hell">hells</a> for the punishment of taboo violators; the numbers of these places of future punishment have varied from one to five.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_4_6"><a href="#fn_a2_4_6">[2]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_4_1"><a href="#fn_s2_4_1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_4_4"><a href="#fn_s2_4_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p2_5">89:2.5</a></small></sup>  The idea of <a href="/en/topic/confession">confession</a> and <a href="/en/topic/forgiveness">forgiveness</a> early appeared in primitive religion. Men would ask forgiveness at a public meeting for sins they intended to commit the following week. Confession was merely a rite of remission, also a public notification of defilement, a ritual of crying “unclean, unclean!” Then followed all the ritualistic schemes of purification. All ancient peoples practiced these meaningless <a href="/en/topic/ceremonies">ceremonies</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b12"><a href="#fn_b12">[12]</a></sup>. Many apparently hygienic customs of the early tribes were largely ceremonial.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_5_4"><a href="#fn_s2_5_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. RENUNCIATION AND HUMILIATION </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p3_1">89:3.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/renunciation">Renunciation</a> came as the next step in religious evolution; <a href="/en/topic/fasting">fasting</a> was a common practice<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b13"><a href="#fn_b13">[13]</a></sup>. Soon it became the custom to forgo many forms of physical pleasure, especially of a sexual nature. The ritual of the fast was deeply rooted in many ancient religions and has been handed down to practically all modern theologic systems of thought.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p3_2">89:3.2</a></small></sup>  Just about the time barbarian man was recovering from the wasteful practice of burning and burying property with the dead, just as the economic structure of the races was beginning to take shape, this new religious doctrine of renunciation appeared, and tens of thousands of earnest souls began to court <a href="/en/topic/poverty">poverty</a>. Property was regarded as a spiritual handicap. These notions of the spiritual dangers of material possession were widespreadly entertained in the times of <a href="/en/topic/Philo_of_Alexandria">Philo</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Paul">Paul</a>, and they have markedly influenced <a href="/en/topic/Europe">European</a> philosophy ever since<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b14"><a href="#fn_b14">[14]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p3_3">89:3.3</a></small></sup>  Poverty was just a part of the ritual of the mortification of the <a href="/en/topic/flesh">flesh</a> which, unfortunately, became incorporated into the writings and teachings of many religions, notably <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a>. <a href="/en/topic/penance">Penance</a> is the negative form of this ofttimes foolish ritual of <a href="/en/topic/renunciation">renunciation</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b15"><a href="#fn_b15">[15]</a></sup>. But all this taught the savage <i><a href="/en/topic/self-control">self-control</a>,</i> and that was a worth-while advancement in social evolution. Self-denial and self-control were two of the greatest social gains from early evolutionary religion. Self-control gave man a new philosophy of <a href="/en/topic/life">life</a>; it taught him the art of augmenting life’s fraction by lowering the denominator of personal demands instead of always attempting to increase the numerator of selfish gratification.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_3_4"><a href="#fn_s3_3_4">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p3_4">89:3.4</a></small></sup>  These olden ideas of self-discipline embraced <a href="/en/topic/flogging">flogging</a> and all sorts of physical <a href="/en/topic/torture">torture</a>. The priests of the <a href="/en/topic/mother_cult">mother cult</a> were especially active in teaching the virtue of physical suffering, setting the example by submitting themselves to <a href="/en/topic/castration">castration</a>. The <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Hindus">Hindus</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Buddhism">Buddhists</a> were earnest devotees of this doctrine of physical <a href="/en/topic/humiliation">humiliation</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p3_5">89:3.5</a></small></sup>  All through the olden times men sought in these ways for extra credits on the <a href="/en/topic/self-denial">self-denial</a> ledgers of their gods. It was once customary, when under some emotional stress, to make <a href="/en/topic/vows">vows</a> of self-denial and self-torture. In time these vows assumed the form of contracts with the gods and, in that sense, represented true evolutionary progress in that the gods were supposed to do something definite in return for this self-torture and mortification of the flesh. Vows were both negative and positive. Pledges of this harmful and extreme nature are best observed today among certain groups in <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_5_19"><a href="#fn_a3_5_19">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p3_6">89:3.6</a></small></sup>  It was only natural that the cult of <a href="/en/topic/renunciation">renunciation</a> and <a href="/en/topic/humiliation">humiliation</a> should have paid attention to sexual gratification. The <a href="/en/topic/continence_cult">continence cult</a> originated as a ritual among soldiers prior to engaging in battle; in later days it became the practice of “<a href="/en/topic/saints">saints</a>.” This cult tolerated <a href="/en/topic/marriage">marriage</a> only as an evil lesser than fornication<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b16"><a href="#fn_b16">[16]</a></sup>. Many of the world’s great religions have been adversely influenced by this ancient cult, but none more markedly than <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a>. The Apostle <a href="/en/topic/Paul">Paul</a> was a devotee of this cult, and his personal views are reflected in the teachings which he fastened onto Christian theology: “It is good for a man not to touch a woman<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b17"><a href="#fn_b17">[17]</a></sup>.” “I would that all men were even as I myself<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b18"><a href="#fn_b18">[18]</a></sup>.” “I say, therefore, to the unmarried and widows, it is good for them to abide even as I<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b19"><a href="#fn_b19">[19]</a></sup>.” Paul well knew that such teachings were not a part of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ gospel, and his acknowledgment of this is illustrated by his statement, “I speak this by permission and not by commandment<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b20"><a href="#fn_b20">[20]</a></sup>.” But this cult led Paul to look down upon women. And the pity of it all is that his personal opinions have long influenced the teachings of a great <a href="/en/topic/Roman_Catholic_Church">world religion</a>. If the advice of the tentmaker-teacher were to be literally and universally obeyed, then would the human race come to a sudden and inglorious end. Furthermore, the involvement of a religion with the ancient continence cult leads directly to a war against marriage and the home, society’s veritable foundation and the basic institution of human progress. And it is not to be wondered at that all such beliefs fostered the formation of celibate priesthoods in the many religions of various peoples.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_6_2"><a href="#fn_a3_6_2">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_6_10"><a href="#fn_a3_6_10">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_6_13"><a href="#fn_a3_6_13">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_6_17"><a href="#fn_a3_6_17">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_6_23"><a href="#fn_a3_6_23">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_6_24"><a href="#fn_a3_6_24">[9]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p4_1">89:4.1</a></small></sup>  Sacrifice as a part of religious devotions, like many other worshipful rituals, did not have a simple and single origin. The tendency to bow down before <a href="/en/topic/power">power</a> and to prostrate oneself in worshipful adoration in the presence of mystery is foreshadowed in the fawning of the dog before its master. It is but one step from the impulse of worship to the act of <a href="/en/topic/sacrifice">sacrifice</a>. Primitive man gauged the value of his sacrifice by the pain which he suffered. When the idea of sacrifice first attached itself to religious ceremonial, no offering was contemplated which was not productive of pain. The first sacrifices were such acts as plucking hair, cutting the flesh, mutilations, knocking out teeth, and cutting off fingers. As civilization advanced, these crude concepts of sacrifice were elevated to the level of the rituals of self-abnegation, <a href="/en/topic/asceticism">asceticism</a>, <a href="/en/topic/fasting">fasting</a>, deprivation, and the later Christian doctrine of sanctification through sorrow, suffering, and the mortification of the flesh.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_1_8"><a href="#fn_a4_1_8">[13]</a></sup></p>

While cannibalism is traditionally horrible to modern civilization, it was a part of the social and religious structure of primitive society. Group interests dictated the practice of cannibalism. It grew up through the urge of necessity and persisted because of the slavery of superstition and ignorance. It was a social, economic, religious, and military custom.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_1_9"><a href="#fn_a5_1_9">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p5_2">89:5.2</a></small></sup>  Early man was a cannibal; he enjoyed human flesh, and therefore he offered it as a <a href="/en/topic/food">food</a> gift to the spirits and his primitive gods. Since ghost spirits were merely modified men, and since food was man’s greatest need, then food must likewise be a spirit’s greatest need.</p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p5_3">89:5.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/cannibalism">Cannibalism</a> was once well-nigh universal among the evolving races.

<p id="p5_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p5_4">89:5.4</a></small></sup>  The taste for human flesh grows. Having been started through hunger, friendship, revenge, or religious ritual, the eating of human flesh goes on to habitual cannibalism. Man-eating has arisen through food scarcity, though this has seldom been the underlying reason. The <a href="/en/topic/Eskimos">Eskimos</a> and early Andonites, however, seldom were cannibalistic except in times of famine. The <a href="/en/topic/red_race">red men</a>, especially in <a href="/en/topic/Central_America">Central America</a>, were cannibals. It was once a general practice for primitive mothers to kill and eat their own <a href="/en/topic/children">children</a> in order to renew the strength lost in childbearing, and in <a href="/en/topic/Queensland">Queensland</a> <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> child is still frequently thus killed and devoured. In recent times cannibalism has been deliberately resorted to by many African tribes as a war measure, a sort of frightfulness with which to terrorize their neighbors.</p>

Man-eating came on at a time when men experienced intense and bitter emotions regarding their enemies. Eating human flesh became part of a solemn ceremony of <a href="/en/topic/revenge">revenge</a>; it was believed that an enemy’s ghost could, in this way, be destroyed or fused with that of the eater. It was once a widespread belief that wizards attained their powers by eating human flesh.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_5_19"><a href="#fn_a5_5_19">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p5_6">89:5.6</a></small></sup>  Certain groups of man-eaters would consume only members of their own tribes, a pseudospiritual inbreeding which was supposed to accentuate tribal solidarity. But they also ate enemies for revenge with the idea of appropriating their strength. It was considered an honor to the soul of a friend or fellow tribesman if his body were eaten, while it was no more than just punishment to an enemy thus to devour him. The savage mind made no pretensions to being consistent.</p>
<p id="p5_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p5_7">89:5.7</a></small></sup>  Among some tribes aged parents would seek to be eaten by their children; among others it was customary to refrain from eating near relations; their bodies were sold or exchanged for those of strangers. There was considerable commerce in women and children who had been fattened for slaughter. When disease or war failed to control population, the surplus was unceremoniously eaten.</p>
<p id="p5_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p5_8">89:5.8</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/cannibalism">Cannibalism</a> has been gradually disappearing because of the following influences:</p>
<p id="p5_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p5_9">89:5.9</a></small></sup>  1. It sometimes became a communal ceremony, the assumption of collective responsibility for inflicting the death penalty upon a fellow tribesman. The blood guilt ceases to be a crime when participated in by all, by society. The last of cannibalism in <a href="/en/topic/Asia">Asia</a> was this eating of executed criminals.</p>
<p id="p5_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p5_10">89:5.10</a></small></sup>  2. It very early became a religious ritual, but the growth of ghost fear did not always operate to reduce <a href="/en/topic/cannibalism">man-eating</a>.</p>
<p id="p5_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p5_11">89:5.11</a></small></sup>  3. Eventually it progressed to the point where only certain parts or organs of the body were eaten, those parts supposed to contain the soul or portions of the spirit. <a href="/en/topic/blood_drinking">Blood drinking</a> became common, and it was customary to mix the “edible” parts of the body with medicines.</p>
<p id="p5_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p5_12">89:5.12</a></small></sup>  4. It became limited to men; women were forbidden to eat human flesh.</p>
<p id="p5_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p5_13">89:5.13</a></small></sup>  5. It was next limited to the chiefs, priests, and shamans.</p>
<p id="p5_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p5_14">89:5.14</a></small></sup>  6. Then it became taboo among the higher tribes. The taboo on man-eating originated in <a href="/en/topic/Dalamatia">Dalamatia</a> and slowly spread over the world. The <a href="/en/topic/Nodites">Nodites</a> encouraged <a href="/en/topic/cremation">cremation</a> as a means of combating <a href="/en/topic/cannibalism">cannibalism</a> since it was once a common practice to dig up buried bodies and eat them.</p>
<p id="p5_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p5_15">89:5.15</a></small></sup>  7. Human <a href="/en/topic/sacrifice">sacrifice</a> sounded the death knell of cannibalism. Human flesh having become the food of <a href="/en/topic/superior_seraphim">superior</a> men, the chiefs, it was eventually reserved for the still more superior spirits; and thus the offering of human sacrifices effectively put a stop to cannibalism, except among the lowest tribes. When human sacrifice was fully established, man-eating became taboo; human flesh was food only for the gods; man could eat only a small ceremonial bit, a sacrament.</p>
<p id="p5_16"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p5_16">89:5.16</a></small></sup>  Finally animal substitutes came into general use for sacrificial purposes, and even among the more backward tribes dog-eating greatly reduced <a href="/en/topic/cannibalism">man-eating</a>. The <a href="/en/topic/dogs">dog</a> was <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> domesticated animal and was held in high esteem both as such and as food.</p>
<h2 id="p6" class="toc-header"><a href="#p6" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 6. EVOLUTION OF HUMAN SACRIFICE </h2>
<p id="p6_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p6_1">89:6.1</a></small></sup>  Human <a href="/en/topic/sacrifice">sacrifice</a> was an indirect result of cannibalism as well as its cure. Providing spirit escorts to the spirit world also led to the lessening of man-eating as it was never the custom to eat these death sacrifices. No race has been entirely free from the practice of human sacrifice in some form and at some time, even though the <a href="/en/topic/Andonites">Andonites</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Nodites">Nodites</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Adamites">Adamites</a> were the least addicted to cannibalism.</p>
<p id="p6_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p6_2">89:6.2</a></small></sup>  Human sacrifice has been virtually universal; it persisted in the religious customs of the <a href="/en/topic/Chinese">Chinese</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Hindus">Hindus</a>, Egyptians, <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a>, Mesopotamians, <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Romans">Romans</a>, and many other peoples, even on to recent times among the backward African and Australian tribes<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b24"><a href="#fn_b24">[24]</a></sup>. The later American <a href="/en/topic/Indians_(American)">Indians</a> had a civilization emerging from cannibalism and, therefore, steeped in human sacrifice, especially in Central and <a href="/en/topic/South_America">South America</a>. The <a href="/en/topic/Chaldeans">Chaldeans</a> were among <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> to abandon the sacrificing of humans for ordinary occasions, substituting therefor animals. About two thousand years ago a tenderhearted Japanese emperor introduced clay images to take the place of human sacrifices, but it was less than a thousand years ago that these sacrifices died out in northern <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a>. Among certain backward tribes, human sacrifice is still carried on by volunteers, a sort of religious or ritual suicide. A shaman once ordered the sacrifice of a much respected old man of a certain tribe. The people revolted; they refused to obey. Whereupon the old man had his own son dispatch him; the ancients really believed in this custom.</p>
<p id="p6_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p6_3">89:6.3</a></small></sup>  There is no more tragic and pathetic experience on record, illustrative of the heart-tearing contentions between ancient and time-honored religious customs and the contrary demands of advancing civilization, than the <a href="/en/topic/Hebrew_language">Hebrew</a> <a href="/en/topic/Urantia_Papers">narrative</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Jephthah">Jephthah</a> and his only daughter<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b25"><a href="#fn_b25">[25]</a></sup>.

And this price was to make a <a href="/en/topic/sacrifice">sacrifice</a> of that which first came out of his house to meet him when he returned to his home. Jephthah thought that one of his trusty slaves would thus be on hand to greet him, but it turned out that his daughter and only child came out to welcome him home. And so, even at that late date and among a supposedly civilized people, this beautiful maiden, after two months to mourn her fate, was actually offered as a human sacrifice by her father, and with the approval of his fellow tribesmen. And all this was done in the face of <a href="/en/topic/Moses">Moses</a>’ stringent rulings against the offering of human sacrifice. But men and women are addicted to making foolish and needless <a href="/en/topic/vows">vows</a>, and the men of old held all such pledges to be highly sacred.</p>
<p id="p6_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p6_4">89:6.4</a></small></sup>  In olden times, when a new <a href="/en/topic/buildings">building</a> of any importance was started, it was customary to slay a human being as a “foundation sacrifice<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b27"><a href="#fn_b27">[27]</a></sup>.” This provided a ghost spirit to watch over and protect the structure. When the <a href="/en/topic/Chinese">Chinese</a> made ready to cast a <a href="/en/topic/bells">bell</a>, custom decreed the sacrifice of at least one maiden for the purpose of improving the tone of the bell; the girl chosen was thrown alive into the molten metal.</p>
<p id="p6_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p6_5">89:6.5</a></small></sup>  It was long the practice of many groups to build slaves alive into important walls. In later times the northern <a href="/en/topic/Europe">European</a> tribes substituted the walling in of the <a href="/en/topic/shadows">shadow</a> of a passerby for this custom of entombing living persons in the walls of new buildings. The Chinese buried in a wall those workmen who died while constructing it.</p>

<p id="p6_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p6_7">89:6.7</a></small></sup>  It was long the custom of many peoples to dedicate <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> fruits to the spirits.

This was a subtle species of self-deception which both the maidens and their consorts delighted to practice upon themselves. The mores always drag behind in the evolutionary advance of civilization, thus providing sanction for the earlier and more savagelike sex practices of the evolving races.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a7_4_10"><a href="#fn_a7_4_10">[5]</a></sup></p>

In more recent times <a href="/en/topic/virgins">virgins</a> dedicated themselves to the service of tending the sacred temple fires.</p>
<p id="p8_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p8_2">89:8.2</a></small></sup>  Men eventually conceived the idea that the offering of some part of the body could take the place of the older and complete human sacrifice. Physical mutilation was also considered to be an acceptable substitute. Hair, nails, blood, and even fingers and toes were sacrificed. The later and well-nigh universal ancient rite of <a href="/en/topic/circumcision">circumcision</a> was an outgrowth of the cult of partial sacrifice; it was purely sacrificial, no thought of hygiene being attached thereto<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b38"><a href="#fn_b38">[38]</a></sup>.

<p id="p8_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p8_3">89:8.3</a></small></sup>  Subsequently it became the custom to bind fingers together instead of cutting them off. Shaving the head and cutting the <a href="/en/topic/hair">hair</a> were likewise forms of religious devotion. The <a href="/en/topic/castration">making of eunuchs</a> was at first a modification of the idea of human <a href="/en/topic/sacrifice">sacrifice</a>.

<p id="p8_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p8_4">89:8.4</a></small></sup>  The custom of sacrifice eventually became associated, as a result of advancing teachings, with the idea of the <a href="/en/topic/covenants">covenant</a>. At last, the gods were conceived of as entering into real agreements with man; and this was a major step in the stabilization of religion.

<p id="p8_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p8_6">89:8.6</a></small></sup>  But the idea of making a <a href="/en/topic/covenants">covenant</a> with the gods did finally arrive. <i>Evolutionary man eventually acquired such moral dignity that he dared to bargain with his gods.</i> And so the business of offering sacrifices gradually developed into the game of man’s philosophic bargaining with God. And all this represented a new device for insuring against bad <a href="/en/topic/luck">luck</a> or, rather, an enhanced technique for the more definite purchase of prosperity. Do not entertain the mistaken idea that these early sacrifices were a free gift to the gods, a spontaneous offering of gratitude or thanksgiving; they were not expressions of true worship.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s8_6_4"><a href="#fn_s8_6_4">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s8_6_3"><a href="#fn_s8_6_3">[4]</a></sup></p>

And as some men were better traders than others, so some were regarded as better prayers than others.

The early rituals of sacrifice bred the later ceremonies of <a href="/en/topic/sacraments">sacrament</a>. In more recent times the priest alone would partake of a bit of the cannibalistic sacrifice or a drop of human blood, and then all would partake of the animal substitute.
