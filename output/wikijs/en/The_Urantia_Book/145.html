<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p1_1">145:1.1</a></small></sup>  On <a href="/en/topic/Fridays">Friday</a> morning of this same week, when <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was teaching by the seaside, the people crowded him so near the water’s edge that he signaled to some fishermen occupying a near-by <a href="/en/topic/boats">boat</a> to come to his rescue. Entering the boat, he continued to teach the assembled multitude for more than two hours<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>. This boat was named “<a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a>”; it was the former fishing vessel of <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a> and had been built by Jesus’ own hands. On this particular morning the boat was being used by <a href="/en/topic/David_Zebedee">David Zebedee</a> and two associates, who had just come in near shore from a fruitless night of fishing on the lake<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>.

Let us go fishing; put out into yonder deep and let down your nets for a draught.” But Simon, one of David’s assistants, answered: “<a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, it is useless. We toiled all night and took nothing; however, at your bidding we will put out and let down the nets.” And Simon consented to follow Jesus’ directions because of a gesture made by his master, David. When they had proceeded to the place designated by Jesus, they let down their nets and enclosed such a multitude of <a href="/en/topic/fish">fish</a> that they feared the nets would break, so much so that they signaled to their associates on the shore to come to their assistance. When they had filled all three boats with fish, almost to sinking, this Simon fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, Master, for I am a sinful man.” Simon and all who were concerned in this episode were amazed at the <a href="/en/topic/draught_of_fishes">draught of fishes</a>.

Accordingly they believed that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had cast a demon out of this man. But Jesus did not at that time cure his epilepsy.

<p id="p3_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p3_13">145:3.13</a></small></sup>  Chiefly because of this unintended demonstration of physical healing, henceforth, throughout the remainder of his earth career, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> became as much a physician as a preacher.

<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p4_1">145:4.1</a></small></sup>  Throughout the evening following this great outburst of healing, the rejoicing and happy throng overran <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a>’s home, and the <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles of Jesus</a> were keyed up to the highest pitch of emotional enthusiasm. From a human standpoint, this was probably the greatest day of all the great days of their association with <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. At no time before or after did their hopes surge to such heights of confident expectation. Jesus had told them only a few days before, and when they were yet within the borders of <a href="/en/topic/Samaria">Samaria</a>, that the hour had come when the kingdom was to be proclaimed in <i>power,</i> and now their eyes had seen what they supposed was the fulfillment of that promise. They were thrilled by the vision of what was to come if this amazing manifestation of healing power was just the beginning. Their lingering doubts of Jesus’ divinity were banished. They were literally intoxicated with the ecstasy of their bewildered enchantment.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_1_8"><a href="#fn_a4_1_8">[22]</a></sup></p>

The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> was much perturbed by what had happened. These men, women, and children who had been healed of diverse diseases lingered late into the evening, hoping for Jesus’ return that they might thank him. The apostles could not understand the Master’s conduct as the hours passed and he remained in seclusion; their joy would have been full and perfect but for his continued absence. When Jesus did return to their midst, the hour was late, and practically all of the beneficiaries of the healing episode had gone to their homes. Jesus refused the congratulations and adoration of the twelve and the others who had lingered to greet him, only saying: “Rejoice not that my Father is powerful to heal the body, but rather that he is mighty to save the soul. Let us go to our rest, for tomorrow we must be about the <a href="/en/topic/Fathers_business">Father’s business</a>.”</p>

Because of these and similar thoughts which occupied the mortal mind of Jesus during the night, he arose <a href="/en/topic/Palm_Sunday">that Sunday</a> morning long before daybreak and went all alone to one of his favorite places for communion with the Father. The theme of Jesus’ prayer on this early morning was for wisdom and judgment that he might not allow his human sympathy, joined with his divine mercy, to make such an appeal to him in the presence of mortal suffering that all of his time would be occupied with physical ministry to the neglect of the spiritual<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b18"><a href="#fn_b18">[18]</a></sup>.

How is it, then, that you would have me turn aside from my work for the gratification of the curious and for the satisfaction of those who seek for signs and wonders? Have we not been among these people all these months, and have they flocked in multitudes to hear the good news of the kingdom? Why have they now come to besiege us? Is it not because of the healing of their physical bodies rather than as a result of the reception of spiritual truth for the salvation of their souls? When men are attracted to us because of extraordinary manifestations, many of them come seeking not for truth and salvation but rather in quest of healing for their physical ailments and to secure deliverance from their material difficulties.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_6_0"><a href="#fn_a5_6_0">[23]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_6_20"><a href="#fn_a5_6_20">[24]</a></sup></p>

It is not the will of my Father that I should return with you to cater to these curious ones and to become occupied with the ministry of things physical to the exclusion of the spiritual.

On this first tour they preached the gospel of the kingdom in many cities, but they did not visit <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>.</p>
<p id="p5_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p5_9">145:5.9</a></small></sup>  That Sunday afternoon, shortly after Jesus and his apostles had left for <a href="/en/topic/Rimmon">Rimmon</a>, his brothers <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Jude">Jude</a> came to see him, calling at Zebedee’s house.
