Let us go fishing; put out into yonder deep and let down your nets for a draught.” But Simon, one of David’s assistants, answered: “<a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>, it is useless. We toiled all night and took nothing; however, at your bidding we will put out and let down the nets.” And Simon consented to follow Jesus’ directions because of a gesture made by his master, David. When they had proceeded to the place designated by Jesus, they let down their nets and enclosed such a multitude of <a href="/en/topic/fish">fish</a> that they feared the nets would break, so much so that they signaled to their associates on the shore to come to their assistance. When they had filled all three boats with fish, almost to sinking, this Simon fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, Master, for I am a sinful man.” Simon and all who were concerned in this episode were amazed at the <a href="/en/topic/draught_of_fishes">draught of fishes</a>.

<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p3_3">145:3.3</a></small></sup>  The whole day’s events had set the stage for this extraordinary sundown scene. Even the text <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had used for his afternoon sermon had intimated that sickness should be banished; and he had spoken with such unprecedented power and authority! His message was so compelling! While he made no appeal to human authority, he did speak directly to the consciences and souls of men. Though he did not resort to logic, legal quibbles, or clever sayings, he did make a powerful, direct, clear, and personal appeal to the hearts of his hearers.</p>

<p id="p3_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p3_10">145:3.10</a></small></sup>  Jesus had passed the responsibility of this healing decision to the ruling of his Father. Evidently the Father’s will interposed no objection, for the words of the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> had scarcely been uttered when the assembly of celestial personalities serving under the command of Jesus’ Personalized Thought Adjuster was mightily astir. The vast retinue descended into the midst of this motley throng of afflicted <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a>, and in a moment of time 683 men, women, and children were made whole, were perfectly healed of all their physical diseases and other material disorders<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b17"><a href="#fn_b17">[17]</a></sup>.

<p id="p3_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p3_11">145:3.11</a></small></sup>  But of all the beings who were astonished at this sudden and unexpected outbreak of supernatural healing, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was the most surprised. In a moment when his human interests and sympathies were focused upon the scene of suffering and affliction there spread out before him, he neglected to bear in his human mind the admonitory warnings of his Personalized Adjuster regarding the impossibility of limiting the time element of the creator prerogatives of a <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Son</a> under certain conditions and in certain circumstances. Jesus desired to see these suffering mortals made whole if his Father’s will would not thereby be violated. The Personalized Adjuster of Jesus instantly ruled that such an act of creative energy at that time would not transgress the will of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Father, and by such a decision—in view of Jesus’ preceding expression of healing desire—the creative act <i>was.</i> What a <i>Creator Son</i> desires and his Father <i>wills</i> IS. Not in all of Jesus’ subsequent earth life did another such en masse physical healing of mortals take place.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_11_11"><a href="#fn_a3_11_11">[10]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_11_8"><a href="#fn_s3_11_8">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p3_12">145:3.12</a></small></sup>  As might have been expected, the fame of this sundown healing at <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a> in <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> spread throughout all <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Judea">Judea</a> and to the regions beyond. Once more were the fears of Herod aroused, and he sent watchers to report on the work and teachings of Jesus and to ascertain if he was the former carpenter of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> or <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John the Baptist</a> risen from the dead.</p>
<p id="p3_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p3_13">145:3.13</a></small></sup>  Chiefly because of this unintended demonstration of physical healing, henceforth, throughout the remainder of his earth career, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> became as much a physician as a preacher. True, he continued his teaching, but his personal work consisted mostly in ministering to the sick and the distressed, while his apostles did the work of public preaching and baptizing believers.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_13_5"><a href="#fn_a3_13_5">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p3_14">145:3.14</a></small></sup>  But the majority of those who were recipients of supernatural or creative physical healing at this sundown demonstration of divine energy were not permanently spiritually benefited by this extraordinary manifestation of mercy. A small number were truly edified by this physical ministry, but the spiritual kingdom was not advanced in the hearts of men by this amazing eruption of timeless creative healing.</p>
<p id="p3_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p3_15">145:3.15</a></small></sup>  The healing wonders which every now and then attended <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ mission on earth were not a part of his plan of proclaiming the kingdom. They were incidentally inherent in having on earth a divine being of well-nigh unlimited creator prerogatives in association with an unprecedented combination of divine mercy and human sympathy. But such so-called miracles gave Jesus much trouble in that they provided prejudice-raising publicity and afforded much unsought notoriety.</p>
<h2 id="p4" class="toc-header"><a href="#p4" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 4. THE EVENING AFTER </h2>
<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p4_1">145:4.1</a></small></sup>  Throughout the evening following this great outburst of healing, the rejoicing and happy throng overran <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a>’s home, and the <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles of Jesus</a> were keyed up to the highest pitch of emotional enthusiasm. From a human standpoint, this was probably the greatest day of all the great days of their association with <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. At no time before or after did their hopes surge to such heights of confident expectation. Jesus had told them only a few days before, and when they were yet within the borders of <a href="/en/topic/Samaria">Samaria</a>, that the hour had come when the kingdom was to be proclaimed in <i>power,</i> and now their eyes had seen what they supposed was the fulfillment of that promise. They were thrilled by the vision of what was to come if this amazing manifestation of healing power was just the beginning. Their lingering doubts of Jesus’ divinity were banished. They were literally intoxicated with the ecstasy of their bewildered enchantment.</p>
<p id="p4_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p4_2">145:4.2</a></small></sup>  But when they sought for Jesus, they could not find him. The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> was much perturbed by what had happened. These men, women, and children who had been healed of diverse diseases lingered late into the evening, hoping for Jesus’ return that they might thank him. The apostles could not understand the Master’s conduct as the hours passed and he remained in seclusion; their joy would have been full and perfect but for his continued absence. When Jesus did return to their midst, the hour was late, and practically all of the beneficiaries of the healing episode had gone to their homes. Jesus refused the congratulations and adoration of the twelve and the others who had lingered to greet him, only saying: “Rejoice not that my Father is powerful to heal the body, but rather that he is mighty to save the soul. Let us go to our rest, for tomorrow we must be about the <a href="/en/topic/Father’s_business">Father’s business</a>.”</p>
<p id="p4_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p4_3">145:4.3</a></small></sup>  And again did twelve disappointed, perplexed, and heart-sorrowing men go to their rest; few of them, except the twins, slept much that night. No sooner would the Master do something to cheer the souls and gladden the hearts of his apostles, than he seemed immediately to dash their <a href="/en/topic/hopes">hopes</a> in pieces and utterly to demolish the foundations of their courage and enthusiasm. As these bewildered fishermen looked into each other’s eyes, there was but one thought: “We cannot understand him. What does all this mean?”</p>

<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p5_1">145:5.1</a></small></sup>  Neither did <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> sleep much that Saturday night. He realized that the world was filled with physical distress and overrun with material difficulties, and he contemplated the great danger of being compelled to devote so much of his time to the care of the sick and afflicted that his mission of establishing the spiritual kingdom in the hearts of men would be interfered with or at least subordinated to the ministry of things physical. Because of these and similar thoughts which occupied the mortal mind of Jesus during the night, he arose that <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a> morning long before daybreak and went all alone to one of his favorite places for communion with the Father. The theme of Jesus’ prayer on this early morning was for wisdom and judgment that he might not allow his human sympathy, joined with his divine mercy, to make such an appeal to him in the presence of mortal suffering that all of his time would be occupied with physical ministry to the neglect of the spiritual<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b18"><a href="#fn_b18">[18]</a></sup>. Though he did not wish altogether to avoid ministering to the sick, he knew that he must also do the more important work of spiritual teaching and religious training.</p>
