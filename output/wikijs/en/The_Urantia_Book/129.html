<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p0_1">129:0.1</a></small></sup>  JESUS had fully and finally separated himself from the management of the domestic affairs of the <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> family and from the immediate direction of its individuals. He continued, right up to the event of his baptism, to contribute to the family finances and to take a keen personal interest in the spiritual welfare of every one of his brothers and sisters. And always was he ready to do everything humanly possible for the comfort and happiness of his widowed mother.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_1_1"><a href="#fn_a0_1_1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p0_2">129:0.2</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> had now made every preparation for detaching himself permanently from the Nazareth home; and this was not easy for him to do. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> naturally loved his people; he loved his family, and this natural affection had been tremendously augmented by his extraordinary devotion to them. The more fully we bestow ourselves upon our fellows, the more we come to <a href="/en/topic/love">love</a> them; and since Jesus had given himself so fully to his family, he loved them with a great and fervent affection.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_2_0"><a href="#fn_a0_2_0">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_2_12"><a href="#fn_a0_2_12">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p0_3">129:0.3</a></small></sup>  All the family had slowly awakened to the realization that Jesus was making ready to leave them. The sadness of the anticipated separation was only tempered by this graduated method of preparing them for the announcement of his intended departure. For more than four years they discerned that he was planning for this eventual separation.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. THE TWENTY-SEVENTH YEAR (A.D. 21) </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p1_1">129:1.1</a></small></sup>  In January of this year, A.D. 21, on a rainy <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">Sunday</a> morning, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> took unceremonious leave of his family, only explaining that he was going over to <a href="/en/topic/Tiberias">Tiberias</a> and then on a visit to other cities about the <a href="/en/topic/Sea_of_Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a>. And thus he left them, never again to be a regular member of that household.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p1_2">129:1.2</a></small></sup>  He spent one week at Tiberias, the new city which was soon to succeed <a href="/en/topic/Sepphoris">Sepphoris</a> as the capital of Galilee; and finding little to interest him, he passed on successively through <a href="/en/topic/Magdala">Magdala</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a> to <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, where he stopped to pay a visit to his father’s friend <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a>. Zebedee’s sons were fishermen; he himself was a boatbuilder. Jesus of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> was an expert in both designing and building; he was a master at working with <a href="/en/topic/wood">wood</a>; and Zebedee had long known of the skill of the Nazareth craftsman. For a long time Zebedee had contemplated making improved boats; he now laid his plans before Jesus and invited the visiting <a href="/en/topic/carpenter">carpenter</a> to join him in the enterprise, and Jesus readily consented.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_9"><a href="#fn_a1_2_9">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p1_3">129:1.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> worked with Zebedee only a little more than one year, but during that time he created a new style of boat and established entirely new methods of boatmaking. By superior technique and greatly improved methods of steaming the boards, Jesus and Zebedee began to build <a href="/en/topic/boats">boats</a> of a very superior type, craft which were far more safe for sailing the lake than were the older types. For several years Zebedee had more work, turning out these new-style boats, than his small establishment could handle; in less than five years practically all the craft on the lake had been built in the shop of Zebedee at Capernaum. Jesus became well known to the Galilean fisherfolk as the designer of the new boats.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p1_4">129:1.4</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a> was a moderately well-to-do man; his boatbuilding shops were on the lake to the south of <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, and his home was situated down the lake shore near the fishing headquarters of <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a>. Jesus lived in the home of Zebedee during the year and more he remained at Capernaum. He had long worked alone in the world, that is, without a father, and greatly enjoyed this period of working with a father-partner.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p1_5">129:1.5</a></small></sup>  Zebedee’s wife, <a href="/en/topic/Salome_(wife_of_Zebedee)">Salome</a>, was a relative of <a href="/en/topic/Annas">Annas</a>, onetime high priest at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and still the most influential of the Sadducean group, having been deposed only eight years previously. <a href="/en/topic/Salome_(sister_of_Mary_mother_of_Jesus)">Salome</a> became a great admirer of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. She loved him as she loved her own sons, <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>, John, and <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a>, while her four daughters looked upon Jesus as their elder brother. Jesus often went out fishing with James, John, and David, and they learned that he was an experienced fisherman as well as an expert boatbuilder.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p1_6">129:1.6</a></small></sup>  All this year Jesus sent money each month to James. He returned to <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> in October to attend <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(wife_of_Justus)">Martha</a>’s wedding, and he was not again in Nazareth for over two years, when he returned shortly before the double wedding of <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Jude">Jude</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p1_7">129:1.7</a></small></sup>  Throughout this year <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> built boats and continued to observe how men lived on earth. Frequently he would go down to visit at the caravan station, <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> being on the direct travel route from <a href="/en/topic/Damascus">Damascus</a> to the south. Capernaum was a strong Roman military post, and the garrison’s commanding officer was a gentile believer in <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a>, “a devout man,” as the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> were wont to designate such proselytes<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. This officer belonged to a wealthy Roman family, and he took it upon himself to build a beautiful synagogue in Capernaum, which had been presented to the <a href="/en/topic/Jews_(ancient_Hebrews)">Jews</a> a short time before Jesus came to live with <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a>. Jesus conducted the services in this new synagogue more than half the time this year, and some of the caravan people who chanced to attend remembered him as the carpenter from Nazareth.</p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p1_8">129:1.8</a></small></sup>  When it came to the payment of taxes, Jesus registered himself as a “skilled craftsman of Capernaum.” From this day on to the end of his earth life he was known as a resident of Capernaum. He never claimed any other legal residence, although he did, for various reasons, permit others to assign his residence to Damascus, <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, and even <a href="/en/topic/Alexandria">Alexandria</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p1_9">129:1.9</a></small></sup>  At the <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> synagogue he found many new books in the library chests, and he spent at least five evenings a week at intense study. One evening he devoted to social life with the older folks, and one evening he spent with the young people. There was something gracious and inspiring about the personality of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> which invariably attracted young people. He always made them feel at ease in his presence. Perhaps his great secret in getting along with them consisted in the twofold fact that he was always interested in what they were doing, while he seldom offered them <a href="/en/topic/advice">advice</a> unless they asked for it.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_9_5"><a href="#fn_a1_9_5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p1_10">129:1.10</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a> family almost worshiped Jesus, and they never failed to attend the conferences of questions and answers which he conducted each evening after supper before he departed for the synagogue to study. The youthful neighbors also came in frequently to attend these after-supper meetings. To these little gatherings Jesus gave varied and advanced instruction, just as advanced as they could comprehend. He talked quite freely with them, expressing his ideas and ideals about politics, sociology, science, and philosophy, but never presumed to speak with authoritative finality except when discussing religion—the relation of man to <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_10_10"><a href="#fn_a1_10_10">[6]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_10_1"><a href="#fn_s1_10_1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p1_11">129:1.11</a></small></sup>  Once a week <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> held a meeting with the entire household, shop, and shore helpers, for Zebedee had many employees. And it was among these workers that Jesus was first called “the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.” They all loved him. He enjoyed his labors with Zebedee in <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, but he missed the children playing out by the side of the <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> carpenter shop.</p>
<p id="p1_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p1_12">129:1.12</a></small></sup>  Of the sons of <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee,_James">Zebedee, James</a> was the most interested in Jesus as a teacher, as a philosopher. John cared most for his religious teaching and opinions. <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a> respected him as a mechanic but took little stock in his religious views and philosophic teachings.</p>
<p id="p1_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p1_13">129:1.13</a></small></sup>  Frequently <a href="/en/topic/Jude">Jude</a> came over on the <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> to hear <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> talk in the synagogue and would tarry to visit with him. And the more Jude saw of his eldest brother, the more he became convinced that Jesus was a truly great man.</p>
<p id="p1_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p1_14">129:1.14</a></small></sup>  This year Jesus made great advances in the ascendant mastery of his human mind and attained new and high levels of conscious contact with his indwelling Thought Adjuster.</p>
<p id="p1_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p1_15">129:1.15</a></small></sup>  This was <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> year of his settled life. Never again did <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> spend a whole year in one place or at one undertaking. The days of his earth pilgrimages were rapidly approaching. Periods of intense activity were not far in the future, but there were now about to intervene between his simple but intensely active life of the past and his still more intense and strenuous public ministry, a few years of extensive travel and highly diversified personal activity. His training as a man of the realm had to be completed before he could enter upon his career of teaching and preaching as the perfected God-man of the divine and posthuman phases of his <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> bestowal.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_15_0"><a href="#fn_a1_15_0">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. THE TWENTY-EIGHTH YEAR (A.D. 22) </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p2_1">129:2.1</a></small></sup>  In March, A.D. 22, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> took leave of <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a> and of <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>. He asked for a small sum of money to defray his expenses to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. While working with Zebedee he had drawn only small sums of money, which each month he would send to the family at <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>. One month <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a> would come down to Capernaum for the money; the next month <a href="/en/topic/Jude">Jude</a> would come over to Capernaum, get the money from Jesus, and take it up to Nazareth. Jude’s fishing headquarters was only a few miles south of Capernaum.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p2_2">129:2.2</a></small></sup>  When Jesus took leave of Zebedee’s family, he agreed to remain in Jerusalem until <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> time, and they all promised to be present for that event. They even arranged to celebrate the Passover supper together. They all sorrowed when Jesus left them, especially the daughters of Zebedee.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p2_3">129:2.3</a></small></sup>  Before leaving <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had a long talk with his new-found friend and close companion, <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John Zebedee</a>. He told John that he contemplated traveling extensively until “my hour shall come” and asked John to act in his stead in the matter of sending some money to the family at <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> each month until the funds due him should be exhausted. And John made him this promise: “My Teacher, go about your business, do your work in the world; I will act for you in this or any other matter, and I will watch over your family even as I would foster my own mother and care for my own brothers and sisters. I will disburse your funds which my father holds as you have directed and as they may be needed, and when your money has been expended, if I do not receive more from you, and if your mother is in need, then will I share my own earnings with her. Go your way in peace. I will act in your stead in all these matters.”</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p2_4">129:2.4</a></small></sup>  Therefore, after Jesus had departed for <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, John consulted with his father, Zebedee, regarding the money due Jesus, and he was surprised that it was such a large sum. As Jesus had left the matter so entirely in their hands, they agreed that it would be the better plan to invest these funds in property and use the income for assisting the family at Nazareth; and since Zebedee knew of a little house in Capernaum which carried a mortgage and was for sale, he directed John to buy this house with Jesus’ money and hold the title in trust for his friend. And John did as his father advised him. For two years the rent of this house was applied on the mortgage, and this, augmented by a certain large fund which Jesus presently sent up to John to be used as needed by the family, almost equaled the amount of this obligation; and Zebedee supplied the difference, so that John paid up the remainder of the mortgage when it fell due, thereby securing clear title to this two-room house. In this way Jesus became the owner of a house in Capernaum, but he had not been told about it.</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p2_5">129:2.5</a></small></sup>  When the family at <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> heard that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had departed from <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, they, not knowing of this financial arrangement with John, believed the time had come for them to get along without any further help from Jesus. <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> remembered his contract with Jesus and, with the help of his brothers, forthwith assumed full responsibility for the care of the family.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p2_6">129:2.6</a></small></sup>  But let us go back to observe Jesus in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. For almost two months he spent the greater part of his time listening to the <a href="/en/topic/temple">temple</a> discussions with occasional visits to the various schools of the rabbis. Most of the <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> days he spent at <a href="/en/topic/Bethany_(near_Jerusalem)">Bethany</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p2_7">129:2.7</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had carried with him to Jerusalem a letter from <a href="/en/topic/Salome_(wife_of_Zebedee)">Salome</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a>’s wife, introducing him to the former high priest, <a href="/en/topic/Annas">Annas</a>, as “one, the same as my own son.” Annas spent much time with him, personally taking him to visit the many academies of the Jerusalem religious teachers. While Jesus thoroughly inspected these schools and carefully observed their methods of teaching, he never so much as asked a single question in public. Although Annas looked upon Jesus as a great man, he was puzzled as to how to advise him. He recognized the foolishness of suggesting that he enter any of the schools of Jerusalem as a student, and yet he well knew Jesus would never be accorded the status of a regular teacher inasmuch as he had never been trained in these schools.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p2_8">129:2.8</a></small></sup>  Presently the time of the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> drew near, and along with the throngs from every quarter there arrived at <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> from <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, Zebedee and his entire family. They all stopped at the spacious home of Annas, where they celebrated the Passover as one happy family.</p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p2_9">129:2.9</a></small></sup>  Before the end of this Passover week, by apparent chance, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> met a wealthy traveler and his son, a young man about seventeen years of age. These travelers hailed from <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a>, and being on their way to visit <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a> and various other points on the <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_region">Mediterranean</a>, they had arranged to arrive in Jerusalem during the Passover, hoping to find someone whom they could engage as interpreter for both and tutor for the son. The father was insistent that Jesus consent to travel with them. Jesus told him about his family and that it was hardly fair to go away for almost two years, during which time they might find themselves in need. Whereupon, this traveler from the Orient proposed to advance to Jesus the wages of one year so that he could intrust such funds to his friends for the safeguarding of his family against want. And Jesus agreed to make the trip.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_9_5"><a href="#fn_s2_9_5">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p2_10">129:2.10</a></small></sup>  Jesus turned this large sum over to John the son of <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a>. And you have been told how John applied this money toward the liquidation of the mortgage on the <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> property. Jesus took Zebedee fully into his confidence regarding this Mediterranean journey, but he enjoined him to tell no man, not even his own flesh and blood, and Zebedee never did disclose his knowledge of Jesus’ whereabouts during this long period of almost two years. Before Jesus’ return from this trip the family at <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> had just about given him up as dead. Only the assurances of Zebedee, who went up to Nazareth with his son John on several occasions, kept hope alive in <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a>’s heart.</p>
<p id="p2_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p2_11">129:2.11</a></small></sup>  During this time the Nazareth family got along very well; <a href="/en/topic/Jude">Jude</a> had considerably increased his quota and kept up this extra contribution until he was married. Notwithstanding that they required little assistance, it was the practice of <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John Zebedee</a> to take presents each month to Mary and <a href="/en/topic/Ruth_(Old_Testament)">Ruth</a>, as <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had instructed him.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. THE TWENTY-NINTH YEAR (A.D. 23) </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p3_1">129:3.1</a></small></sup>  The whole of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ twenty-ninth year was spent finishing up the tour of the <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_region">Mediterranean</a> world. The main events, as far as we have permission to reveal these experiences, constitute the subjects of the narratives which immediately follow this paper.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p3_2">129:3.2</a></small></sup>  Throughout this tour of the Roman world, for many reasons, Jesus was known as the <i><a href="/en/topic/Damascus">Damascus</a> scribe.</i> At <a href="/en/topic/Corinth">Corinth</a> and other stops on the return trip he was, however, known as the <i><a href="/en/topic/Jewish_tutor">Jewish tutor</a>.</i></p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p3_3">129:3.3</a></small></sup>  This was an eventful period in <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ life. While on this journey he made many contacts with his fellow men, but this experience is a phase of his life which he never revealed to any member of his family nor to any of the apostles. Jesus lived out his life in the flesh and departed from this world without anyone (save <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a>) knowing that he had made this extensive trip.

If you would comprehend the meaning of many of his apparently strange doings, you must discern the purpose of his sojourn on your world. He was consistently careful not to build up an overattractive and attention-consuming personal career. He wanted to make no unusual or overpowering appeals to his fellow men. He was dedicated to the work of revealing the heavenly Father to his fellow <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> and at the same time was consecrated to the sublime task of living his mortal earth life all the while subject to the will of the same <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Father.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_5_2"><a href="#fn_a3_5_2">[7]</a></sup></p>

There was something special and inspiring associated with the life he lived in the flesh of mortal nature for every single inhabited sphere throughout all the universe of <a href="/en/topic/Nebadon">Nebadon</a>.

<p id="p4_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p4_1">129:4.1</a></small></sup>  To the onlooking celestial intelligences of the local universe, this <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_region">Mediterranean</a> trip was the most enthralling of all <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ earth experiences, at least of all his career right up to the event of his crucifixion and mortal death. This was the fascinating period of his <i>personal ministry</i> in contrast with the soon-following epoch of public ministry. This unique episode was all the more engrossing because he was at this time still the carpenter of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, the boatbuilder of <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, the scribe of <a href="/en/topic/Damascus">Damascus</a>; he was still the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>.

This experience of spiritual development was a consistently gradual growth from the moment of the arrival of his Thought Adjuster until the day of the completion and confirmation of that natural and normal human relationship between the material mind of man and the mind-endowment of the spirit—the phenomenon of the making of these two minds one, the experience which the Son of Man attained in completion and finality, as an incarnated mortal of the realm, on the day of his baptism in the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a>.</p>
