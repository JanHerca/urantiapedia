Said Jesus: “Though human beings differ in many ways, the one from another, before <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and in the spiritual world all <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> stand on an equal footing. There are only two groups of mortals in the eyes of God: those who desire to do his will and those who do not. As the universe looks upon an inhabited world, it likewise discerns two great classes: those who know God and those who do not. Those who cannot know God are reckoned among the <a href="/en/topic/animals">animals</a> of any given realm. Mankind can appropriately be divided into many classes in accordance with differing qualifications, as they may be viewed physically, mentally, socially, vocationally, or morally, but as these different classes of mortals appear before the judgment bar of God, they stand on an equal footing; God is truly no <a href="/en/topic/favoritism">respecter of persons</a>. Although you cannot escape the recognition of differential human abilities and endowments in matters intellectual, social, and moral, you should make no such distinctions in the spiritual brotherhood of men when assembled for worship in the presence of God.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_3_7"><a href="#fn_a0_3_7">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_3_8"><a href="#fn_a0_3_8">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_3_9"><a href="#fn_a0_3_9">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_3_15"><a href="#fn_a0_3_15">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_3_24"><a href="#fn_a0_3_24">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_3_52"><a href="#fn_a0_3_52">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_3_72"><a href="#fn_a0_3_72">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_3_97"><a href="#fn_a0_3_97">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_3_108"><a href="#fn_a0_3_108">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_3_118"><a href="#fn_a0_3_118">[11]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_3_2"><a href="#fn_s0_3_2">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s0_3_7"><a href="#fn_s0_3_7">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p1_1">133:1.1</a></small></sup>  A very interesting incident occurred one afternoon by the roadside as they neared <a href="/en/topic/Tarentum">Tarentum</a>. They observed a <a href="/en/topic/bully_near_Tarentum">rough and bullying youth</a> brutally attacking a smaller lad. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> hastened to the assistance of the assaulted youth, and when he had rescued him, he tightly held on to the offender until the smaller lad had made his escape. The moment Jesus released the little bully, <a href="/en/topic/Ganid">Ganid</a> pounced upon the boy and began soundly to thrash him, and to Ganid’s astonishment Jesus promptly interfered. After he had restrained Ganid and permitted the frightened boy to escape, the young man, as soon as he got his breath, excitedly exclaimed: “I cannot understand you, Teacher. If <a href="/en/topic/mercy">mercy</a> requires that you rescue the smaller lad, does not <a href="/en/topic/justice">justice</a> demand the punishment of the larger and offending youth?” In answering, Jesus said:<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_1_55"><a href="#fn_a1_1_55">[12]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_1_7"><a href="#fn_s1_1_7">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_1_3"><a href="#fn_s1_1_3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p1_2">133:1.2</a></small></sup>  “Ganid, it is true, you do not understand. Mercy ministry is always the work of the individual, but justice <a href="/en/topic/punishment">punishment</a> is the function of the social, governmental, or universe administrative groups. As an individual I am beholden to show mercy; I must go to the rescue of the assaulted lad, and in all consistency I may employ sufficient force to restrain the aggressor. And that is just what I did. I achieved the deliverance of the assaulted lad; that was the end of mercy ministry. Then I forcibly detained the aggressor a sufficient length of time to enable the weaker party to the dispute to make his escape, after which I withdrew from the affair. I did not proceed to sit in <a href="/en/topic/judgment">judgment</a> on the aggressor, thus to pass upon his <a href="/en/topic/motives">motive</a>—to adjudicate all that entered into his attack upon his fellow—and then undertake to execute the punishment which my mind might dictate as just recompense for his wrongdoing. Ganid, mercy may be lavish, but justice is precise. Cannot you discern that no two persons are likely to agree as to the punishment which would satisfy the demands of justice? One would impose forty lashes, another twenty, while still another would advise solitary confinement as a just punishment. Can you not see that on this world such responsibilities had better rest upon the group or be administered by chosen representatives of the group? In the universe, judgment is vested in those who fully know the antecedents of all wrongdoing as well as its motivation. In civilized society and in an organized universe the administration of justice presupposes the passing of just sentence consequent upon fair judgment, and such prerogatives are vested in the juridical groups of the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_worlds">worlds</a> and in the all-knowing administrators of the higher universes of all creation.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_34"><a href="#fn_a1_2_34">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_2_93"><a href="#fn_a1_2_93">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_2_92"><a href="#fn_a1_2_92">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_2_111"><a href="#fn_a1_2_111">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_2_112"><a href="#fn_a1_2_112">[17]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_2_1"><a href="#fn_s1_2_1">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_2_5"><a href="#fn_s1_2_5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p1_3">133:1.3</a></small></sup>  For days they talked about this problem of manifesting <a href="/en/topic/mercy">mercy</a> and administering <a href="/en/topic/justice">justice</a>. And <a href="/en/topic/Ganid">Ganid</a>, at least to some extent, understood why <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> would not engage in personal combat. But Ganid asked one last question, to which he never received a fully satisfactory answer; and that question was: “But, Teacher, if a stronger and ill-tempered creature should attack you and threaten to destroy you, what would you do? Would you make no effort to defend yourself?” Although Jesus could not fully and satisfactorily answer the lad’s question, inasmuch as he was not willing to disclose to him that he (Jesus) was living on earth as the exemplification of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Father’s love to an onlooking universe, he did say this much:</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p1_4">133:1.4</a></small></sup>  “Ganid, I can well understand how some of these problems perplex you, and I will endeavor to answer your question. First, in all attacks which might be made upon my person, I would determine whether or not the aggressor was a son of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>—my brother in the flesh—and if I thought such a creature did not possess moral judgment and spiritual reason, I would unhesitatingly defend myself to the full capacity of my powers of resistance, regardless of consequences to the attacker. But I would not thus assault a fellow man of sonship status, even in <a href="/en/topic/self-defense">self-defense</a>. That is, I would not punish him in advance and without judgment for his assault upon me. I would by every possible artifice seek to prevent and dissuade him from making such an attack and to mitigate it in case of my failure to abort it. Ganid, I have absolute confidence in my heavenly Father’s overcare; I am consecrated to doing the will of my Father in heaven. I do not believe that <i>real</i> harm can befall me; I do not believe that my lifework can really be jeopardized by anything my enemies might wish to visit upon me, and surely we have no violence to fear from our friends.

Many times they talked over these matters, and <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> told him some of his boyhood experiences and also about <a href="/en/topic/Jacob_the_stone_mason_(son)">Jacob the stone mason</a>’s son. On learning how <a href="/en/topic/Jacob_of_Crete">Jacob</a> appointed himself to defend Jesus, Ganid said: “Oh, I begin to see! In <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> place very seldom would any normal human being want to attack such a kindly person as you, and even if anyone should be so unthinking as to do such a thing<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📘" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d8.svg"><sup id="cite_c1"><a href="#fn_c1">[1]</a></sup>, there is pretty sure to be near at hand some other mortal who will fly to your assistance, even as you always go to the rescue of any person you observe to be in distress. In my heart, Teacher, I agree with you, but in my head I still think that if I had been <a href="/en/topic/Jacob_of_Emmaus">Jacob</a>, I would have enjoyed punishing those rude fellows who presumed to attack you just because they thought you would not defend yourself. I presume you are fairly safe in your journey through life since you spend much of your time helping others and ministering to your fellows in distress—well, most likely there’ll always be someone on hand to defend you.” And Jesus replied: “That test has not yet come, Ganid, and when it does, we will have to abide by the Father’s will.” And that was about all the lad could get his teacher to say on this difficult subject of self-defense and <a href="/en/topic/nonresistance">nonresistance</a>. On another occasion he did draw from Jesus the opinion that organized society had every right to <a href="/en/topic/compulsion">employ force</a> in the execution of its just mandates.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_5_52"><a href="#fn_a1_5_52">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_5_40"><a href="#fn_a1_5_40">[36]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p2_1">133:2.1</a></small></sup>  While tarrying at the ship landing, waiting for the <a href="/en/topic/boats">boat</a> to unload cargo, the travelers observed a <a href="/en/topic/man_who_attacked_wife_at_Tarentum">man mistreating his wife</a>. As was his custom, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> intervened in behalf of the person subjected to attack. He stepped up behind the irate husband and, tapping him gently on the shoulder, said: “My friend, may I speak with you in private for a moment?” The angry man was nonplused by such an approach and, after a moment of embarrassing hesitation, stammered out—“er—why—yes, what do you want with me?” When Jesus had led him to one side, he said: “My friend, I perceive that something terrible must have happened to you; I very much desire that you tell me what could happen to such a strong man to lead him to attack <a href="/en/topic/Claudia_Procula">his wife</a>, the mother of his children, and that right out here before all eyes. I am sure you must feel that you have some good reason for this assault. What did the woman do to deserve such treatment from her husband? As I look upon you, I think I discern in your face the love of justice if not the desire to show mercy. I venture to say that, if you found me out by the wayside, attacked by robbers, you would unhesitatingly rush to my rescue. I dare say you have done many such brave things in the course of your life. Now, my friend, tell me what is the matter? Did the woman do something wrong, or did you foolishly lose your head and thoughtlessly assault her?” It was not so much what he said that touched this man’s heart as the kindly look and the sympathetic smile which Jesus bestowed upon him at the conclusion of his remarks. Said the man: “I perceive you are a priest of the <a href="/en/topic/Cynics">Cynics</a>, and I am thankful you restrained me. My wife has done no great wrong; she is a good woman, but she irritates me by the manner in which she picks on me in public, and I lose my temper. I am sorry for my lack of self-control, and I promise to try to live up to my former pledge to one of your brothers who taught me the better way many years ago. I promise you.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_1_51"><a href="#fn_a2_1_51">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_1_6"><a href="#fn_a2_1_6">[38]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_1_125"><a href="#fn_a2_1_125">[39]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_1_127"><a href="#fn_a2_1_127">[40]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_7"><a href="#fn_s2_1_7">[2]</a></sup></p>

Your wife has engaged to go through life with you, to help you fight its battles, and to assume the far greater share of the burden of bearing and rearing your <a href="/en/topic/children">children</a>; and in return for this special service it is only fair that she receive from you that special protection which man can give to woman as the partner who must carry, bear, and nurture the children.

One evening as they strolled about <a href="/en/topic/Corinth">Corinth</a> out near where the wall of the citadel ran down to the sea, they were accosted by two public women. Ganid had imbibed the idea, and rightly, that Jesus was a man of high ideals, and that he abhorred everything which partook of uncleanness or savored of <a href="/en/topic/evil">evil</a>; accordingly he spoke sharply to these women and rudely motioned them away. When Jesus saw this, he said to Ganid: “You mean well, but you should not presume thus to speak to the children of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, even though they chance to be his erring children. Who are we that we should sit in <a href="/en/topic/judgment">judgment</a> on these women?

This good spirit ever strives to lead us to God, to help us to find God and to know God; but also within <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> there are many natural physical tendencies which the Creator put there to serve the well-being of the individual and the race. Now, oftentimes, men and women become confused in their efforts to understand themselves and to grapple with the manifold difficulties of <a href="/en/topic/earning_a_living">making a living</a> in a world so largely dominated by selfishness and sin. I perceive, Ganid, that neither of these women is willfully wicked. I can tell by their faces that they have experienced much sorrow; they have suffered much at the hands of an apparently cruel fate; they have not intentionally chosen this sort of life; they have, in discouragement bordering on despair, surrendered to the pressure of the hour and accepted this distasteful means of obtaining a livelihood as the best way out of a situation that to them appeared hopeless. Ganid, some people are really wicked at heart; they deliberately choose to do mean things, but, tell me, as you look into these now tear-stained faces, do you see anything bad or wicked?” And as Jesus paused for his reply, Ganid’s voice choked up as he stammered out his answer: “No, Teacher, I do not. And I apologize for my rudeness to them—I crave their forgiveness.” Then said Jesus: “And I bespeak for them that they have forgiven you as I speak for my Father in heaven that he has forgiven them. Now all of you come with me to a friend’s house where we will seek refreshment and plan for the new and better life ahead.” Up to this time the amazed women had not uttered a word; they looked at each other and silently followed as the men led the way.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_7_55"><a href="#fn_a3_7_55">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_7_37"><a href="#fn_a3_7_37">[52]</a></sup></p>
