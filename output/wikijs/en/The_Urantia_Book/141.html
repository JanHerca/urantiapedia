<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p0_1">141:0.1</a></small></sup>  ON THE <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">first day</a> of the week, January 19, A.D. 27, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the twelve apostles made ready to depart from their headquarters in <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a>. The twelve knew nothing of their <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s plans except that they were going up to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> to attend the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> feast in April, and that it was the intention to journey by way of the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> valley. They did not get away from <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a>’s house until near noon because the families of the apostles and others of the disciples had come to say good-bye and wish them well in the new work they were about to begin.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_1_34"><a href="#fn_a0_1_34">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p0_2">141:0.2</a></small></sup>  Just before leaving, the apostles missed the Master, and <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> went out to find him. After a brief search he found Jesus sitting in a boat down the beach, and he was weeping. The twelve had often seen their Master when he seemed to grieve, and they had beheld his brief seasons of serious preoccupation of mind, but none of them had ever seen him weep. Andrew was somewhat startled to see the Master thus affected on the eve of their departure for Jerusalem, and he ventured to approach Jesus and ask: “On this great day, Master, when we are to depart for Jerusalem to proclaim the Father’s kingdom, why is it that you weep? Which of us has offended you?” And Jesus, going back with Andrew to join the twelve, answered him: “No one of you has grieved me. I am saddened only because none of my father <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Tyre">Joseph</a>’s family have remembered to come over to bid us Godspeed.” At this time <a href="/en/topic/Ruth_(Old_Testament)">Ruth</a> was on a visit to her brother <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_(Old_Testament)">Joseph</a> at <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>.

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p1_1">141:1.1</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> was not far from <a href="/en/topic/Tiberias">Tiberias</a>, and the fame of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had begun to spread well over all of <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> and even to parts beyond. Jesus knew that Herod would soon begin to take notice of his work; so he thought best to journey south and into <a href="/en/topic/Judea">Judea</a> with his apostles. A company of over one hundred believers desired to go with them, but Jesus spoke to them and besought them not to accompany the apostolic group on their way down the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a>. Though they consented to remain behind, many of them followed after the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> within a few days.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p1_2">141:1.2</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Sunday">first day</a> Jesus and the apostles only journeyed as far as <a href="/en/topic/Tarichea">Tarichea</a>, where they rested for the night. The next day they traveled to a point on the Jordan near <a href="/en/topic/Pella">Pella</a> where John had preached about one year before, and where Jesus had received baptism. Here they tarried for more than two weeks, teaching and preaching. By the end of <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> week several hundred people had assembled in a camp near where Jesus and the twelve dwelt, and they had come from Galilee, Phoenicia, <a href="/en/topic/Syria">Syria</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Decapolis">Decapolis</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Perea">Perea</a>, and Judea.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p1_3">141:1.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> did no public preaching. <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> divided the multitude and assigned the preachers for the forenoon and afternoon assemblies; after the evening meal Jesus talked with the twelve. He taught them nothing new but reviewed his former teaching and answered their many questions. On one of these evenings he told the twelve something about the forty days which he spent in the hills near this place.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p1_4">141:1.4</a></small></sup>  Many of those who came from <a href="/en/topic/Perea">Perea</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Judea">Judea</a> had been baptized by John and were interested in finding out more about Jesus’ teachings. The apostles made much progress in teaching the disciples of John inasmuch as they did not in any way detract from John’s preaching, and since they did not at this time even baptize their new disciples. But it was always a stumbling stone to John’s followers that Jesus, if he were all that John had announced, did nothing to get him out of prison. John’s disciples never could understand why Jesus did not prevent the cruel death of their beloved leader.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p1_5">141:1.5</a></small></sup>  From night to night <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> carefully instructed his fellow apostles in the delicate and difficult task of getting along smoothly with the followers of <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John the Baptist</a>. During this first year of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ public ministry more than three fourths of his followers had previously followed John and had received his baptism. This entire year of A.D. 27 was spent in quietly taking over John’s work in Perea and Judea.</p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p2_1">141:2.1</a></small></sup>  The night before they left <a href="/en/topic/Pella">Pella</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> gave the apostles some further instruction with regard to the new kingdom. Said the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>: “You have been taught to look for the coming of the kingdom of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, and now I come announcing that this long-looked-for kingdom is near at hand, even that it is already here and in our midst. In every kingdom there must be a king seated upon his throne and decreeing the laws of the realm. And so have you developed a concept of the <a href="/en/topic/kingdom_of_heaven">kingdom of heaven</a> as a glorified rule of the Jewish people over all the peoples of the earth with <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a> sitting on <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a>’s throne and from this place of miraculous power promulgating the laws of all the world. But, my children, you see not with the eye of faith, and you hear not with the understanding of the spirit. I declare that the kingdom of heaven is the realization and acknowledgment of God’s rule within the hearts of men. True, there is a King in this kingdom, and that King is my Father and your Father. We are indeed his loyal subjects, but far transcending that fact is the transforming truth that we are his <i>sons.</i> In my <a href="/en/topic/life">life</a> this truth is to become manifest to all. Our Father also sits upon a throne, but not one made with hands. The throne of the <a href="/en/topic/Infinite">Infinite</a> is the eternal dwelling place of the Father in the heaven of heavens; he fills all things and proclaims his laws to universes upon universes. And the Father also rules within the hearts of his children on earth by the spirit which he has sent to live within the souls of mortal men<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_1_11"><a href="#fn_a2_1_11">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_1_24"><a href="#fn_a2_1_24">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_1_29"><a href="#fn_a2_1_29">[6]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_2"><a href="#fn_s2_1_2">[2]</a></sup></p>

Verily, verily, I say to you, when the Father’s will is your <i>law,</i> you are hardly in the kingdom. But when the Father’s will becomes truly your <i>will,</i> then are you in very truth in the kingdom because the kingdom has thereby become an established experience in you. When God’s will is your law, you are noble slave subjects; but when you believe in this new gospel of divine sonship, my Father’s will becomes your will, and you are elevated to the high position of the free children of God, liberated sons of the kingdom<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_2_2"><a href="#fn_a2_2_2">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_2_14"><a href="#fn_a2_2_14">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_2_18"><a href="#fn_a2_2_18">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_2_40"><a href="#fn_a2_2_40">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_2_56"><a href="#fn_a2_2_56">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_2_57"><a href="#fn_a2_2_57">[12]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p3_1">141:3.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> and his apostles remained near <a href="/en/topic/Amathus">Amathus</a> for almost three weeks. The apostles continued to preach twice daily to the multitude, and <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> preached each <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> afternoon. It became impossible to continue the <a href="/en/topic/Wednesday">Wednesday</a> playtime; so <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> arranged that two apostles should rest each day of the six days in the week, while all were on duty during the Sabbath services.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p3_2">141:3.2</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>, <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>, and John did most of the public preaching. <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a>, Thomas, and <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> did much of the personal work and conducted classes for special groups of inquirers; the twins continued their general police supervision, while Andrew, Matthew, and Judas developed into a general managerial committee of three, although each of these three also did considerable religious work.</p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p3_3">141:3.3</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> was much occupied with the task of adjusting the constantly recurring misunderstandings and disagreements between the disciples of John and the newer disciples of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. Serious situations would arise every few days, but Andrew, with the assistance of his apostolic associates, managed to induce the contending parties to come to some sort of agreement, at least temporarily. Jesus refused to participate in any of these conferences; neither would he give any advice about the proper adjustment of these difficulties. He never once offered a suggestion as to how the apostles should solve these perplexing problems. When Andrew came to Jesus with these questions, he would always say: “It is not wise for the host to participate in the family troubles of his guests; a wise parent never takes sides in the petty quarrels of his own children.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_3_73"><a href="#fn_a3_3_73">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p3_4">141:3.4</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> displayed great wisdom and manifested perfect fairness in all of his dealings with his apostles and with all of his disciples. Jesus was truly a master of men; he exercised great influence over his fellow men because of the combined charm and force of his personality. There was a subtle commanding influence in his rugged, nomadic, and homeless life. There was intellectual attractiveness and spiritual drawing power in his authoritative manner of teaching, in his lucid logic, his strength of reasoning, his sagacious insight, his alertness of mind, his matchless poise, and his sublime tolerance. He was simple, manly, honest, and fearless. With all of this physical and intellectual influence manifest in the Master’s presence, there were also all those spiritual charms of being which have become associated with his personality—patience, tenderness, meekness, gentleness, and humility.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_4_16"><a href="#fn_a3_4_16">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_4_28"><a href="#fn_a3_4_28">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_4_38"><a href="#fn_a3_4_38">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_4_68"><a href="#fn_a3_4_68">[19]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_4_4"><a href="#fn_s3_4_4">[1]</a></sup></p>
