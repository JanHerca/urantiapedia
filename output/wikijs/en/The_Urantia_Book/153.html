<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p0_1">153:0.1</a></small></sup>  ON FRIDAY evening, the day of their arrival at <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a>, and on <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> morning, the apostles noticed that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was seriously occupied with some momentous problem; they were cognizant that the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> was giving unusual thought to some important matter. He ate no breakfast and but little at noontide. All of Sabbath morning and the evening before, the twelve and their associates were gathered together in small groups about the house, in the <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a>, and along the seashore. There was a tension of uncertainty and a suspense of apprehension resting upon all of them. Jesus had said little to them since they left <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_1_3"><a href="#fn_a0_1_3">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_1_14"><a href="#fn_a0_1_14">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p0_2">153:0.2</a></small></sup>  Not in months had they seen the Master so preoccupied and uncommunicative. Even <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a> was depressed, if not downcast. <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> was at a loss to know what to do for his dejected associates. <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a> said they were in the midst of the ‚Äúlull before the storm.‚Äù <a href="/en/topic/Thomas_Didymus">Thomas</a> expressed the opinion that ‚Äúsomething out of the ordinary is about to happen.‚Äù <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a> advised <a href="/en/topic/David_Zebedee">David Zebedee</a> to ‚Äúforget about plans for feeding and lodging the multitude until we know what the Master is thinking about.‚Äù <a href="/en/topic/Matthew_Levi">Matthew</a> was putting forth renewed efforts to replenish the treasury. <a href="/en/topic/James_Zebedee">James</a> and <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John</a> talked over the forthcoming sermon in the synagogue and speculated much as to its probable nature and scope. <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Zelotes">Simon Zelotes</a> expressed the belief, in reality a hope, that ‚Äúthe Father in heaven may be about to intervene in some unexpected manner for the vindication and support of his Son,‚Äù while <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a> dared to indulge the thought that possibly Jesus was oppressed with regrets that ‚Äúhe did not have the courage and daring to permit the five thousand to proclaim him king of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>.‚Äù</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p0_3">153:0.3</a></small></sup>  It was from among such a group of depressed and disconsolate followers that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> went forth on this beautiful <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> afternoon to preach his epoch-making sermon in the <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> synagogue<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. The only word of cheerful greeting or well-wishing from any of his immediate followers came from one of the unsuspecting <a href="/en/topic/Alpheus_twins">Alpheus twins</a>, who, as Jesus left the house on his way to the synagogue, saluted him cheerily and said: ‚ÄúWe pray the Father will help you, and that we may have bigger multitudes than ever.‚Äù<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_3_24"><a href="#fn_a0_3_24">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p1_1">153:1.1</a></small></sup>  A distinguished congregation greeted <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> at three o‚Äôclock on this exquisite <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> afternoon in the new <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> synagogue. <a href="/en/topic/Jairus">Jairus</a> presided and handed Jesus the Scriptures to read. The day before, fifty-three <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Sadducees">Sadducees</a> had arrived from <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>; more than thirty of the leaders and rulers of the neighboring synagogues were also present. These Jewish religious leaders were acting directly under orders from the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> at Jerusalem, and they constituted the orthodox vanguard which had come to inaugurate open warfare on Jesus and his disciples. Sitting by the side of these Jewish leaders, in the synagogue seats of honor, were the official observers of <a href="/en/topic/Herod_Antipas">Herod Antipas</a>, who had been directed to ascertain the truth concerning the disturbing reports that an attempt had been made by the populace to proclaim Jesus the king of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>, over in the domains of his brother <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_1_18"><a href="#fn_a1_1_18">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p1_2">153:1.2</a></small></sup>  Jesus comprehended that he faced the immediate declaration of avowed and open warfare by his increasing enemies, and he elected boldly to assume the offensive. At the <a href="/en/topic/feeding_the_5000">feeding of the five thousand</a> he had challenged their ideas of the material <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a>; now he chose again openly to attack their concept of the Jewish <a href="/en/topic/Deliverer">deliverer</a>. This crisis, which began with the feeding of the five thousand, and which terminated with this Sabbath afternoon sermon, was the outward turning of the tide of popular fame and acclaim. Henceforth, the work of the kingdom was to be increasingly concerned with the more important task of winning lasting spiritual converts for the truly religious brotherhood of mankind. This sermon marks the crisis in the transition from the period of discussion, controversy, and decision to that of open warfare and final acceptance or final rejection.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_14"><a href="#fn_a1_2_14">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_2_18"><a href="#fn_a1_2_18">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_2_13"><a href="#fn_a1_2_13">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p1_3">153:1.3</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> well knew that many of his followers were slowly but surely preparing their minds finally to reject him. He likewise knew that many of his <a href="/en/topic/disciples">disciples</a> were slowly but certainly passing through that training of mind and that discipline of soul which would enable them to triumph over doubt and courageously to assert their full-fledged faith in the gospel of the kingdom. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> fully understood how men prepare themselves for the decisions of a <a href="/en/topic/crisis">crisis</a> and the performance of sudden deeds of courageous choosing by the slow process of the reiterated choosing between the recurring situations of good and evil. He subjected his chosen <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> to repeated rehearsals in <a href="/en/topic/disappointment">disappointment</a> and provided them with frequent and testing opportunities for choosing between the right and the wrong <a href="/en/topic/way">way</a> of meeting spiritual trials. He knew he could depend on his followers, when they met the final test, to make their vital decisions in accordance with prior and habitual mental attitudes and spirit reactions.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_3_14"><a href="#fn_a1_3_14">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_3_23"><a href="#fn_a1_3_23">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_3_33"><a href="#fn_a1_3_33">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_3_38"><a href="#fn_a1_3_38">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p1_4">153:1.4</a></small></sup>  This crisis in Jesus‚Äô earth life began with the feeding of the five thousand and ended with this sermon in the synagogue; the crisis in the lives of the apostles began with this sermon in the synagogue and continued for a whole year, ending only with the Master‚Äôs trial and crucifixion.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_4_18"><a href="#fn_a1_4_18">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p1_5">153:1.5</a></small></sup>  As they sat there in the synagogue that afternoon before <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> began to speak, there was just one great mystery, just one supreme question, in the minds of all. Both his friends and his foes pondered just one thought, and that was: ‚ÄúWhy did he himself so deliberately and effectively turn back the tide of popular enthusiasm?‚Äù And it was immediately before and immediately after this sermon that the doubts and disappointments of his disgruntled adherents grew into unconscious opposition and eventually turned into actual hatred. It was after this sermon in the synagogue that <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a> entertained his first conscious thought of deserting. But he did, for the time being, effectively master all such inclinations.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p1_6">153:1.6</a></small></sup>  Everyone was in a state of perplexity. Jesus had left them dumfounded and confounded. He had recently engaged in the greatest demonstration of supernatural power to characterize his whole career. The feeding of the five thousand was the one event of his earth life which made the greatest appeal to the Jewish concept of the expected <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a>. But this extraordinary advantage was immediately and unexplainedly offset by his prompt and unequivocal refusal to be made king.</p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p1_7">153:1.7</a></small></sup>  On <a href="/en/topic/Fridays">Friday</a> evening, and again on <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> morning, the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> leaders had labored long and earnestly with <a href="/en/topic/Jairus">Jairus</a> to prevent <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>‚Äô speaking in the synagogue, but it was of no avail. Jairus‚Äôs only reply to all this pleading was: ‚ÄúI have granted this request, and I will not violate my word.‚Äù</p>

Therefore shall you serve your enemies who shall come against you. You shall endure hunger and thirst and wear this alien yoke of iron. The Lord shall bring against you a nation from afar, from the end of the earth, a nation whose tongue you shall not understand, a nation of fierce countenance, a nation which will have little regard for you. And they shall besiege you in all your towns until the high fortified walls wherein you have trusted come down; and all the land shall fall into their hands. And it shall come to pass that you will be driven to eat the fruit of your own bodies, the flesh of your sons and daughters, during this time of siege, because of the straitness wherewith your enemies shall press you.‚Äù<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_3"><a href="#fn_s2_1_3">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p2_2">153:2.2</a></small></sup>  And when Jesus had finished this reading, he turned to the Prophets and read from <a href="/en/topic/Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a>: ‚Äú‚ÄòIf you will not hearken to the words of my servants the prophets whom I have sent you, then will I make this house like <a href="/en/topic/Shiloh">Shiloh</a>, and I will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.‚Äô And the priests and the teachers heard Jeremiah speak these words in the house of the Lord. And it came to pass that, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to speak to all the people, the priests and teachers laid hold of him, saying, ‚ÄòYou shall surely die.‚Äô And all the people crowded around Jeremiah in the house of the Lord. And when the princes of <a href="/en/topic/Judah">Judah</a> heard these things, they sat in judgment on Jeremiah. Then spoke the priests and the teachers to the princes and to all the people, saying: ‚ÄòThis man is worthy to die, for he has prophesied against our city, and you have heard him with your own ears.‚Äô Then spoke Jeremiah to all the princes and to all the people: ‚ÄòThe Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words which you have heard. Now, therefore, amend your ways and reform your doings and obey the voice of the Lord your God that you may escape the evil which has been pronounced against you. As for me, behold I am in your hands. Do with me as seems good and right in your eyes. But know you for certain that, if you put me to death, you shall bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this people, for of a truth the Lord has sent me to speak all these words in your ears.‚Äô<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_2_4"><a href="#fn_a2_2_4">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_2_16"><a href="#fn_a2_2_16">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_2_15"><a href="#fn_a2_2_15">[11]</a></sup></p>

They were all amazed and somewhat terror-stricken by the sudden change in the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>‚Äôs teaching tactics. They were wholly unaccustomed to seeing him perform in such a militant manner.</p>
<h2 id="p5" class="toc-header"><a href="#p5" class="toc-anchor">¬∂</a> 5. THE SATURDAY EVENING </h2>
<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p5_1">153:5.1</a></small></sup>  Time and again had <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> dashed to pieces the <a href="/en/topic/hopes">hopes</a> of his <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">apostles</a>, repeatedly had he crushed their fondest expectations, but no time of disappointment or season of sorrow had ever equaled that which now overtook them. And, too, there was now admixed with their depression a real fear for their safety. They were all surprisingly startled by the suddenness and completeness of the desertion of the populace<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b43"><a href="#fn_b43">[43]</a></sup>. They were also somewhat frightened and disconcerted by the unexpected boldness and assertive determination exhibited by the <a href="/en/topic/Pharisees">Pharisees</a> who had come down from <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. But most of all they were bewildered by Jesus‚Äô sudden change of tactics. Under ordinary circumstances they would have welcomed the appearance of this more militant attitude, but coming as it did, along with so much that was unexpected, it startled them.</p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p5_2">153:5.2</a></small></sup>  And now, on top of all of these worries, when they reached home, Jesus refused to eat. For hours he isolated himself in one of the upper rooms. It was almost midnight when <a href="/en/topic/Joab">Joab</a>, the leader of the <a href="/en/topic/evangelists">evangelists</a>, returned and reported that about one third of his associates had deserted the cause. All through the evening loyal disciples had come and gone, reporting that the revulsion of feeling toward the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> was general in <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>. The leaders from Jerusalem were not slow to feed this feeling of disaffection and in every way possible to seek to promote the movement away from Jesus and his teachings. During these trying hours <a href="/en/topic/womens_corps">the twelve women</a> were in session over at <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>‚Äôs house. They were tremendously upset, but none of them deserted.</p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p5_3">153:5.3</a></small></sup>  It was a little after midnight when <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> came down from the upper chamber and stood among the twelve and their associates, numbering about thirty in all. He said: ‚ÄúI recognize that this <a href="/en/topic/sifting">sifting</a> of the kingdom distresses you, but it is unavoidable. Still, after all the training you have had, was there any good reason why you should stumble at my words? Why is it that you are filled with fear and consternation when you see the kingdom being divested of these lukewarm multitudes and these halfhearted disciples? Why do you grieve when the new day is dawning for the shining forth in new glory of the spiritual teachings of the <a href="/en/topic/kingdom_of_heaven">kingdom of heaven</a>? If you find it difficult to endure this test, what, then, will you do when the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> must return to the Father? When and how will you prepare yourselves for the time when I ascend to the place whence I came to this world?<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìï" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b44"><a href="#fn_b44">[44]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b45"><a href="#fn_b45">[45]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìì" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s5_3_1"><a href="#fn_s5_3_1">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p5_4">153:5.4</a></small></sup>  ‚ÄúMy beloved, you must remember that it is the spirit that quickens; the <a href="/en/topic/flesh">flesh</a> and all that pertains thereto is of little profit. The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and life. Be of good cheer!

Many shall be offended by the plain speaking of these days. Already you have heard that many of my disciples have turned back; they walk no more with me. From the beginning I knew that these halfhearted believers would fall out by the way. Did I not choose you twelve men and set you apart as <a href="/en/topic/apostles_of_Jesus">ambassadors of the kingdom</a>? And now at such a time as this would you also desert? Let each of you look to his own faith, for one of you stands in grave danger.‚Äù And when Jesus had finished speaking, <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a> said: ‚ÄúYes, Lord, we are sad and perplexed, but we will never forsake you. You have taught us the words of eternal life. We have believed in you and followed with you all this time. We will not turn back, for we know that you are sent by <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>.‚Äù And as <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> ceased speaking, they all with one accord nodded their approval of his pledge of loyalty.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="üìÉ" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_4_20"><a href="#fn_a5_4_20">[39]</a></sup></p>
