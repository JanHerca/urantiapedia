Moses’ father-in-law was a Kenite worshiper of <a href="/en/topic/El_Elyon">El Elyon</a>, but the emancipator’s parents were believers in <a href="/en/topic/El_Shaddai">El Shaddai</a>.

And this evolution of life practices and change of religious viewpoint demanded a more or less complete change in the character of their conception of the nature of their God, Yahweh. During the times of the beginning of the transmutation of the austere, crude, exacting, and thunderous desert god of Sinai into the later appearing concept of a God of love, justice, and mercy, the <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a> almost lost sight of Moses’ lofty teachings. They came near losing all concept of monotheism; they nearly lost their opportunity of becoming the people who would serve as a vital link in the spiritual evolution of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>, the group who would conserve the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> teaching of one God until the times of the incarnation of a bestowal Son of that Father of all.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a6_2_3"><a href="#fn_a6_2_3">[1]</a></sup></p>

The burden of Joshua’s teaching became: “Yahweh is a holy <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b40"><a href="#fn_b40">[40]</a></sup>.” The highest concept of this age pictured Yahweh as a “God of power, judgment, and justice<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b41"><a href="#fn_b41">[41]</a></sup>.”</p>

<h2 id="p7" class="toc-header"><a href="#p7" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 7. PSALMS AND THE BOOK OF JOB </h2>
<p id="p7_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/96#p7_1">96:7.1</a></small></sup>  Under the leadership of their sheiks and priests the <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a> became loosely established in <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a>. But they soon drifted back into the benighted beliefs of the desert and became contaminated with the less advanced Canaanite religious practices. They became idolatrous and licentious, and their idea of <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> fell far below the Egyptian and Mesopotamian concepts of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> that were maintained by certain surviving <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> groups, and which are recorded in some of the <a href="/en/topic/Psalms">Psalms</a> and in the so-called Book of <a href="/en/topic/Job_(book)">Job</a>.</p>
<p id="p7_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/96#p7_2">96:7.2</a></small></sup>  The Psalms are the work of a score or more of authors; many were written by Egyptian and Mesopotamian teachers. During these times when the <a href="/en/topic/Levant">Levant</a> worshiped nature gods, there were still a goodly number who believed in the supremacy of <a href="/en/topic/El_Elyon">El Elyon</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Most_High">Most High</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s7_2_11"><a href="#fn_s7_2_11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p7_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/96#p7_3">96:7.3</a></small></sup>  No collection of religious writings gives expression to such a wealth of devotion and inspirational ideas of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> as the Book of <a href="/en/topic/Psalms">Psalms</a>. And it would be very helpful if, in the perusal of this wonderful collection of worshipful literature, consideration could be given to the source and chronology of each separate hymn of praise and adoration, bearing in mind that no other single collection covers such a great range of time. This Book of Psalms is the record of the varying concepts of God entertained by the believers of the <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> religion throughout the Levant and embraces the entire period from <a href="/en/topic/Amenemope">Amenemope</a> to <a href="/en/topic/Isaiah_(first)">Isaiah</a>. In the Psalms God is depicted in all phases of conception, from the crude idea of a tribal deity to the vastly expanded ideal of the later <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a>, wherein <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a> is pictured as a loving ruler and merciful Father.</p>
<p id="p7_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/96#p7_4">96:7.4</a></small></sup>  And when thus regarded, this group of Psalms constitutes the most valuable and helpful assortment of devotional sentiments ever assembled by man up to the times of the twentieth century. The worshipful spirit of this collection of hymns transcends that of all other sacred books of the world.</p>
<p id="p7_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/96#p7_5">96:7.5</a></small></sup>  The variegated picture of <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> presented in the Book of <a href="/en/topic/Job_(book)">Job</a> was the product of more than a score of Mesopotamian religious teachers extending over a period of almost three hundred years. And when you read the lofty concept of divinity found in this compilation of Mesopotamian beliefs, you will recognize that it was in the neighborhood of <a href="/en/topic/Ur">Ur</a> of Chaldea that the idea of a real <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> was best preserved during the dark days in <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a>.</p>
<p id="p7_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/96#p7_6">96:7.6</a></small></sup>  In Palestine the wisdom and all-pervasiveness of God was often grasped but seldom his love and mercy. The <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a> of these times “sends evil spirits to dominate the souls of his enemies”; he prospers his own and obedient children, while he curses and visits dire judgments upon all others<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b45"><a href="#fn_b45">[45]</a></sup>. “He disappoints the devices of the crafty; he takes the wise in their own deceit<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b46"><a href="#fn_b46">[46]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p7_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/96#p7_7">96:7.7</a></small></sup>  Only at <a href="/en/topic/Ur">Ur</a> did a voice arise to cry out the mercy of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, saying: “He shall pray to God and shall find favor with him and shall see his face with joy, for God will give to man divine <a href="/en/topic/righteousness">righteousness</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b47"><a href="#fn_b47">[47]</a></sup>.” Thus from Ur there is preached <a href="/en/topic/salvation">salvation</a>, divine favor, by faith: “He is gracious to the repentant and says, ‘Deliver him from going down in the pit, for I have found a ransom.’ If any say, ‘I have sinned and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not,’ God will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and he shall see the light<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b48"><a href="#fn_b48">[48]</a></sup>.” Not since the times of <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> had the Levantine world heard such a ringing and cheering message of human salvation as this extraordinary teaching of <a href="/en/topic/Elihu">Elihu</a>, the prophet of Ur and priest of the <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> believers, that is, the remnant of the onetime Melchizedek colony in <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b49"><a href="#fn_b49">[49]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p7_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/96#p7_8">96:7.8</a></small></sup>  And thus did the remnants of the Salem missionaries in Mesopotamia maintain the light of truth during the period of the disorganization of the Hebrew peoples until the appearance of <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> of that long line of the teachers of <a href="/en/topic/Israel">Israel</a> who never stopped as they built, concept upon concept, until they had achieved the realization of the ideal of the Universal and Creator Father of all, the acme of the evolution of the <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a> concept.</p>
