<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p0_1">137:0.1</a></small></sup>  EARLY on Saturday morning, February 23, A.D. 26, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> came down from the hills to rejoin John’s company encamped at <a href="/en/topic/Pella">Pella</a>. All that day Jesus mingled with the multitude. He ministered to a lad who had injured himself in a fall and journeyed to the near-by village of Pella to deliver the boy safely into the hands of his parents.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. CHOOSING THE FIRST FOUR APOSTLES </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p1_1">137:1.1</a></small></sup>  During this <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> two of John’s leading disciples spent much time with <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>. Of all John’s followers one named <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> was the most profoundly impressed with Jesus; he accompanied him on the trip to <a href="/en/topic/Pella">Pella</a> with the injured boy. On the way back to John’s rendezvous he asked Jesus many questions, and just before reaching their destination, the two paused for a short talk, during which Andrew said: “I have observed you ever since you came to <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>, and I believe you are the new Teacher, and though I do not understand all your teaching, I have fully made up my mind to follow you; I would sit at your feet and learn the whole truth about the new kingdom.” And Jesus, with hearty assurance, welcomed Andrew as <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> of his apostles, that group of twelve who were to labor with him in the work of establishing the new kingdom of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> in the hearts of men.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p1_2">137:1.2</a></small></sup>  Andrew was a silent <a href="/en/topic/Most_High_observer_of_Urantia">observer</a> of, and sincere believer in, John’s work, and he had a very able and enthusiastic brother, named <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a>, who was one of John’s foremost disciples. It would not be amiss to say that <a href="/en/topic/Simon_of_Cyrene">Simon</a> was one of John’s chief supporters.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p1_3">137:1.3</a></small></sup>  Soon after <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> returned to the camp, Andrew sought out his brother, Simon, and taking him aside, informed him that he had settled in his own mind that Jesus was the great Teacher, and that he had pledged himself as a disciple. He went on to say that Jesus had accepted his proffer of service and suggested that he (Simon) likewise go to Jesus and offer himself for fellowship in the service of the new kingdom. Said Simon: “Ever since this man came to work in <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a>’s shop, I have believed he was sent by <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, but what about John? Are we to forsake him? Is this the right thing to do?” Whereupon they agreed to go at once to consult John. John was saddened by the thought of losing two of his able advisers and most promising disciples, but he bravely answered their inquiries, saying: “This is but the beginning; presently will my work end, and we shall all become his disciples.” Then Andrew beckoned to Jesus to draw aside while he announced that his brother desired to join himself to the service of the new kingdom. And in welcoming Simon as his second apostle, Jesus said: “Simon, your <a href="/en/topic/enthusiasm">enthusiasm</a> is commendable, but it is dangerous to the work of the kingdom. I admonish you to become more thoughtful in your speech. I would change your name to <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p1_4">137:1.4</a></small></sup>  The parents of the injured lad who lived at <a href="/en/topic/Pella">Pella</a> had besought Jesus to spend the night with them, to make their house his home, and he had promised. Before leaving Andrew and his brother, Jesus said, “Early on the morrow we go into <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>.”</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p1_5">137:1.5</a></small></sup>  After <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had returned to Pella for the night, and while <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Simon_(boat)">Simon</a> were yet discussing the nature of their service in the establishment of the forthcoming kingdom, <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a> and John the sons of <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a> arrived upon the scene, having just returned from their long and futile searching in the hills for Jesus. When they heard <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Simon Peter</a> tell how he and his brother, Andrew, had become <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> accepted counselors of the new kingdom, and that they were to leave with their new <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> on the morrow for Galilee, both James and John were sad. They had known Jesus for some time, and they loved him. They had searched for him many days in the hills, and now they returned to learn that others had been preferred before them. They inquired where Jesus had gone and made haste to find him.</p>

<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p1_6">137:1.6</a></small></sup>  Jesus was asleep when they reached his abode, but they awakened him, saying: “How is it that, while we who have so long lived with you are searching in the hills for you, you prefer others before us and choose Andrew and Simon as your first associates in the new kingdom?” Jesus answered them, “Be calm in your hearts and ask yourselves, ‘who directed that you should search for the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> when he was about his <a href="/en/topic/Father’s_business">Father’s business</a>?’” After they had recited the details of their long search in the hills, Jesus further instructed them: “You should learn to search for the secret of the new kingdom in your hearts and not in the hills. That which you sought was already present in your souls. You are indeed my brethren—you needed not to be received by me—already were you of the kingdom, and you should be of good cheer, making ready also to go with us tomorrow into <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>.” John then made bold to ask, “But, Master, will James and I be associates with you in the new kingdom, even as Andrew and Simon?” And Jesus, laying a hand on the shoulder of each of them, said: “My brethren, you were already with me in the spirit of the kingdom, even before these others made request to be received. You, my brethren, have no need to make request for entrance into the kingdom; you have been with me in the kingdom from the beginning. Before men, others may take precedence over you, but in my heart did I also number you in the councils of the kingdom, even before you thought to make this request of me. And even so might you have been first before men had you not been absent engaged in a well-intentioned but self-appointed task of seeking for one who was not <a href="/en/topic/lost">lost</a>. In the coming kingdom, be not mindful of those things which foster your <a href="/en/topic/anxiety">anxiety</a> but rather at all times concern yourselves only with doing the will of the Father who is in heaven.”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_6_9"><a href="#fn_a1_6_9">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_6_16"><a href="#fn_a1_6_16">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_6_20"><a href="#fn_a1_6_20">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_6_24"><a href="#fn_a1_6_24">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_6_30"><a href="#fn_a1_6_30">[5]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_6_3"><a href="#fn_s1_6_3">[1]</a></sup></p>

And they made ready, with their two associate apostles, to depart for Galilee the next morning.

<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p1_8">137:1.8</a></small></sup>  Late that evening, James, John, Andrew, and Simon held converse with <a href="/en/topic/John_the_Baptist">John the Baptist</a>, and with tearful eye but steady voice the stalwart Judean prophet surrendered two of his leading disciples to become the apostles of the Galilean Prince of the coming kingdom.</p>

<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p2_2">137:2.2</a></small></sup>  That day, as Jesus and his four disciple-apostles departed for <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>, there was a great tumult in the camp of John’s followers<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>. The first great division was about to take place. The day before, John had made his positive pronouncement to <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Ezra_(Prophet)">Ezra</a> that Jesus was the <a href="/en/topic/Deliverer">Deliverer</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>. Andrew decided to follow Jesus, but <a href="/en/topic/Ezra_of_Nazareth">Ezra</a> rejected the mild-mannered carpenter of <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, proclaiming to his associates: “The Prophet <a href="/en/topic/Daniel">Daniel</a> declares that the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> will come with the clouds of heaven, in power and great glory. This Galilean carpenter, this <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a> boatbuilder, cannot be the Deliverer. Can such a gift of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> come out of Nazareth? This Jesus is a relative of John, and through much kindness of heart has our teacher been deceived. Let us remain aloof from this false <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>.” When John rebuked <a href="/en/topic/Ezra_of_Syracuse">Ezra</a> for these utterances, he drew away with many disciples and hastened south. And this group continued to baptize in John’s name and eventually founded a sect of those who believed in John but refused to accept Jesus. A remnant of this group persists in <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> even to this day.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p2_3">137:2.3</a></small></sup>  While this trouble was brewing among John’s followers, <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and his four disciple-apostles were well on their way toward Galilee. Before they crossed the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a>, to go by way of <a href="/en/topic/Nain">Nain</a> to Nazareth, Jesus, looking ahead and up the road, saw one <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a> of <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a> with a friend coming toward them. Jesus had known <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Tetrarch)">Philip</a> aforetime, and he was also well known to all four of the new apostles. He was on his way with his friend <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a> to visit John at <a href="/en/topic/Pella">Pella</a> to learn more about the reported coming of the kingdom of God, and he was delighted to greet Jesus.

But <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_the_Pharisee">Nathaniel</a>, who lived at <a href="/en/topic/Cana">Cana</a> of Galilee, did not know Jesus.

Philip was in a quandary. What should he do? Here, without a moment’s warning—on the roadside near the Jordan—there had come up for immediate <a href="/en/topic/decisions">decision</a> the most momentous question of a lifetime. By this time he was in earnest converse with <a href="/en/topic/Simon_Peter">Peter</a>, Andrew, and John while Jesus was outlining to James the trip through <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> and on to <a href="/en/topic/Capernaum">Capernaum</a>. Finally, Andrew suggested to Philip, “Why not ask the Teacher?”</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p2_5">137:2.5</a></small></sup>  It suddenly dawned on <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Apostle)">Philip</a> that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> was a really great man, possibly the <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a>, and he decided to abide by Jesus’ decision in this matter; and he went straight to him, asking, “Teacher, shall I go down to John or shall I join my friends who follow you?” And Jesus answered, “Follow me.” <a href="/en/topic/Philip_(Tetrarch)">Philip</a> was thrilled with the assurance that he had found the <a href="/en/topic/Deliverer">Deliverer</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_5_3"><a href="#fn_s2_5_3">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p4_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p4_4">137:4.4</a></small></sup>  Early in the afternoon <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> summoned <a href="/en/topic/James_(brother_of_Jesus)">James</a>, and together they made bold to approach Jesus to inquire if he would admit them to his confidence to the extent of informing them at what hour and at what point in connection with the wedding ceremonies he had planned to manifest himself as the “supernatural one.” No sooner had they spoken of these matters to Jesus than they saw they had aroused his characteristic indignation. He said only: “If you love me, then be willing to tarry with me while I wait upon the will of my Father who is in heaven.” But the eloquence of his rebuke lay in the expression of his face.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_4_11"><a href="#fn_a4_4_11">[9]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_4_3"><a href="#fn_s4_4_3">[1]</a></sup></p>

That was one of the very things he had decided not to do when so recently isolated in the hills. For several hours Mary was much depressed. She said to James: “I cannot understand him; what can it all mean? Is there no end to his strange conduct?” James and <a href="/en/topic/Jude">Jude</a> tried to comfort their mother, while Jesus withdrew for an hour’s solitude.

Then it was whispered about that the carpenter and boatbuilder, announced by John as “the <a href="/en/topic/Deliverer">Deliverer</a>,” would show his hand during the evening festivities, perhaps at the wedding supper. But all expectance of such a demonstration was effectually removed from the minds of his six disciple-apostles when he called them together just before the wedding supper and, in great earnestness, said: “Think not that I have come to this place to work some wonder for the gratification of the curious or for the conviction of those who doubt. Rather are we here to wait upon the will of our Father who is in heaven.” But when <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> and the others saw him in consultation with his associates, they were fully persuaded in their own minds that something extraordinary was about to happen.

As she stood there before him motionless, with the tears streaming down her face, the human heart of Jesus was overcome with compassion for the woman who had borne him in the flesh; and bending forward, he laid his hand tenderly upon her head, saying: “Now, now, Mother Mary, grieve not over my apparently hard sayings, for have I not many times told you that I have come only to do the will of my heavenly Father? Most gladly would I do what you ask of me if it were a part of the Father’s will—“ and Jesus stopped short, he hesitated. Mary seemed to sense that something was happening. Leaping up, she threw her arms around Jesus’ neck, kissed him, and rushed off to the servants’ quarters, saying, “Whatever my son says, that do.” But Jesus said nothing.

She did not know how the <a href="/en/topic/wine">wine</a> would be produced, but she confidently believed that she had finally persuaded her first-born son to assert his authority, to dare to step forth and claim his position and exhibit his Messianic power. And, because of the presence and association of certain universe powers and personalities, of which all those present were wholly ignorant, she was not to be disappointed. The wine <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Clopas)">Mary</a> desired and which Jesus, the God-man, humanly and sympathetically wished for, was forthcoming.</p>

<p id="p4_12"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p4_12">137:4.12</a></small></sup>  It was gradually dawning upon Jesus what had happened. Of all persons present at the marriage feast of <a href="/en/topic/Cana">Cana</a>, Jesus was the most surprised. Others had expected him to work a wonder, but that was just what he had purposed not to do. And then the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> recalled the admonition of his Personalized Thought Adjuster in the hills.

On this occasion <a href="/en/topic/power_transformers">power transformers</a>, <a href="/en/topic/midwayers">midwayers</a>, and all other required personalities were assembled near the water and other necessary elements, and in the face of the expressed wish of the Universe Creator Sovereign, there was no escaping the instantaneous appearance of <i><a href="/en/topic/wine">wine</a>.</i> And this occurrence was made doubly certain since the Personalized Adjuster had signified that the execution of the Son’s desire was in no way a contravention of the Father’s will.</p>
<p id="p4_13"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p4_13">137:4.13</a></small></sup>  But this was in no sense a miracle. No law of nature was modified, abrogated, or even transcended. Nothing happened but the abrogation of <i>time</i> in association with the celestial assembly of the chemical elements requisite for the elaboration of the wine. At Cana on this occasion the agents of the Creator made wine just as they do by the ordinary natural processes <i>except</i> that they did it independently of time and with the intervention of superhuman agencies in the matter of the space assembly of the necessary chemical ingredients.</p>
<p id="p4_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p4_14">137:4.14</a></small></sup>  Furthermore it was evident that the enactment of this so-called miracle was not contrary to the will of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Father, else it would not have transpired, since <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had already subjected himself in all things to the Father’s will.</p>

Jesus’ family and all his friends in <a href="/en/topic/Cana">Cana</a> were much distressed because he so suddenly left them, and <a href="/en/topic/Jude">Jude</a>, Jesus’ youngest brother, set out in search of him.

<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p5_2">137:5.2</a></small></sup>  After supper that evening, in this home of Zebedee and <a href="/en/topic/Salome_(wife_of_Zebedee)">Salome</a>, there was held one of the most important conferences of all Jesus’ earthly career. Only the six apostles were present at this meeting; Jude arrived as they were about to separate. These six chosen men had journeyed from Cana to Bethsaida with Jesus, walking, as it were, on air. They were alive with expectancy and thrilled with the thought of having been selected as close associates of the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>. But when Jesus set out to make clear to them who he was and what was to be his mission on earth and how it might possibly end, they were stunned. They could not grasp what he was telling them.

When Jesus perceived that they did not comprehend his message, when he saw that their ideas of the Jewish <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a> were so completely crystallized, he sent them to their rest while he walked and talked with his brother Jude. And before Jude took leave of Jesus, he said with much feeling: “My father-brother, I never have understood you.

In the long hours of that night of meditation Jesus came clearly to comprehend that he never would be able to make his followers see him in any other light than as the long-expected Messiah. At last he recognized that there was no way to launch his message of the kingdom except as the fulfillment of John’s prediction and as the one for whom the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> were looking. After all, though he was not the Davidic type of Messiah, he was truly the fulfillment of the prophetic utterances of the more spiritually minded of the olden seers.
