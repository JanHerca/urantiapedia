<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p0_1">150:0.1</a></small></sup>  ON SUNDAY evening, January 16, A.D. 29, <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a>, with the apostles of John, reached <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a> and went into joint conference with <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> and the apostles of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> the next day. Abner and his associates made their headquarters at <a href="/en/topic/Hebron">Hebron</a> and were in the habit of coming up to Bethsaida periodically for these conferences.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p0_2">150:0.2</a></small></sup>  Among the many matters considered by this joint conference was the practice of anointing the sick with certain forms of <a href="/en/topic/oil_(petroleum)">oil</a> in connection with prayers for <a href="/en/topic/healing">healing</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. Again did Jesus decline to participate in their discussions or to express himself regarding their conclusions. The apostles of John had always used the anointing <a href="/en/topic/oil_(vegetable)">oil</a> in their ministry to the sick and afflicted, and they sought to establish this as a uniform practice for both groups, but the apostles of Jesus refused to bind themselves by such a regulation.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p0_3">150:0.3</a></small></sup>  On Tuesday, January 18, the twenty-four were joined by the tested evangelists, about seventy-five in number, at the <a href="/en/topic/Zebedee">Zebedee</a> house in <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a> preparatory to being sent forth on the third preaching tour of <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a>. This third mission continued for a period of seven weeks.</p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p0_4">150:0.4</a></small></sup>  The evangelists were sent out in groups of five, while <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and the twelve traveled together most of the time, the apostles going out two and two to baptize believers as occasion required. For a period of almost three weeks <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a> and his associates also worked with the evangelistic groups, advising them and baptizing believers. They visited <a href="/en/topic/Magdala">Magdala</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Tiberias">Tiberias</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, and all the principal cities and villages of central and southern Galilee, all the places previously visited and many others.

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p1_1">150:1.1</a></small></sup>  Of all the daring things which <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> did in connection with his earth career, the most amazing was his sudden announcement on the evening of January 16: “On the morrow we will set apart ten women for the ministering work of the kingdom<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>.” At the beginning of the two weeks’ period during which the apostles and the evangelists were to be absent from <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a> on their furlough, Jesus requested <a href="/en/topic/David_(King)">David</a> to summon his parents back to their home and to dispatch <a href="/en/topic/messengers_(tertiary_supernaphim)">messengers</a> calling to Bethsaida ten devout women who had served in the administration of the former encampment and the tented infirmary. These women had all listened to the instruction given the young evangelists, but it had never occurred to either themselves or their teachers that Jesus would dare to commission women to teach the gospel of the kingdom and minister to the sick. These ten women selected and commissioned by Jesus were: <a href="/en/topic/Susanna_(daughter_of_Nazareth_chazan)">Susanna</a>, the daughter of the former chazan of the <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> synagogue; <a href="/en/topic/Joanna">Joanna</a>, the wife of <a href="/en/topic/Chuza">Chuza</a>, the steward of <a href="/en/topic/Herod_Antipas">Herod Antipas</a>; <a href="/en/topic/Elizabeth_of_Tiberias">Elizabeth</a>, the daughter of a wealthy Jew of <a href="/en/topic/Tiberias">Tiberias</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Sepphoris">Sepphoris</a>; <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(wife_of_Justus)">Martha</a>, the elder sister of <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a>; <a href="/en/topic/Rachel_(Old_Testament)">Rachel</a>, the sister-in-law of <a href="/en/topic/Jude">Jude</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s brother in the flesh; <a href="/en/topic/Nasanta">Nasanta</a>, the daughter of <a href="/en/topic/Elman">Elman</a>, the Syrian physician; <a href="/en/topic/Milcha">Milcha</a>, a cousin of the Apostle Thomas; <a href="/en/topic/Ruth_(Old_Testament)">Ruth</a>, the eldest daughter of <a href="/en/topic/Matthew_Levi">Matthew Levi</a>; <a href="/en/topic/Celta">Celta</a>, the daughter of a <a href="/en/topic/Roman_centurion_in_Corinth">Roman centurion</a>; and <a href="/en/topic/Agaman">Agaman</a>, a widow of <a href="/en/topic/Damascus">Damascus</a>. Subsequently, Jesus added two other women to this group—<a href="/en/topic/Mary_Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Rebecca_(daughter_of_Ezra)">Rebecca</a>, the daughter of <a href="/en/topic/Joseph_of_Arimathea">Joseph of Arimathea</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_1_8"><a href="#fn_a1_1_8">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_1_33"><a href="#fn_a1_1_33">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_1_35"><a href="#fn_a1_1_35">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_1_39"><a href="#fn_a1_1_39">[5]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_1_1"><a href="#fn_s1_1_1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_1_3"><a href="#fn_s1_1_3">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p1_2">150:1.2</a></small></sup>  Jesus authorized these women to effect their own organization and directed Judas to provide funds for their equipment and for pack animals. The ten elected Susanna as their chief and Joanna as their treasurer. From this time on they furnished their own funds; never again did they draw upon Judas for support<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_2_20"><a href="#fn_a1_2_20">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_2_37"><a href="#fn_a1_2_37">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p1_3">150:1.3</a></small></sup>  It was most astounding in that day, when <a href="/en/topic/women">women</a> were not even allowed on the main floor of the synagogue (being confined to the <a href="/en/topic/court_of_women">women’s gallery</a>), to behold them being recognized as authorized teachers of the new gospel of the kingdom. The charge which <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> gave these ten women as he set them apart for gospel teaching and ministry was the emancipation proclamation which set free all women and for all time; no more was man to look upon woman as his spiritual inferior. This was a decided shock to even the twelve apostles. Notwithstanding they had many times heard the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> say that “in the kingdom of heaven there is neither rich nor poor, free nor bond, male nor female, all are equally the sons and daughters of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>,” they were literally stunned when he proposed formally to commission these ten women as religious teachers and even to permit their traveling about with them<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>. The whole country was stirred up by this proceeding, the enemies of Jesus making great capital out of this move, but everywhere the women believers in the good news stood stanchly behind their chosen sisters and voiced no uncertain approval of this tardy acknowledgment of woman’s place in religious work. And this liberation of women, giving them due recognition, was practiced by the apostles immediately after the Master’s departure, albeit they fell back to the olden customs in subsequent generations. Throughout the early days of the Christian church women teachers and ministers were called <i><a href="/en/topic/deaconesses">deaconesses</a></i> and were accorded general recognition. But <a href="/en/topic/Paul">Paul</a>, despite the fact that he conceded all this in theory, never really incorporated it into his own attitude and personally found it difficult to carry out in practice<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_3_8"><a href="#fn_a1_3_8">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_3_33"><a href="#fn_a1_3_33">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_3_35"><a href="#fn_a1_3_35">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_3_1"><a href="#fn_a1_3_1">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_3_11"><a href="#fn_a1_3_11">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_3_25"><a href="#fn_a1_3_25">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_3_27"><a href="#fn_a1_3_27">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_3_28"><a href="#fn_a1_3_28">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_3_29"><a href="#fn_a1_3_29">[13]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p2_1">150:2.1</a></small></sup>  As the apostolic party journeyed from <a href="/en/topic/Bethsaida">Bethsaida</a>, the women traveled in the rear. During the conference time they always sat in a group in front and to the right of the speaker. Increasingly, women had become believers in the gospel of the kingdom, and it had been a source of much difficulty and no end of embarrassment when they had desired to hold personal converse with <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> or one of the apostles. Now all this was changed. When any of the women believers desired to see the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> or confer with the apostles, they went to <a href="/en/topic/Susanna_(daughter_of_Nazareth_chazan)">Susanna</a>, and in company with one of the twelve women evangelists, they would go at once into the presence of the Master or one of his apostles.</p>

<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p2_2">150:2.2</a></small></sup>  It was at <a href="/en/topic/Magdala">Magdala</a> that the <a href="/en/topic/women">women</a> first demonstrated their usefulness and vindicated the wisdom of their choosing. <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> had imposed rather strict rules upon his associates about doing personal work with women, especially with those of questionable character. When the party entered Magdala, these ten women evangelists were free to enter the evil resorts and preach the glad tidings directly to all their inmates. And when visiting the sick, these women were able to draw very close in their ministry to their afflicted sisters. As the result of the ministry of these ten women (afterward known as the twelve women) at this place, <a href="/en/topic/Mary_Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a> was won for the kingdom. Through a succession of misfortunes and in consequence of the attitude of reputable society toward women who commit such errors of judgment, this woman had found herself in one of the nefarious resorts of Magdala. It was <a href="/en/topic/Martha_(wife_of_Justus)">Martha</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Rachel_(Old_Testament)">Rachel</a> who made plain to <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Ezra)">Mary</a> that the doors of the kingdom were open to even such as she. <a href="/en/topic/Mary_(wife_of_Clopas)">Mary</a> believed the good news and was baptized by <a href="/en/topic/Peter">Peter</a> the next day.</p>

This meant, of course, that they could not be held in the new synagogue. The women selected <a href="/en/topic/Joanna">Joanna</a> to have charge of this occasion, and the meeting was held in the banquet room of Herod’s new palace, Herod being away in residence at <a href="/en/topic/Julias">Julias</a> in <a href="/en/topic/Perea">Perea</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup>.

<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p3_2">150:3.2</a></small></sup>  Late that evening Jesus gave the united group a memorable talk on “Magic and Superstition.” In those days the appearance of a bright and supposedly new star was regarded as a token indicating that a great man had been born on earth<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b9"><a href="#fn_b9">[9]</a></sup>.

<p id="p7_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p7_1">150:7.1</a></small></sup>  This <a href="/en/topic/Fridays">Friday</a> afternoon <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> walked about <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> quite unobserved and wholly unrecognized.

Not since the day of his baptism by John in the <a href="/en/topic/Jordan_River">Jordan</a> had the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a> had such a flood of human emotion stirred up within his soul. While coming down from the mount, he heard the familiar sounds of the trumpet blast announcing the going down of the sun, just as he had so many, many times heard it when a boy growing up in Nazareth. Before returning to the encampment, he walked down by the synagogue where he had gone to school and indulged his mind in many reminiscences of his childhood days. Earlier in the day Jesus had sent Thomas to arrange with the ruler of the synagogue for his preaching at the <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> morning service.</p>
<p id="p7_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p7_2">150:7.2</a></small></sup>  The people of Nazareth were never reputed for piety and righteous living.

But this was not all. His enemies, knowing that he was to spend this <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> day in <a href="/en/topic/Nazareth">Nazareth</a> and supposing that he would speak in the synagogue, had hired numerous rough and uncouth men to harass him and in every way possible make trouble.</p>

They failed to remember his early devotion to his father’s family, and they were bitter in their criticism of his neglect to visit his brother and his married sisters living in Nazareth. The attitude of Jesus’ family toward him had also tended to increase this unkind feeling of the citizenry. The orthodox among the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> even presumed to criticize Jesus because he walked too fast on the way to the synagogue this Sabbath morning.</p>

You taught them the statutes of life; have mercy upon us and teach us. Enlighten our eyes in the law; cause our hearts to cleave to your commandments; unite our hearts to love and fear your name, and we shall not be put to shame, world without end.

This ritual consisted in repeating numerous passages from the law and indicated that the worshipers took upon themselves the yoke of the kingdom of heaven, also the yoke of the commandments as applied to the day and the night.</p>
<p id="p8_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p8_5">150:8.5</a></small></sup>  And then followed the third prayer: “True it is that you are <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a>, our <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and the God of our fathers; our King and the King of our fathers; our Savior and the Savior of our fathers; our Creator and the rock of our salvation; our help and our <a href="/en/topic/Deliverer">deliverer</a>.

But on this occasion it was desirable to shorten the service in order that the distinguished guest might have more time for his discourse; accordingly, only <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> and last of the benedictions were recited. The first was: “Blessed is the Lord our God, and the God of our fathers, the God of <a href="/en/topic/Abraham_(Old_Testament)">Abraham</a>, and the God of <a href="/en/topic/Isaac_(Old_Testament)">Isaac</a>, and the God of <a href="/en/topic/Jacob_of_Crete">Jacob</a>; the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who shows mercy and kindness, who creates all things, who remembers the gracious promises to the fathers and brings a savior to their children’s children for his own name’s sake, in love. O King, helper, savior, and shield! Blessed are you, O Yahweh, the shield of Abraham.”</p>

And it is good in your eyes to bless Israel at all times and at every hour with peace. Blessed are you, <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a>, who blesses his people Israel with peace.” The congregation looked not at the ruler as he recited the benedictions. Following the benedictions he offered an informal prayer suitable for the occasion, and when this was concluded, all the congregation joined in saying amen.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a8_7_18"><a href="#fn_a8_7_18">[40]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a8_7_34"><a href="#fn_a8_7_34">[41]</a></sup></p>

It was customary to call upon seven persons to read not less than three verses of the law, but this practice was waived on this occasion that the visitor might read the lesson of his own selection.

<p id="p8_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p8_9">150:8.9</a></small></sup>  And when he had ceased reading from the law, he turned to <a href="/en/topic/Isaiah_(first)">Isaiah</a> and began to read: “The spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b35"><a href="#fn_b35">[35]</a></sup>.

Accordingly, on this <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> morning Jesus stepped down into the crowd which pressed forward to ask questions. In this group were many turbulent individuals whose minds were bent on mischief, while about the fringe of this crowd there circulated those debased men who had been hired to make trouble for Jesus. Many of the disciples and evangelists who had remained without now pressed into the synagogue and were not slow to recognize that trouble was brewing. They sought to lead the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> away, but he would not go with them.</p>
