<p id="p0_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/17#p0_11">17:0.11</a></small></sup>  The Seven Master Spirits are the co-ordinating directors of this far-flung administrative realm. In some matters pertaining to the administrative regulation of organized physical power, mind energy, and impersonal spirit ministry, they act personally and directly, and in others they function through their multifarious associates.

These executive spheres are under the direction of the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme_Executives">Supreme Executives</a>, a group of seven who were trinitized by the Father, Son, and Spirit in accordance with the specifications of the <a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirits,_Seven">Seven Master Spirits</a> for beings of a type that could function as their universal representatives.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_1_5"><a href="#fn_s1_1_5">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_1_8"><a href="#fn_s1_1_8">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_1_13"><a href="#fn_s1_1_13">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_1_10"><a href="#fn_s1_1_10">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_1_19"><a href="#fn_s1_1_19">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_1_18"><a href="#fn_s1_1_18">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/17#p1_2">17:1.2</a></small></sup>  The Master Spirits maintain contact with the various divisions of the superuniverse governments through these Supreme Executives. It is they who very largely determine the basic constitutive trends of the seven superuniverses. They are uniformly and divinely perfect, but they also possess diversity of personality. They have no presiding head; each time they meet together, they choose one of their number to preside over that joint council. Periodically they journey to Paradise to sit in council with the Seven Master Spirits.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/17#p1_3">17:1.3</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Seven_Supreme_Executives">Seven Supreme Executives</a> function as the administrative co-ordinators of the grand universe; they might be termed the board of managing directors of the post-Havona creation. They are not concerned with the internal affairs of <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a>, and they direct their limited spheres of <a href="/en/topic/Havona">Havona</a> activity through the <a href="/en/topic/Seven_Spirits_of_Havona_Circuits">Seven Spirits of the Circuits</a>. Otherwise there are few limits to the scope of their supervision; they engage in the direction of things physical, intellectual, and spiritual; they see all, hear all, feel all, even know all, that transpires in the seven superuniverses and in Havona.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/17#p1_4">17:1.4</a></small></sup>  These Supreme Executives do not originate policies, nor do they modify universe procedures; they are concerned with the execution of the plans of divinity promulgated by the Seven <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> Spirits. Neither do they interfere with the rule of the <a href="/en/topic/Ancients_of_Days">Ancients of Days</a> in the superuniverses nor with the sovereignty of the <a href="/en/topic/Creator_Sons">Creator Sons</a> in the local universes. They are the co-ordinating executives whose function it is to carry out the combined policies of all duly constituted rulers in the grand universe.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_4_2"><a href="#fn_s1_4_2">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/17#p1_5">17:1.5</a></small></sup>  Each of the executives and the facilities of his sphere are devoted to the efficient administration of a single superuniverse. <a href="/en/topic/Supreme">Supreme</a> Executive Number One, functioning on executive sphere number one, is wholly occupied with the affairs of superuniverse number one, and so on to Supreme Executive Number Seven, working from the seventh <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> satellite of the Spirit and devoting his energies to the management of the seventh superuniverse. The name of this seventh sphere is <a href="/en/topic/Orvonton_(superuniverse)">Orvonton</a>, for the Paradise satellites of the Spirit have the same names as their related superuniverses; in fact, the superuniverses were named after them.</p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/17#p1_6">17:1.6</a></small></sup>  On the executive sphere of the seventh superuniverse the staff engaged in keeping straight the affairs of Orvonton runs into numbers beyond human comprehension and embraces practically every order of celestial intelligence. All superuniverse services of personality dispatch (except <a href="/en/topic/Inspired_Trinity_Spirits">Inspired Trinity Spirits</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Thought_Adjusters">Thought Adjusters</a>) pass through one of these seven executive worlds on their universe journeys to and from Paradise, and here are maintained the central registries for all personalities created by the <a href="/en/topic/Third_Source_and_Center">Third Source and Center</a> who function in the superuniverses. The system of material, morontial, and spiritual records on one of these executive worlds of the Spirit amazes even a being of my order.</p>

In all matters affecting the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortals</a> of time, there is a secondary cabinet, consisting of <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> of Paradise attainment and of the trinitized sons of glorified mortals; this body is chosen by the perfecting and ascending beings who transiently dwell on the seven superuniverse headquarters.

<p id="p1_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/17#p1_10">17:1.10</a></small></sup>  Once in each Paradise millennium the <a href="/en/topic/Seven_Supreme_Executives">Seven Supreme Executives</a> vacate their seats of authority and go to Paradise, where they hold their millennial conclave of universal greeting and well-wishing to the intelligent hosts of creation. This eventful occasion takes place in the immediate presence of <a href="/en/topic/Majeston">Majeston</a>, the chief of all reflective spirit groups.

There are fifty of these unique and somewhat mysterious beings. Seven of these extraordinary personalities were created at a time, and each such creative episode was effected by a liaison of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise_Trinity">Paradise Trinity</a> and one of the <a href="/en/topic/Master_Spirits,_Seven">Seven Master Spirits</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_1_5"><a href="#fn_s2_1_5">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_1_8"><a href="#fn_s2_1_8">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_1_18"><a href="#fn_s2_1_18">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_1_1"><a href="#fn_s2_1_1">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_1_11"><a href="#fn_s2_1_11">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_1_16"><a href="#fn_s2_1_16">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/17#p2_2">17:2.2</a></small></sup>  This momentous transaction, occurring in the dawn of time, represents the initial effort of the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme">Supreme</a> Creator Personalities, represented by the Master Spirits, to function as cocreators with the Paradise Trinity. This union of the creative power of the <a href="/en/topic/Supreme_Creators">Supreme Creators</a> with the creative potentials of the Trinity is the very source of the actuality of the Supreme Being. Therefore, when the cycle of reflective creation had run its course, when each of the Seven Master Spirits had found perfect creative synchrony with the Paradise Trinity, when the forty-ninth Reflective Spirit had personalized, then a new and far-reaching reaction occurred in the <a href="/en/topic/Deity_Absolute">Deity Absolute</a> which imparted new personality prerogatives to the Supreme Being and culminated in the personalization of <a href="/en/topic/Majeston">Majeston</a>, the <a href="/en/topic/reflectivity">reflectivity</a> chief and Paradise center of all the work of the forty-nine Reflective Spirits and their associates throughout the universe of universes.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_2_0"><a href="#fn_a2_2_0">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_2_1"><a href="#fn_a2_2_1">[3]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_2_2"><a href="#fn_s2_2_2">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_2_8"><a href="#fn_s2_2_8">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_2_20"><a href="#fn_s2_2_20">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_2_15"><a href="#fn_s2_2_15">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s2_2_17"><a href="#fn_s2_2_17">[13]</a></sup></p>
