<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p0_1">160:0.1</a></small></sup>  ON SUNDAY morning, September 18, <a href="/en/topic/Andrew">Andrew</a> announced that no work would be planned for the coming week. All of the apostles, except <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a> and Thomas, went home to visit their families or to sojourn with friends. This week <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> enjoyed a period of almost complete rest, but <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_the_Pharisee">Nathaniel</a> and Thomas were very busy with their discussions with a certain <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greek</a> philosopher from <a href="/en/topic/Alexandria">Alexandria</a> named Rodan. This Greek had recently become a disciple of Jesus through the teaching of one of <a href="/en/topic/Abner">Abner</a>’s associates who had conducted a mission at Alexandria. Rodan was now earnestly engaged in the task of harmonizing his philosophy of life with Jesus’ new religious teachings, and he had come to Magadan hoping that the <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> would talk these problems over with him. He also desired to secure a firsthand and authoritative version of the gospel from either Jesus or one of his apostles. Though the Master declined to enter into such a conference with Rodan, he did receive him graciously and immediately directed that Nathaniel and Thomas should listen to all he had to say and tell him about the gospel in return.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_1_4"><a href="#fn_a0_1_4">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_1_84"><a href="#fn_a0_1_84">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_1">160:1.1</a></small></sup>  Early Monday morning, Rodan began a series of ten addresses to <a href="/en/topic/Nathaniel_(Apostle)">Nathaniel</a>, Thomas, and a group of some two dozen believers who chanced to be at Magadan. These talks, condensed, combined, and restated in modern phraseology, present the following thoughts for consideration:<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_1_66"><a href="#fn_a1_1_66">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_2">160:1.2</a></small></sup>  Human life consists in three great drives—urges, desires, and lures. Strong <a href="/en/topic/character">character</a>, commanding personality, is only acquired by converting the natural urge of life into the social art of living, by transforming present desires into those higher longings which are capable of lasting attainment, while the commonplace lure of existence must be transferred from one’s conventional and established ideas to the higher realms of unexplored ideas and undiscovered ideals.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_3">160:1.3</a></small></sup>  The more complex civilization becomes, the more difficult will become the art of living. The more rapid the changes in social usage, the more complicated will become the task of character development. Every ten generations mankind must learn anew the art of living if progress is to continue. And if man becomes so ingenious that he more rapidly adds to the complexities of society, the art of living will need to be remastered in less time, perhaps every single generation. If the evolution of the art of living fails to keep pace with the technique of existence, humanity will quickly revert to the simple urge of living—the attainment of the satisfaction of present desires. Thus will humanity remain immature; society will fail in growing up to full maturity.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_3_2"><a href="#fn_s1_3_2">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s1_3_11"><a href="#fn_s1_3_11">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_4">160:1.4</a></small></sup>  Social <a href="/en/topic/maturity">maturity</a> is equivalent to the degree to which man is willing to surrender the gratification of mere transient and present desires for the entertainment of those superior longings the striving for whose attainment affords the more abundant satisfactions of progressive advancement toward permanent goals. But the true badge of social maturity is the willingness of a people to surrender the right to live peaceably and contentedly under the ease-promoting standards of the lure of established beliefs and conventional ideas for the disquieting and energy-requiring lure of the pursuit of the unexplored possibilities of the attainment of undiscovered goals of idealistic spiritual realities.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_4_2"><a href="#fn_s1_4_2">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_5">160:1.5</a></small></sup>  Animals respond nobly to the urge of life, but only man can attain the art of living, albeit the majority of mankind only experience the <a href="/en/topic/animals">animal</a> urge to live. Animals know only this blind and instinctive urge; man is capable of transcending this urge to natural function. Man may elect to live upon the high plane of intelligent art, even that of celestial joy and spiritual ecstasy. Animals make no inquiry into the purposes of life; therefore they never worry, neither do they commit <a href="/en/topic/suicide">suicide</a>. Suicide among men testifies that such beings have emerged from the purely animal stage of existence, and to the further fact that the exploratory efforts of such human beings have failed to attain the artistic levels of mortal experience. Animals know not the meaning of life; man not only possesses capacity for the recognition of values and the comprehension of meanings, but he also is conscious of the meaning of meanings—he is self-conscious of <a href="/en/topic/insight">insight</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_5_36"><a href="#fn_a1_5_36">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_5_38"><a href="#fn_a1_5_38">[24]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_6">160:1.6</a></small></sup>  When men dare to forsake a life of natural craving for one of adventurous art and uncertain logic, they must expect to suffer the consequent hazards of emotional casualties—<a href="/en/topic/conflict">conflicts</a>, unhappiness, and uncertainties—at least until the time of their attainment of some degree of intellectual and emotional maturity. Discouragement, worry, and <a href="/en/topic/indolence">indolence</a> are positive evidence of moral <a href="/en/topic/immaturity">immaturity</a>. Human society is confronted with two problems: attainment of the maturity of the individual and attainment of the maturity of the race. The mature human being soon begins to look upon all other <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> with feelings of <a href="/en/topic/tenderness">tenderness</a> and with emotions of <a href="/en/topic/tolerance">tolerance</a>.

<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_7">160:1.7</a></small></sup>  Successful living is nothing more or less than the art of the mastery of dependable techniques for solving common problems. The first step in the solution of any problem is to locate the difficulty, to isolate the problem, and frankly to recognize its nature and gravity. The great mistake is that, when life problems excite our profound fears, we refuse to recognize them. Likewise, when the acknowledgment of our difficulties entails the reduction of our long-cherished conceit, the admission of <a href="/en/topic/envy">envy</a>, or the abandonment of deep-seated prejudices, the average person prefers to cling to the old <a href="/en/topic/illusions">illusions</a> of safety and to the long-cherished false feelings of security. Only a <a href="/en/topic/courage">brave</a> person is willing honestly to admit, and fearlessly to face, what a sincere and logical mind discovers.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_7_33"><a href="#fn_a1_7_33">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_7_44"><a href="#fn_a1_7_44">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_7_64"><a href="#fn_a1_7_64">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_7_9"><a href="#fn_a1_7_9">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_7_17"><a href="#fn_a1_7_17">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_7_38"><a href="#fn_a1_7_38">[24]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_7_2"><a href="#fn_s1_7_2">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_8">160:1.8</a></small></sup>  The wise and effective solution of any problem demands that the mind shall be free from bias, passion, and all other purely personal prejudices which might interfere with the disinterested survey of the actual factors that go to make up the problem presenting itself for solution. The solution of life problems requires courage and sincerity. Only honest and brave individuals are able to follow valiantly through the perplexing and confusing maze of living to where the logic of a fearless mind may lead. And this emancipation of the mind and soul can never be effected without the driving power of an intelligent enthusiasm which borders on religious zeal. It requires the lure of a great ideal to drive man on in the pursuit of a goal which is beset with difficult material problems and manifold intellectual hazards.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_8_93"><a href="#fn_a1_8_93">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_8_9"><a href="#fn_a1_8_9">[13]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_8_2"><a href="#fn_s1_8_2">[1]</a></sup></p>

You cannot hope for a large measure of success in either secular or religious work unless you can learn how to persuade your fellows, to prevail with men. You simply must have <a href="/en/topic/tact">tact</a> and <a href="/en/topic/tolerance">tolerance</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_9_33"><a href="#fn_a1_9_33">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_9_32"><a href="#fn_a1_9_32">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_9_49"><a href="#fn_a1_9_49">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_9_87"><a href="#fn_a1_9_87">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_9_38"><a href="#fn_a1_9_38">[24]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_9_67"><a href="#fn_a1_9_67">[28]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_9_2"><a href="#fn_s1_9_2">[1]</a></sup></p>

In this habit of Jesus’ going off so frequently by himself to commune with the Father in heaven is to be found the technique, not only of gathering strength and wisdom for the ordinary conflicts of living, but also of appropriating the energy for the solution of the higher problems of a moral and spiritual nature.

If you are unwise, you can bestow a devoted life upon your generation without material reward; if you are an accidental beneficiary of the flow of wealth, you may roll in luxury even though you have done nothing worth while for your fellow men.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_10_2"><a href="#fn_s4_10_2">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s4_10_12"><a href="#fn_s4_10_12">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p5_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p5_1">160:5.1</a></small></sup>  You have told me that your <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> regards genuine human <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> as the individual’s experience with spiritual realities. I have regarded religion as man’s experience of reacting to something which he regards as being worthy of the homage and devotion of all mankind. In this sense, religion symbolizes our supreme devotion to that which represents our highest concept of the ideals of reality and the farthest reach of our minds toward eternal possibilities of spiritual attainment.</p>
<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p5_2">160:5.2</a></small></sup>  When men react to religion in the tribal, national, or racial sense, it is because they look upon those without their group as not being truly human. We always look upon the object of our religious loyalty as being worthy of the reverence of all men. Religion can never be a matter of mere intellectual belief or philosophic reasoning; religion is always and forever a mode of reacting to the situations of life; it is a species of conduct. Religion embraces thinking, feeling, and acting reverently toward some reality which we deem worthy of universal adoration.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_2_11"><a href="#fn_a5_2_11">[89]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p5_3">160:5.3</a></small></sup>  If something has become a <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> in your experience, it is self-evident that you already have become an active evangel of that religion since you deem the supreme concept of your religion as being worthy of the worship of all mankind, all universe intelligences. If you are not a positive and missionary evangel of your religion, you are self-deceived in that what you call a religion is only a traditional belief or a mere system of intellectual philosophy. If your religion is a spiritual experience, your object of worship must be the universal spirit reality and ideal of all your spiritualized concepts. All religions based on fear, emotion, tradition, and philosophy I term the intellectual religions, while those based on true spirit experience I would term the true religions. The object of religious devotion may be material or spiritual, true or false, real or unreal, human or divine. Religions can therefore be either good or evil.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_3_15"><a href="#fn_a5_3_15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_3_3"><a href="#fn_a5_3_3">[36]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_3_0"><a href="#fn_a5_3_0">[81]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_3_7"><a href="#fn_a5_3_7">[90]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_3_20"><a href="#fn_a5_3_20">[91]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_3_21"><a href="#fn_a5_3_21">[92]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_3_22"><a href="#fn_a5_3_22">[93]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_3_39"><a href="#fn_a5_3_39">[94]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_3_56"><a href="#fn_a5_3_56">[95]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_3_58"><a href="#fn_a5_3_58">[96]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_3_59"><a href="#fn_a5_3_59">[97]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_3_73"><a href="#fn_a5_3_73">[98]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_3_74"><a href="#fn_a5_3_74">[99]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_3_75"><a href="#fn_a5_3_75">[100]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_3_76"><a href="#fn_a5_3_76">[101]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_3_77"><a href="#fn_a5_3_77">[102]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p5_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p5_4">160:5.4</a></small></sup>  Morality and religion are not necessarily the same. A system of morals, by grasping an object of worship, may become a religion. A religion, by losing its universal appeal to loyalty and supreme devotion, may evolve into a system of philosophy or a code of morals. This thing, being, state, or order of existence, or possibility of attainment which constitutes the supreme ideal of religious loyalty, and which is the recipient of the religious devotion of those who worship, is <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>.

<p id="p5_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p5_5">160:5.5</a></small></sup>  The social characteristics of a true <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> consist in the fact that it invariably seeks to convert the individual and to transform the world. Religion implies the existence of undiscovered <a href="/en/topic/ideals">ideals</a> which far transcend the known standards of ethics and morality embodied in even the highest social usages of the most mature institutions of civilization. Religion reaches out for undiscovered ideals, unexplored realities, superhuman values, divine wisdom, and true spirit attainment. True religion does all of this; all other beliefs are not worthy of the name. You cannot have a genuine spiritual religion without the supreme and supernal ideal of an eternal God. A religion without this God is an invention of man, a human institution of lifeless intellectual beliefs and meaningless emotional ceremonies. A religion might claim as the object of its devotion a great ideal. But such ideals of unreality are not attainable; such a concept is illusionary. The only ideals susceptible of human attainment are the divine realities of the infinite values resident in the spiritual fact of the eternal God.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a5_5_25"><a href="#fn_a5_5_25">[103]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_5_37"><a href="#fn_a5_5_37">[104]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5_5_99"><a href="#fn_a5_5_99">[105]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s5_5_8"><a href="#fn_s5_5_8">[13]</a></sup></p>

That, I submit, is the highest concept of religion the world has ever known, and I pronounce that there can never be a higher since this gospel embraces the infinity of realities, the divinity of values, and the eternity of universal attainments.
