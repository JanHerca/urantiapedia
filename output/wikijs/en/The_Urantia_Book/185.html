The <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a> was taken into the presence of the Roman governor by the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple_guards">temple guards</a>, bound, and was accompanied by about fifty of his accusers, including the Sanhedrist court (principally Sadduceans), <a href="/en/topic/Judas_Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>, and the high priest, <a href="/en/topic/Caiaphas">Caiaphas</a>, and by the Apostle John. <a href="/en/topic/Annas">Annas</a> did not appear before Pilate.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_1_8"><a href="#fn_a0_1_8">[1]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s0_1_2"><a href="#fn_s0_1_2">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p0_2">185:0.2</a></small></sup>  Pilate was up and ready to receive this group of early morning callers, having been informed by those who had secured his consent, the previous evening, to employ the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_soldiers_in_Jerusalem">Roman soldiers</a> in arresting the <a href="/en/topic/Son_of_Man">Son of Man</a>, that Jesus would be early brought before him. This trial was arranged to take place in front of the <a href="/en/topic/praetorium">praetorium</a>, an addition to the fortress of <a href="/en/topic/Antonia_(fortress)">Antonia</a>, where Pilate and <a href="/en/topic/Claudia_Procula">his wife</a> made their headquarters when stopping in <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p0_3">185:0.3</a></small></sup>  Though Pilate conducted much of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ examination within the praetorium halls, the public trial was held outside on the steps leading up to the main entrance<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. This was a concession to the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>, who refused to enter any gentile building where leaven might be used on this day of preparation for the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a>. Such conduct would not only render them ceremonially unclean and thereby debar them from partaking of the afternoon feast of thanksgiving but would also necessitate their subjection to purification <a href="/en/topic/ceremonies">ceremonies</a> after sundown, before they would be eligible to partake of the Passover supper.</p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p0_4">185:0.4</a></small></sup>  Although these Jews were not at all bothered in conscience as they intrigued to effect the judicial murder of Jesus, they were nonetheless scrupulous regarding all these matters of ceremonial cleanness and traditional regularity. And these Jews have not been the only ones to fail in the recognition of high and holy <a href="/en/topic/duty">obligations</a> of a divine nature while giving meticulous attention to things of trifling importance to human welfare in both time and eternity.</p>
<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. PONTIUS PILATE </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_1">185:1.1</a></small></sup>  If <a href="/en/topic/Pontius_Pilate">Pontius Pilate</a> had not been a reasonably good governor of the minor provinces, <a href="/en/topic/Tiberius">Tiberius</a> would hardly have suffered him to remain as procurator of <a href="/en/topic/Judea">Judea</a> for ten years. Although he was a fairly good administrator, he was a moral coward. He was not a big enough man to comprehend the nature of his task as governor of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>. He failed to grasp the fact that these <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a> had a <i>real</i> religion, a faith for which they were willing to die, and that millions upon millions of them, scattered here and there throughout the empire, looked to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> as the shrine of their faith and held the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> in respect as the highest tribunal on earth.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_1_6"><a href="#fn_a1_1_6">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_2">185:1.2</a></small></sup>  Pilate did not love the Jews, and this deep-seated hatred early began to manifest itself. Of all the Roman provinces, none was more difficult to govern than Judea. Pilate never really understood the problems involved in the management of the Jews and, therefore, very early in his experience as governor, made a series of almost fatal and well-nigh suicidal blunders. And it was these blunders that gave the Jews such power over him. When they wanted to influence his decisions, all they had to do was to threaten an uprising, and Pilate would speedily capitulate. And this apparent vacillation, or lack of moral courage, of the procurator was chiefly due to the memory of a number of controversies he had had with the Jews and because in each instance they had worsted him. The Jews knew that Pilate was afraid of them, that he feared for his position before Tiberius, and they employed this knowledge to the great disadvantage of the governor on numerous occasions.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_3">185:1.3</a></small></sup>  Pilate’s disfavor with the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> came about as a result of a number of unfortunate encounters. First, he failed to take seriously their deep-seated prejudice against all <a href="/en/topic/images">images</a> as symbols of idol worship. Therefore he permitted his soldiers to enter <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> without removing the images of Caesar from their banners, as had been the practice of the <a href="/en/topic/Roman_soldiers_in_Jerusalem">Roman soldiers</a> under his predecessor. A large deputation of <a href="/en/topic/Jews_(ancient_Hebrews)">Jews</a> waited upon Pilate for five days, imploring him to have these images removed from the military standards. He flatly refused to grant their petition and threatened them with instant death. Pilate, himself being a skeptic, did not understand that men of strong religious feelings will not hesitate to die for their religious convictions; and therefore was he dismayed when these Jews drew themselves up defiantly before his palace, bowed their faces to the ground, and sent word that they were ready to die. Pilate then realized that he had made a threat which he was unwilling to carry out. He surrendered, ordered the images removed from the standards of his soldiers in Jerusalem, and found himself from that day on to a large extent subject to the whims of the Jewish leaders, who had in this way discovered his weakness in making threats which he feared to execute.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_3_6"><a href="#fn_a1_3_6">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_4">185:1.4</a></small></sup>  Pilate subsequently determined to regain this lost prestige and accordingly had the shields of the emperor, such as were commonly used in Caesar worship, put up on the walls of Herod’s palace in Jerusalem. When the Jews protested, he was adamant. When he refused to listen to their protests, they promptly appealed to <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a>, and the emperor as promptly ordered the offending shields removed. And then was Pilate held in even lower esteem than before.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_5">185:1.5</a></small></sup>  Another thing which brought him into great disfavor with the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> was that he dared to take money from the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> treasury to pay for the construction of a new aqueduct to provide increased water supply for the millions of visitors to <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> at the times of the great religious feasts. The <a href="/en/topic/Jews_(ancient_Hebrews)">Jews</a> held that only the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> could disburse the temple funds, and they never ceased to inveigh against Pilate for this presumptuous ruling. No less than a score of riots and much bloodshed resulted from this decision. The last of these serious outbreaks had to do with the slaughter of a large company of Galileans even as they worshiped at the altar.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_5_6"><a href="#fn_a1_5_6">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_6">185:1.6</a></small></sup>  It is significant that, while this vacillating Roman ruler sacrificed <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> to his fear of the Jews and to safeguard his personal position, he finally was deposed as a result of the needless slaughter of <a href="/en/topic/Samaritans">Samaritans</a> in connection with the pretensions of a false <a href="/en/topic/Messiah">Messiah</a> who led troops to <a href="/en/topic/Mount_Gerizim">Mount Gerizim</a>, where he claimed the temple vessels were buried; and fierce riots broke out when he failed to reveal the hiding place of the sacred vessels, as he had promised. As a result of this episode, the legatus of <a href="/en/topic/Syria">Syria</a> ordered Pilate to <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a>. <a href="/en/topic/Tiberius">Tiberius</a> died while Pilate was on the way to Rome, and he was not reappointed as procurator of <a href="/en/topic/Judea">Judea</a>. He never fully recovered from the regretful condemnation of having consented to the crucifixion of Jesus. Finding no favor in the eyes of the new emperor, he retired to the province of <a href="/en/topic/Lausanne">Lausanne</a>, where he subsequently committed <a href="/en/topic/suicide">suicide</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_6_6"><a href="#fn_a1_6_6">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_7">185:1.7</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Claudia_Procula">Claudia Procula</a>, Pilate’s wife, had heard much of Jesus through the word of her maid-in-waiting, who was a Phoenician believer in the gospel of the kingdom. After the death of Pilate, Claudia became prominently identified with the spread of the good news.</p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_8">185:1.8</a></small></sup>  And all this explains much that transpired on this tragic <a href="/en/topic/Fridays">Friday</a> forenoon. It is easy to understand why the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> presumed to dictate to Pilate—to get him up at six o’clock to try <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>—and also why they did not hesitate to threaten to charge him with treason before the emperor if he dared to refuse their demands for Jesus’ death.</p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_9">185:1.9</a></small></sup>  A worthy Roman governor who had not become disadvantageously involved with the rulers of the Jews would never have permitted these bloodthirsty religious fanatics to bring about the death of a man whom he himself had declared to be innocent of their false charges and without fault. <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a> made a great blunder, a far-reaching error in earthly affairs, when she sent the second-rate Pilate to govern <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a>. <a href="/en/topic/Tiberius">Tiberius</a> had better have sent to the Jews the best provincial administrator in the empire.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. JESUS APPEARS BEFORE PILATE </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p2_1">185:2.1</a></small></sup>  When <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and his accusers had gathered in front of Pilate’s judgment hall, the Roman governor came out and, addressing the company assembled, asked, “What accusation do you bring against this fellow?” The <a href="/en/topic/Sadducees">Sadducees</a> and councilors who had taken it upon themselves to put Jesus out of the way had determined to go before Pilate and ask for confirmation of the death sentence pronounced upon Jesus, without volunteering any definite charge<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>. Therefore did the spokesman for the Sanhedrist court answer Pilate: “If this man were not an evildoer, we should not have delivered him up to you.”</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p2_2">185:2.2</a></small></sup>  When Pilate observed that they were reluctant to state their charges against Jesus, although he knew they had been all night engaged in deliberations regarding his guilt, he answered them: “Since you have not agreed on any definite charges, why do you not take this man and pass judgment on him in accordance with your own laws?”<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p2_3">185:2.3</a></small></sup>  Then spoke the clerk of the <a href="/en/topic/Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> court to Pilate: “It is not lawful for us to put any man to death, and this disturber of our nation is worthy to die for the things which he has said and done. Therefore have we come before you for confirmation of this decree<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>.”</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p2_4">185:2.4</a></small></sup>  To come before the Roman governor with this attempt at evasion discloses both the ill-will and the ill-humor of the Sanhedrists toward <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> as well as their lack of respect for the fairness, honor, and dignity of Pilate. What effrontery for these subject citizens to appear before their provincial governor asking for a decree of execution against a man before affording him a fair trial and without even preferring definite criminal charges against him!</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p2_5">185:2.5</a></small></sup>  Pilate knew something of Jesus’ work among the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>, and he surmised that the charges which might be brought against him had to do with infringements of the Jewish ecclesiastical laws; therefore he sought to refer the case back to their own tribunal. Again, Pilate took delight in making them publicly confess that they were powerless to pronounce and execute the death sentence upon even one of their own race whom they had come to despise with a bitter and envious hatred.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p2_6">185:2.6</a></small></sup>  It was a few hours previously, shortly before midnight and after he had granted permission to use <a href="/en/topic/Roman_soldiers_in_Jerusalem">Roman soldiers</a> in effecting the secret arrest of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, that Pilate had heard further concerning Jesus and his teaching from <a href="/en/topic/Claudia_Procula">his wife</a>, Claudia, who was a partial convert to <a href="/en/topic/Judaism">Judaism</a>, and who later on became a full-fledged believer in Jesus’ gospel.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_6_9"><a href="#fn_a2_6_9">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p2_7">185:2.7</a></small></sup>  Pilate would have liked to postpone this hearing, but he saw the Jewish leaders were determined to proceed with the case. He knew that this was not only the forenoon of preparation for the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a>, but that this day, being <a href="/en/topic/Fridays">Friday</a>, was also the preparation day for the Jewish <a href="/en/topic/Sabbath">Sabbath</a> of rest and worship.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p2_8">185:2.8</a></small></sup>  Pilate, being keenly sensitive to the disrespectful manner of the approach of these <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a>, was not willing to comply with their demands that <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> be sentenced to death without a trial. When, therefore, he had waited a few moments for them to present their charges against the prisoner, he turned to them and said: “I will not sentence this man to death without a trial; neither will I consent to examine him until you have presented your charges against him in writing.”</p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p2_9">185:2.9</a></small></sup>  When the high priest and the others heard Pilate say this, they signaled to the clerk of the court, who then handed to Pilate the written charges against Jesus. And these charges were:</p>
<p id="p2_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p2_10">185:2.10</a></small></sup>  “We find in the Sanhedrist tribunal that this man is an evildoer and a disturber of our nation in that he is guilty of:<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_10_2"><a href="#fn_a2_10_2">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p2_14"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p2_14">185:2.14</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> had not been regularly tried nor legally convicted on any of these charges. He did not even hear these charges when first stated, but Pilate had him brought from the praetorium, where he was in the keeping of the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple_guards">guards</a>, and he insisted that these charges be repeated in Jesus’ hearing.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_14_2"><a href="#fn_a2_14_2">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_15"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p2_15">185:2.15</a></small></sup>  When Jesus heard these accusations, he well knew that he had not been heard on these matters before the Jewish court, and so did <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John Zebedee</a> and his accusers, but he made no reply to their false charges. Even when Pilate bade him answer his accusers, he opened not his mouth. Pilate was so astonished at the unfairness of the whole proceeding and so impressed by Jesus’ silent and masterly bearing that he decided to take the prisoner inside the hall and examine him privately.</p>
<p id="p2_16"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p2_16">185:2.16</a></small></sup>  Pilate was confused in mind, fearful of the <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> in his heart, and mightily stirred in his spirit by the spectacle of <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>’ standing there in majesty before his bloodthirsty accusers and gazing down on them, not in silent contempt, but with an expression of genuine pity and sorrowful affection.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. THE PRIVATE EXAMINATION BY PILATE </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p3_1">185:3.1</a></small></sup>  Pilate took <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> and <a href="/en/topic/John_Zebedee">John Zebedee</a> into a private chamber, leaving the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple_guards">guards</a> outside in the hall, and requesting the prisoner to sit down, he sat down by his side and asked several questions<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>. Pilate began his talk with Jesus by assuring him that he did not believe <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> count against him: that he was a perverter of the nation and an inciter to rebellion. Then he asked, “Did you ever teach that tribute should be refused Caesar?” Jesus, pointing to John, said, “Ask him or any other man who has heard my teaching<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b7"><a href="#fn_b7">[7]</a></sup>.” Then Pilate questioned John about this matter of tribute, and John testified concerning his <a href="/en/topic/Master">Master</a>’s teaching and explained that Jesus and his apostles paid taxes both to Caesar and to the <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a>. When Pilate had questioned John, he said, “See that you tell no man that I talked with you.” And John never did reveal this matter.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_1_0"><a href="#fn_s3_1_0">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p3_2">185:3.2</a></small></sup>  Pilate then turned around to question Jesus further, saying: “And now about the third accusation against you, are you the <a href="/en/topic/king_of_the_Jews">king of the Jews</a>?” Since there was a tone of possibly sincere inquiry in Pilate’s voice, Jesus smiled on the procurator and said: “Pilate, do you ask this for yourself, or do you take this question from these others, my accusers?” Whereupon, in a tone of partial indignation, the governor answered: “Am I a Jew? Your own people and the chief priests delivered you up and asked me to sentence you to death<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b8"><a href="#fn_b8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b9"><a href="#fn_b9">[9]</a></sup>.

Pilate thought he understood something of what Jesus meant when he called himself a king, for he was familiar with the teachings of the Stoics, who declared that “the wise man is king.” Pilate was thoroughly convinced that, instead of being a dangerous seditionmonger, Jesus was nothing more or less than a harmless visionary, an innocent fanatic.</p>

<p id="p5_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p5_2">185:5.2</a></small></sup>  Just as the Jews were about to engage in shouting their protests against the release of Jesus, a vast crowd came marching up to the praetorium for the purpose of asking Pilate for the release of a prisoner in honor of the <a href="/en/topic/Passover">Passover</a> feast<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b23"><a href="#fn_b23">[23]</a></sup>. For some time it had been the custom of the Roman governors to allow the populace to choose some imprisoned or condemned man for pardon at the time of the Passover. And now that this crowd had come before him to ask for the release of a prisoner, and since Jesus had so recently been in great favor with the multitudes, it occurred to Pilate that he might possibly extricate himself from his predicament by proposing to this group that, since Jesus was now a prisoner before his judgment seat, he release to them this man of <a href="/en/topic/Galilee">Galilee</a> as the token of Passover good will<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b24"><a href="#fn_b24">[24]</a></sup>.</p>
