<p id="p0_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p0_1">111:0.1</a></small></sup>  THE presence of the divine Adjuster in the human <a href="/en/topic/mind">mind</a> makes it forever impossible for either science or philosophy to attain a satisfactory comprehension of the evolving <a href="/en/topic/soul">soul</a> of the human personality. The morontia soul is the child of the universe and may be really known only through cosmic insight and spiritual discovery.</p>
<p id="p0_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p0_2">111:0.2</a></small></sup>  The concept of a soul and of an indwelling spirit is not new to <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>; it has frequently appeared in the various systems of planetary beliefs. Many of the Oriental as well as some of the Occidental faiths have perceived that man is divine in heritage as well as human in inheritance. The feeling of the inner presence in addition to the external omnipresence of <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a> has long formed a part of many Urantian religions. Men have long believed that there is something growing within the human nature, something vital that is destined to endure beyond the short span of temporal life.</p>
<p id="p0_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p0_3">111:0.3</a></small></sup>  Before man realized that his evolving <a href="/en/topic/soul">soul</a> was fathered by a divine spirit, it was thought to reside in different physical <a href="/en/topic/organs">organs</a>—the eye, liver, kidney, heart, and later, the brain. The savage associated the soul with blood, breath, shadows and with reflections of the self in water.</p>
<p id="p0_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p0_4">111:0.4</a></small></sup>  In the conception of the <i><a href="/en/topic/atman">atman</a></i> the Hindu teachers really approximated an appreciation of the nature and presence of the Adjuster, but they failed to distinguish the copresence of the evolving and potentially immortal soul. The <a href="/en/topic/Chinese">Chinese</a>, however, recognized two aspects of a human being, the <i>yang</i> and the <i>yin,</i> the soul and the spirit. The Egyptians and many African tribes also believed in two factors, the <i><a href="/en/topic/ka_and_ba">ka</a></i> and the <i>ba;</i> the soul was not usually believed to be pre-existent, only the spirit.</p>
<p id="p0_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p0_5">111:0.5</a></small></sup>  The inhabitants of the <a href="/en/topic/Nile_valley">Nile valley</a> believed that each favored individual had bestowed upon him at birth, or soon thereafter, a protecting spirit which they called the ka. They taught that this guardian spirit remained with the mortal subject throughout life and passed before him into the future estate. On the walls of a <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> at <a href="/en/topic/Luxor">Luxor</a>, where is depicted the birth of <a href="/en/topic/Amenhotep_III">Amenhotep III</a>, the little prince is pictured on the arm of the <a href="/en/topic/Nile_god">Nile god</a>, and near him is another child, in appearance identical with the prince, which is a symbol of that entity which the Egyptians called the ka. This sculpture was completed in the fifteenth century before <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a>.</p>
<p id="p0_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p0_6">111:0.6</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/ka_and_ba">ka</a> was thought to be a superior spirit genius which desired to guide the associated mortal <a href="/en/topic/soul">soul</a> into the better paths of temporal living but more especially to influence the fortunes of the human subject in the hereafter. When an Egyptian of this period died, it was expected that his ka would be waiting for him on the other side of the <a href="/en/topic/Great_River">Great River</a>. At first, only kings were supposed to have kas, but presently all righteous men were believed to possess them. One Egyptian ruler, speaking of the ka within his heart, said: “I did not disregard its speech; I feared to transgress its guidance. I prospered thereby greatly; I was thus successful by reason of that which it caused me to do; I was distinguished by its guidance.” Many believed that the ka was “an oracle from <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> in everybody.” Many believed that they were to “spend eternity in gladness of heart in the favor of the God that is in you.”</p>
<p id="p0_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p0_7">111:0.7</a></small></sup>  Every race of evolving <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> <a href="/en/topic/mortals">mortals</a> has a word equivalent to the concept of soul. Many primitive peoples believed the soul looked out upon the world through human <a href="/en/topic/eyes">eyes</a>; therefore did they so cravenly fear the malevolence of the <a href="/en/topic/evil_eye">evil eye</a>. They have long believed that “the spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord.” The <a href="/en/topic/Rig-Veda">Rig-Veda</a> says: “My <a href="/en/topic/mind">mind</a> speaks to my heart.”</p>

<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_1">111:1.1</a></small></sup>  Though the work of Adjusters is spiritual in nature, they must, perforce, do all their work upon an intellectual foundation. Mind is the human soil from which the spirit Monitor must evolve the morontia <a href="/en/topic/soul">soul</a> with the co-operation of the indwelt personality.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_2">111:1.2</a></small></sup>  There is a cosmic unity in the several <a href="/en/topic/mind">mind</a> levels of the universe of universes. Intellectual selves have their origin in the <a href="/en/topic/cosmic_mind">cosmic mind</a> much as nebulae take origin in the cosmic energies of universe space. On the human (hence personal) level of intellectual selves the potential of spirit evolution becomes dominant, with the assent of the <a href="/en/topic/mortal_mind">mortal mind</a>, because of the spiritual endowments of the human personality together with the creative presence of an entity-point of absolute value in such human selves. But such a spirit dominance of the material mind is conditioned upon two experiences: This mind must have evolved up through the ministry of the seven <a href="/en/topic/adjutant_mind-spirits">adjutant mind-spirits</a>, and the material (personal) self must choose to co-operate with the indwelling Adjuster in creating and fostering the morontia self, the evolutionary and potentially immortal soul.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1"><a href="#fn_a1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_3">111:1.3</a></small></sup>  Material mind is the arena in which human personalities live, are self-conscious, make decisions, choose <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> or forsake him, eternalize or destroy themselves.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2"><a href="#fn_a2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3"><a href="#fn_a3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_4">111:1.4</a></small></sup>  Material evolution has provided you a life machine, your body; the Father himself has endowed you with the purest spirit reality known in the universe, your Thought Adjuster. But into your hands, subject to your own decisions, has been given <a href="/en/topic/mind">mind</a>, and it is by mind that you live or die. It is within this mind and with this mind that you make those moral decisions which enable you to achieve Adjusterlikeness, and that is <a href="/en/topic/Godlikeness">Godlikeness</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_5">111:1.5</a></small></sup>  Mortal mind is a temporary intellect system loaned to human beings for use during a material lifetime, and as they use this mind, they are either accepting or rejecting the potential of eternal existence. Mind is about all you have of universe reality that is subject to your will, and the <a href="/en/topic/soul">soul</a>—the morontia self—will faithfully portray the harvest of the temporal decisions which the mortal self is making. Human <a href="/en/topic/consciousness">consciousness</a> rests gently upon the electrochemical mechanism below and delicately touches the spirit-morontia energy system above. Of neither of these two systems is the human being ever completely conscious in his mortal life; therefore must he work in mind, of which he is conscious. And it is not so much what mind comprehends as what mind desires to comprehend that insures <a href="/en/topic/survival_(of_mortal_death)">survival</a>; it is not so much what mind is like as what mind is striving to be like that constitutes spirit identification. It is not so much that man is conscious of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> as that man yearns for God that results in universe ascension. What you are today is not so important as what you are becoming day by day and in eternity.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4"><a href="#fn_a4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a5"><a href="#fn_a5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a6"><a href="#fn_a6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7"><a href="#fn_a7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a8"><a href="#fn_a8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_6">111:1.6</a></small></sup>  Mind is the cosmic instrument on which the human will can play the discords of destruction, or upon which this same human will can bring forth the exquisite melodies of God identification and consequent eternal survival. The Adjuster bestowed upon man is, in <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> analysis, impervious to evil and incapable of sin, but <a href="/en/topic/mortal_mind">mortal mind</a> can actually be twisted, distorted, and rendered evil and ugly by the sinful machinations of a perverse and self-seeking human will. Likewise can this <a href="/en/topic/mind">mind</a> be made noble, beautiful, true, and good—actually great—in accordance with the spirit-illuminated will of a God-knowing human being.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a9"><a href="#fn_a9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_7">111:1.7</a></small></sup>  Evolutionary mind is only fully stable and dependable when manifesting itself upon the two extremes of cosmic intellectuality—the wholly mechanized and the entirely spiritualized. Between the intellectual extremes of pure mechanical control and true spirit nature there intervenes that enormous group of evolving and ascending minds whose stability and tranquillity are dependent upon personality choice and spirit identification.</p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_8">111:1.8</a></small></sup>  But man does not passively, slavishly, surrender his will to the Adjuster. Rather does he actively, positively, and co-operatively choose to follow the Adjuster’s leading when and as such leading consciously differs from the desires and impulses of the natural <a href="/en/topic/mortal_mind">mortal mind</a>. The Adjusters manipulate but never dominate man’s <a href="/en/topic/mind">mind</a> against his will; to the Adjusters the human will is supreme. And they so regard and respect it while they strive to achieve the spiritual goals of thought adjustment and character transformation in the almost limitless arena of the evolving human intellect.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a10"><a href="#fn_a10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a11"><a href="#fn_a11">[11]</a></sup></p>

The master of the mortal vessel should have the wisdom to trust the divine pilot to guide the ascending <a href="/en/topic/soul">soul</a> into the morontia harbors of eternal <a href="/en/topic/survival_(of_mortal_death)">survival</a>. Only by <a href="/en/topic/selfishness">selfishness</a>, slothfulness, and sinfulness can the will of man reject the guidance of such a loving pilot and eventually wreck the mortal career upon the evil shoals of rejected mercy and upon the rocks of embraced <a href="/en/topic/sin">sin</a>.

<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p2_1">111:2.1</a></small></sup>  Throughout the <a href="/en/topic/mind">mind</a> functions of cosmic intelligence, the totality of mind is dominant over the parts of intellectual function. Mind, in its essence, is functional unity; therefore does mind never fail to manifest this constitutive unity, even when hampered and hindered by the unwise actions and choices of a misguided self. And this unity of mind invariably seeks for spirit co-ordination on all levels of its association with selves of will dignity and ascension prerogatives.</p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p2_2">111:2.2</a></small></sup>  The material mind of mortal man is the cosmic loom that carries the morontia fabrics on which the indwelling Thought Adjuster threads the spirit patterns of a universe character of enduring values and divine meanings—a surviving <a href="/en/topic/soul">soul</a> of ultimate destiny and unending career, a potential <a href="/en/topic/finaliters">finaliter</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a13"><a href="#fn_a13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p2_3">111:2.3</a></small></sup>  The human personality is identified with <a href="/en/topic/mind">mind</a> and spirit held together in functional relationship by life in a material body. This functioning relationship of such mind and spirit does not result in some combination of the qualities or attributes of mind and spirit but rather in an entirely new, original, and unique universe value of potentially eternal endurance, the <i>soul.</i><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a14"><a href="#fn_a14">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p2_4">111:2.4</a></small></sup>  There are three and not two factors in the evolutionary creation of such an immortal <a href="/en/topic/soul">soul</a>. These three antecedents of the morontia human soul are:</p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p2_5">111:2.5</a></small></sup>  1. <i>The human <a href="/en/topic/mind">mind</a></i> and all cosmic influences antecedent thereto and impinging thereon.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p2_6">111:2.6</a></small></sup>  2. <i>The divine spirit</i> indwelling this human mind and all potentials inherent in such a fragment of absolute spirituality together with all associated spiritual influences and factors in human life.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p2_7">111:2.7</a></small></sup>  3. <i>The relationship between material <a href="/en/topic/mind">mind</a> and divine spirit,</i> which connotes a value and carries a meaning not found in either of the contributing factors to such an association. The reality of this unique relationship is neither material nor spiritual but morontial. It is the <a href="/en/topic/soul">soul</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p2_8">111:2.8</a></small></sup>  The midway creatures have long denominated this evolving soul of man the mid-mind in contradistinction to the lower or material mind and the higher or cosmic mind. This mid-mind is really a morontia phenomenon since it exists in the realm between the material and the spiritual. The potential of such a morontia evolution is inherent in the two universal urges of mind: the impulse of the finite mind of the creature to know <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and attain the divinity of the Creator, and the impulse of the infinite mind of the Creator to know man and attain the <i>experience</i> of the creature.</p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p2_9">111:2.9</a></small></sup>  This supernal transaction of evolving the immortal <a href="/en/topic/soul">soul</a> is made possible because the mortal <a href="/en/topic/mind">mind</a> is first personal and second is in contact with superanimal realities; it possesses a supermaterial endowment of cosmic ministry which insures the evolution of a moral nature capable of making moral decisions, thereby effecting a bona fide creative contact with the associated spiritual ministries and with the indwelling Thought Adjuster.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a15"><a href="#fn_a15">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p2_10">111:2.10</a></small></sup>  The inevitable result of such a contactual spiritualization of the human mind is the gradual birth of a soul, the joint offspring of an adjutant mind dominated by a human will that craves to know <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, working in liaison with the spiritual forces of the universe which are under the overcontrol of an actual fragment of the very God of all creation—the Mystery Monitor<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. And thus does the material and mortal reality of the self transcend the temporal limitations of the physical-life machine and attain a new expression and a new identification in the evolving vehicle for selfhood continuity, the morontia and immortal soul.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a16"><a href="#fn_a16">[16]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p3_1">111:3.1</a></small></sup>  The mistakes of mortal <a href="/en/topic/mind">mind</a> and the errors of human conduct may markedly delay the evolution of the <a href="/en/topic/soul">soul</a>, although they cannot inhibit such a morontia phenomenon when once it has been initiated by the indwelling Adjuster with the consent of the creature will. But at any time prior to mortal death this same material and human will is empowered to rescind such a choice and to reject <a href="/en/topic/survival_(of_mortal_death)">survival</a>. Even after survival the <a href="/en/topic/ascending_mortals">ascending mortal</a> still retains this prerogative of choosing to reject eternal life; at any time before <a href="/en/topic/fusion">fusion</a> with the Adjuster the evolving and ascending creature can choose to forsake the will of the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> Father. Fusion with the Adjuster signalizes the fact that the ascending mortal has eternally and unreservedly chosen to do the Father’s will.</p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p3_2">111:3.2</a></small></sup>  During the life in the flesh the evolving soul is enabled to reinforce the supermaterial decisions of the mortal mind. The soul, being supermaterial, does not of itself function on the material level of human experience. Neither can this subspiritual soul, without the collaboration of some spirit of <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>, such as the Adjuster, function above the morontia level. Neither does the soul make final decisions until death or translation divorces it from material association with the mortal mind except when and as this material mind delegates such authority freely and willingly to such a morontia soul of associated function. During life the mortal will, the personality power of decision-choice, is resident in the material mind circuits; as terrestrial mortal growth proceeds, this <a href="/en/topic/self">self</a>, with its priceless powers of choice, becomes increasingly identified with the emerging morontia-soul entity; after death and following the mansion world resurrection, the human personality is completely identified with the morontia self. The soul is thus the embryo of the future morontia vehicle of personality identity.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a17"><a href="#fn_a17">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a18"><a href="#fn_a18">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a19"><a href="#fn_a19">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a20"><a href="#fn_a20">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p3_3">111:3.3</a></small></sup>  This immortal <a href="/en/topic/soul">soul</a> is at first wholly morontia in nature, but it possesses such a capacity for development that it invariably ascends to the true spirit levels of fusion value with the spirits of Deity, usually with the same spirit of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a> that initiated such a creative phenomenon in the creature <a href="/en/topic/mind">mind</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p3_4">111:3.4</a></small></sup>  Both the human mind and the divine Adjuster are conscious of the presence and differential nature of the evolving soul—the Adjuster fully, the mind partially. The soul becomes increasingly conscious of both the mind and the Adjuster as associated identities, proportional to its own evolutionary growth. The soul partakes of the qualities of both the human mind and the divine spirit but persistently evolves toward augmentation of spirit control and divine dominance through the fostering of a mind function whose meanings seek to co-ordinate with true spirit value.</p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p3_5">111:3.5</a></small></sup>  The mortal career, the <a href="/en/topic/soul">soul</a>’s evolution, is not so much a probation as an <a href="/en/topic/education">education</a>. Faith in the survival of supreme values is the core of <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a>; genuine religious experience consists in the union of supreme values and cosmic meanings as a realization of universal reality.</p>
