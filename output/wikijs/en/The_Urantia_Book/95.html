<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. THE SALEM RELIGION IN MESOPOTAMIA </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p1_1">95:1.1</a></small></sup>  By 2000 B.C. the religions of <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> had just about lost the teachings of the <a href="/en/topic/Sethites">Sethites</a> and were largely under the influence of the primitive beliefs of two groups of invaders, the Bedouin <a href="/en/topic/Semites">Semites</a> who had filtered in from the western desert and the barbarian horsemen who had come down from the north.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p1_2">95:1.2</a></small></sup>  But the custom of the early Adamite peoples in honoring the seventh day of the week never completely disappeared in Mesopotamia. Only, during the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> era, the seventh day was regarded as the worst of bad luck. It was taboo-ridden; it was unlawful to go on a journey, cook food, or make a fire on the evil seventh day. The <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> carried back to <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a> many of the Mesopotamian taboos which they had found resting on the <a href="/en/topic/Babylon">Babylonian</a> observance of the seventh day, the <a href="/en/topic/Shabattum">Shabattum</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p1_3">95:1.3</a></small></sup>  Although the <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> teachers did much to refine and uplift the religions of <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, they did not succeed in bringing the various peoples to the permanent recognition of one <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. Such teaching gained the ascendancy for more than one hundred and fifty years and then gradually gave way to the older belief in a multiplicity of deities.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p1_4">95:1.4</a></small></sup>  The Salem teachers greatly reduced the number of the gods of Mesopotamia, at one time bringing the chief deities down to seven: <a href="/en/topic/Bel">Bel</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Shamash">Shamash</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Nabu">Nabu</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Anu">Anu</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Ea">Ea</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Marduk">Marduk</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Sin_(god)">Sin</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>. At the height of the new teaching they exalted three of these gods to supremacy over all others, the <a href="/en/topic/Babylon">Babylonian</a> triad: Bel, Ea, and Anu, the gods of earth, sea, and sky. Still other triads grew up in different localities, all reminiscent of the trinity teachings of the <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andites</a> and the <a href="/en/topic/Sumerians">Sumerians</a> and based on the belief of the Salemites in <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a>’s insignia of the <a href="/en/topic/concentric_circles,_three">three circles</a>.</p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p1_5">95:1.5</a></small></sup>  Never did the <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> teachers fully overcome the popularity of <a href="/en/topic/Ishtar">Ishtar</a>, the mother of gods and the spirit of <a href="/en/topic/sex">sex</a> fertility. They did much to refine the worship of this goddess, but the <a href="/en/topic/Babylonians">Babylonians</a> and their neighbors had never completely outgrown their disguised forms of sex worship. It had become a universal practice throughout <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> for all women to submit, at least once in early life, to the embrace of strangers; this was thought to be a devotion required by Ishtar, and it was believed that fertility was largely dependent on this sex sacrifice.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_5_6"><a href="#fn_a1_5_6">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p1_6">95:1.6</a></small></sup>  The early progress of the <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> teaching was highly gratifying until <a href="/en/topic/Nabodad">Nabodad</a>, the leader of the school at <a href="/en/topic/Kish">Kish</a>, decided to make a concerted attack upon the prevalent practices of <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> harlotry. But the Salem missionaries failed in their effort to bring about this social reform, and in the wreck of this failure all their more important spiritual and philosophic teachings went down in defeat.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_6_3"><a href="#fn_s1_6_3">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p1_7">95:1.7</a></small></sup>  This defeat of the <a href="/en/topic/Salem_teachings">Salem gospel</a> was immediately followed by a great increase in the cult of <a href="/en/topic/Ishtar">Ishtar</a>, a ritual which had already invaded <a href="/en/topic/Palestine">Palestine</a> as <a href="/en/topic/Ashtoreth">Ashtoreth</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Egypt">Egypt</a> as <a href="/en/topic/Isis">Isis</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Greece">Greece</a> as <a href="/en/topic/Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>, and the northern tribes as <a href="/en/topic/Astarte">Astarte</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>. And it was in connection with this revival of the worship of Ishtar that the <a href="/en/topic/Babylon">Babylonian</a> priests turned anew to stargazing; <a href="/en/topic/astrology">astrology</a> experienced its last great Mesopotamian revival, <a href="/en/topic/fortunetellers">fortunetelling</a> became the vogue, and for centuries the priesthood increasingly deteriorated.</p>
<p id="p1_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p1_8">95:1.8</a></small></sup>  <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> had warned his followers to teach about the one <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>, the Father and Maker of all, and to preach only the gospel of divine favor through faith alone. But it has often been the error of the teachers of new truth to attempt too much, to attempt to supplant slow <a href="/en/topic/evolution">evolution</a> by sudden revolution. The Melchizedek missionaries in <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> raised a moral standard too high for the people; they attempted too much, and their noble cause went down in defeat. They had been commissioned to preach a definite gospel, to proclaim the truth of the reality of the <a href="/en/topic/Universal_Father">Universal Father</a>, but they became entangled in the apparently worthy cause of reforming the <a href="/en/topic/mores">mores</a>, and thus was their great mission sidetracked and virtually lost in frustration and oblivion.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_8_11"><a href="#fn_a1_8_11">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_8_15"><a href="#fn_a1_8_15">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_8_16"><a href="#fn_a1_8_16">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_8_17"><a href="#fn_a1_8_17">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_8_18"><a href="#fn_a1_8_18">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_8_24"><a href="#fn_a1_8_24">[8]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s1_8_5"><a href="#fn_s1_8_5">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p1_9">95:1.9</a></small></sup>  In one generation the <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> headquarters at <a href="/en/topic/Kish">Kish</a> came to an end, and the propaganda of the belief in one God virtually ceased throughout Mesopotamia. But remnants of the Salem schools persisted. Small bands scattered here and there continued their belief in the one Creator and fought against the idolatry and immorality of the Mesopotamian priests.</p>
<p id="p1_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p1_10">95:1.10</a></small></sup>  It was the Salem missionaries of the period following the rejection of their teaching who wrote many of the <a href="/en/topic/Old_Testament">Old Testament</a> <a href="/en/topic/Psalms">Psalms</a>, inscribing them on stone, where later-day <a href="/en/topic/Hebrew_language">Hebrew</a> priests found them during the <a href="/en/topic/Babylonian_captivity">captivity</a> and subsequently incorporated them among the collection of hymns ascribed to Jewish authorship. These beautiful psalms from <a href="/en/topic/Babylon">Babylon</a> were not written in the temples of <a href="/en/topic/Bel-Marduk">Bel-Marduk</a>; they were the work of the descendants of the earlier Salem missionaries, and they are a striking contrast to the magical conglomerations of the Babylonian priests. The Book of <a href="/en/topic/Job_(book)">Job</a> is a fairly good reflection of the teachings of the Salem school at Kish and throughout <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_10_13"><a href="#fn_a1_10_13">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p1_11">95:1.11</a></small></sup>  Much of the Mesopotamian religious culture found its way into Hebrew literature and liturgy by way of <a href="/en/topic/Egypt">Egypt</a> through the work of <a href="/en/topic/Amenemope">Amenemope</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Ikhnaton">Ikhnaton</a>. The Egyptians remarkably preserved the teachings of social obligation derived from the earlier <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andite</a> Mesopotamians and so largely lost by the later <a href="/en/topic/Babylonians">Babylonians</a> who occupied the <a href="/en/topic/Euphrates_River">Euphrates</a> valley.</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. EARLY EGYPTIAN RELIGION </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p2_1">95:2.1</a></small></sup>  The original <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> teachings really took their deepest root in <a href="/en/topic/Egypt">Egypt</a>, from where they subsequently spread to <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a>. The evolutionary religion of the <a href="/en/topic/Nile_valley">Nile valley</a> was periodically augmented by the arrival of superior strains of Nodite, Adamite, and later <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andite</a> peoples of the <a href="/en/topic/Euphrates_River">Euphrates</a> valley. From time to time, many of the Egyptian civil administrators were <a href="/en/topic/Sumerians">Sumerians</a>. As <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a> in these days harbored the highest mixture of the world races, so Egypt fostered the most thoroughly blended type of religious philosophy to be found on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>, and from the Nile valley it spread to many parts of the world. The <a href="/en/topic/Jews">Jews</a> received much of their idea of the creation of the world from the <a href="/en/topic/Babylonians">Babylonians</a>, but they derived the concept of divine Providence from the Egyptians.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_1_13"><a href="#fn_a2_1_13">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_1_20"><a href="#fn_a2_1_20">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_1_21"><a href="#fn_a2_1_21">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p2_2">95:2.2</a></small></sup>  It was political and moral, rather than philosophic or religious, tendencies that rendered Egypt more favorable to the <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> teaching than <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>. Each tribal leader in Egypt, after fighting his way to the throne, sought to perpetuate his dynasty by proclaiming his tribal god the original deity and creator of all other gods. In this way the Egyptians gradually got used to the idea of a supergod, a steppingstone to the later doctrine of a universal creator <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>. The idea of <a href="/en/topic/monotheism">monotheism</a> wavered back and forth in Egypt for many centuries, the belief in one <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> always gaining ground but never quite dominating the evolving concepts of polytheism.</p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p2_3">95:2.3</a></small></sup>  For ages the Egyptian peoples had been given to the worship of nature gods; more particularly did each of the two-score separate tribes have a special group god, one worshiping the <a href="/en/topic/bulls">bull</a>, another the <a href="/en/topic/lions">lion</a>, a third the ram, and so on. Still earlier they had been totem tribes, very much like the <a href="/en/topic/Amerinds">Amerinds</a>.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p2_4">95:2.4</a></small></sup>  In time the Egyptians observed that dead bodies placed in brickless graves were preserved—embalmed—by the action of the soda-impregnated sand, while those buried in brick vaults decayed. These observations led to those experiments which resulted in the later practice of <a href="/en/topic/embalming">embalming</a> the dead. The Egyptians believed that preservation of the body facilitated one’s passage through the future life. That the individual might properly be identified in the distant future after the decay of the body, they placed a burial statue in the tomb along with the corpse, carving a likeness on the coffin. The making of these burial statues led to great improvement in Egyptian <a href="/en/topic/art">art</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_4_25"><a href="#fn_a2_4_25">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p2_5">95:2.5</a></small></sup>  For centuries the Egyptians placed their faith in tombs as the safeguard of the body and of consequent pleasurable survival after death. The later evolution of magical practices, while burdensome to life from the cradle to the grave, most effectually delivered them from the religion of the tombs. The priests would inscribe the coffins with charm texts which were believed to be protection against a “man’s having his heart taken away from him in the nether world.” Presently a diverse assortment of these magical texts was collected and preserved as <a href="/en/topic/Dead,_Book_of_the">The Book of the Dead</a>. But in the <a href="/en/topic/Nile_valley">Nile valley</a> magical ritual early became involved with the realms of conscience and character to a degree not often attained by the rituals of those days. And subsequently these ethical and moral ideals, rather than elaborate tombs, were depended upon for salvation.</p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p2_6">95:2.6</a></small></sup>  The superstitions of these times are well illustrated by the general belief in the efficacy of <a href="/en/topic/spittle">spittle</a> as a healing agent, an idea which had its origin in <a href="/en/topic/Egypt">Egypt</a> and spread therefrom to <a href="/en/topic/Arabia">Arabia</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>. In the legendary battle of <a href="/en/topic/Horus">Horus</a> with <a href="/en/topic/Set">Set</a> the young god lost his eye, but after Set was vanquished, this eye was restored by the wise god <a href="/en/topic/Thoth">Thoth</a>, who spat upon the wound and healed it.</p>
<p id="p2_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p2_7">95:2.7</a></small></sup>  The Egyptians long believed that the <a href="/en/topic/stars">stars</a> twinkling in the night sky represented the survival of the souls of the worthy dead; other survivors they thought were absorbed into the <a href="/en/topic/sun_(Urantia’s)">sun</a>. During a certain period, solar veneration became a species of <a href="/en/topic/ancestor_worship">ancestor worship</a>. The sloping entrance passage of the great pyramid pointed directly toward the <a href="/en/topic/Pole_Star">Pole Star</a> so that the soul of the king, when emerging from the tomb, could go straight to the stationary and established constellations of the fixed stars, the supposed abode of the kings.</p>
<p id="p2_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p2_8">95:2.8</a></small></sup>  When the oblique rays of the sun were observed penetrating earthward through an aperture in the clouds, it was believed that they betokened the letting down of a celestial stairway whereon the king and other righteous souls might ascend. “King <a href="/en/topic/Pepi">Pepi</a> has put down his radiance as a stairway under his feet whereon to ascend to his mother.”</p>
<p id="p2_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p2_9">95:2.9</a></small></sup>  When <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> appeared in the flesh, the Egyptians had a religion far above that of the surrounding peoples. They believed that a disembodied soul, if properly armed with magic formulas, could evade the intervening evil spirits and make its way to the judgment hall of <a href="/en/topic/Osiris">Osiris</a>, where, if innocent of “murder, robbery, falsehood, adultery, theft, and selfishness,” it would be admitted to the realms of bliss. If this soul were weighed in the balances and found wanting, it would be consigned to <a href="/en/topic/hell">hell</a>, to the <a href="/en/topic/Devouress">Devouress</a>. And this was, relatively, an advanced concept of a future life in comparison with the beliefs of many surrounding peoples.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_9_13"><a href="#fn_a2_9_13">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p2_10">95:2.10</a></small></sup>  The concept of judgment in the hereafter for the sins of one’s life in the flesh on earth was carried over into <a href="/en/topic/Hebrew_language">Hebrew</a> theology from <a href="/en/topic/Egypt">Egypt</a>. The word judgment appears only once in the entire Book of Hebrew <a href="/en/topic/Psalms">Psalms</a>, and that particular psalm was written by an Egyptian.</p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. EVOLUTION OF MORAL CONCEPTS </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p3_1">95:3.1</a></small></sup>  Although the culture and religion of <a href="/en/topic/Egypt">Egypt</a> were chiefly derived from <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andite</a> <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and largely transmitted to subsequent civilizations through the <a href="/en/topic/Hebrews">Hebrews</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Greeks">Greeks</a>, much, very much, of the social and ethical idealism of the Egyptians arose in the valley of the Nile as a purely evolutionary development. Notwithstanding the importation of much truth and culture of Andite origin, there evolved in Egypt more of moral culture as a purely human development than appeared by similar natural techniques in any other circumscribed area prior to the bestowal of <a href="/en/topic/Michael_of_Nebadon">Michael</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_1_4"><a href="#fn_s3_1_4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p3_2">95:3.2</a></small></sup>  Moral evolution is not wholly dependent on revelation. High moral concepts can be derived from man’s own experience. Man can even evolve spiritual values and derive cosmic insight from his personal experiential living because a divine spirit indwells him. Such natural evolutions of conscience and character were also augmented by the periodic arrival of teachers of truth, in ancient times from the second Eden, later on from <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a>’s headquarters at <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_2_12"><a href="#fn_a3_2_12">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p3_3">95:3.3</a></small></sup>  Thousands of years before the <a href="/en/topic/Salem_teachings">Salem gospel</a> penetrated to <a href="/en/topic/Egypt">Egypt</a>, its moral leaders taught justice, fairness, and the avoidance of avarice. Three thousand years before the <a href="/en/topic/Hebrew_language">Hebrew</a> scriptures were written, the motto of the Egyptians was: “Established is the man whose standard is righteousness; who walks according to its way.” They taught gentleness, moderation, and discretion. The message of one of the great teachers of this epoch was: “Do right and deal justly with all.” The Egyptian triad of this age was <a href="/en/topic/Truth-Justice-Righteousness">Truth-Justice-Righteousness</a>. Of all the purely human religions of <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a> none ever surpassed the social ideals and the moral grandeur of this onetime humanism of the <a href="/en/topic/Nile_valley">Nile valley</a>.</p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p3_4">95:3.4</a></small></sup>  In the soil of these evolving ethical ideas and moral ideals the surviving doctrines of the <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> religion flourished. The concepts of good and evil found ready response in the hearts of a people who believed that “Life is given to the peaceful and death to the guilty.” “The peaceful is he who does what is loved; the guilty is he who does what is hated.” For centuries the inhabitants of the Nile valley had lived by these emerging ethical and social standards before they ever entertained the later concepts of right and wrong—good and bad.</p>

This young teacher-king was a prolific writer, being author of the exposition entitled “The One God,” a book of thirty-one chapters, which the priests, when returned to power, utterly destroyed.

<p id="p5_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p5_9">95:5.9</a></small></sup>  The fatal weakness of Ikhnaton’s gospel was its greatest truth, the teaching that <a href="/en/topic/Aton">Aton</a> was not only the creator of Egypt but also of the “whole world, man and beasts, and all the foreign lands, even <a href="/en/topic/Syria">Syria</a> and Kush, besides this land of Egypt.

Increasingly they were compelled to combine and hyphenate their gods; more and more the family of gods contracted. Ikhnaton had associated the flaming disc of the heavens with the creator God, and this idea continued to flame up in the hearts of men, even of the priests, long after the young reformer had passed on.

<p id="p6_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p6_7">95:6.7</a></small></sup>  Even the religion which succeeded <a href="/en/topic/Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrianism</a> in <a href="/en/topic/Persia">Persia</a> was markedly influenced by it. When the <a href="/en/topic/Iran">Iranian</a> priests sought to overthrow the teachings of Zoroaster, they resurrected the ancient worship of Mithra. And <a href="/en/topic/Mithraism">Mithraism</a> spread throughout the <a href="/en/topic/Levant">Levant</a> and Mediterranean regions, being for some time a contemporary of both <a href="/en/topic/Judaism">Judaism</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a>. The teachings of Zoroaster thus came successively to impress three great religions: Judaism and Christianity and, through them, <a href="/en/topic/Islam">Mohammedanism</a>.</p>
<p id="p6_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p6_8">95:6.8</a></small></sup>  But it is a far cry from the exalted teachings and noble psalms of <a href="/en/topic/Zoroaster">Zoroaster</a> to the modern perversions of his gospel by the <a href="/en/topic/Parsees">Parsees</a> with their great fear of the dead, coupled with the entertainment of beliefs in sophistries which Zoroaster never stooped to countenance.</p>
<p id="p6_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p6_9">95:6.9</a></small></sup>  This great man was one of that unique group that sprang up in the sixth century before <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a> to keep the light of <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> from being fully and finally extinguished as it so dimly burned to show man in his darkened world the path of light leading to everlasting life.</p>

<p id="p7_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p7_1">95:7.1</a></small></sup>  The <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a> teachings of the one <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> became established in the Arabian Desert at a comparatively recent date. As in <a href="/en/topic/Greece">Greece</a>, so in <a href="/en/topic/Arabia">Arabia</a> the <a href="/en/topic/Salem">Salem</a> <a href="/en/topic/missionaries">missionaries</a> failed because of their misunderstanding of Machiventa’s instructions regarding overorganization. But they were not thus hindered by their interpretation of his admonition against all efforts to extend the gospel through military force or civil compulsion.</p>
<p id="p7_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p7_2">95:7.2</a></small></sup>  Not even in <a href="/en/topic/China">China</a> or <a href="/en/topic/Rome">Rome</a> did the Melchizedek teachings fail more completely than in this desert region so very near Salem itself. Long after the majority of the peoples of the Orient and Occident had become respectively Buddhist and Christian, the desert of Arabia continued as it had for thousands of years. Each tribe worshiped its olden fetish, and many individual families had their own household gods. Long the struggle continued between <a href="/en/topic/Babylon">Babylonian</a> <a href="/en/topic/Ishtar">Ishtar</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Hebrew_language">Hebrew</a> <a href="/en/topic/Yahweh">Yahweh</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Iran">Iranian</a> Ahura, and Christian Father of the Lord <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a> <a href="/en/topic/Christ">Christ</a>. Never was one concept able fully to displace the others.</p>
<p id="p7_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p7_3">95:7.3</a></small></sup>  Here and there throughout <a href="/en/topic/Arabia">Arabia</a> were families and clans that held on to the hazy idea of the one <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a>. Such groups treasured the traditions of <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek,_Machiventa">Melchizedek</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Abraham_the_Pharisee">Abraham</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Moses">Moses</a>, and <a href="/en/topic/Zoroaster">Zoroaster</a>. There were numerous centers that might have responded to the Jesusonian <a href="/en/topic/gospel">gospel</a>, but the Christian <a href="/en/topic/missionaries">missionaries</a> of the desert lands were an austere and unyielding group in contrast with the compromisers and innovators who functioned as missionaries in the <a href="/en/topic/Mediterranean_region">Mediterranean</a> countries. Had the followers of Jesus taken more seriously his injunction to “go into all the world and preach the gospel,” and had they been more gracious in that preaching, less stringent in collateral social requirements of their own devising, then many lands would gladly have received the simple gospel of the carpenter’s son, Arabia among them<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b16"><a href="#fn_b16">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_b17"><a href="#fn_b17">[17]</a></sup>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a7_3_5"><a href="#fn_a7_3_5">[26]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_3_19"><a href="#fn_a7_3_19">[27]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_3_23"><a href="#fn_a7_3_23">[28]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a7_3_29"><a href="#fn_a7_3_29">[29]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s7_3_0"><a href="#fn_s7_3_0">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p7_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p7_4">95:7.4</a></small></sup>  Despite the fact that the great Levantine monotheisms failed to take root in Arabia, this desert land was capable of producing a faith which, though less demanding in its social requirements, was nonetheless monotheistic.</p>
<p id="p7_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p7_5">95:7.5</a></small></sup>  There was only one factor of a tribal, racial, or national nature about the primitive and unorganized beliefs of the desert, and that was the peculiar and general respect which almost all Arabian tribes were willing to pay to a certain black stone <a href="/en/topic/fetishes">fetish</a> in a certain <a href="/en/topic/Jerusalem_temple">temple</a> at <a href="/en/topic/Mecca">Mecca</a>. This point of common contact and reverence subsequently led to the establishment of the <a href="/en/topic/Islam">Islamic</a> religion.

<p id="p7_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p7_6">95:7.6</a></small></sup>  The strength of Islam has been its clear-cut and well-defined presentation of <a href="/en/topic/Allah">Allah</a> as the one and only <a href="/en/topic/Deity">Deity</a>; its weakness, the association of military force with its promulgation, together with its degradation of woman. But it has steadfastly held to its presentation of the One Universal Deity of all, “who knows the invisible and the visible. He is the merciful and the compassionate.” “Truly <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> is plenteous in goodness to all men.” “And when I am sick, it is he who heals me.” “For whenever as many as three speak together, God is present as a fourth,” for is he not “<a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the first</a> and the last, also the seen and the hidden”?<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a7_6_22"><a href="#fn_a7_6_22">[30]</a></sup></p>
