<p id="p0_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p0_9">39:0.9</a></small></sup>  To say that any one <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> is inferior to an angel of any other group would hardly be true. Nevertheless every angel is at first service-limited to the group of original and inherent classification. My seraphic associate in the preparation of this statement, <a href="/en/topic/Manotia">Manotia</a>, is a <a href="/en/topic/supreme_seraphim">supreme seraphim</a> and onetime functioned only as a supreme <a href="/en/topic/seraphim_of_the_future">seraphim</a>. By application and devoted service she has, one by one, achieved all seven of the seraphic services, having functioned in well-nigh every avenue of activity open to a seraphim, and now holds the commission of associate chief of seraphim on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_9_96"><a href="#fn_a0_9_96">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_10"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p0_10">39:0.10</a></small></sup>  Human beings sometimes find it hard to understand that a created capacity for higher-level ministry does not necessarily imply <a href="/en/topic/ability">ability</a> to function on relatively lower service levels. Man begins life as a helpless infant; hence every mortal attainment must embrace all experiential prerequisites; seraphim have no such preadult life—no childhood. They are, however, experiential creatures, and by experience and through additional education they can augment their divine and inherent endowment of ability by the experiential acquirement of functional skill in one or more of the seraphic services.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a0_10_4"><a href="#fn_a0_10_4">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a0_10_3"><a href="#fn_a0_10_3">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p0_11"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p0_11">39:0.11</a></small></sup>  After being commissioned, <a href="/en/topic/seraphim">seraphim</a> are assigned to the reserves of their inherent group. Those of planetary and administrator status often serve for long periods as originally classified, but the higher the inherent function level, the more persistently do the angelic ministers seek assignment to the lower orders of universe service. Especially do they desire assignment to the reserves of the <a href="/en/topic/planetary_helper_seraphim">planetary helpers</a>, and if successful they enroll in the celestial schools attached to the headquarters of the Planetary Prince of some evolutionary world. Here they begin the study of the languages, history, and local habits of the races of mankind. Seraphim must acquire knowledge and gain experience much as do human beings. They are not far removed from you in certain personality attributes. And they all crave to start at the bottom, on the lowest possible level of ministry; thus may they hope to achieve the highest possible level of experiential destiny.</p>

Higher orders of angels, <a href="/en/topic/supernaphim">supernaphim</a> and <a href="/en/topic/seconaphim">seconaphim</a>, might also form a part of the attending host, and though their missions are distinct from those of the seraphim, all these activities would be co-ordinated by the bestowal attendants.</p>

To gain admission to the <a href="/en/topic/Paradise">Paradise</a> seraphic abode in a personal capacity by achieving perfection of specialized service as a celestial artisan, a Technical Adviser, or a Celestial Recorder. To become a Paradise Companion and, having thus attained the center of all things, perhaps then to become an eternal minister and adviser to the seraphic orders and others.</p>
<p id="p8_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p8_4">39:8.4</a></small></sup>  2. To be summoned to <a href="/en/topic/Seraphington">Seraphington</a>.

The supreme choice of seraphim in the career of time is the post of guardian angel in order that they may attain the career of finality and be qualified for assignment to the eternal spheres of seraphic service. Such personal guides of the children of time are called guardians of destiny, signifying that they guard mortal creatures in the path of divine destiny, and that in so doing they are determining their own high destiny.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a8_5_4"><a href="#fn_a8_5_4">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a8_5_92"><a href="#fn_a8_5_92">[116]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a8_5_107"><a href="#fn_a8_5_107">[117]</a></sup></p>
