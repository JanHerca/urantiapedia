Many races harbor the story of a world-wide flood some time during past ages. The Biblical story of Noah, the ark, and the flood is an invention of the Hebrew priesthood during the Babylonian captivity. There has never been a universal flood since life was established on <a href="/en/topic/Urantia">Urantia</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>. The only time the surface of the earth was completely covered by water was during those <a href="/en/topic/Archeozoic">Archeozoic</a> ages before the land had begun to appear.</p>
<p id="p7_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p7_5">78:7.5</a></small></sup>  But <a href="/en/topic/Noah_(Garden_dweller)">Noah</a> really lived; he was a wine maker of <a href="/en/topic/Aram">Aram</a>, a river settlement near <a href="/en/topic/Erech">Erech</a><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>. He kept a written record of the days of the river’s rise from year to year. He brought much ridicule upon himself by going up and down the river valley advocating that all houses be built of wood, boat fashion, and that the family animals be put on board each night as the flood season approached. He would go to the neighboring river settlements every year and warn them that in so many days the <a href="/en/topic/floods">floods</a> would come. Finally a year came in which the annual floods were greatly augmented by unusually heavy rainfall so that the sudden rise of the waters wiped out the entire village; only <a href="/en/topic/Noah_(wine_maker_of_Aram)">Noah</a> and his immediate family were saved in their houseboat<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>.</p>

With the ending of this period of deluge, the second <a href="/en/topic/Garden_of_Eden">garden</a> was no more.

<p id="p8_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p8_1">78:8.1</a></small></sup>  When <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> Andite dispersion broke the biologic backbone of Mesopotamian civilization, a small minority of this superior race remained in their homeland near the mouths of the rivers. These were the <a href="/en/topic/Sumerians">Sumerians</a>, and by 6000 B.C. they had become largely Andite in extraction, though their culture was more exclusively Nodite in character, and they clung to the ancient traditions of <a href="/en/topic/Dalamatia">Dalamatia</a>. Nonetheless, these Sumerians of the coastal regions were the last of the <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andites</a> in <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>. But the races of Mesopotamia were already thoroughly blended by this late date, as is evidenced by the skull types found in the graves of this era.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s8_1_0"><a href="#fn_s8_1_0">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s8_1_2"><a href="#fn_s8_1_2">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s8_1_3"><a href="#fn_s8_1_3">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p8_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p8_2">78:8.2</a></small></sup>  It was during the floodtimes that <a href="/en/topic/Susa">Susa</a> so greatly prospered. The first and lower city was inundated so that the second or higher town succeeded the lower as the headquarters for the peculiar artcrafts of that day. With the later diminution of these <a href="/en/topic/floods">floods</a>, <a href="/en/topic/Ur">Ur</a> became the center of the <a href="/en/topic/pottery">pottery</a> industry. About seven thousand years ago Ur was on the <a href="/en/topic/Persian_Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>, the river deposits having since built up the land to its present limits. These settlements suffered less from the floods because of better controlling works and the widening mouths of the rivers.</p>
<p id="p8_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p8_3">78:8.3</a></small></sup>  The peaceful grain growers of the <a href="/en/topic/Euphrates_River">Euphrates</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Tigris_River">Tigris</a> valleys had long been harassed by the raids of the barbarians of <a href="/en/topic/Turkestan">Turkestan</a> and the Iranian plateau. But now a concerted invasion of the Euphrates valley was brought about by the increasing <a href="/en/topic/drought">drought</a> of the highland pastures. And this invasion was all the more serious because these surrounding herdsmen and hunters possessed large numbers of tamed <a href="/en/topic/horses">horses</a>. It was the possession of horses which gave them a tremendous military advantage over their rich neighbors to the south. In a short time they overran all <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, driving forth <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> waves of culture which spread out over all of <a href="/en/topic/Europe">Europe</a>, western <a href="/en/topic/Asia">Asia</a>, and northern <a href="/en/topic/Africa">Africa</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s8_3_0"><a href="#fn_s8_3_0">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p8_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p8_4">78:8.4</a></small></sup>  These conquerors of Mesopotamia carried in their ranks many of the better <a href="/en/topic/Andites">Andite</a> strains of the mixed northern races of Turkestan, including some of the <a href="/en/topic/Adamson">Adamson</a> stock. These less advanced but more vigorous tribes from the north quickly and willingly assimilated the residue of the civilization of Mesopotamia and presently developed into those mixed peoples found in the Euphrates valley at the beginning of historic annals. They quickly revived many phases of the passing civilization of Mesopotamia, adopting the arts of the valley tribes and much of the culture of the <a href="/en/topic/Sumerians">Sumerians</a>. They even sought to build a third tower of <a href="/en/topic/Babel">Babel</a> and later adopted the term as their national name.</p>
<p id="p8_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p8_5">78:8.5</a></small></sup>  When these barbarian cavalrymen from the northeast overran the whole <a href="/en/topic/Euphrates_River">Euphrates</a> valley, they did not conquer the remnants of the Andites who dwelt about the mouth of the river on the <a href="/en/topic/Persian_Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>. These Sumerians were able to defend themselves because of superior intelligence, better weapons, and their extensive system of military canals, which were an adjunct to their <a href="/en/topic/irrigation">irrigation</a> scheme of interconnecting pools. They were a united people because they had a uniform group religion. They were thus able to maintain their racial and national integrity long after their neighbors to the northwest were broken up into isolated city-states. No one of these city groups was able to overcome the united Sumerians.</p>
<p id="p8_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p8_6">78:8.6</a></small></sup>  And the invaders from the north soon learned to trust and prize these peace-loving <a href="/en/topic/Sumerians">Sumerians</a> as able teachers and administrators. They were greatly respected and sought after as teachers of art and industry, as directors of commerce, and as civil rulers by all peoples to the north and from <a href="/en/topic/Egypt">Egypt</a> in the west to <a href="/en/topic/India">India</a> in the east.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a8_6_4"><a href="#fn_a8_6_4">[7]</a></sup></p>

Only when these priests made conquests of the neighboring cities did they call themselves kings. The later city kings failed to form powerful confederations before the days of <a href="/en/topic/Sargon_(priest_of_Kish)">Sargon</a> because of deity jealousy. Each city believed its municipal god to be superior to all other gods, and therefore they refused to subordinate themselves to a common leader.</p>
<p id="p8_8"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p8_8">78:8.8</a></small></sup>  The end of this long period of the weak rule of the city priests was terminated by Sargon, the priest of <a href="/en/topic/Kish">Kish</a>, who proclaimed himself king and started out on the conquest of the whole of <a href="/en/topic/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and adjoining lands<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b6"><a href="#fn_b6">[6]</a></sup>.

<p id="p8_9"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p8_9">78:8.9</a></small></sup>  After the breakup of this Kish confederation there ensued a long period of constant warfare between these valley cities for supremacy.
