<h2 id="p1" class="toc-header"><a href="#p1" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 1. THE EVOLUTIONARY NATURE OF RELIGION </h2>
<p id="p1_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p1_1">92:1.1</a></small></sup>  The evolution of religion has been traced from early fear and ghosts down through many successive stages of development, including those efforts first to coerce and then to cajole the spirits. Tribal fetishes grew into totems and tribal gods; magic formulas became modern prayers. Circumcision, at first a sacrifice, became a hygienic procedure.</p>
<p id="p1_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p1_2">92:1.2</a></small></sup>  Religion progressed from nature worship up through ghost worship to fetishism throughout the savage childhood of the races. With the dawn of civilization the human race espoused the more mystic and symbolic beliefs, while now, with approaching maturity, mankind is ripening for the appreciation of real religion, even a beginning of the revelation of truth itself.</p>
<p id="p1_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p1_3">92:1.3</a></small></sup>  Religion arises as a biologic reaction of mind to spiritual beliefs and the environment; it is <a href="/en/topic/Alpha_and_Omega">the last</a> thing to perish or change in a race. Religion is society’s adjustment, in any age, to that which is mysterious. As a social institution it embraces rites, symbols, cults, scriptures, altars, shrines, and temples. Holy water, relics, fetishes, charms, vestments, bells, drums, and priesthoods are common to all religions. And it is impossible entirely to divorce purely evolved <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> from either magic or sorcery.</p>
<p id="p1_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p1_4">92:1.4</a></small></sup>  Mystery and <a href="/en/topic/power">power</a> have always stimulated religious feelings and fears, while emotion has ever functioned as a powerful conditioning factor in their development. Fear has always been the basic religious stimulus. Fear fashions the gods of evolutionary religion and motivates the religious ritual of the primitive believers. As civilization advances, <a href="/en/topic/fear">fear</a> becomes modified by reverence, admiration, respect, and sympathy and is then further conditioned by remorse and repentance.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a1_4_42"><a href="#fn_a1_4_42">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a1_4_78"><a href="#fn_a1_4_78">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p1_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p1_5">92:1.5</a></small></sup>  One Asiatic people taught that “<a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> is a great fear”; that is the outgrowth of purely evolutionary religion<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b1"><a href="#fn_b1">[1]</a></sup>. <a href="/en/topic/Jesus">Jesus</a>, the revelation of the highest type of religious living, proclaimed that “God is love<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b2"><a href="#fn_b2">[2]</a></sup>.”</p>
<h2 id="p2" class="toc-header"><a href="#p2" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 2. RELIGION AND THE MORES </h2>
<p id="p2_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p2_1">92:2.1</a></small></sup>  Religion is the most rigid and unyielding of all human institutions, but it does tardily adjust to changing society. Eventually, evolutionary <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> does reflect the changing mores, which, in turn, may have been affected by revealed religion. Slowly, surely, but grudgingly, does religion (worship) follow in the wake of <a href="/en/topic/wisdom">wisdom</a>—knowledge directed by experiential reason and illuminated by divine revelation.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_1_82"><a href="#fn_a2_1_82">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p2_2">92:2.2</a></small></sup>  Religion clings to the mores; that which <i>was</i> is ancient and supposedly sacred. For this reason and no other, stone implements persisted long into the age of bronze and iron. This statement is of record: “And if you will make me an <a href="/en/topic/altars">altar</a> of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stone, for, if you use your tools in making it, you have polluted it<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b3"><a href="#fn_b3">[3]</a></sup>.” Even today, the <a href="/en/topic/Hindus">Hindus</a> kindle their altar fires by using a primitive fire drill. In the course of evolutionary religion, novelty has always been regarded as sacrilege. The sacrament must consist, not of new and manufactured food, but of the most primitive of viands: “The flesh roasted with fire and unleavened bread served with bitter herbs<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b4"><a href="#fn_b4">[4]</a></sup>.” All types of social usage and even legal procedures cling to the old forms.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_2_13"><a href="#fn_s2_2_13">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p2_3">92:2.3</a></small></sup>  When modern man wonders at the presentation of so much in the scriptures of different religions that may be regarded as obscene, he should pause to consider that passing generations have feared to eliminate what their ancestors deemed to be holy and sacred. A great deal that one generation might look upon as obscene, preceding generations have considered a part of their accepted mores, even as approved religious rituals. A considerable amount of religious controversy has been occasioned by the never-ending attempts to reconcile olden but reprehensible practices with newly advanced reason, to find plausible theories in justification of creedal perpetuation of ancient and outworn customs.</p>
<p id="p2_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p2_4">92:2.4</a></small></sup>  But it is only foolish to attempt the too sudden acceleration of religious growth. A race or nation can only assimilate from any advanced religion that which is reasonably consistent and compatible with its current evolutionary status, plus its genius for adaptation. Social, climatic, political, and economic conditions are all influential in determining the course and progress of religious evolution. Social morality is not determined by religion, that is, by evolutionary religion; rather are the forms of religion dictated by the racial morality.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_4_20"><a href="#fn_a2_4_20">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a2_4_53"><a href="#fn_a2_4_53">[11]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_4_4"><a href="#fn_s2_4_4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p2_5">92:2.5</a></small></sup>  Races of men only superficially accept a strange and new <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a>; they actually adjust it to their mores and old ways of believing. This is well illustrated by the example of a certain <a href="/en/topic/New_Zealand">New Zealand</a> tribe whose priests, after nominally accepting <a href="/en/topic/Christianity">Christianity</a>, professed to have received direct revelations from <a href="/en/topic/Gabriel">Gabriel</a> to the effect that this selfsame tribe had become the chosen people of <a href="/en/topic/God">God</a> and directing that they be permitted freely to indulge in loose sex relations and numerous other of their olden and reprehensible customs. And immediately all of the new-made Christians went over to this new and less exacting version of Christianity.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_5_1"><a href="#fn_a2_5_1">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p2_6"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p2_6">92:2.6</a></small></sup>  Religion has at one time or another sanctioned all sorts of contrary and inconsistent behavior, has at some time approved of practically all that is now regarded as immoral or sinful. Conscience, untaught by experience and unaided by reason, never has been, and never can be, a safe and unerring guide to human conduct. Conscience is not a divine voice speaking to the human soul. It is merely the sum total of the moral and ethical content of the mores of any current stage of existence; it simply represents the humanly conceived ideal of reaction in any given set of circumstances.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a2_6_90"><a href="#fn_a2_6_90">[1]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s2_6_15"><a href="#fn_s2_6_15">[5]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="p3" class="toc-header"><a href="#p3" class="toc-anchor">¶</a> 3. THE NATURE OF EVOLUTIONARY RELIGION </h2>
<p id="p3_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p3_1">92:3.1</a></small></sup>  The study of human religion is the examination of the fossil-bearing social strata of past ages. The mores of the anthropomorphic gods are a truthful reflection of the morals of the men who first conceived such deities. Ancient religions and mythology faithfully portray the beliefs and traditions of peoples long since lost in obscurity. These olden cult practices persist alongside newer economic customs and social evolutions and, of course, appear grossly inconsistent. The remnants of the cult present a true picture of the racial religions of the past. Always remember, the <a href="/en/topic/cults">cults</a> are formed, not to discover truth, but rather to promulgate their creeds.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_1_33"><a href="#fn_a3_1_33">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_1_37"><a href="#fn_a3_1_37">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_1_44"><a href="#fn_a3_1_44">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_2"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p3_2">92:3.2</a></small></sup>  Religion has always been largely a matter of rites, rituals, observances, <a href="/en/topic/ceremonies">ceremonies</a>, and dogmas. It has usually become tainted with that persistently mischief-making error, the chosen-people delusion. The cardinal religious ideas of incantation, inspiration, revelation, propitiation, repentance, atonement, intercession, sacrifice, prayer, confession, worship, survival after death, sacrament, ritual, ransom, salvation, redemption, covenant, uncleanness, purification, prophecy, original sin—they all go back to the early times of primordial ghost fear.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_2_33"><a href="#fn_a3_2_33">[13]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_2_13"><a href="#fn_s3_2_13">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_3"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p3_3">92:3.3</a></small></sup>  Primitive religion is nothing more nor less than the struggle for material existence extended to embrace existence beyond the grave. The observances of such a creed represented the extension of the self-maintenance struggle into the domain of an imagined ghost-spirit world. But when tempted to criticize evolutionary religion, be careful. Remember, that is <i>what happened;</i> it is a historical fact. And further recall that the power of any idea lies, not in its certainty or truth, but rather in the vividness of its human appeal.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_3_82"><a href="#fn_a3_3_82">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_3_5"><a href="#fn_a3_3_5">[16]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_3_13"><a href="#fn_s3_3_13">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s3_3_10"><a href="#fn_s3_3_10">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p3_4">92:3.4</a></small></sup>  Evolutionary <a href="/en/topic/religion">religion</a> makes no provision for change or revision; unlike science, it does not provide for its own progressive correction. Evolved religion commands respect because its followers believe it is <i>The Truth;</i> “the faith once delivered to the saints” must, in theory, be both final and infallible<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📕" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d5.svg"><sup id="cite_b5"><a href="#fn_b5">[5]</a></sup>. The <a href="/en/topic/cults">cult</a> resists development because real progress is certain to modify or destroy the cult itself; therefore must revision always be forced upon it.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_4_2"><a href="#fn_a3_4_2">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_4_50"><a href="#fn_a3_4_50">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p id="p3_5"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p3_5">92:3.5</a></small></sup>  Only two influences can modify and uplift the dogmas of natural religion: the pressure of the slowly advancing mores and the periodic illumination of epochal revelation. And it is not strange that progress was slow; in ancient days, to be progressive or inventive meant to be killed as a sorcerer. The cult advances slowly in generation epochs and agelong cycles. But it does move forward. Evolutionary belief in ghosts laid the foundation for a philosophy of revealed religion which will eventually destroy the superstition of its origin.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a3_5_33"><a href="#fn_a3_5_33">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_5_2"><a href="#fn_a3_5_2">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a3_5_80"><a href="#fn_a3_5_80">[19]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_5_13"><a href="#fn_s3_5_13">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s3_5_3"><a href="#fn_s3_5_3">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p3_7"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p3_7">92:3.7</a></small></sup>  But while calling attention to the fact that religion was essential to the development and preservation of civilization, it should be recorded that natural religion has also done much to cripple and handicap the very civilization which it otherwise fostered and maintained. Religion has hampered industrial activities and economic development; it has been wasteful of labor and has squandered capital; it has not always been helpful to the family; it has not adequately fostered peace and good will; it has sometimes neglected education and retarded science; it has unduly impoverished life for the pretended enrichment of death. Evolutionary religion, human religion, has indeed been guilty of all these and many more mistakes, errors, and blunders; nevertheless, it did maintain cultural ethics, civilized morality, and social coherence, and made it possible for later revealed religion to compensate for these many evolutionary shortcomings.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s3_7_13"><a href="#fn_s3_7_13">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s3_7_4"><a href="#fn_s3_7_4">[4]</a></sup></p>

But if revelation is to exalt and upstep the religions of evolution, then must such divine visitations portray teachings which are not too far removed from the thought and reactions of the age in which they are presented. Thus must and does revelation always keep in touch with evolution. Always must the religion of revelation be limited by man’s capacity of receptivity.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a4_1_21"><a href="#fn_a4_1_21">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_1_32"><a href="#fn_a4_1_32">[23]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_1_34"><a href="#fn_a4_1_34">[24]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_1_49"><a href="#fn_a4_1_49">[25]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_1_59"><a href="#fn_a4_1_59">[26]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_1_66"><a href="#fn_a4_1_66">[27]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_1_68"><a href="#fn_a4_1_68">[28]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_1_87"><a href="#fn_a4_1_87">[29]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_1_92"><a href="#fn_a4_1_92">[30]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_1_94"><a href="#fn_a4_1_94">[31]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_1_97"><a href="#fn_a4_1_97">[32]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_1_98"><a href="#fn_a4_1_98">[33]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a4_1_99"><a href="#fn_a4_1_99">[34]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s4_1_3"><a href="#fn_s4_1_3">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s4_1_6"><a href="#fn_s4_1_6">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s4_1_7"><a href="#fn_s4_1_7">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s4_1_8"><a href="#fn_s4_1_8">[12]</a></sup></p>
