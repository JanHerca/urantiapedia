<p id="p9_4"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p9_4">41:9.4</a></small></sup>  Sun stability is wholly dependent on the equilibrium between gravity-heat contention—tremendous pressures counterbalanced by unimagined temperatures. The interior gas elasticity of the suns upholds the overlying layers of varied materials, and when gravity and heat are in equilibrium, the weight of the outer materials exactly equals the temperature pressure of the underlying and interior gases. In many of the younger stars continued gravity condensation produces ever-heightening internal temperatures, and as internal heat increases, the interior <a href="/en/topic/X_rays">X-ray</a> pressure of supergas winds becomes so great that, in connection with the centrifugal motion, a sun begins to throw its exterior layers off into space, thus redressing the imbalance between gravity and heat.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a9_4_9"><a href="#fn_a9_4_9">[35]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s9_4_0"><a href="#fn_s9_4_0">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p id="p10_1"><sup><small><a href="/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p10_1">41:10.1</a></small></sup>  Some of the variable stars, in or near the state of maximum pulsation, are in process of giving origin to subsidiary systems, many of which will eventually be much like your own sun and its revolving <a href="/en/topic/planets">planets</a>. Your sun was in just such a state of mighty pulsation when the massive <a href="/en/topic/Angona">Angona</a> system swung into near approach, and the outer surface of the sun began to erupt veritable streams—continuous sheets—of matter. This kept up with ever-increasing violence until nearest apposition, when the limits of solar cohesion were reached and a vast pinnacle of matter, the ancestor of the solar system, was disgorged. In similar circumstances the closest approach of the attracting body sometimes draws off whole planets, even a quarter or third of a sun. These major extrusions form certain peculiar cloud-bound types of <a href="/en/topic/Melchizedek_worlds">worlds</a>, spheres much like <a href="/en/topic/Jupiter_(god)">Jupiter</a> and <a href="/en/topic/Saturn">Saturn</a>.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a10_1_13"><a href="#fn_a10_1_13">[64]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a10_1_63"><a href="#fn_a10_1_63">[65]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s10_1_0"><a href="#fn_s10_1_0">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s10_1_5"><a href="#fn_s10_1_5">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_s10_1_9"><a href="#fn_s10_1_9">[14]</a></sup></p>

But no matter what technique of world building obtains, gravity always produces the solar system type of creation; that is, a central sun or dark island with planets, satellites, subsatellites, and meteors.<img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📃" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4c3.svg"><sup id="cite_a10_2_13"><a href="#fn_a10_2_13">[64]</a></sup><sup id="cite_a10_2_28"><a href="#fn_a10_2_28">[66]</a></sup><img class="emoji" draggable="false" alt="📓" src="/_assets/svg/twemoji/1f4d3.svg"><sup id="cite_s10_2_0"><a href="#fn_s10_2_0">[1]</a></sup></p>
