## Urantia Book Summer Study Session

The Urantia Book Fellowship is excited to invite you to the Summer Study Session 2012. This year’s topic is “Progressive Planetary Civilization.” We will be gathering at the very comfortable and conveniently located Techny Towers retreat center just outside Chicago in Northbrook, IL, from August 1st to the 6th, 2012.

Our Friday morning August 3rd, keynote speaker will be Steve McIntosh, a wellknown author in the emerging integral philosophy movement as well as life-long student of progressive spirituality. He is also an original member of the “Evolutionary Leaders” group spearheaded by Deepak Chopra. His 2007 book Integral Consciousness and the Future of Evolution (Paragon House), as well as his forthcoming book, Evolution’s Purpose (Select Books) present a spiritual philosophy of evolution that has many affinities with the teachings of The Urantia Book.

Saturday morning’s keynote will be given by Daniel Love Glazer on the topic, “Marriage, Family Life, and the Importance of Fatherhood in Progressive Planetary Civilization.” Daniel was raised as a Jew, became an agnostic, then a yogi–almost a swami. After leaving the yogic path, he embarked on a wholehearted search for Truth that resulted in a saving realization of God’s love. With this came the promise that he would be led into more truth. Shortly thereafter, he discovered The Urantia Book through which he came to know Jesus–thanks be to God! He is now retired and is active as a certified lay speaker and preacher in the Methodist Church. He and his wife Karen have two children, Andrew Michael, and Rachel Rebecca.

A pre-conference retreat will include a focus on forgiveness in the contemplative experience. Join Gard Jameson and Bobbie Dreier to share in the experience of contemplative prayer and engage in a conversation about the application of our Father’s love. To register, e-mail Bobbie Dreier at bdreier@earthlink.net.

In addition, there will be an all day pre-conference workshop for presenters and speakers. It is open to anyone who has, is, or will be facilitating a workshop or giving a public address. Its focus is to review and improve public speaking skills. To register email Doreen Heyne at Doreen.heyne@comcast.net.

Various evening and social events are scheduled, and for those of you that have children, a great children’s program is planned. SSS12 also has a limited number of partial scholarships. Contact Lara Amyx at lara10@bellsouth.net subject SSS12 info, for the children’s program and scholarship information.

- **Eugenics and Evolutionary Progressive Civilization.** 
  Presenters: (Tutors) Katharina Becker and Charles Laurence Olivea
  Participants are required to read and take notes on assigned material on the subject matter taken from The Urantia Book on the subject prior to attending the seminar. Participation will be interactive. Registration for the seminar will be limited to 12. Participants must sign up before the “hard” deadline of July 1, 2012.

- **Working on a Building and Trying to Make It Real Compared to What…Rethinking and Revitalizing a Civilization**
  Presenter: Dave Holt
  Let’s examine why civilizations die out (the civilization Onamonalonton built in the Americas.) At the same time we’ll look at what is needed to revitalize an existing civilization and build a progressive one.
- **Fostering the Progressive Growth of Human Society & Civilization: The Unceasing Campaign of the Master Seraphim**
  Presenters: Bob Debold and Barbara Newsom
  This workshop will use a study guide developed by the Committee for the Global Endeavor that will serve as a framework for both large and small group discussions. The study guide contains more than 15 open-ended questions to stimulate personal study and reflection.
- **Government on a Neighboring Planet**
  Presenters: Nick Stefero and Linda Buselli
  We will explore the possible reasons this information was included in The Urantia Book by creating side by side lists of what both this planet and Urantia are doing, as well as the ideas, ideals, and standards that The Urantia Book puts forth.
- **Stepping Stones on the Progress Pyramid**
  Presenter: Stephen Zendt
  With a focus on Paper 81, Section 6, I will open up the fifteen items listed as “stepping stones” in the “Maintenance of Civilization.” I will also call attention to certain “admonitions and warnings” included in this section and in other parts of the book.
- **Special Programs for New Readers**
  Family members, spouses, and local friends can take advantage of  special programs designed to introduce them to The Urantia Book. Facilitated by experienced students of the book, these programs will be interactive and will focus on basic concepts as well as questions raised by the participants.
- **Introduction to The Urantia Book for Friends and Family**
  We will start with your questions, then read and discuss relevant excerpts of the text from all four parts of the book. You will get an overview of the book with a handout based on questions many readers have, and material related to your questions. If you are planning to attend and can send your questions in advance, please e-mail them to barbaranewsom@aol.com.
- **Exploring the Big Questions**
  Presenters: Peter Laurence, Ellen Macias
  A new approach for introducing The Urantia Book to people who are not familiar with it, this workshop is intended for new readers and also for experienced students of the book who might want to present the workshop themselves.

## Meredith J. Sprunger, 1915-2012

Dr. Meredith Justin Sprunger was a highly respected Urantian, serving in numerous capacities, including President of the original Urantia Brotherhood. Meredith authored many important Urantia Book derivative works, including, Spiritual Psychology, 1988, and The Abridged Urantia Papers, 2008. Few would dispute that Dr. Sprunger was probably the most reliable source of first-hand information about the intriguing origin and history of the Urantia Papers. Meredith became a friend and colleague of Dr. William Sadler (1875-1969), the prominent Chicago psychiatrist who led the Forum, safeguarded the Urantia Papers, and oversaw the publication of The Urantia Book in 1955. He personally knew two other members of the original contact commission. 

Meredith had a distinguished career aside from his interest in the Urantia Papers. He earned his Masters from Princeton Theological Seminary and a Ph. D in psychology from Purdue University. He taught at Elmhurst College and the Indiana Institute of Technology where he functioned as the head of the Department of Psychology, Chairman of the Division of Liberal Arts, and as President. Dr. Sprunger was a licensed and practicing psychologist, and an ordained minister with pastorates at United Church of Christ in Indiana.

Dr. Sprunger first met Dr. William Sadler in Chicago on May 7, 1958, shortly after The Urantia Book was published. From that time, Dr. Sprunger served Urantia Foundation, the Urantia Brotherhood, and later The Urantia Book Fellowship as a loyal and dedicated Urantian. Throughout the years of turmoil in the Urantia movement, Meredith held steady as a resolute and judicious leader, and emitted a light that all factions could trust and depend upon.

I first met Meredith in the mid-seventies at a Urantia conference. In those days, the older Urantians were rather secretive about matters concerning the origin of the Urantia Papers. However, I found Meredith quite open and gracious. His wisdom was balanced, his spiritual depth extraordinary, and his knowledge and understanding of the Urantia Papers profound…yet he served with remarkable humility. Over the years I developed a warm relationship with him and Irene, his wife of 66 years who was also a selfless, dedicated Urantian, and who preceded him to the mansion worlds in 2007.

Meredith assisted me in many projects, and even conducted the marriage ceremony for Joan and I in 1991. When Joan suggested that I attempt to write an authentic history of the Urantia Papers, I turned to Meredith. His only stipulation was that we would follow and document the truth wherever it led, and so we did. Dr. Sprunger, who was known for his sterling integrity, provided a sworn affidavit regarding the authenticity of the Urantia Papers for our History. I can only offer a portion of it here.

“I have studied The Urantia Book in depth for over forty years, and I am likewise convinced that the authorship of the text was superhuman, and that it was materialized by unprecedented means that are not fully understood. In my best professional and personal opinion, I am absolutely convinced there was no human authorship or creative input, and there were no human editorial decisions involved with the materialization of the Urantia Papers. I believe the truth of what Dr. Sadler wrote–and personally disclosed to me numerous times: the Urantia Papers were published just as received, and the contact commission had no editorial authority whatever, and its role was confined solely to the clerical tasks of spelling, capitalization, and punctuation. Neither did the forum members contribute to the creative contents of the Urantia Papers. The forum was similar to a modern focus group in that it was used by the celestial authors solely as a gauge to measure human understanding.”

## YaYa January Conference Awesome!

By _Mike MacIsaac_

Thanks to all who made the January 13 - 16 younger generation conference awesome! The conference in Boulder, Colorado was well attended and went superbly. The program included a rich variety of activities. A large number of visitors also arrived early and stayed late for additional days of friendship-deepening great times. The weekend included a variety of group readings, workshops, presentations, and discussions having to do with spiritual living, community, and more intimately getting to know each other.

We also went on a short hike overlooking central Boulder, engaged in hilarious improvisational exercises, experienced a guided meditation, went to Chris Halvorson’s Friday night class (www.perfectinghorizons.org), enjoyed the Outlook Hotel’s atrium with pool and hot tub, and made the most of opportunities for nocturnal socializing. One highlight was the large potluck event to which local readers of all generations were invited. It included inspiring short talks from locals as well as young visitors and music by the UB-inspired composer Stockhausen, which was played by a highly skilled young professor of music theory.

I initially envisioned this mid-January event to be rather small and mostly for friends that were not able to come to the one last October in Boulder. While both conferences were equally wonderful, inspiring, and joyous, what caught me by surprise about this event was the comparatively robust turnout, about twice the number of participants came from out of state compared to the previous gathering! We enjoyed twenty-four such visitors, some who came great distances; from Kansas, California, New York City, Arizona, Nevada, Oklahoma, Illinois, Nebraska, and Wisconsin. An additional twenty-four readers who live in Colorado participated to varying extents depending on their schedules and interest levels.

This conference turned out to be much larger than any I’ve seen in the fifteen years since I became active in the movement, especially surprising considering that it took place in mid-January.

An encouraging development that helped in the task of attracting young, spiritually motivated individuals, is that some who were kids when I was fostering community in the past are now active readers; a ‘new batch’ of mostly second-generation young readers has arrived on the scene. This includes the “YaYa” (Youth and Young Adult) Committee of The Urantia Book Fellowship, which is a relatively new team working to foster the younger generations of readers. I’ve recently become active with the YaYa Committee, and their input, encouragement, and attendance (five committee members came) brought unique and priceless dynamism to this event. I want to thank Angie Thurston, Tony Finstad, and the rest of the Committee for their help and support!

The YaYa Committee also contributed funds toward scholarships and event expenses which made it possible for us to have such a large group. When YaYa voted to devote money toward this event, I decided to also ask Urantia Association International if they would be willing to assist with a few travel scholarships for young readers. This resulted in a handful of individuals also donating assistance to support this event via UAI. I want to thank James Woodward, David Lithicum, Rick Lyon, Arnie Ondis, and an anonymous donor for their enormously helpful contributions. Scholarships, which typically cover about half of travel expenses for those in need, made it possible for half a dozen young people to come who would not have been able to afford it. We found some rooms at an inexpensive hotel that served as an ideal location for some of our workshops and socializing.

I want to thank Rocky Mountain Spiritual Fellowship and the Colorado readers including Chris and Cydney Riggio, Chris and Cady Halvorson, Paula Thompson, Andre Radatus, Claire Thurston, and Laura Hay, and also Don Green, who maintains a Urantia club and booth at the University of Colorado. Finally, thanks to all those who came to Boulder to contribute their unique perspectives and personalities!

We aim to keep the momentum going. I’m excited to be working with the YaYa Committee and others to organize similar gatherings in July.

## Pipeline of Light

The Urantia Book Fellowship is delighted to announce that the Pipeline of Light is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year. Since our inception in 2002, volunteers have placed 3,347 copies of The Urantia Book with readers in seventy-five countries, including:

Algeria, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Bahrain, Belize, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Canada, Chechnya, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, England, Fiji, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Guinea, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, India, Iran, Italy, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Malaysia, Maldives, Mexico, Moldavia, Myanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Palestine, Panama, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, South Vietnam, Spain, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, Taiwan, Togo, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine, the United States, Uruguay, Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia.

Working the Pipeline of Light brings both joys and challenges. The joys include working with the Fellowship office staff, Paula Thompson and Jo Ann Weidman. These women pack, ship, and track books, and generate the reports needed to keep donors informed and the books flowing along to their global destinations. Tamara Strumfeld at Urantia Foundation cheerfully serves the same purpose in keeping cases of translations moving to appointed destinations around the world. All three women are well versed in the challenges of international shipping, shipments that disappear, shipments that arrive with a book or two missing, and exorbitant customs fees.
Pipeline shipments are sometimes a bit circuitous (Cuba comes to mind,) but we believe the results are worth the effort.

Approximately 80% of the books placed by volunteers for the Pipeline are sent to Latin America, in no small part due to the efforts of Agustin Arellano Tirado. Agustin has a real gift for inspiring new readers, starting study groups, and placing books in libraries and study groups where they are greatly needed and most appreciated. I am in awe of his relentless quest to bring the revelation to his fellow men and women. Mo Seigel, President of Urantia Foundation, recently visited South America and was inspired to increase the Pipeline’s discount on the cost of the Urantia Foundation’s Spanish translation, our most requested book. His generosity will help us place more copies of El Libro de Urantia with readers in Latin America this year.

This summary would not be complete without expressing my gratitude to the many donors who have supported us, financially and through prayer, in the past ten years. Large and small, your contributions make the magic of the Pipeline of Light possible! If you would like to contribute to this work, donations can be made online at: www.stores.homestead.com/UrantiaBook/-strsePipeline-of-Light/Categories.bok or by mail to:

The Urantia Book Fellowship, PO Box 6631, Broomfield, CO 80021

Thank you so much for your support of the Pipeline of Light!

Michelle Klimesh, Pipeline Coordinator
