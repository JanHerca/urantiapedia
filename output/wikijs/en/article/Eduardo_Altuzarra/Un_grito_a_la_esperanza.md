UBIS In Focus Series Presentation, May 6, 2023

## INTRODUCTION

> **Hope** is a process of faith and optimistic spirit based on the expectation of favorable outcomes related to events or circumstances in one's own life or the world as a whole. It is a virtue that moves us, motivates us, and shows us a direction to follow in life.

Not long ago, I was talking with a friend who was familiar with the existence of _The Urantia Book_, and he asked me the following question:

—Is everything written in that book true? Do you believe it?

I answered him:

—If it's not true, at least it's a book of hope.

And I answered him, saying that because today, after many years of reading it, studying it, and comparing it with other readers, I'm convinced that there is survival after death. That death is the beginning of a career that will keep me eternally entertained. That I will be immortal, because I will never die again. Victor Hugo once said: “If man is not immortal, God is not honorable.” God is honorable, and much more besides. This book allows us to truly know Him.

Personally, I believe in this book because it is a book of **hope**, regardless of whether the existence of God is a demonstrable fact for some and an undemonstrable fact for others. There are so many things that assure me that there exists a Reality completely unknown to most mortals that I cannot help but, at the very least, place trust and, above all, **hope** in each and every one of the teachings within it.

If we are clearly observant, at the beginning, the book tells us about Reality and says, among other things, in the Prologue...

> REALITY, as comprehended by finite beings, is partial, relative, and shadowy... [UB 0:3.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p3_20)

And about the truth, a Divine Counselor says in:

> All finite knowledge and creature understanding are relative. Information and intelligence, gleaned from even high sources, is only relatively complete, locally accurate, and personally true. [UB 2:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p7_1)

Adding below:

> Physical facts are fairly uniform, but truth is a living and flexible factor in the philosophy of the universe. Evolving personalities are only partially wise and relatively true in their communications. They can be certain only as far as their personal experience extends. That which apparently may be wholly true in one place may be only relatively true in another segment of creation. [UB 2:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p7_2)

Many years ago, when I was younger, I read in a book by Félix Gracia, something I have already shared on more than one occasion, in which he said:

<figure id="Figure_1" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Un_grito_a_la_esperanza/001.jpg">
</figure>

“_The Universe emits a permanent vibration, a musical note that calls for everyone's affiliation, a non-audible signal, ***but sensitive to the soul***, it is like a key, like a silent call that alerts those who, even without being aware of it, are waiting for it_”

From then on, I dedicated myself to testing whether this could be possible, until one fine day, Eureka! I caught the musical note, discovered The Urantia Book, and confirmed that what I had read had come true for me, it was true.

When I first began reading this book and later began studying it in depth, I realized I was convincing myself that in order to fulfill many of its teachings, I had to change many things in my mind. I had to change my way of thinking, my way of speaking, and my way of acting.

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Un_grito_a_la_esperanza/002.jpg">
</figure>

The revelators themselves place **hope** in us, humble but ignorant mortals, so that we may come to understand and practice the contents of this “manual.” The book, in its text, contains many sections and paragraphs that encourage us to **hope** through its description of the different scenarios life has in store for us.

I'm sure there are many phrases or paragraphs worth sharing about hope, but I personally like these two...

<br style="clear:both;"/>

A divine Counselor in:

> The concept of truth might possibly be entertained apart from personality, the concept of beauty may exist without personality, but the concept of divine goodness is understandable only in relation to personality. Only a person can love and be loved. Even beauty and truth would be divorced from survival hope if they were not attributes of a personal God, a loving Father. [UB 1:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p7_3)

And immediately after, he says this:

> We cannot fully understand how God can be primal, changeless, all-powerful, and perfect, and at the same time be surrounded by an ever-changing and apparently law-limited universe, an evolving universe of relative imperfections. But we can know such a truth in our own personal experience since we all maintain identity of personality and unity of will in spite of the constant changing of both ourselves and our environment. [UB 1:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p7_4)

From the first pages of this book, such interesting information is provided for the novice that, from the outset, it puts us, if that is our desire, on the path to living an endless adventure. The great thing about that adventure is that it tells us the layout, the route, and the places or settings we will travel through. I am convinced that The Urantia Book is a transformative book.

## -HUMAN EXPERIENTIAL REALITIES

At the beginning of your reading, which is no small feat, if we begin with the Prologue, Part One, etc., the difficulties become evident. Leaving personality and morontia aside for the moment, it is necessary to consider four aspects of the human being that are very important for spiritual evolution: body, mind, spirit, and soul. It is very interesting and thoughtful to consciously consider these four parts of the book.

- The body, which is considered to be a biological system divided into three parts: head, trunk, and limbs, has an electrochemical mechanism and is, in turn, of animal origin.
- The mind, something difficult to understand because we cannot see it or locate it in a reliable or obvious way, however, we can elucidate it as an energy, as a circuit, as a channel or also as a level that, nevertheless, accompanies the body.
- The spirit, the bearer of new ideas, is the one who tries to adjust thoughts, is the one who nests and lives in the mind.
- The soul is something imperceptible, but it begins in our lives with our first moral decisions based on our aptitude. It is an experiential and morontial substance endowment and also accompanies our body.

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Un_grito_a_la_esperanza/003.jpg">
</figure>

Metaphorically speaking, and taking these four aspects into account, and at the same time, considering that the brain is located inside the head, if we reflect on this as we become acutely aware of the reading we are comprehending, some of us begin to realize that there was barely any light left in the interior of our brain. We can even perceive that this “room” is practically dark, in the face of this new Reality through which the text of the book is leading us. With this observation, you can come to understand, if examined carefully, that a thin, faint halo of light appears in one area of that room, and you begin to realize that this room has a small window with a blind and even a door.

Every day it's helpful and important to understand new aspects of the book. These new discoveries will help you, once and for all, with a combination of patience, sincerity, and courage, effectively raise the blinds on that window, let the light in, and appreciate the mess that “room” is in, the disorder in the contents of our brains when they think, speak, or act.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

<figure id="Figure_4" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Un_grito_a_la_esperanza/004.jpg">
</figure>

Faced with such a scenario, we must begin to stop and reflect. We must step back and reflect on the potential error and disorder in which we can live. Of course, in all honesty, it must be said that this can be achieved if one wants and desires it, and in this case, one must convince oneself using free will, without coercion from anything or anyone; that is necessary to be able to use the button of decisions from a conscious level.

This is something very important and necessary in a person's life. It's time to design a new decoration for that vast brain. Everyone will decide how to do it, because this is now under a new responsibility, which I believe brings courage, strength, and a lot of **hope**.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

We'll all agree that thinking is not the same as reacting to those thoughts, both in words and actions. Because, of course, how do you change something without causing a huge mess? How do you do it well without situations affecting the concepts of your psyche? How do you start a new decor? Is the same furniture of any use to me? How do I develop something harmonious within that space? How do you learn to repair all the mess? Etc., etc. Because, of course, a young tree can be easily straightened, but a leaning, already mature tree—how do we make it as straight as possible?

A Perfector of Wisdom from Uversa says:

> That, then, is the primary or elementary course which confronts the faith-tested and much-traveled pilgrims of space. But long before reaching Havona, these ascendant children of time have learned to feast upon uncertainty, to fatten upon disappointment, to enthuse over apparent defeat, to invigorate in the presence of difficulties, to exhibit indomitable courage in the face of immensity, and to exercise unconquerable faith when confronted with the challenge of the inexplicable. Long since, the battle cry of these pilgrims became: “In liaison with God, nothing—absolutely nothing—is impossible.” [UB 26:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p5_3)

## -THE INEVITABLE, AN ESSENTIAL ASPECT

Sometimes we overlook certain sections or paragraphs in the book that we should really give some importance to regarding the uncertainties of life and the vicissitudes of existence, because it is there, in my view, where human beings can become a little more aware of the difference they can find between embellishing or darkening our minds.

<figure id="Figure_5" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Un_grito_a_la_esperanza/005.jpg">
</figure>

Over time, and not without experiencing mistakes, disappointments, efforts, etc., we acquire, with good aptitude, willpower, and free will, the experiences that help us evolve. It is understood that from certain moments on, we must be more conscious when facing certain difficulties and know how to choose in the face of disappointment. There is nothing better than living and experiencing what we understand from this book and putting it into practice through a fraternal approach to our fellow human beings, seeking to understand and empathize with them, knowing how to discern the broad field of social and religious inequality.

Little by little, we're managing to bring some order to that tangle of thoughts, to that cerebral clutter where, with patience, you notice that something beautiful is emerging in your mental environment. We're beginning to understand that the effort and willpower are worth it, given that we must constantly confront insecurities and uncertainties in order to consciously realize that it's necessary to harbor trust and hope in our brains, as well as other types of situations in which we must test our minds when we face the dilemma of knowing less than we might believe. This is called the birth of faith.

We must also pause to consider that, at times, it is desirable to acknowledge that we live in a world where error is ever-present, largely due to our imperfection, and that hypocrisy and deceitfulness are possible. Nor can we fail to inspire ourselves to achieve certain divine ideals in the face of situations where goodness and beauty are relative.

We must not forget to be loyal to our principles, keeping in mind that there are possibilities of betrayal and abandonment, since there is always the risk of abandoning nobility. The ego also plays a significant role. That “bug” that tries to make us selfish toward our fellow human beings, through this clamor for self-recognition and false honor. Therefore, we always find ourselves “jumping” between good and evil. And finally, let's emphasize whether happiness is desirable among us, ascending mortals. Personally, I would dare to say yes, as long as we understand that pain and suffering accompany us as ever-present life processes.

A Divine Counselor says in:

> The full appreciation of truth, beauty, and goodness is inherent in the perfection of the divine universe... Mortal man earns even his status as an ascension candidate by his own faith and hope. Everything divine which the human mind grasps and the human soul acquires is an experiential attainment; it is a reality of personal experience and is therefore a unique possession in contrast to the inherent goodness and righteousness of the inerrant personalities of Havona. [UB 3:5.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p5_16)

## -SUBCONSCIOUS, CONSCIOUS AND SUPERCONSCIOUS

<figure id="Figure_6" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Un_grito_a_la_esperanza/006.jpg">
</figure>

Our mind, according to the book and my interpretation, seems to contain three levels and several channels or circuits. Five adjutors, something like five assistants of that level of the mind, reside at the subconscious level. They are sponsored by the Divine Minister and are responsible for making us capable, on an intellectual level, of intuition, understanding, courage, knowledge, and advice or counsel. It is at this level that, with free will, most human beings try to develop their lives. It is the habitual monotony in which a large part of humanity has lived for many years.

Then there's the conscious level. Truth be told, we rarely find ourselves at that level. We hardly ever find ourselves in that kind of situation. It's not easy either; it's not a common occurrence. I understand that in order to live a few moments with that horizon as a perspective, we need to make decisions. Decisions about new, refreshing ideas, without having to waste time sifting them through doubt or uncertainty. Ideas based largely on ideals to be achieved through good practice, good intentions, and honest aptitude. Let's consider aptitude as a quality found in that area of the mind, and that we possess it to know how to face transcendent situations.

And finally, the superconscious level, which, trying to put it metaphorically, I would dare say is the level that isn't easy to enjoy. It's where you find the “spiritual transmitter” that, depending on the channel or wave you tune into, will receive one information or another in your consciousness. You reach this spiritual realm when the material tribulations of the subconscious level disrupt your daily life. From there, the light of consciousness is sometimes ignited. These are moments of reflection, contemplation, and prayer. These are states that make you live consciously in the face of reality, since within this “transmitter” are the Thought Adjuster, the Spirit of Truth, the Holy Spirit, and two other helpers: the Spirit of Worship and the Spirit of Wisdom.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

Faith, willpower, conviction, and sincere and trusting dialogue are the tools that must be used to achieve a minimum of spiritual certainty and true wisdom within that divine realm that is the superconscious level. From there, we can accomplish the will of the Universal Father.

A Mighty Messenger temporarily assigned to serve on Urantia says:

> Having started out on the way of life everlasting, having accepted the assignment and received your orders to advance, do not fear the dangers of human forgetfulness and mortal inconstancy, do not be troubled with doubts of failure or by perplexing confusion, do not falter and question your status and standing, for in every dark hour, at every crossroad in the forward struggle, the Spirit of Truth will always speak, saying, “This is the way.” [UB 34:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p7_8)

## -HUMAN RECEPTOR, THE BRAIN, SUPPORT OF THE MIND

<figure id="Figure_7" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Un_grito_a_la_esperanza/007.jpg">
</figure>

The book informs us that there are a series of spiritual circuits within the many that exist within gravity, something similar to the neural circuits in our body. It explains that sensations or effects are directed to different parts of our body, and just as some reside in less important areas of our organism, others travel to different areas of human consciousness.

Looking back, we recognize that, over time, the skillful use and implementation of the book's teachings are leading our brains to better utilize their biological qualities. We are acquiring more coherent thoughts. We are using words that help us connect with our fellow human beings and developing more understanding, empathetic, and sincere actions. In a word, we are decorating it with new furniture. We are gaining a greater and broader perspective of our spiritual horizon.

In practice, we are gaining a greater awareness of the environment in which we move. We are becoming, every day, a little more aware of the reality the book speaks of. And, every day, and to a greater extent, we acquire greater qualities to tune into that transmitter, into that universe that daily transmits permanent vibrations, signals, keys, calls, ideas, etc., which are deposited in the deepest part of our consciousness.

<figure id="Figure_7" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Un_grito_a_la_esperanza/008.jpg">
</figure>

And although it may seem unbelievable, I would personally dare to say that it's possible that certain aspects of our biology are changing because we're also simultaneously changing our eating habits and the way we view ourselves. This is an important fact to keep in mind, as health and vigor are necessary for spiritual evolution.

A Melchizedek from the Jerusem School of Planetary Management says:

<br style="clear:both;"/>

> 3. ***Spirit-reception series***. There are three groups of mind design as related to contact with spirit affairs. This classification does not refer to the one-, two-, and three-brained orders of mortals; it refers primarily to gland chemistry, more particularly to the organization **of certain glands comparable to the pituitary bodies**. The races on some worlds have one gland, on others two, as do Urantians, while on still other spheres the races have three of these unique bodies. The inherent imagination and spiritual receptivity is definitely influenced by this differential chemical endowment. [UB 49:5.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p5_19)

## -THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PSYCHIC CIRCLES

There are a number of documents that tell us the order in which spiritual evolution develops in human beings, from the moment they confess that they have been asleep in time or living in the habitual disorder of life until, recognizing this situation, they awaken at the gateway to a new reality.

Man must choose and express his destiny. The cycle is predetermined, but man's participation in it is optional and experiential. Decisions are made within ethical, social, and moral frameworks. They are progressive and ascendant.

<br>

<figure id="Figure_8" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Un_grito_a_la_esperanza/008.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

> The sum total of personality realization on a material world is contained within the successive conquest of the seven psychic circles of mortal potentiality [UB 110:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_1)

Awakening to a new reality in becoming aware and taking responsibility to exercise with resilient will that ability inherent to the human being through which he is able to discern in an authentic way between good and evil based on an unshakeable faith and true human values, which are part of his essence, beyond cultures and traditions, in the face of a new religion, which will take birth trying, as far as possible, to abandon as much time as possible, living in the subconscious level

When we recognize that we can live at the conscious or superconscious level, we understand that our Monitor can help us improve our behavior and thus better attempt to do the will of our Universal Father.

It's important not to fall into the error of thinking that the Adjuster influences our consciousness. He acts beyond it, to the extent that we know how to position ourselves with our aptitude. The first step toward being able to experience these moments and these types of influences is knowing how to move from the conscious level to the superconscious level. These are decisions made consciously in moments when human equity, emotional harmony, and peace of mind are desired in the face of difficult human situations.

With this, we are positioned on the different steps of that ladder that will lead us to obtain a position fully proportional to our scale of spiritual values.

A Mighty Messenger on duty in Nebadon says:

> On a material world you think of a body as having a spirit, but we regard the spirit as having a body. The material eyes are truly the windows of the spirit-born soul. The spirit is the architect, the mind is the builder, the body is the material building. [UB 42:12.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p12_12)

A Solitary Messenger from Orvonton says in:

> In varying degrees and increasingly as you ascend the psychic circles, sometimes directly, but more often indirectly, you do communicate with your Adjusters. But it is dangerous to entertain the idea that every new concept originating in the human mind is the dictation of the Adjuster. More often, in beings of your order, that which you accept as the Adjuster’s voice is in reality the emanation of your own intellect. This is dangerous ground, and every human being must settle these problems for himself in accordance with his natural human wisdom and superhuman insight. [UB 110:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p5_6)

## -FINAL OBJECTIVE: THE FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT

Although sometimes comparisons are not the best way to give an example, it occurs to me that to ascend like the salmon does up the river of life until it fulfills its plan of sowing the river of embryonic seeds, the human being must also ascend before the vicissitudes of the existence of life, recognizing what it means to evolve spiritually in order to reach the ultimate goal, which is to obtain the fruits of the spirit from its seeds.

This is no easy task for a person beginning to acquire these fruits. One must first recognize the presence of a consciousness nourished by the activities of divine existences such as the Thought Adjusters and the Spirit of Truth. One must also recognize that the existence of the soul, this joint creation of the mind and the Monitor, is evolving daily, acquiring a consciousness capable of appreciating the presence and permitting spiritual guidance and other supermaterial actions of the Adjuster.

<figure id="Figure_9" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Un_grito_a_la_esperanza/009.jpg">
</figure>

Achieving the fruits of the Spirit is an idea, an ideal, a longing, an intrinsic desire, premised on doing the Father's will. But first, one must be aware of the transformation that develops within oneself and in those invisible areas that are only detectable through noble, sensitive, and charitable experiences. “You will know them by their fruits.”

Only in this way will we be able to obtain those significant gifts that will allow us to live a proportional and coherent life in the eyes of our fellow human beings. We will finally, once and for all, complete the task of renewing our cerebral furniture, that decoration that can sometimes confuse us so much.

Religious belief is effective for the spiritualization of that person. The experiences directed toward religious social life inevitably produce the “fruits of the Spirit” in the daily life of the spirit-led mortal. To be born of the Spirit is to free oneself from the shackles of life at the subconscious level. These fruits are the attribute of the highest kind of ennobling and joyful self-control. It is the highest achievement we can attain and what the Father desires and expects of us here on earth: true self-mastery.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

A Solitary Messenger from Orvonton says in:

> Mind is your ship, the Adjuster is your pilot, the human will is captain. The master of the mortal vessel should have the wisdom to trust the divine pilot to guide the ascending soul into the morontia harbors of eternal survival. Only by selfishness, slothfulness, and sinfulness can the will of man reject the guidance of such a loving pilot and eventually wreck the mortal career upon the evil shoals of rejected mercy and upon the rocks of embraced sin. With your consent, this faithful pilot will safely carry you across the barriers of time and the handicaps of space to the very source of the divine mind and on beyond, even to the Paradise Father of Adjusters. [UB 111:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_9)

A Powerful Messenger says in:

> The consciousness of the spirit domination of a human life is presently attended by an increasing exhibition of the characteristics of the Spirit in the life reactions of such a spirit-led mortal, **<ins>“for the fruits of the spirit are love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance”</ins>** [UB 34:6.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_13)

## -THE LAST TEST OF HOPE: GRANDFANDA

<figure id="Figure_10" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Un_grito_a_la_esperanza/010.jpg">
</figure>

Grandfanda is the first ascending mortal to arrive in Havona and later on Paradise. He is unequivocal proof that survival, immortality, and eternal life exist. He brings hope to all of us. He gives our careers the green light by learning of his existence. Throughout his journey and through his experiences, we know that we have the potential to reach the Universal Father, there in his permanent residence.

This pilgrim discovered Havona way back in the eternity of time past. He hailed from planet 341, system 84, constellation 62, local universe 1131, located in superuniverse number one. His arrival meant establishing broadcasts from the universe of universes, since up to that time, operations had been centered in the superuniverses and local universes. With this originated the “glory reports to space,” notifying the reception of the first evolving mortal who had successfully reached the threshold of ascendant existence; the goal was Paradise.

<figure id="Figure_11" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Un_grito_a_la_esperanza/011.jpg">
</figure>

Grandfanda is currently the head of the seven Corps of Completion that constitute the Supreme Council of Destiny, which carry out missions in the universe for the children of ultimate destiny.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

A Perfector of Wisdom from Uversa says:

> After the attainment of the supreme satisfaction of the fullness of worship, you are qualified for admission to the Corps of the Finality. The ascendant career is well-nigh finished, and the seventh jubilee prepares for celebration. The first jubilee marked the mortal agreement with the Thought Adjuster when the purpose to survive was sealed; the second was the awakening in the morontia life; the third was the fusion with the Thought Adjuster; the fourth was the awakening in Havona; the fifth celebrated the finding of the Universal Father; and the sixth jubilee was the occasion of the Paradise awakening from the final transit slumber of time. The seventh jubilee marks entrance into the mortal finaliter corps and the beginning of the eternity service. The attainment of the seventh stage of spirit realization by a finaliter will probably signalize the celebration of the first of the jubilees of eternity. [UB 27:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p7_8)

**WHAT A GLORIOUS DESTINY FOR THE SONS OF TIME OF ANIMAL ORIGIN, THE MATERIAL SONS OF SPACE!**
