***Presentation given by Eduardo Altuzarra at the Third Urantia Book Readers' Meeting in Cáceres, November 2002***

Part Three of the Book covers pages 651 to 1319 (670 pages), or, in other words, documents 57 to 119 (63 documents). It can be divided into four sections:

## 1st Section Origin and establishment of life on Urantia.

_Andronover.- The nebula._

Almost a billion years ago, a space scout from the Force Organizers family saw that the space conditions were favorable for the initiation of the materialization of said nebula. He informed the Ancients of Days and they proceeded to manipulate it. Thus, for almost 981 billion years, with the help of the Power Directors and the Physical Controllers, the four nebular stages developed, giving rise to just over a million suns with their respective planets.

_Monmatia.- The solar system._

Our solar system originated around 5 billion years ago. Some anomalies arise early on, which is why less than 1% of planetary systems have a similar beginning. Over a period of just over 4 billion years, the planets gradually settle and acquire their more or less current orbits and shapes.

Urantia.- Room to live.

They estimate that the history of Urantia begins about a billion years ago and divide it into five main eras:

| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| --- | --- |
| 1st The pre-life era | which lasted 450 million years (Archaeozoic) |
| 2nd The Age of the Dawn of Life | “ 150 million (Proterozoic) |
| 3rd The Age of Marine Life | “250 million (Paleozoic) |
| 4th The era of maritime terrestrial life.. | “ 100 million (Mesozoic) |
| 5th The era of mammalian life.. | “ 50 million (Cenozoic) |

550 million years ago the Life Carriers began their six hundred and sixth (606) experience of the original life patterns and their sixtieth opportunity to effect changes and modifications in the basic, normal life concept (decimal planet). The life pattern for this Earth was established on the basis of sodium chloride. They implanted life in three distinct locations on the planet in warm, calm, and protected waters:

- the <ins>central</ins> or Eurasian-African
- the <ins>oriental</ins> or southern Asian
- the <ins>western</ins> encompassing the Americas and Greenland

Years pass and different ages, stages and periods pass by: that of vegetative terrestrial life, that of fish, that of ferns, that of frogs, that of seed plants, that of reptiles, that of birds, finally that of mammals, that of terrestrial settlements and that of the first glacials.

A little over a million years ago, a little to the west of India, on lands that are now submerged, primitive lemurs originating in America began to interbreed and unite with favorable races of monkeys and gibbons from Eurasia and North Africa, giving rise, in a sudden, unprecedented and unexpected way, through three mutations and over the course of some 21,000 years, to the precursor mammals, the intermediate mammals, the apes, the primates and from there to a twin pair, the first human beings, Andon and Fonta. This event occurred 993,419 years ago.

850,000 years ago, superior tribes called Bodonán settled in the foothills of the northwest highlands of India gave rise to a new race, the <ins>Neardental</ins>.

500,000 years ago, suddenly and unexpectedly, a family descended from the Bodonán, also located in northeastern India, began producing uniquely intelligent offspring with an unusual tendency for their skin to turn colored when exposed to the sun. They gave rise to the <ins>Sangik</ins> family, the ancestors of the six colored races. They had 19 children: 5 red, 2 orange, 4 yellow, 2 green, 4 blue, and 2 indigo.

Around this time, Caligastia, the Planetary Prince, arrived with a retinue of 100 members, 50 males and 50 females, plus a large number of assisting angels and a host of celestial beings. They settled in a region of the Persian Gulf and built a great walled city called Dalamatia. The 100 Caligastias, or retinue, organized themselves and formed ten autonomous advisory groups. For more than 300,000 years, all these beings socialized and civilized all the human tribes and settlements.

200,000 years ago, the System Sovereign, Lucifer, voluntarily decided to draft a manifesto sparking a System-wide rebellion. This gave rise to great conflict and confusion among superhuman personalities on our planet. All communication circuits with the rest of the worlds and celestial entities were cut off, and they were quarantined indefinitely until the good ruler repented of his actions.

This greatly delayed human evolution. For more than 160,000 years, all beings roamed the face of the earth without achieving proper and successful evolution, abandoned by God.

During the rebellion, some (superhumans) joined the manifesto and others did not. Those who did not and remained faithful to the Universal Father tried, as much as possible, to socialize the surrounding communities and ensure they did not lose the good customs they had acquired long ago.

A little over 37,000 years ago, it was decided to send two Material Sons, Adam and Eve, to Urantia. They settled in the Garden of Eden, built exclusively for that purpose. They had a mission: over time and through a direct lineage of half a million children, never before seen, they would be able to intermingle with the various members of the different races, since they and their children are biological uplifters, and this entire process would give rise to the seventh colored race, the violet. After one hundred years, the situation failed miserably, and the entire project collapsed, starting all over again.

From now on, history has little to tell that we don't already know with more or less certainty, except for the arrival of Maquiventa Melchizedek, the sage of Salem. A contemporary of Abraham, he shared life with us for a hundred years, and his mission consisted primarily of creating a monotheistic religion, speaking of one God, good and kind. He trained missionaries and sent them to the East, the Levant, and the West. They were misunderstood, and hence the different religious currents in today's world.

(Comment a little on the history of the book as the 5th revelation)

If anyone here would like to know what some of the latest historians have to say, it would be a good idea to read Zechariah Sitchin's book series “Chronicles of the Earth” published by Obelisco:
- 1st The 12th Planet.
- 2nd The stairway to heaven.
- 3rd The war of gods and men.
- 4th The Lost Kingdoms.

## 2nd Section The socialization of human beings over time.

Since human beings have been on Earth, in my bold opinion, little or almost nothing has been able to socialize, and if not, let's contemplate how we are a million years later.

Those who did the most to socialize and civilize us were the hundred of the Entourage, who thanks to their organization created ten schools and taught us many things.

(Comment on section 5 of chapter 66)

(Comment on section 5 of chapter 68)

(Comment on several sections of chapters 69, 70, 71)

Rebellion drags us into misery, error, and confusion. For many years, we failed to socialize or evolve.

The arrival of Adam and Eve was intended to give us a strong push toward socialization; that sweet treat only lasted a hundred years; that project also failed. During the 530 years they lived among us, these two beings tried to guide us toward a better future and succeeded, though not entirely, in civilizing us and making us better understand the reality of life and existence.

We've improved since then, but I think we're less sociable. We've improved materially, but very little spiritually, due to the great confusion we have about reality today.

(Comment on section 6 of chapter 81)

## 3rd Section: Human Beliefs and Errors: Science, Philosophy, and Religion.

Many of them come to us from misinterpretations from the time of Adam and Eve, both because they were the most recent superhuman beings and their descendants, and also because of the intermediate beings created by the members of the Entourage who were left loose on Earth after the rebellion.

(Comment on chapter 77 the intermediate beings)

(Comment on the different sections of chapters 87 and 88)

(Comment on the different sections of chapter 103, especially 7-8 - 9)

## * 4th Section The spirit in the human being. The Thought Adjusters.

(Comment on the different types, why they come to us and when)

(Also discuss the dream error and psychic circles)
