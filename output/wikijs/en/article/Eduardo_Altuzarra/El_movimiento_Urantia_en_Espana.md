## INTRODUCTION

The Urantia Book has been around in Spain long enough for someone to share how it began to be known and studied in our country. My friend Eduardo, who has been involved in many of the movements' various events, was the first to undertake this endeavor, and I can attest that it has been a long and arduous task, spanning many years, until (finally) this article has seen the light of day.

If there's one thing that draws my attention in this work, at times a history and at times a personal account, it's the description of the key people involved in disseminating the teachings of The Urantia Book in our country. These people weren't intimidated by the fact that the book was in a language other than their native tongue and that there was no one else in the country to turn to for it; they were so determined to learn its contents that they resorted to every means at their disposal to absorb its teachings. Now, in the Internet age, it's easy to access any book from anywhere on the planet, but this was far from the case in the 1970s.

This story may not include everyone who is, but it certainly includes everyone who is. It was very difficult, if not impossible, for everyone to be there. Perhaps we still lack the perspective that time brings; the history of the Urantia movement, like all history, is an open-ended story that cannot be put to the word “end.” Furthermore, many of the key players in this movement are still alive and doing their best to make its teachings known to Truth seekers in this country. Perhaps in a few decades, this story will need to be revised, and I am convinced that more key people will be included.

The seeds of revelation were sown in our country more than forty years ago, and we can say they have borne good fruit. I am sure it will continue to be so for decades to come, thanks to the pioneers who came before us. There are already protagonists of history who have continued their upward path to Paradise, but new blood has also appeared that has maintained the momentum of disseminating The Urantia Book in Spain. And I trust that new seeds will continue to germinate in the dissemination of the book, for we are not alone; our invisible friends have helped us, help us, and will help us throughout this entire process. Someone will be there to tell the tale, so that the silent heroes are not forgotten.

## Part One

Childhood and youth are years that pass with unusual rapidity, especially for a memory that spans more than six decades.

At that time, I was five years old when, far, far away from my hometown, events were taking place that would mark the beginning of an unstoppable movement, the “melody” of which reached me when just under forty years had passed.

It was on October 12, 1955, that The Urantia Book was first published in this world. This event took place in the city of Chicago, United States of America.

<br>

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">

<br style="clear:both;"/>

The compilation of his text was developed through the dedication of a group of people called “the Forum”, who believed from the beginning in some documents that were “appearing” in previous years in the Sadler family environment as a revelation, which without any greater mysteries than those of family confidentiality were kept inside a safe that said family had in the building they owned, located at 533 Diversey Parkway, Chicago (Illinois), currently the headquarters of the Urantia Foundation in the USA.

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/The_Urantia_Movement_in_Spain/004.jpg">
</figure>

This book gradually spread throughout the different states of the United States, as well as to several other countries. In fact, between 1961 and 1962, The Urantia Book was published for the first time in France in French, translated by Jacques Weiss and his team, under the title La Cosmogonie d'Urantia and published in three volumes. Jacques Weiss was a French industrialist, aviation expert, former leader of the underground resistance to the Nazis during the occupation, and an ardent seeker of truth. [A Short History](/en/article/Georges_Michelson_Dupont/A_Short_History_of_the_French_Translation)

<br style="clear:both;"/>

_The Urantia Book_ was first published in Spain as _El libro de Urantia_ in mid-1993.

The fact that this book wasn't published in Spanish for almost 40 years doesn't mean that there weren't Spaniards who didn't read it in other languages.

The most conclusive proof, after a long, exhaustive, and reliable investigation, is Mr. Pedro Valverde Tort. This man, back in 1964 or perhaps earlier, was already reading _La Cosmogonie d'Urantia_. Mr. Pedro Valverde Tort acquired the three volumes of _La Cosmogonie d'Urantia_ at the time, and was thus almost certainly the first Spaniard to read (in French) _The Urantia Book_ in Spain.

<br>

Pedro Valverde Tort was born in Mataró on August 25, 1928. He married Carmen Vilabella Bassangé in 1952, and they had four children. Later, in 1956, they lived in Granollers. In 1964, Pedro and his family moved to Porto (Portugal) for work. He held degrees in Geography and History, as well as a degree in Draftsmanship. Around that time, or perhaps a little earlier, Pedro Valverde Tort discovered books. For the next eight years, family life unfolded naturally in the neighboring country.

Throughout his time in Portugal, he devoted himself to expanding his knowledge of the vast world of the “unknown,” keeping family and work in mind. His inquisitiveness, which he felt from a very young age, always led him to research the UFO subject and the connotations this phenomenon had on various mythologies, as well as its religious implications and consequences in dreamscapes.

While reading and studying the three books, he devoted his time to writing essays and translating relevant documents into Spanish, which he shared with like-minded friends.

According to what I was told at the time, in broad strokes and without many details—it seems to be an anecdote that he himself didn't share in detail, but with great respect, since it has always been understood that that experience marked a turning point in his life—shortly after settling in Portugal, on one of his trips, at the Porto airport, two somewhat sinister, elegantly dressed figures in dark clothing approached him. They approached him, and what they discussed or handed him remained forever in Pedro's memory, since, as far as I know, he never spoke of it. The truth is that after that conversation at the compound and on the way back home, a car accident occurred. As Pedro passed by, he saw the two people who had been with him moments before lying on the ground, apparently dead. That incident was never heard from again.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

Pedro gave several lectures (Annex 1) on wide and diverse topics of “unexplained phenomena” because he was a member, at that time, of societies such as the “Interplanetary Studies of Barcelona” and the “Friends of Space Visitors of Madrid.”

<figure id="Figure_6" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/The_Urantia_Movement_in_Spain/006.jpg">
</figure>

At the same time as these events were taking place in Portugal, other events related to _The Urantia Book_ were also unfolding in the city of Chicago, in the United States of America. On April 26, 1969, the alma mater, Dr. William Samuel Sadler, passed away at the age of 93. He was the lifeblood of all the writings associated with the 196 documents of _The Urantia Book_.

France was also experiencing important events surrounding the book _La Cosmogonie d'Urantia_ between 1969 and 1972. Jacques Weiss decided to make a second, somewhat improved printing of the book. The second edition of Volume II was completed on April 14, 1969, Volume I on November 28, 1970, and Volume III on March 10, 1971. However, some 2,000 copies of Volume II of this second edition were damaged, and later, on May 11, 1972, Weiss decided to print new, corrected volumes of Volume II to replace those that were damaged.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

It seems that news of the events unfolding in France around that time reached Pedro Valverde Tort's residence in Portugal. Within a short period of time, and to the best of his ability, Pedro contacted a friend in France to obtain, in the most favorable manner possible, the three volumes of the new edition that had been printed in the neighboring country and were subsequently lost. Once he had obtained them, he contacted a personal friend in Barcelona who frequently traveled to France, and asked her to pick up the three volumes of the second edition of _La Cosmogonie d'Urantia_ from a specific address in France.

Later, in mid-1972, Pedro had to leave for Angola for work. His work consisted mainly of the gradual relocation of industrial equipment.

<figure id="Figure_7" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/The_Urantia_Movement_in_Spain/007.jpg">
</figure>

Between 1973 and 1974, it is true that, due to misunderstandings, debates, and confrontations between the trustees of The Urantia Foundation in Chicago and Jacques Weiss, a series of lawsuits and lawsuits began, ultimately resulting in the confiscation of the printing plates for the volumes of _La Cosmogonie d'Urantia_, as well as all the printed books that could be seized. As a result of these actions against Weiss, the French translation essentially ceased to be sold. The only option left was to make clandestine photocopies of the editions, and due to the situation, these photocopies increased in price.

Time went by and, due to greater responsibility, Pedro found himself in need of establishing himself almost permanently in Angola, in the district of Huambo (New Lisbon), specifically in Caála, (Annex 2) to direct the construction work of a technical unit intended for the manufacture of machinery for the chemical and graphic industries.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

This also included a project conceived by Pedro Valverde Tort, which basically consisted of constructing innovative buildings for the local population. He designed them, they bore his name (Tort), and he oversaw their construction.

The fact that Pedro acquired new volumes of _La Cosmogonie d`Urantia_ was mainly because, despite having a large library in Portugal, his work required him to travel frequently, and part of this large and diverse library also accompanied him.

In the African country, Pedro Valverde Tort developed and attempted to supply primary schools and medical clinics during his years there using a system of prefabricated buildings made with modern materials while preserving native forms. This system he invented and for which he won a silver medal at the International Exhibition of New Techniques held in Geneva in 1973.

It's worth noting, according to the project plans, that some of the buildings in the villages had something similar to a dome that could be opened at any given time. A futuristic vision?

Pedro was immersed in the development of such a long-awaited project when, at the end of 1975, he found himself forced to write to his family from Angola. He came to say that he was fully aware that it would be impossible for his ideas to see the light of day, largely due to the civil war raging in that country. All his hopes and good intentions would go unfulfilled.

Another thing that also worried him greatly was trying to safeguard the library he had moved during his years working in that country. He was most reluctant to leave his valuable library there. Later, not without great difficulty and leaving only a few works on the shelves, he managed to return his most prized treasure, his most interesting books.

Finally, Pedro returned to Spain from Angola, settling in Mataró in December 1975 due to the unrelenting armed conflicts in that country. Pedro was 47 years old.

From that year onwards and perhaps with renewed spirit, not without leaving his studies and work duties, Pedro Valverde Tort began a journey of activities in his free time for approximately two decades, in which he mainly dedicated himself to the dissemination of _The Urantia Book_ and to a more in-depth study (if possible).

<figure id="Figure_8" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/The_Urantia_Movement_in_Spain/008.jpg">
</figure>

He dedicated, as could not be otherwise, every moment he had available to research and studies of ufology, parapsychology, as well as a series of somewhat incomprehensible and enigmatic events related to the paranormal world, such as life after death and other occult topics that sometimes and in some people create totally mysterious emotional and mental conflicts.

Around October 23, 1976, Pedro Valverde gave possibly his first lecture/talk in Spain after returning from Angola. He spoke about his extensive knowledge of _The Urantia Book_ and its cosmogony.

<figcaption>Cultural activities. The current situation and problems of UFOs under scrutiny. The First National Congress on Ufology, in Barcelona. The First National Congress on Ufology ( OVNI ) will be held on December 3rd and 4th at the Montjuich Conference Centre, under the chairmanship of Mr. Antonio Ribera. The objectives of this Congress are to inform the attending public and the Spanish public in general about the state of UFO research in Spain, research that has reached very high levels among us, and also to allow contact and an exchange of views among our researchers. Among the presentations that will be presented are: - The enigma of Sirius. - Bases for a theoretical modeling of the UFO phenomenon. - Pictorial material from Cantabrian caves and its relation to the UFO phenomenon. The Mystery of UMMO, The 1897 Aircraft: Unpublished Facts, The Problem of Contact, UFOs: Official Documents of the Spanish Government, and other equally interesting ones.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

At the end of 1977, between December 3 and 4, the 1st National Congress of Ufology was held in Barcelona at the Montjuic Conference Centre under the presidency of Mr. Antonio Ribera, a famous researcher, ufologist and friend of Pedro Valverde Tort and Ignacio Darnaude Rojas Marcos.

Pedro and Ignacio, among others, participated in this conference (Appendix 1). Pedro gave his first lecture entitled “The Mystical Problems of the UFO Phenomenon.” It was a thesis developed over more than twenty-five years of study on unidentified flying objects and the inspiration for _The Urantia Book_.

This article presents the generalized theory that attempts to unify the two most contradictory lines of research into the phenomenon into a single field:

- The position of scientific investigations.
- The subjective position of the “spiritualists”.

To achieve this, the author develops a line of thought that leads to a synthesis of the problem, encompassing three basic components in a single formula:

- Physical observation.
- The correlative parapsychic effects.
- The consequent religious implications.

He also argues that it's not a good idea to lump all types of unidentified flying objects together. After extensive research, Pedro says he's concluded that there are two categories of UFOs:

- <ins>The Primary UFO</ins>. Mechanical, the result of a technical evolution superior to ours, but within reach of the future possibilities of our intelligence.
- <ins>The Superior UFO</ins>. The mysterious UFO that we intuitively consider to be technically inaccessible to our capacity for intellectual evolution.

And in the philosophical and transcendental aspect, Pedro “takes us on a journey” through the hypothetical idea of the creation of a new science called “Eternology”, which he defines as “_The science that studies the laws and phenomena that provide man with the quality that will allow him to transcend time and space, placing him on a line of infinite and eternal evolution._”

This postulate, which the author calls the “Theory of Eternalism,” is basically interpreted on the hypothesis that the survival of personality is not a purely mystical phenomenon of a supernatural nature, but rather the end of a stage and a natural process in which the human being obtains qualities that provide him with a new category or dimension, a goal in human evolution that has been sensed since the dawn of time and that man has always tried to understand and deserve (definition inspired by _The Urantia Book_).

During this year and in subsequent years, which were years of much casuistry, Pedro Valverde, one of his sons, his wife, and Josep Barceló, within the Coordinator of Studies on the UFO Phenomenon (CEFO), established the guidelines for developing the project known as “Documentary Disclosure” or DIDO.

The DIDO Project's main objective was to receive, encode, report, and distribute all possible information from documents, news, interviews, books, etc., on the UFO phenomenon and its derivatives. The project's development consisted of two phases. The first consisted of structuring and launching at the national level, and the second involved restructuring and expanding to the international level.

The process followed consisted of obtaining as much information as possible, studying and analyzing the testimonies and evidence to ensure the reliability of the material, recording and cataloging it, publishing a periodic newsletter summarizing all the material, and allocating said material to the client based on demand.

Approximately one month after the 1st National Congress of Ufology, Pedro asked Antonio Ribera for the address of Juan José Benítez, journalist, ufologist and writer, to contact him because, knowing that he attended the congress as a speaker, and that, due to circumstances beyond their control, it was impossible to have an in-depth conversation except for sporadic greetings (if there were any).

<figure id="Figure_10" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/The_Urantia_Movement_in_Spain/009.jpg">
</figure>

JJ Benítez is well known to all of us, mainly for the books written about the saga “_The Trojan Horses_” (“_Caballos de Troya_”).

One of the possible reasons Pedro wanted to contact JJ Benítez was the large amount of similar research each of them was doing separately. Pedro wanted to contact Juanjo so that they could somehow compare and unify their opinions on some of the findings and arrive at the most reliable results possible.

It's true, I tell myself, that who knows what profound conversations these two unique figures of ufology had. What is certain is that from those first communications a friendship was born that lasted until the end of Pedro's life. I know that together they developed profound and transcendent treatises for thousands of readers and conference attendees.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

Juan José Benítez wrote: His name was Pedro Valverde Tort. He was a silent man, full of secrets. One day he showed me the way of the Urantia revelation, and my mind understood the seemingly incomprehensible. I owe him a lot. I made every possible inquiry and confirmed that the aforementioned revelation was authentic. Everyone should know it. Pedro arrived in silence and thus departed...

In October 1978, Pedro traveled to Portugal, specifically to Porto, where he had spent eight years of his life. The 1st Iberian Congress on Ufology (Appendix 1) was held there on the 7th and 8th of October at the Faculty of Economics, organized by the Center for Astronomical Studies and Unusual Phenomena. At this congress, Pedro again presented “The Mystical Problems in the UFO Phenomenon.”

During those times and in subsequent years, the I - II and III National Congresses of Parapsychology were also held, possibly in Barcelona, as well as the I European Congress of Parapsychology (Barcelona, 1976) and the I and II World Congresses of Parapsychology (Barcelona, 1977 and 1978) and later in Penedés and Vendrell.

I'm not entirely sure whether Pedro Valverde Tort attended them as a spectator or speaker, but given his interest in these topics, I have no doubt that he may have participated in some of them, just as he participated in numerous conferences and gave numerous interviews to various media outlets. (Appendix 3)

<figcaption>A conference dedicated to the topic of UFOs will begin tomorrow. The First Mediterranean Congress of Ufology (OVNI) will be held at the Montjuich Conference Centre on the 16th and 17th. This conference will feature specialists in unidentified flying objects from various European countries. The president of the conference is writer Antonio Ribera, and the president of the Organizing Committee is Francisco de Asis Rovaatti, a specialist in parapsychology. While some presentations are expected to be rigorous in their approach to the UFO phenomenon, such as that of Robert Pinotti from Italy, who will discuss the “dossiers” of the Italian Department of Defense General Staff, there are others whose announcement is pending, such as that of Antonio Pelegrí of Spain, who will discuss “Standards for legal relations with extraterrestrials.” Other topics to be discussed will include: - Correlation of the UFO phenomenon with certain socioeconomic factors. - New official Spanish documents. - “The mystical problems of the UFO phenomenon” and - “On the nature of observations”
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

At the First Mediterranean Congress of Ufology, now in 1979, Pedro presented his improved paper “The Mystical Problems of the UFO Phenomenon” for the third time, and Juan José Benítez presented his paper “UFOs, New Official Documents.” At that congress, Pedro also established a close friendship and correspondence with Pierre Delval (France), who presented his paper “Psychic and Spiritual Aspects of the UFO Phenomenon.” Pierre Delval was the director of the OURANOS study commission, which published a journal.

<figcaption>Interest in the UFO topic is growing. The First Mediterranean Congress on Ufology has concluded. There is great interest in our country in the UFO topic. There is a group of young university students, physics graduates, engineers, computer science specialists, all with rigorous training, who are studying this phenomenon, declared the president of the First Mediterranean Congress on Ufology at the closing ceremony, which concluded on Sunday. The Congress included speakers from Portugal, Italy, France, Romania, Turkey, and Spain. According to the president of the Congress, Mr. Antonio Ribera, in other countries this interest is channeled through official organizations, such as in France, where the organization that studies UFOs depends on the National Center for Scientific Research. The presidencies of the Congress and its organizing committee were held by Antonio Ribera, writer and honorary president of the Center for Interplanetary Studies (CEI) in Barcelona, and Francisco Rovatti, sociologist and president of the I, II, and III National Congresses of Parapsychology. Papers were presented at this Mediterranean Congress by Marius Lleget, De Blas, David López, José Benitez, Antoni Pelegri, Pedro Valverde, Enrique Vicente, and Antonio Ribera, from Spain; Pierre Delval, from France; Fernando Patinha, from Portugal; Florin Gheorghita, from Romania; and Roberto Pinoti, from Italy. Also attending the congress were Dr. Haluk Egemen, from Turkey, and Messrs. Fourd and Lagarde, from France, although they did not present communications or papers.

Among many attendees at this conference was Ferran Ballester, an ophthalmologist based in Cerdanyola, who met Pedro Valverde Tort for the first time in person, a close friendship that would last until the end of Pedro's life.

Personally, over time, I had the opportunity to meet Ferran and also some of his friends with whom I was able to talk about that conference and its consequences.

<figure id="Figure_14" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/The_Urantia_Movement_in_Spain/011.jpg">
</figure>

I asked him several questions, including when, how, and why he met Pedro Valverde Tort. Ferran answered:

_I met him in 1979, during the First Mediterranean Congress of Ufology, held in Barcelona. My reason for meeting him was more out of curiosity and a bit of personal interest._

Ferran told me:

_During an intermission, I asked Pedro about the content of his lecture, and almost without saying a word, Pedro said, looking me straight in the eyes, “I have something for you.” He then handed me a business card and told me to call him. We continued talking. After a short time, I did get in touch with him via phone, in which he told me he was going to send me some documents. The truth is, it took him several months to provide me with some pamphlets he had translated from French of a book entitled_ “La Cosmogonie d'Urantia.”

<br style="clear:both;"/>

He also told me:

_I must admit that its content caught my attention, and I insisted that I was interested in purchasing the book. He replied that the French version by Jacques Weiss was out of print and that a reissue was not authorized, but that Weiss himself would provide copies of the book upon request. I managed to locate Mr. Weiss and spoke with him by telephone, and thus I obtained the complete French version of The Urantia Book, distributed in 12 booklets, which allowed me to delve into the study of this extensive and peculiar narrative work about Urantia, our planet._

<figure id="Figure_15" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/The_Urantia_Movement_in_Spain/013.jpg">
</figure>

Beginning in October 1980, Pedro collaborated with the Center for the Study and Reflection on Human Destiny and the Urantia Book Study Group. On November 20 of that same year, he gave a lecture on religions, speaking about “The Human Instrument within The Urantia Book.”


In 1981, a series of meetings took place in which, through negotiations between Mr. Henry Begemann, a Dutchman and representative of The Urantia Foundation in Europe at that time, French readers and the American trustees, they agreed to publish, in a single volume, under the name Le Livre d'Urantia and with the text translated by Jacques Weiss, but printed in two columns, new copies for those readers who requested to read _The Urantia Book_.

<br style="clear:both;"/>


<figure id="Figure_16" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/The_Urantia_Movement_in_Spain/015.jpg">
</figure>

Mr. Jacques Weiss passed away in 1983. According to a close friend of Mr. Jacques, who was present at his deathbed, he told him something to the effect that he was leaving this world broken by the consequences he had experienced over the years involved in the translation. What began with great enthusiasm between him and Dr. Sadler was cut short by the trustees' insistence on implementing policies to control the revelation after Dr. Sadler's death.

I know, without specifying reliable dates, that at the beginning of the 80s, from statements by Ferran Ballester and Antonio Moya Cerpa, another of the pioneers in Spain on the reading and study of _The Urantia Book_, Mr. Henry Begemann and his wife made several trips to Spain to visit his sister Margarita Begemann and her husband Alberto Bakker, who owned a home in the city of Vinaroz (Castellón), while also taking the opportunity to interview those readers of _The Urantia Book_ who were known to be studying it here in Spain at that time.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

<figure id="Figure_17" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/The_Urantia_Movement_in_Spain/014.jpg">
</figure>

Asking Ferran Ballester about this topic, about how and where he came to know Henry Begemann, Ferran answered:

_I met him in Vinaroz at his sister Margarita's house. I visited that house several times, one of which was when we met Antonio Moya, with whom I had several phone conversations._

When I asked him if he knew whether Pedro Valverde, Alber Bakker and Henry Begemann had any common relationship with _The Urantia Book_, he replied:

_On one occasion, when Begemann came to see Margarita and Alberto, we had a meeting at my house in Cerdanyola with people interested in the book. Pedro, Sénder, possibly Darnell, and a few others Valverde brought with me whom I've never seen again were there. Perhaps some of them have continued studying the book, but I'd rather think not._

_This meeting left me with fond memories and the feeling that Begemann was a man of deep and cultivated spirituality._

_There was something special about that atmosphere, and I mentioned it. Begemann's response was surprising. He said, “I have felt the presence of the Thought Adjuster. I know it is here.” This comment was later analyzed by those of us who remained after the Baker-Begemann family had said their goodbyes._

_All this happened during the eighties, which was the period when I was most dedicated to the study of books._

<br style="clear:both;"/>

I believe that Pedro Valverde Tort dedicated the following years to maintaining relationships with friends linked in one way or another to the dissemination of _The Urantia Book_.

Between 1988 and 1994, Pedro Valverde collaborated extensively with Andreas Faber-Kaiser (1944-1994). Andreas directed, produced and presented the esoteric program _Sintonia Alfa_ on Catalunya Ràdio, alternating with the special program [Arxiu Secret](http://andreas.faber.cat/radio/) (Secret Archive) and the program [Què volen aquesta gent?](http://andreas.faber.cat/radio/) (What Do These People Want?), a series dedicated to extraterrestrial issues and unidentified flying objects.

Pedro Valverde was a friend and collaborator in most of the events developed by Andreas ([^1]) and similar in many of the ideas.

In fact, on August 12, 1988, Pedro appeared on the radio program _Què Volen Aquesta Gent_ on the topic of “Jesus of Nazareth.” On November 19, 1989, he appeared on the radio program _Sintonia Alfa_ on _The Urantia Book_ in general.

A few days after this last event on _Catalunya Ràdio_, on the 25th and 26th, Pedro appeared as a speaker at the III Symposium of the Ramón Llull Lodge of AMORC Rosicrucian Order, of which he was a Frater, and gave a lecture on “The mystery of _The Urantia Book_”.

In 1990, on January 16th, Pedro gave a talk/conference at the Abraxas (1972-1996) [^2] venue in Barcelona, which was located on Gelabert Street next to Josep Tarradellas (formerly Infanta Carlota) and no longer exists. The conference was organized by the Epsilon bookstore. At that colloquium, Pedro spoke about _The Urantia Book_ in general terms.

In December of that same year, more specifically on the 23rd, Pedro participated in the radio program _Sintonia Alfa_ on “The historical aspects of the Bible, in the light of Cosmogony”

Throughout 1991, the activities were varied, and of particular note were those held at the headquarters of the Ramón Llull Lodge in Barcelona on February 23, where Pedro gave a lecture on “Science and Consciousness.”

In December, the Third International Ufology Congress was held in Penedès on the 6th, 7th, and 8th. Pedro attended to give a lecture on “_The Urantia Book_ and Its Mystery.”

On the 22nd of that same month and year, Pedro appeared on Andreas Faber-Kaiser's radio program _Sintonia Alfa_ and spoke about “The Universe of Our Mind.”

1992 was a year in which Pedro participated in numerous events. On February 23rd, he appeared on the radio program _Sintonia Alfa_ on _Catalunya Ràdio_ and spoke about “Survival after Death.”

As the attached photo shows, Pedro will be giving a lecture on March 14th at 10:00 p.m. in the city of El Masnou, where he will once again present “The History of Survival After Death.”

In April, specifically on the 12th, he was called again by _Catalunya Ràdio_ to present on the radio program _Sintonia Alfa_ “The mystery of the sin of Adam and Eve.”

In June he moved to Madrid to appear on the program LA NOCHE on Radio Getafe, where Pedro talks about _The Urantia Book_.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

</figure>

Once again, on July 12, Pedro Valverde Tort, along with Francisco Gil Sarrión, participated in Andreas Faber Kaiser's program _Sintonia Alfa_ on _Catalunya Ràdio_ to discuss topics related to the “Rosicrucian Fellowship.”

That year, Pedro corresponded with Alejandro César Agostinelli of Buenos Aires, Argentina, director of the magazine UfoPress and secretary general of CIU (Commission for Ufological Research), whom he met at the Third International Congress of Ufology held in Penedès. In one of the letters in which Alejandro inquires about the future Spanish version of _The Urantia Book_, Pedro replies that it will soon be published in Spanish for the entire Spanish-speaking world.

Between September 9 and 10, Pedro was visited by Urantia Foundation Trustee Richard Keeler and Chief Translator Seppo Kanerva. The interview took place in connection with the new translation of _The Urantia Book_ into Spanish, which was being started in the United States by a translation company. Both Richard and Seppo wanted to check with Pedro whether the translation they had started was a success and asked him to translate Document 31 into Spanish so they could compare it with the translation translated by the American company. Correspondence continued on this subject from then on.

In October and December, Pedro returned to _Catalunya Ràdio_, first on “The First Men on Earth” and later on “The Archetypes of Adam and Eve.”

In mid-October of that year, Pedro wrote to the Foundation sending Document 31, which he had revised and translated. In that correspondence, he congratulated Seppo on opening the Australian Office with Trevor and Katleen Swadling.

In 1993, the Urantia Foundation of Chicago, through the American translation company Euramérica, based in New York, published _The Urantia Book_ in Spanish for the first time.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

<figure id="Figure_21" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/The_Urantia_Movement_in_Spain/020.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

In that same year, _The Urantia Book_ was also published for the first time in Finnish.

On May 2 of that same year, Pedro Valverde Tort, along with Ana Gardeñas, Ramón Martínez, Roser Lluch and Santiago Latorre, participated in the radio program _Sintonia Alfa_ about “People who have returned from the dead.”

Due to the fluid correspondence he maintained with Urantia Foundation in Chicago, in June, Pedro wrote to Damián Bondi, a member of Urantia Foundation in Chicago, and spoke about the importance of the book and how it changed his life. In the letter, he mentions that for 30 years his life has been guided by the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ and that it will continue to be so in the future. From this letter and some other information, we can deduce the years in which he began reading the book.

Although the exact date is unknown, that year Pedro Valverde Tort, along with Neus Albentosa and Ramón Hervás, participated in a program hosted by José Herrera on Hospitalet de Llobregat TV.

<figure id="Figure_22" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/The_Urantia_Movement_in_Spain/021.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

On September 26, Pedro appeared on the radio program _Sintonía Alfa_ about “The Diabolical Reality of UFOs.”

A series of lectures on parapsychology begins in October at the Barcelona Cultural Center, CETRES. This prestigious center hosts courses, seminars, lectures, and various other activities. (Annex 1)

On January 23, 1994, Pedro Valverde Tort and Francisco Gil Sarrión probably appeared for the last time on the _Catalunya Ràdio_ program _Sintonía Alfa_, presented by Andreas Faber Kaiser, to discuss the topic of “Who are the Rosicrucians?”

That same year, 1994, and specifically between April 8, 9, and 10, the “DELFOS Project” began at the Santo Espíritu de Gilet Monastery (Valencia). This project was carried out in collaboration with the Institute for Exobiological Research and Studies (IIEE), whose president and ufologist was Ramón Navia.

Pedro Valverde Tort, along with a series of researchers of some importance in “mysterious” and UFO subjects, articulate their experiences, knowledge and criteria to develop a document (Annex 4) that compiled a whole process of conclusions that each of them had reached regarding the multiple mysteries that encompassed the UFO subject.

A possible conclusion or synthesis of that statement could be something like: “_The phenomenon is one more manifestation of the multiple facets of a plane of existence or hidden universe, foreign to our material world subject to the laws of space-time._”

Before this encounter, Pedro had already held the theory, researched and studied, that there was a possibility that, in the dream process, through lucid dreams or “controlled” dream states, one could maintain a mental connection with personalities from other worlds and that this could have been occurring for a long time, including the “messages” of certain Marian apparitions.

Several meetings were subsequently held to delve deeper into the various cases under investigation. This project, to which he dedicated all his knowledge, remained active until the end of his life.

In July of this same year, _Le Livre d'Urantia_ was republished in France with the text corrected to a single column, in a single volume and with the same pagination as the original English _The Urantia Book_.

In early October, Pedro attended the Second International Congress for the Study of Altered States of Consciousness in Lérida (Appendix 1). This congress was sponsored by the _Institute for Anthropological Prospection_ in Barcelona, and he was invited to speak on “Otherness and Dreams.”

Also in early November, Pedro traveled to Olot to give a lecture on “The Strange World of Dreams.” Around the 16th of that same month, he traveled to Madrid, specifically to the headquarters of the Rosicrucian Order, where he shared a lecture with his brothers and sisters on “Man, a Cosmic Project.”

He began 1995 by dedicating himself to his most cherished treasure, the DELFOS Project, giving lectures, talks, interviews, and seminars. Of particular note was the one he gave on February 21st, entitled “A Great Cosmic Adventure Awaits Us Beyond Death.”

Without warning, in November of that same year, Pedro was diagnosed with an incurable illness. He lived with it for almost a year, and on October 2nd, Pedro Valverde Tort passed away at the age of 68. Truly, very young.

At this point, after the appropriate investigations, I must state that Pedro Valverde Tort, already at a very young age, in late 1947, was demonstrating his abilities. Proof of this is this clipping from the newspaper La Vanguardia.

<br>

</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

Pedro, a man who was already showing promise before reaching his twenties, became a versatile, self-taught individual well-versed in many different fields of knowledge. Throughout his life, he maintained contact with a wide range of people, who in one way or another came into contact with him on subjects as diverse as parapsychology, ufology, the mystery of “communications,” dreams, life after death, and many other elements that significantly influence human life.

Pedro never formed a study group as such, although he certainly had some friends within his circle of friends who were more in tune with the book's ideas, and he met with them at various times. They didn't maintain rules for following or reading the text as a group. There were comments, debates, and some in-depth discussions, but not much more.

Of course, it goes without saying that all his research was inspired by the text and teachings of _The Urantia Book_. As he once said, “This book transformed my life.”

Pedro Valverde Tort left this letter written in his study books in which he said:

_Hello, sister, welcome to the club._

_If this book has come into your hands, you can be absolutely certain that it was not by chance, but by “causality.” Three years ago, exactly the same thing happened to me. And during these thirty years, with periods of greater or lesser dedication, the book has been a constant source of surprises for me, so much so that today I still discover nuances in the text that give me the impression that I am reading it for the first time. It is not simple reading material. It is study material. $$$ of in-depth study, I guarantee you. I remember that in my early days of dedication to the book, it often felt like a burden, like a “brick” difficult to digest, easy to put aside. But that didn't happen, although it was a true miracle. One day I decided to put it away temporarily, but the situation didn't last too long. And this happened because I attempted a type of reading that is normally considered inadvisable. (I warn you that nothing in the Book is normal.) I simply devoted my full attention to reading the Fourth Part—The Life and Teachings of Jesus—in addition to thoroughly understanding the General Index of the work. It was like finding Ariadne's Milestone that allowed me to confront its overall content. It was a key that paved the way for a strange understanding. Reading the Third Part in its entirety, the need constantly arose to consult other previous sections to clarify confusing terms. I had to resort to other terms, and so on, constantly going back and forth, back and forth in the Book. Suddenly, at a certain point during the reading, I had a kind of global understanding of the spirit of the work, of something that went beyond the printed letter, just as it happens with the poetry of San Juan de la Cruz._

_I can't say what that revelatory way of understanding the Book consists of. It's a personal, inner experience, which I imagine to be different in its manifestation for each of us, although the same in its cultured purpose._

_It's the only advice I can give you before you start reading it: follow the indicated method. It was crucial for this. Before that happened, I was distracted by studying the nature of each tree in a tangled forest. Then I realized that, as a whole, it was a forest, an Entity absolved of itself._

_I wish you luck. And, I repeat, “welcome to the club.”_


A good friend of his said goodbye to him, saying:

“_In the temple of the New Life where the seven Radial Halls of resurrection extend, the angels await you and, with your new glorified body, you will continue your ascending path, where the Melchizedek masters will satisfy your thirst for knowledge and, by the hand of Christ, you will safely reach the permanent abode of the Universal Father, the Central Island of Paradise._”

_Until then, my friend, may the love of the Father unite us._

## Part Two

**ELSEWHERE IN SPAIN**

While all these events were taking place in Catalonia, a series of events were also occurring almost simultaneously in Andalusia, more specifically in Seville, which over time had, if anything, even greater significance.

It all began around 1977 when Mr. Ignacio Darnaude Rojas Marcos in Seville, reading a novel about extraterrestrial life forms, read a footnote that said: Adam and Eve (_The Urantia Book_).

<figure id="Figure_26" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/The_Urantia_Movement_in_Spain/023.jpg">
</figure>

Ignacio, a lifelong Sevillian, is a person of unique characteristics: extroverted, friendly, a great conversationalist, and a very good friend to his friends. Ignacio Darnaude Rojas Marcos was born in Seville on November 18, 1931. He has three children from his first wife. He later married Mariluz. With a degree in Economics and Business Administration, his career has been linked to banking.

His oratory, drawn from his personal vocabulary, is surely informed by the hundreds of books he's read. An entire home could become his personal library. He began searching, in his own words, “_at the age of military service,_” when he was in his early twenties. One of the first books he read about unidentified flying objects was “_The Mystery of the Flying Saucers._”

<br style="clear:both;"/>

I'd venture to say that his greatest dedication has been reading and researching all kinds of phenomena, but especially those devoted to ufology and its derivatives. Thus, throughout his life, he has established friendships with the most famous figures in this enigmatic world.

He has been researching and writing about the UFO phenomenon and contactees for over 50 years. He has attended several conferences related to these UFO incidents, presenting several papers. He has given numerous lectures and granted numerous interviews. He has written hundreds of articles on sightings and contactees. He has compiled a catalog of just under 1,500 pages called _UMMOCAT_, which covers all the letters received from alleged Ummites. He has published at least five books since 2014, including several earlier, including “_The Principle of Cosmic Elusiveness,_” “_Revealed Books on ET Contact Syndrome,_” “_Extraterrestrial Destiny in the 21st Century,_” “_Life After Death,_” and “_Metaphysical Questions._”

At one point he was asked how he defined the “Principle of Cosmic Elusiveness” and he commented on it:

> _The vast and fascinating intangible world is intentionally and purposefully invisible. Evidence about fascinating issues that are out there but cannot be captured by the senses has been deliberately withheld from us. This deliberate concealment of sensory evidence is called elusiveness._

Simply speechless, and if anything were to be added, it would be something like, in my opinion, that he is one of the most renowned and recognized ufologists in our country. Ignacio once remarked that “_anyone who is obsessed and insists on knowing the whys and wherefores of things is an aspiring philosopher._”

The thing is, Ignatius, upon reading “Adam and Eve (_The Urantia Book_),” became interested in the subject and located the Foundation in Chicago that houses the book, so he requested a copy. Once he had it in his hands, he read its 2,097 pages continuously for several months.

<figure id="Figure_27" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/The_Urantia_Movement_in_Spain/026.jpg">
</figure>

It didn't end there. Ignacio, a close friend of Antonio Moya Cerpa, with whom he was primarily interested in ufology at the time, commented on the existence and content of the book (I should add at this point that Antonio Moya told me at the time that he got into this primarily because of Ignacio's explanations and tenacity in giving him details of the book's contents).

<br style="clear:both;"/>

I had the opportunity to meet him and interact with Ignacio Darnaude for the first time in Seville due to a visit made by several members of the board of directors of the Urantia Association of Spain.

<figure id="Figure_28" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/The_Urantia_Movement_in_Spain/025.jpg">
</figure>

Antonio Moya was born in 1948 in Seville (Spain). When he was 26, he began to investigate phenomena such as UFOs, Oui-ja, extraterrestrial contacts, mediumship, revealed books, etc. He found the French translation of _The Urantia Book_ at the age of 30, and since then his life has never been the same.

He participated in reading and correcting the first Papers of the 1993 Spanish translation, but ceased to participate in this task due to differences of opinion with the other reviewers. In 1995, Urantia Foundation asked Antonio to review and correct the Spanish translation. He enlisted the help of members of his study group (which included between 10 and 12 people) and Seppo Kanerva, Urantia Foundation's Director of Translations. This revision-retranslation took about seven years.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

My wife and I had the opportunity to meet Antonio Moya and other members of the Seville study group in 1997, at the First National Meeting of Readers of _The Urantia Book_, held in Alcalá de Guadaira (Seville) and organized by the study group itself. We also had the opportunity to meet several readers at that meeting with whom we maintain very good relations today.

Years later, when I began to take an interest in the history of _The Urantia Book_ in Spain, I asked Antonio a couple of questions, to which he responded as follows:

Question: - Antonio, tell me, how did you get started in this Urantia thing?

_Answer: - Around 1977, Ignacio Darnaude Rojas-Marcos, a good friend of ufology, requested_ The Urantia Book _in English from the Chicago Foundation and began reading it. Every day, for about nine months, he told me what he had read the day before. After some time, I began to get interested in the subject, and, since I didn't speak English well, I tried to find the work in French, since it didn't exist in Spanish. After some negotiations with the French embassy in Madrid, they gave me the publisher's address in Paris. I ordered the book and received it around March 1978._

_I started reading it on the first page and, within a few months, finished it on the last. I found it so fascinating that I told my friends at the time about it, most of them ufologists, and other spiritualists, seekers, and those just generally curious._

_I received people at my home, and our meetings sometimes lasted until the wee hours of the morning. Everyone discussed their own line of research, but they weren't formal meetings to read Urantia. It was an interesting mix, and we were all very enthusiastic._

_As time went on, we began to meet more formally to read Urantia. Since it wasn't available in Spanish, I translated aloud from French, while the others listened. We continued like this for many years, until the translation was published in 1993._

_Over the years, the number of people attending has changed, with some leaving and new ones arriving. We've always met between 7 and 12 people on Saturday or Sunday afternoons, and each week we try to change the meeting location, either at one person's home or at another's._

_Of the people who have been in the group for 20 years, only Esteban and Josefina remain_ ( $\dagger$ ). _Those before this date gradually stopped coming until they disappeared from our lives, and later friends who used to come to the meetings stopped doing so due to conflicts between members of the group._

_The Seville group has gone through all sorts of ups and downs. There have been periods of enthusiasm and times of disappointment. There have been periods when we haven't met at all. We have hosted many people from other countries—trustees, readers, Foundation representatives, etc. We have organized the first Readers' Gatherings in Spain. We have collaborated on the first translation of the book (in 1993) and have completed the complete retranslation of The Urantia Book European Edition into Spanish (2009). We have published articles on Urantia, maintained contact with readers in other countries, etc. etc. We are a very diverse group of people, with very different levels of interest and understanding of the work._

_And here we are, each with his own personal struggle, always trying to find new horizons where we can be useful._

Question: In the beginning, were you aware of anyone else reading _The Urantia Book_ in Spain?

_Answer: For years, we were unaware of anyone else reading_ The Urantia Book _in Spain. Later, we discovered J.J. Benítez's book, “Dreams,” in which he reprinted some paragraphs from the book. Later, I learned from him that a man in Barcelona, Pedro Valverde Tort, sent him Spanish translations of the book that he had written, and that Benítez, even though he didn't know what the story was about, included some of those translations in his work “Dreams.”_

<br>

<figure id="Figure_29" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/The_Urantia_Movement_in_Spain/027.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

_I don't know if Pedro Valverde started before us or not. The fact is that I haven't encountered any study groups, as such, before ours._

_I met Ferran Ballester in person in Vinaroz. He came with his wife, invited (like us) to the home of Albert Bakker (brother-in-law of Henry Begemann, the Foundation's first representative for Europe). Bakker spoke Spanish very well, although he was Dutch, because he had worked for many years in South America. He was already retired and spent time with his wife in Vinaroz (Castellón). During that visit, Albert Bakker and his wife Margarita gave my wife and me a copy of The Urantia Book, signed in his own hand and dated August 26, 1981. But I've lost track of Ferran since then. I believe he was an ophthalmologist, and he told us that the book had changed his life. I suppose that, like Valverde and myself, he read it in French, since it didn't exist in Spanish._

From these dates in 1978, Antonio Moya, as he clearly explains in the interview, took a special interest in reading those photocopies of the book La Cosmogonie d'Urantia that he received in French, which led him to believe that the content should be shared with more people.

Initially, Antonio made contact with the Urantia Foundation in Chicago, and thanks to this, he was visited in Seville over the course of several years by various people associated with the Foundation. Henry Begemann was particularly notable among them. Later, when he embarked on the project to translate The Urantia Book into Spanish, he was visited by Dick Prince, with whom he maintained a long correspondence. Lynne Kulieke, daughter of one of the Forum members, also visited his home. Trustees Richard Keeler, Georges Dupont, and others also visited him.

Initially, Antonio was alone, but after a while, he found it necessary to begin reading _The Urantia Book_ as a group. This was achieved mainly thanks to the way he spread the word among his ufologist, spiritualist, and seeker friends. It's worth noting that this was the first study group in Spain, which met regularly to read and analyze it.

Antonio Moya, personally, over time, published several articles in different magazines of national interest on specific topics related to the content of _The Urantia Book_.

The entire Seville Group actively participated in promoting the book among friends and acquaintances and always maintained very close contact with the Foundation members in Chicago. The fundamental reasons for these relationships were diverse, such as ongoing projects, the translation of the book into Spanish, getting to know the various members, how they interacted, what their free time activities were, observing the study group, spending a few days of vacation with them, etc., even to the point that some members of the Seville group, such as Esteban Cotán and Juan Carlos Durán, were able to travel to the Foundation headquarters at 533 Diversey Parkway in Chicago, Illinois, at the invitation of the trustees themselves.

In 1995, the Foundation decided to commission Antonio Moya, in collaboration with the Seville Study Group, to create a new translation of _The Urantia Book_.

After nearly twenty years of reading _The Urantia Book_ and having previously attended a National Meeting in France, the group came up with the idea of organizing a meeting in Spain and, as I mentioned earlier, they developed everything by inviting all the Spanish readers who they knew, through the Foundation, were potential readers of the book in Spain.

The first National Readers' Meeting of _The Urantia Book_ was held from May 1 to 4, 1997, in the Oromana Hotel, Alcalá de Guadaira, near Seville. [First Meeting](http://www.librodeurantia.es/?q=node/14)

Two of the Urantia Foundation trustees, Georges Dupont and Richard Keeler, attended this meeting. They presented topics related to the Foundation and _The Urantia Book_, while also answering questions from the audience. Two interesting topics were also raised: the formation of a _Urantia Book_ Readers' Association in Spain and the creation of a magazine for Spanish readers.

These were moments of true dedication, as Antonio would translate a document during the week and meet with the group on Sunday afternoon to comment on, correct, or modify paragraphs or words that needed to be changed. Once approved, the translation was sent to Mr. Seppo Kanerva, Chief Translation Officer at the time, for supervision, and once completed, each document was filed until all 196 documents were completed.

The Second National Meeting of Readers of _The Urantia Book_ was held 10 km from the city of Miranda de Ebro, province of Burgos, between April 29 and 30 and May 1, 2 and 3, 1998, at the Monastery of El Espino. This was a typically Castilian place, nestled in the nearby historic town of Santa Gadea del Cid. The event was organized by some local readers of the book, friends, my wife and I. [Second Meeting](http://www.librodeurantia.es/?q=node/15)

As an anecdote, I can say that it was the meeting that lasted the longest and had the most attendees. A humorous manifesto was also drafted there, containing a “Declaration of Intent” for the smooth running of future meetings.

Once the meeting was over, several candidates took over the baton so that the next meeting could be organized over the next 365 days. Initially, a couple of readers residing in Toledo offered to participate, but they were unable to do so due to circumstances that were never clarified. It took several years for Spanish readers of The Urantia Book to gather again to read it.

<figure id="Figure_30" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/The_Urantia_Movement_in_Spain/029.jpg">
</figure>

At the beginning of the summer of 2001, several of my “die-hard” reader friends got together to analyze the situation and consider whether it was worth organizing a national meeting. We discussed it extensively from all possible perspectives and came to the conclusion that it was necessary for us Spanish readers to meet again.

As a result of the various conversations, it was decided to first obtain information about addresses, phone numbers, etc., from Spanish readers, in order to contact them by letter or phone call to inform them of our intentions; then, to organize all the arrangements related to dates, location, venue, etc.

While all this was happening, in early September of that same year, my wife and I were invited by the Seville Study Group to a meeting convened by the Urantia Foundation through its trustees at the Hotel Colón in the same city.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

The reason for this event was to attempt to reach some agreements to resolve the controversy that had arisen from the publication in the same edition of _The Urantia Book_ with the Prologue and the First Part with an improved translation by Antonio Moya and the Study Group.

<figure id="Figure_31" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/The_Urantia_Movement_in_Spain/028.jpg">
</figure>

After various conversations, a series of agreements were reached that did not bear the desired fruit over time.

That meeting at the Hotel Colón also served to establish the Urantia Association of Spain. At that time, the International Urantia Association (IUA) was affiliated with the Urantia Foundation, which sought to promote the creation of national reader associations. That first board was made up of readers from the Seville Group: Esteban Cotán (president), Víctor Izquierdo (vice president), María José García Canseco (secretary), and Elías García Canseco (treasurer).

<br style="clear:both;"/>

It should also be noted that the representative of the Urantia Foundation in Spain at the time, our dear friend David Carrera, a reader of _The Urantia Book_ and a native of León, was present at this meeting.

Time passed and finally the Third National Meeting of Readers of _The Urantia Book_ was held in the city of Cáceres between October 31 and November 3, 2002, almost four years after the previous one, in a convent of nuns located next to the shrine of Our Lady of the Mountain. [Third Meeting](http://www.librodeurantia.es/?q=node/16)

Unlike previous programs, the program was not based on workshops. This time, four discussions were organized on the four parts of the book, preceded by a pre-prepared introduction.

It's worth noting that this meeting was the first in which all attendees were committed to delving deeper into _The Urantia Book_. It was clear that the vast majority of the audience had read the entire book. Both factors contributed to the high-level discussions at this meeting. Add to this the atmosphere of fellowship that permeated throughout, and we can say that the overall outcome was very positive.

In 2003, no national events were organized, but we did receive visitors. Between November 18 and 19, I was visited by several local readers, along with Trustee Richard Keeler and the Foundation's liaison with Spanish-speaking readers, Victor Garcia. The purpose of this visit was to consult us on our opinions of the Spanish translation of _The Urantia Book_, published in 1993. They spent several days in Spain, visiting as many reader groups as they could find on their agendas: Seville, Madrid, Barcelona, etc.

<figure id="Figure_32" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/The_Urantia_Movement_in_Spain/030.jpg">
</figure>

At the beginning of December, a group of “hardcore readers” met in Sigüenza. We did so at the end of the year in a wonderful, newly renovated accommodation provided by our friend and reader, Rafael Modéjar.

In those days we made wise decisions that sought to change the trajectory of the Urantia movement in Spain.

We decided to volunteer to renew the current leadership of the movement, not because it wasn't working or was working poorly, but rather because we felt it needed “fresh blood.” It was also agreed to obtain information to draft national bylaws that would allow for the establishment of a National Association. If events proceeded as planned, we would attempt to mediate and obtain a list of potential Spanish readers from Urantia Foundation in Chicago.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

At this mini-meeting, it was also decided to prepare a next National Meeting for May 2004.

In early 2004, Olga López in Barcelona and Mariano Pérez in Madrid created two new study groups in Spain, the first to be created after the Seville study group.

As planned, we, the readers of _The Urantia Book_, met once again in a town in Segovia called San Rafael, from May 13 to 16, 2004. [IV Meeting](http://www.librodeurantia.es/?q=node/17)

One of the most notable events of that Meeting was that, after a group of attendees, including members of the board of directors of the Urantia Association of Spain, met, it was decided to form a new board of directors. Its initial composition was as follows: Olga López (president), myself, Eduardo (vice president), Andrés Pérez from Barakaldo (treasurer), and Santiago Rodríguez (from Reus and a member of the Barcelona study group) as secretary.

From this meeting emerged new guidelines that would lead the new Association down paths more in line with current circumstances.

After the Meeting, steps were taken to make the association accessible to the widest possible audience. This involved not only publishing small advertisements in the magazines Enigmas, Año Cero, and Más Allá, but also establishing an online presence. The initiative to create a website ([Website of the Urantia Association of Spain](http://www.librodeurantia.es/)) was born, as well as the publication of a semiannual newsletter that would include articles written by Spanish readers, as well as Spanish translations of articles published in other languages. This magazine would be renamed “Luz y Vida” [Light and Life](http://www.librodeurantia.es/node/7)

Activities are proposed to promote study groups throughout Spain, such as visits, presentations, lectures, etc., as well as placing _The Urantia Book_ in public libraries.

In July of this same year (2004), a representative from the Junta attended the Parliament of Religions, held for the first time in Europe. It was held in Barcelona, within the framework of the Universal Forum of Cultures. We attended because members of the Fellowship (a readers' association that emerged from the Urantia Brotherhood, created by the Foundation) sent a delegation with a stand and two representatives who gave lectures as speakers.

At that event, we had the opportunity to meet several international readers such as Gard Jameson, Moussa Ndiaye, Agustín Arellano, etc.

The opportunity was taken to speak with Trustee Gard Jameson about the much-anticipated publication of the new Spanish translation of _The Urantia Book_, already completed by Antonio Moya and the Seville Group.

In 2005, the Urantia Foundation trustees were looking to form a team to revise the 1993 translation, as it had been decided not to publish Antonio Moya's translation. Early in the year, a Biscayan engineer, Carmelo Martínez Ortiz de Zárate, a solo reader of the book, “appeared.” He contacted the foundation to offer the translation he had been working on for the past few years, as he found the 1993 translation to be deficient. This, coupled with the need to find someone who could be part of the revision work that was being undertaken, led to the request to join the team.

Having made the necessary contacts and spoken about him to the Foundation, the Board of Trustees invited him to Chicago to meet him personally between April 14 and 17, 2005. Once there, the various members of the Foundation, including the trustees, met and believed he was the right person. This led to him becoming part of the team, along with other Latin American members already established as a proofreading team, and the corresponding procedures for revising the 1993 edition were initiated.

From April 29th to May 2nd, 2005 we celebrated the V National Meeting at the Sacred Hearts Convent of San Lorenzo de El Escorial (Madrid) [V Meeting](http://www.librodeurantia.es/?q=node/18) and [Light and Life No. 1](http://www.librodeurantia.es/sites/default/files/LyV1.pdf)

In 2005, the process of establishing the Urantia Association of Spain began. That year, another new study group was established in the Balearic Islands, specifically in Mallorca. Its leader was Catalina Covas, an enthusiastic and active reader who even maintained two study groups in Palma de Mallorca and the surrounding area. She enthusiastically led the various readers on the island, always striving to emphasize the importance of this revelation for personal growth.

The VI Meeting of Readers took us to Segovia, in the incomparable setting of the Monastery of San Juan de la Cruz, between April 28 and May 1, 2006. [VI Meeting](http://www.librodeurantia.es/?q=node/19) and [Light and Life No. 5](http://www.librodeurantia.es/sites/default/files/LyV5.pdf)

Another highlight of that year was that we offered to organize the 2009 Urantia Association International conference. In preparing for it, we aimed to involve all the study groups that existed in Spain at that time.

That year also saw the launch of the EDEN (School of Natural Spiritual Development) project, a personal project of Mariano Pérez that for a time involved readers from various study groups. The purpose of this project was to make the book's teachings known to seekers of Truth. Ultimately, the project was left “fallow,” awaiting its time.

At the end of October 2006, our president was invited by Urantia Association International to visit its headquarters in Chicago, specifically to the iconic building located at 533 Diversey Parkway. The purpose of the invitation was to be part of a UAI delegation that was to meet with the Foundation's trustees to explore avenues for rapprochement between UAI and the Fellowship. The trip was also used to establish friendly relations with the trustees and members of the international association.

Due to circumstances described in issue 17 of our magazine Luz y Vida, specifically at the beginning of the article “Genesis of the Conference,” the curiosity of taxi driver, book reader, and friend Thomas Sánchez Mateos, unbeknownst to him, triggered the course of events. The link is provided below. Because of this, we found it necessary to move our venue for the VII Meeting to the Hotel Vistamar in Benalmádena, Málaga. We were able to maintain the dates and program since it could not be held in Toledo for reasons beyond our control. [VII Meeting](http://www.librodeurantia.es/?q=node/20) and [Luz y Vida No. 9](http://www.librodeurantia.es/sites/default/files/LyV9.pdf)

A few months after the national meeting, we received the news that the new translation of _The Urantia Book_, developed with hard work and dedication by Antonio Moya in collaboration with members of the Seville Study Group, has been authorized for publication.

We are informed that this Association must cover the printing costs and that, to differentiate it from the publication published by the Foundation in 1993, it will be called _The Urantia Book_ (European Edition). From then on, members and other staff are informed of the need to contribute a sum to cover the cost of the books to be published.

The Association finally obtained legal status, and on October 29, 2007, we were registered in the Registry of Associations of the Spanish Ministry of the Interior.

At the beginning of 2008, it was very welcome news for everyone associated with the Association to learn that the trustees of the Urantia Foundation in Chicago had appointed our president, Olga López, as an associate trustee. This appointment helped establish stronger and better relationships of all kinds with the various members of the Foundation and, likewise, with members of the International Urantia Association. She is a computer engineer with a degree in philosophy and the author of three novels, several essays, and several articles. [Books](http://www.librodeurantia.es/node/364).

Olga held the position for five years with dedication and responsibility, attending every meeting the trustees held at the Foundation building in Chicago. Throughout this journey, our president met numerous people connected to the international Urantia movement, establishing fruitful and cordial ties, which continue to this day, largely for the socialization and fellowship of all its members.

From May 2nd to 4th, 2008, we decided to hold the 8th National Meeting of _Urantia Book_ Readers at the Hotel Osuna in Madrid. [8th Meeting](http://www.librodeurantia.es/?q=node/21) and [Light and Life No. 13](http://www.librodeurantia.es/sites/default/files/LyV13.pdf)

In October, and in reference to the printing of the European Edition, the director of the company that had printed the first paperbacks of the 1993 edition referred us to other printers since that company did not publish less than 10,000 copies and our expectations ranged between 1,500 or 2,500 copies, at most, the economic cost of which was expected to be covered by contributions received from readers.

At the beginning of November, we visited the study group led by Cati (Catalina Covas, now deceased) in Mallorca. Indeed, on the weekend of the 1st and 2nd, President Olga López and I, accompanied by our respective spouses, flew to the island. [LyV15 News](http://www.librodeurantia.es/sites/default/files/LyV15.pdf)

By mid-November, the association had raised most of the money needed to finance the printing of the European edition of _The Urantia Book_.

The second weekend of March, several board members (Olga, Andrés, and I) traveled to Madrid to visit the study group members and give a presentation of _The Urantia Book_ in one of the Ecocentro rooms located on Esquilache Street.

April arrives, and with all the arrangements for the International Conference practically in place, my wife and I headed to the Vistamar Hotel in Benalmádena, Málaga, a week before the conference was scheduled to take place and made all the preparations with the hotel manager.

On the 17th, we began the international event that the four members of the board of directors, along with the twelve members of the Organizing Committee, had been preparing for almost three years. The Vistamar Hotel hosted us for five days, during which we enjoyed the company of more than 117 people from 20 different countries.

Between October 10th and 12th, a mini-meeting was organized for several Spanish readers in the town of San Rafael, Segovia, at the same accommodation where the IV Meeting was held: La Casona del Pinar, a leisure residence. Various comments were made on topics from the book, as well as PowerPoint presentations by Mariano and me. The possibility of a presentation on the new European Edition was discussed. We enjoyed three unforgettable days of good atmosphere and long talks, as well as good food and generous walks through pine forests.

In 2009, three new study groups were established. The one in Mallorca, which had been somewhat disbanded due to the death of its leader, was established; a new one in Murcia; and another in Girona.

In May 2010, the IX National Meeting was held at La Casa Toya, a nursing home located in the small town of Aluenda (Zaragoza), where members of the Board had met on previous occasions. We met on the weekend of May 7-9 (inclusive) to enjoy a seminar given by Sheila Keene-Lund, a reader born in Spain to an English father and Puerto Rican mother who has lived in the U.S. since her adolescence. Sheila had recently published a book on the teachings of _The Urantia Book_, Heaven Is Not the Last Stop, and we invited her to give a seminar so she could share her way of spreading the teachings.

Olga, Andrés, and I represented the Association at the EcoAltea environmental fair, held annually in the Levantine city of Altea, from October 1st to 3rd, 2010. We set up a tent and displayed _The Urantia Book_, brochures, and publications related to the book. PowerPoint presentations about the book's teachings were also shown. [Light and Life No. 23](http://www.librodeurantia.es/sites/default/files/LyV23.pdf)

We ended the year by expanding the number of study groups with the gathering of several readers from Malaga.

The Urantia Association of Spain invited all Spanish readers, members, and friends to the National Meeting held from May 5th to 8th, 2011, in Valls, Tarragona. [10th Meeting](http://www.librodeurantia.es/?q=node/267) and Light and Life No. 25

A few days after the meeting, on Sunday the 22nd, President Olga and I traveled to Seville with our respective spouses for the Book Fair taking place in the city of Seville to give a lecture/presentation on _The Urantia Book_ in the events tent in Plaza Nueva. Our presence there was promoted by the ANATMA Bookstore.

In July, Urantia Association International sponsored the Leadership Symposium held at Techny Towers, north of Chicago. A pair of Urantia Association members from Spain, Mariano and Ismael, attended, along with our president, Olga. [Leadership and Light and Life Symposium No. 26](http://www.urantia.org/news/2011-09/urantia-book-readers-study-together-this-summer)

Shortly after this event, in September, the board members decided to appoint Mariano Pérez Blanco as head of the Study Group Committee. Since then, Mariano has made and continues to make trips (Seville, Malaga, Valencia, Mallorca, etc.) to various provincial capitals in Spain, whenever requested by readers or groups, to guide, organize, or give lectures, seeking to promote and encourage readers to create book study groups.

At the end of 2011, Olga joined the board of directors of UBIS (_Urantia Book_ Internet School, sponsored by the Urantia Foundation), with the aim of creating and promoting the Spanish-language organizational branch of UBIS. After an initial trial course in September 2011, to which Latin American and Spanish readers were invited, UBIS began offering courses in Spanish in early 2012. The school itself had been offering online courses since 1999, but until this year they were only offered in English. This first year, three courses were offered in Spanish, one per quarter.

Also in January, our president, Olga López, was invited to be interviewed on the program “Lights in the Darkness” on ABC Punto Radio, broadcast from Barcelona throughout Spain. The interview lasted forty minutes and explained the history of _The Urantia Book_ and its highlights. [Interview](http://lucesenlaoscuridad.es/entradas_grabacion/los-misterios-y-ensenanzas-del-libro-de-urantia-entrevista-a-olga-lopez-presidenta-de-la-asociacion-urantia-de-espana-2/)

At the end of April, the International Conference sponsored by Urantia Association International was held from April 28th to May 2nd in Medellín, Colombia. Our president attended the conference. [CI 2012](http://www.urantia.org/en/news/2012-06/mi-viaje-colombia-sudamerica)

Between May 11 and 13 of this year, we held the XI National Meeting at the “Inturjoven” Hostel located at 2 Isaac Peral Street (Reina Mercedes) in Seville.

At this meeting, it is worth noting that almost the entire board of directors of the association was renewed. The outgoing members had held their positions for eight years, and it was time for them to be replaced. Carmelo Martínez then became president; Jaime Marco, from the Murcia study group, was appointed vice president. Ismael Gracia, from Roquetes (Tarragona) and a member of the Barcelona study group, was appointed secretary.

I was unable to leave my position, but I changed my position from vice president to treasurer. However, Olga voluntarily agreed to continue maintaining the Association's website and publishing the magazine Luz y Vida. We also asked her to remain with the new leadership as an advisor with voice but no vote, which she gladly accepted. [XI Meeting](http://www.librodeurantia.es/?q=node/339) and [Luz y Vida No. 29](http://www.librodeurantia.es/sites/default/files/LyV29.pdf)

In June, a mini-meeting held in the city of Talavera de la Reina among an informal group of readers made headlines. It was said to be an enriching meeting, with discussions and comments, resulting in a commitment to formalize a new study group, led by Paloma Gutiérrez, a reader of the book and friend of the Association.

A month later, at the beginning of July, Olga López and Ismael Gracia gave a presentation of _The Urantia Book_ at the “Green House” in Barcelona, a meeting place where spiritual progression and changes in consciousness were encouraged among some citizens of that cosmopolitan city.

A good news highlight was the talk and presentation given by Ismael Gracia in one of the rooms of the FNAC bookstore in Valencia, at the end of September. [News](http://www.librodeurantia.es/sites/default/files/LyV30.pdf) And we must not forget the presentation given by the president of the Association, Carmelo Martínez, in the town of L'Aldea, Tarragona, in October, which several readers attended. [Light and Life No. 31](http://www.librodeurantia.es/sites/default/files/LyV31.pdf)

In early January 2013, thanks to readers in Brazil who “lent” us hours in a virtual room, the board members created the Virtual Study Group (GEV), where readers, mostly Spanish, could meet to read and study _The Urantia Book_. Currently, the group meets virtually in a Zoom platform room contracted by the Urantia Association of Spain.

At the end of February, our secretary, Ismael Gracia, went to Seville for an interview on a video program called “Confidencias en el Camarote” (Confidences in the Cabin) on Cadena Gelves. The video (below) and [Luz y Vida No. 32](http://www.librodeurantia.es/sites/default/files/LyV32.pdf)

The day after this interview, we were informed of the passing of Josefina Canseco, the “Mother Spirit of Spain,” as Richard Keeler, one of the Foundation's trustees, once called her. She left us to take a trip to the mansion worlds on the morning of February 26th. She hadn't been doing well for some time; she was admitted on Wednesday the 20th, and finally, on Tuesday the 26th, she said goodbye to us, although, as we all know, not forever. Josefina was always motivating relationships among readers from Seville and throughout Spain. Long meetings of readers, supporters, and friends of _The Urantia Book_ were held at her home. She had two children, Elías and Mª José, who grew up among her writing. She lived her last years in the company of Esteban Cotán, also a reader from Seville, a good and wise man. Another enthusiastic and conversationalist with whom one could spend hours enthralled in the paragraphs of the book.

Jaime Marco, our vice president, gave a presentation at the FNAC Diagonal in Barcelona on March 15, where he was accompanied by several readers.

In mid-April, we launched what we're now calling “The Urantia Corner,” an online discussion forum, a new reader-to-read commentary list, developed primarily as a place to discuss, comment, or give opinions on any of the many topics contained in _The Urantia Book_.

Readers from several European countries, including Spain (Olga, Paco, Fran) met in Frankfurt on April 27 and 28 at the invitation of “The Blue Club” (El Club Azul), including the president of the UAI, to create dissemination activities aimed at European societies, where secularization is the dominant element, in order to promote the teachings of _The Urantia Book_.

Mariano Pérez gave a talk and book presentation at the Cinco Anillos bookstore in Málaga, in collaboration with members of the local study group.

We've reached the month of May, and once again this year, the Spanish readers of _The Urantia Book_ are reunited. This trip marks a repeat of the same event. We were together from May 31st to June 2nd [12th Gathering](http://www.librodeurantia.es/?q=node/353) and [Light and Life No. 33](http://www.librodeurantia.es/sites/default/files/LyV33.pdf).

It is worth mentioning that two new study groups were formalized this year, one in Valencia and another in Torrevieja (Alicante).

For the second time, coinciding with the 2nd Consciousness, Art, and Sentiment Fair held in L'Aldea, Tarragona, our secretary, Ismael Gracia, was invited on October 19th to give a talk/presentation in the Town Hall Auditorium on _The Urantia Book_, entitled “The Great Adventure.” He was accompanied by several readers.

Olga López gave a presentation on April 20 at 9:00 p.m. in the virtual room of the Urantia Association of Brazil with the title THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IN THE 21ST CENTURY

Between May 23rd and 25th, the readers of _The Urantia Book_ met once again in Valencia for the National Meeting organized by the board of directors of the Urantia Association of Spain and with the collaboration of several members of the Valencia study group.

This year, from August 21st to 24th, a European _Urantia Book_ Readers' Conference was held in Berlin, Germany, organized by The Blue Club. Fifty-five people from thirteen European countries attended the event, including Olga, Paco, and Fran from Spain. Special mention should be made of the presence of Chris Wood, President of UAI, and Urantia Foundation Associate Trustees Richard Jernigan (USA) and Sandra Burga-Cisneros (resident of Switzerland but originally from Peru).

At the end of August, our president, Carmelo Martínez, recorded a video presentation-invitation through the audiovisual medium Pandora's Box. He spoke, as expected, about _The Urantia Book_ and called his talk “A Transforming Revelation.” In this presentation, the author begins by talking about the transformation that occurs in the reader as they delve deeper into its reading and study. He delights us by talking about the capacity one achieves to obtain a certain cosmic vision of the entire content of The Reality. At the end, he invites us to make the decision to read it and to do so with the necessary patience to use it as a "tool" for our own personal growth, since its entire content is brimming with coherence. Throughout this presentation, the speaker is asked several questions on various topics related to the book's content. He was able to give satisfactory answers to all of them. Video (below)

Mariano Pérez gave a talk on September 14th at 10:00 PM (Spanish time) in the AUB virtual room. The title was “WORSHIP AND MEDITATION.” This talk was repeated on October 5th due to technical problems in the room, which caused some participants to be out of place.

On October 2nd, Olga López gave a talk-presentation on _The Urantia Book_ in the Alexandria Room of Espai Natura in Girona. Several people attended, including readers and invited friends, filling the room, which had a capacity of about 25. Olga spent about 45 minutes talking, and then began a period for questions and answers, which lasted as long as, if not longer than, the presentation. There were all kinds of questions, the most notable of which were about how the book came to be, reincarnation, and so on.

We are in the month of November, and on the weekend of the 21st to the 23rd, board members met and among the various things they developed, it is worth highlighting some video recordings they made entitled “Agora Nostra,” aimed at presenting different topics from _The Urantia Book_ in a colloquial way. Agora Nostra (below)

Days after this meeting, Mariano Pérez and Fernando Carazo, members of the Madrid Study Group, gave a talk on the 30th in one of the rooms at Ecocentro in Madrid at 7:00 p.m. The topic was “Reaching God through Personal Religion” and “The Soul.”

The readers of _The Urantia Book_ gathered once again in Cartagena, Murcia, to celebrate the 14th National Meeting from April 30 to May 3, 2015. That year, we had the invaluable help of the Murcia Study Group in organizing the meeting in this corner of the eastern peninsula. It's also worth mentioning that Antonio Schefer, president of the UAI Conference Committee, joined us for the first time. His company was very pleasant and offered to collaborate with the board members in their outreach efforts.

In the Urantia Association of Brazil's virtual conference room, Olga López gave a lecture entitled “THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE” at 9:00 p.m. on May 31.

“REFLECTIONS FOR THE INSTRUCTORS AND BELIEVERS OF THE FIFTH REVELATION” was the conference broadcast by Olga López on July 26, also at 9:00 p.m. and also in the AUB virtual room.

Carmelo Martínez, our president, spoke about “MATTER AND ENERGY, PHYSICS AND _The Urantia Book_” on September 27 at the usual time in the AUB virtual room.

In Girona, in the Alexandria room of Espai Natura, on October 1st, Olga López gave a talk based on the presentation of _The Urantia Book_. The attendees were very attentive to the presentation, and the questions and answers lasted almost an hour.

WHAT TO DO WITH THE BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION OF THE HUMAN RACE? This was the title Mariano Pérez gave during the lecture he gave on October 25th at 9:00 PM Spanish time in the Urantia Association of Brazil's virtual conference room.

On a whirlwind trip, Carmelo Martínez, president, and Mariano Pérez, coordinator of the Study Groups, traveled to Mallorca on Friday, October 30th to meet at the home of Miguel Bustos, head of the Mallorca Study Group, with several readers of _The Urantia Book_, as well as with friends and supporters, in order to introduce themselves, give a talk/presentation, and socialize with the group.

Until 2016, UBIS offered one course per quarter; starting this January, three courses will be offered per quarter, thereby increasing the participation of Spanish-speaking instructors. Currently, of the 18 teacher-facilitators, seven are Spanish.

Some examples of the courses taught are the following:

- The series “The Road Home”, a set of three courses that covers the upward career.
- Lucifer's Rebellion
- The Supreme Being, the oversoul of the grand universe.
- Jesus, the Master of Masters.
- The Universal Father: to love Him is to know Him.
- Study of the human government of Urantia.
- Adam and Eve.
- Michael of Nebadon, our Creator Son.

In January, several readers from Zaragoza met and agreed to form a new study group in that city. This is one more than the Association's current 10 groups, with the Torrevieja group currently inactive.

On Sunday, April 10, a conference was held at 9:00 p.m. Spanish time in the Urantia Association of Brazil's virtual room. Olga López led the presentation, based on the document “The Government of a Neighboring Planet: The Possible Utopia.”

At the end of March, due to technological upgrades, the old chat room offered by the Urantia Association of Brazil was abandoned and a virtual room was hired on Zoom.es. As of that date, the Urantia Association of Spain has its own virtual room for all its outreach activities.

The 15th Readers' Meeting took place in Bilbao between April 28 and May 1. The city of Bilbao was chosen by a majority at the previous meeting in Cartagena. The 15th Meeting [Light and Life No. 44](http://www.librodeurantia.es/sites/default/files/LyV44.pdf)

It is also worth mentioning that a revision of the Spanish translation of _The Urantia Book_ has been underway since 2011, with the intention of improving both the 1993 Edition and the European Edition. [Translation](http://www.urantia.org/en/news/2011-09/informe-de-la-reunion-de-inicio-de-la-revision-de-la-traduccion-espanola)

At this point, there's little more to say. It's worth mentioning that over the years the movement has been operating since that initial decision by the Seville Study Group to meet periodically with those readers of _The Urantia Book_ who were willing to spend a few days socializing around the book's topics. More than 600 people have participated in the organized events. From all these events, however, numerous activities have emerged, all of which are growing and developing well.

INTERVIEW WITH PEDRO VALVERDE: THE MYSTICISM OF THE UFO PHENOMENON

By Pere Artigas, from the magazine “El Maresme”

<figure id="Figure_63" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/The_Urantia_Movement_in_Spain/066.jpg">

Pedro Valverde Tort is part of that group of Mataró residents who, despite having accomplished truly important things, remain anonymous; perhaps in his case, Pedro Valverde expressly wants it that way. It was very difficult to conduct this interview, among other reasons because he has a kind of destiny that compels him to travel constantly, either for his profession or simply because he pushes the limits. Born in Mataró fifty years ago, he works as a mechanical expert. Fifteen years ago, he began a journey that took him to numerous countries, ending his adventure when the African war in Angola disrupted his most cherished personal and professional project: supplying an entire African country with primary schools and medical clinics using a system of prefabricated buildings, a system he invented.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

<figure id="Figure_64" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/The_Urantia_Movement_in_Spain/065.jpg">
</figure>

It was precisely with this new system that Pedro Valverde won the silver medal at the International Salon of New Techniques, held in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1973. However, it was not his professional activity that led us to speak with him, but rather his studies on the possibility of the existence of extraterrestrials and their manifestations through the UFO phenomenon. Since 1950, Pedro Valverde has conducted numerous investigations in this field; it can be said that he, Antonio Ribera, and Mario Lleget are the most advanced Catalans in this field. The First National Congress of Ufology was recently held in Barcelona, where Valverde presented a paper entitled “The Mystical Problems of the UFO Phenomenon,” which successfully sparked the interest of the international specialists attending the conference. Even more recently, he presented the same paper at “El Racó” in our city.

<br style=“clear:both;”/>

Pedro justifies the existence of extraterrestrials and their calling card: the UFO. Many people are deeply skeptical about these issues...

_This fact is, for me and for many others, incontrovertible. And it's time it became so for many more, for everyone. Today, we can say that we have an extensive case study available to anyone who wants to delve deeper into the subject; twenty years ago, everything was much more confusing. Today, we have the recognition of the governments of many countries, including Spain, and in a certain way, it represents an endorsement of the current relevance and reality of this fact._

Even so, the topic remains of interest to certain minorities...

_It seems like the minority thing is true, but it isn't. In reality, there are many associations, both nationally and internationally, that are actively working on the issue, and when associations are formed, it's clear proof of the enormous pressures within the community. What there is, however, is a great deal of confusion, in the sense that everything is filled with difficulties, many of them created expressly to discern between positive and falsified facts, and this generates a certain distrust among the layperson._

AN INTERFERENCE CALLED RELIGION

Let's accept that this phenomenon is a reality. What consequences can arise? What interpretations do you make of this phenomenon?

_Your question is well-intentioned. To begin with, I'll tell you that my current position is different from the beginning; this is nothing new, as the same thing has happened to many. At the beginning, one is concerned and interested in the event itself, its spectacular nature, the technical advances that represent the mastery of space technology observed in UFOs, the confirmation of the transcendental fact that we are not alone in the universe, the sociological repercussions of a future contact between our society and an extraterrestrial civilization..._

_Little by little, you manage to get to the bottom of the matter, to the “why” of the presence of extraterrestrial observers among us, something confirmed in the most remote antiquity and, above all, to the reason for the constant interference of the UFO and Mr. Extraterrestrial in the religious context of all peoples..._

I think you're entering into slippery and dangerous territory...

_I'm fully aware of this. I was talking about the constant interference across time and cultures. This is, without a doubt, the fundamental “why” of the problem._

IMMORTALITY: A BOXED AND EXCLUSIVE WORD

Religiously speaking, you could say that everything is tied up and calculated, very well tied up and very well calculated, I would say...

_More than that, I think it's correct to say that he's “on track and well on track.”_

_The entire universe has been governed by the laws of evolution since the beginning of beginnings, and Homo sapiens is the result of a biological and psychological evolution that will continue for centuries to come, for there is nothing that can make us believe that we have reached the culmination of an evolutionary curve. But when we think in terms of evolution, we condition ourselves—without any reason—to accept it in philosophical terms and in terms of intelligence at a purely cerebral level. And that is not the point. There is another, parallel, much more transcendent line of action that will eventually provide man with a very special quality—one that some of the peoples of space already possess. The possibility that man can acquire this “superior quality” has been instituted by all the generations that have preceded us and, at the same time, has been pigeonholed, monopolized by all religions. I am referring to immortality._

Damn! I think you're still treading on slippery and dangerous ground...

_We have been forced to accept immortality as a prize awarded to those who abide by certain rules, but it can also be considered a quality that is acquired indiscriminately when the laws of psychic evolution are not interfered with or encouraged._

I think we're getting away from what we were talking about at the beginning... although what you're saying is very interesting.

_No, it's not far from what I was saying at the beginning. You can find accounts of countless cases of UFO sightings in which the characteristics are so far removed, so superior to what the most advanced human technology can achieve, that you can only explain it by framing it within what is now considered supernatural territory._

A REALITY TO CONFIRM AND MASTER

In what sense can this - let's call it - “knowledge” influence or modify the way of life and development of today's man?

_When the man of today, especially his youth, has the knowledge, the certainty that he can assert his right to participate in a great cosmic adventure, full of incentives and stimuli; an adventure that can lead him to infinite horizons of personal fulfillment and to the full understanding of why we exist and what we exist for, it will demand of this man that he be freed from dogmas and doctrines—which will have already fulfilled their historical mission of preparing us for a “third phase” but which in no way can be accepted as something perennial._

It can be understood in the classical concept of the supernatural world or level...

_No, no, in no way are we to understand it in this classical sense. We must understand it as an authentic reality that we are about to confirm and, then, master; a reality that will include within itself the knowledge of the great law that governs the entire universe._

You've talked little about UFOs, people want to know specific things...

_Consider the way they behave. First, after centuries of observation, they begin to manifest themselves, making humans aware that they are possible. All of this coincides with the technical phase in which humans can attempt space flight, with the timid tests of small satellites orbiting the world._

_Then comes a phase of verification of its physical certainty, of the reality of its presence. And it is precisely in this second phase that man opens borders and sets foot in a world that is not Earth. For any child today, this advancement is completely natural, and they don't question it, but rather accept it as just another thing, even though for older people this fact may have been—at the time—a real emotional shock._

_And now a “third phase” is being prepared, in which man sets his sights beyond the solar system and becomes accustomed to the possibility of encountering other intelligences; he prepares to face “contact.” Conversely, those to be “contacted” possess real proof of their position in the cosmos, and there will be no danger of this event being framed within the framework of pseudo-supernaturalism, superstition, or human religious context..._

Can everything you say be related to the film “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” being shown in Barcelona?

_Obviously, the theme is a good fit, and I think the screening of this film is happening at the most opportune time. I think the idea behind it is valid, although naturally the interpretation is very much the author's own._

Pedro Valverde explains to me that next April, UN Secretary-General Kurt Walheim will present a dossier on the UFO phenomenon to the Assembly; he believes this could be very important for the future. He also regrets that US President Jimmy Carter has not kept the promises he made during the election campaign, to the effect that if he were elected president, he would shed light on the UFO issue and all the documentation collected and kept secret... “_That means the subject frightens them, that it's eluding them..._” he says, resigned to Carter's lack of word, yet hopeful about what might be said at the UN.

As he walked me to the exit door, discussing the interview, we agreed on the same thing: the topic is highly controversial and could spark controversy among readers. “_This shows that the issue is alive, that it exists, that it's palpable... despite some people saying it's purely a commercial tale,_” Pedro told me, clearly alluding to a piece that recently appeared in a large-circulation Barcelona newspaper owned by a count and written by FM.

INSTITUTE OF RESEARCH AND EXOBIOLOGICAL STUDIES

In Gilet, April 11, 1994.

All the UFO phenomenon researchers listed below, who have met in Gilet to form a working group and develop the guidelines for the Delphi project, agree to develop a future line of work, research and dissemination, which they define according to the ten points of the following:

- MANIFEST-

1) The UFO phenomenon is totally or partially unrelated to the problem of extraterrestrial life, with which it has almost always been attempted to be associated and justified.
2) Many of the manifestations of the UFO phenomenon fall into the realm of paraphysics, a level that, due to its highly subjective nature, can escape conventional scientific analysis.
3) Extensive networks of researchers in Europe and America have managed to gather sufficient information that proves that many of the phenomena classified as UFOs belong to the paraphysical domain.
4) There is enough case history of phenomena that today would be classified as UFOs and that have determined a protohistory of the phenomenon inscribed within the framework of ancient mythologies and in the origin of religions that are now institutionalized.
5) These manifestations are nothing more than ONE of the multiple facets of a plane of existence or hidden universe, foreign to our material world subject to the laws of space-time.
6) Their interference in human affairs must be placed in the context of a real hidden plot, possibly oriented towards a New World Order.
7) It can be concluded that the UFO phenomenon and other unexplained manifestations take place within the framework of a vast scenario of deception.
8) It is concluded that this plan or plot has interfered and continues to interfere with the normal evolution of man and his psychic abilities, through the seduction of trivializing the occult, in a strategy focused essentially on young people.
9) This action includes psychic manipulation, suggestion, mental manipulation, altered states of consciousness, personality modifications, telepathic control...
10) The continued presence of the UFO phenomenon and its interference throughout history is clear proof of the existence of an INTENTION and a STRATEGY serving a power. Countering the PURPOSE of this subversive action, carried out both mentally and physically, is the line of work that the members involved in the Delphi Project propose to develop.
