This brief commentary and its outlines are designed to attempt to understand, from a finite mind, the entire framework of Creation from its origins to the universal end.

All of this is based on the “Prologue” of The Urantia Book, “A Simplification of the Prologue”, “A Study of the Master Universe”, the latter two by Bill Sadler, transcripts of some of the author's lectures, and “Creation History” by Antonio Moya.

The different authors try to make us understand through their expositions how God, one day, decided to emerge from his lethargy and from the most absolute and infinite stillness began to move, to project and to free himself from so much responsibility.

Like that magician who, in his best and most dazzling performance, takes up his top hat and begins to perform various magical tricks, in a similar way I imagine God inaugurated the beginning of the beginning. He began by making plans that would later become possibilities. He established potentials, three impressive reservoirs from which all things and all beings that would embellish such a magnificent creation would later be drawn. He called them the Qualified Absolute and the Unqualified Absolute, and, so that the two would interact, he synthesized them into the Universal Absolute.

The first holds in its reserves all beings and other realities that are spiritual and divine, that is, all personalities. The second, all physical energies that are organized into new material universes, nebulae, galaxies, or planets of space, that is, everything impersonal. The third unites the other two. It maintains balance.

To fulfill all his plans and free up more responsibility, God needed to partner, and in the blink of an eye, he transformed himself into the Father of the Son. He also developed a powerful machine: Paradise. Together, Father and Son looked at each other and saw themselves incomplete. At that instant, they decided to bring in another helper: the Spirit. As if that weren't enough, together the three developed a perfect universe and filled it with a great family of perfect creatures. They called it Havona, a place endowed with beauty and a model universe.

The power, imagination, and wisdom of God, like the greatest magician, brought into existence the Paradise Trinity: the Universal Father, the Eternal Son, and the Infinite Spirit. He gave the three a place to live and a machine to develop the rest of creation: Paradise. Within it, he placed three impressive storehouses: the Absolutes.

God, through His associates, decided to create. To do so, they utilized the potentials containing all the “patterns” of all personalities and all things. From that moment on, their aggregates transformed and continue to transform these potentials into realities, giving rise to the existence of new personalities, new mental levels, and the organization of new nebulae. All new realities come from the Three Absolutes; they provide all the “space” and “substance” from which all persons and universes after Havona have been created.

The Father, the Son, and the Spirit, together and separately, began to develop God's plans. They created personalities such as the Seven Master Spirits, the Architects of the Master Universe, the Force Organizers, the 21 Ancients of Days, etc., etc. Nebulae and physical beings were also organized in the space of the seven superuniverses, later to house personalities and creatures. Then the Father and the Son procreated the Creator Sons, and the Spirit created the Creative Spirits.

Some of these personalities belong to the Corps of Supreme Creators. They and their associates organize, administer, and perfect through evolution, as God so determined, the seven superuniverses—a broad margin of space beyond the boundaries of Havona. They are “giving” life to all the creatures of those worlds, from where they will begin a long journey as pilgrims to Paradise in search of the Universal Father.

We are currently in those moments of creation. We are in the era in which a number of creatures from those more advanced worlds of the Superuniverses are already in Paradise, having been “born” earlier. Others are preparing for it, and still others, like us, are just beginning. We are born, live, die, are resurrected, continue to exist (“in another way,” of course), prepare on specific worlds, and continue our pilgrimage. We will spend long periods of time on the various worlds of our Superuniverse and later on the worlds of Havona.

Going back a little to the origin, God thought that after a good evolution we should pass through a supreme level, and for this, He planned the creation of these Superuniverses and an entire process in which the creatures who lived there (who live) would be created in finite and imperfect terms. In other words, something like living inevitably committed to evolving and finding perfection through experience in time and space. Almost nothing. Something totally different from the creatures who live in Havona. They have always been perfect, because they have always existed that way. Hence, those beings and those personalities are called existential, and we and the rest of creation, which belong to another era, are called experiential. We are experiential beings.

Beyond the boundaries of the seven superuniverses lie more fringes of outer space—four to be exact. As could not be otherwise in God's plans, passing through these four spaces is transiting through the ultimate level. In the first zone, physical things already exist; nebulae are forming. If you don't believe me, just ask our astronomers when they look “outward” with their telescopes.

These nebulae or galaxies in formation will one day be universes with suns and planets that will later be established as habitable worlds for beings and creatures who will no longer be like us, finite and imperfect, nor like the creatures of the eternal and perfect worlds of Havona. They will be... what will they be like? Only God knows.

Some authors of the Documents, and Bill Sadler himself, say that what will be created in those four immense spaces, all within the ultimate level, will be named with a new creation term, intermediate between the absolute and the finite. To this end, they have taken four letters from each of them, the first four and the last four, respectively, and it will be called absonite. This term and what it entails is difficult for us humans to understand, and it will remain so for a long time.

In any case, if we resume our journey as Urantia mortals, it turns out that, having been created finite and imperfect, we will always exist if we so desire. God has given us the power of choice. With that power in our hands, we can decide whether or not we wish to be residents of the universe, as well as of affiliation with Him. If we decide to do His will and live in His different “plots,” we are given the opportunity to learn more with each age we spend on the different training worlds to become less imperfect. We will change into different forms and evolve over time.

At some point, we will leave our Superuniverse to arrive at the first worlds of the perfect universe. We will spend long periods in the company of these creatures and will try to learn each day to become a little more perfect. We will gain much experience throughout all these periods. After a long time, we will be allowed to “land” on Paradise and present ourselves before the Universal Father. Finally, we will come into His presence. We will enter the Corps of the Finality and thereby become “finaliters.” Throughout this journey, we pass from being human, physical, and material beings to spiritual beings in the form of high-grade spirits.

Trying to understand what the future holds for us after arriving on Paradise, it has been revealed to us that our work of improvement continues. We will once again “descend” to the Superuniverses, but now as spirit beings. We will continue to acquire experience on those worlds, and it seems that this will be until all the inhabited worlds of all the Superuniverses are established in the era of light and life, more or less, I believe. Then we will return to Paradise so that we can immediately plunge “headfirst” into the exciting adventure of real experience. We will be tested and put on the test to experience the unknown, the immense, the inexplicable, and the unpredictable. The most expansive history, so far, that we have ever experienced up to that point. It will be impressively long and full of surprises, although those “in the know” say that we are sufficiently prepared, I don't know how much.

We're finally going to live and experience the famous and mysterious Absonite creation. What a mouthful. We're told that we, finite beings and many other finaliter associates, are going to teach, in those places of God, things that those who will be born there lack. A very enriching job. They're going to give us the “backing” to be entrusted with the task of creating, organizing, and administering their territory, and we're going to share our acquired experiences with them. That's going to be real work. It seems that's how we all evolve at this final level. They're going to prepare to pass through the well-organized and established worlds of the Superuniverses, well-established in light and life, and then continue through the worlds of Havona, and then later on, reach Paradise. More or less, the same way we did.

How does our situation evolve throughout these four very long stages? Let's realize that we are going to live through the final level established by God, or at least that's what the documents tell us. In any case, the authors, as they express themselves in The Urantia Book, have deduced possible hypotheses that, if Creation continues, might possibly develop. They say that, once the entire Master Universe is finished, more empty space continues to exist, which would be the Infinite Cosmos. If so, who doesn't tell us that there's more work to be done? Will we ever experience this absolute term? Those who know best say we probably will. Despite all this, I've come to the conclusion that God designed the entire Creation not only to make us perfect like Him, but also to keep us eternally entertained.
