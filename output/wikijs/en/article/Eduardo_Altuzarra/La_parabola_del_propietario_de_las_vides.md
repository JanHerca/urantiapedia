In order to understand the parable of the owner of the vineyard and the denarii, that is, “The discussion about wealth”, it is necessary to reread the entire [Paper 163](/en/The_Urantia_Book/163).

It all comes because of the ordination of the seventy and the commitment they make to go preach about the good things of the kingdom. These messengers of the gospel abandoned everything they owned and dedicated themselves to going to different cities proclaiming peace on Earth and goodwill among men, speaking that the kingdom of heaven was near, etc.

In this paper, Jesus tries to show that whoever feels called to represent him speaking on his behalf should abandon attachment to his loved ones and property.

Andrew introduces Jesus to a certain rich young man who was a fervent believer and who wanted to receive ordination, and they have a very direct conversation in which he tells him the essential condition, to which the boy seems to have disagreed, for what the Master dismisses him and invites him to return to his home.

The paper says that:

> _Thus always it was and forever will be: Men must arrive at their own decisions. There is a certain range of the freedom of choice which mortals may exercise. The forces of the spiritual world will not coerce man; they allow him to go the way of his own choosing._ (<a id="a52_268"></a>[UB 163:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p2_8))

It seems that, years later, this boy was able to realize the dream that he previously did not dare to follow due to his attachment to material things.

The paper also says:

> _Riches have nothing directly to do with entrance into the kingdom of heaven, but the *love of wealth does.* The spiritual loyalties of the kingdom are incompatible with servility to materialistic mammon. Man may not share his supreme loyalty to a spiritual ideal with a material devotion._ (<a id="a58_294"></a>[UB 163:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p2_10))

Jesus explained that if the wealth that one possesses does not invade the halls of the soul, this has no consequence on the spiritual life of those who wish to enter the kingdom of heaven. It says that the Father treats all his creatures according to their needs and always in accordance with the just laws of merciful and loving consideration for the welfare of the universe.

## Comments from attendees about this parable

- It is natural (or should be) to feel joy for the one who enters the kingdom later than us.
- It must be borne in mind that justice must be tempered by mercy. Love is not fair because it exceeds justice.
- The laws of the spiritual economy are not the same as those of the material economy.
- What would have happened if the last workers had been given a denarius without working? Well, it is fair in the spiritual but unfair in the material.
- We must take into account the context of the parable, but also what is the application of this parable in our time. You cannot serve God and money at the same time.
- This parable is very similar to the parable of the prodigal son.
- This parable teaches us to want the same good for everyone.
- The human being is like the last worker in the vineyard. There are other ascending beings who have been serving much longer (such as midwayers and seraphim).
- Our motto should be “give according to your ability, to the other according to their need”.
- The payment for living is life and, as long as you serve, you serve.
