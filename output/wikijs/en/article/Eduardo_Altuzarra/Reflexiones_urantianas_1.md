In this world, many people live with their backs to reality, although they do not stop evolving for a better future. The only difference is that some live between the subconscious and the conscious and others live between the levels of the conscious and the superconscious.

An irremediable and permanent “vibration” spreads throughout Creation, it can become like a faint musical note, like a barely perceptible signal that, however, is audible for the most transcendental part of the human being: the soul. It comes to be like a compendium of sensations, beyond the conscious, that invite you to think and ask yourself: What will become of me, after this is over? What can I do to be happy? Why am I in this world? Who I am?

That signal can appear at any time, in the course of any event, by observing an image, contemplating nature, during a conversation, during a period of reflection, or perhaps that moment has resonated in us as a kind of echo that has been able to remove our own intuitions; perhaps we have already perceived the musical note that has made us recognize as ours in that cosmic score that is already being interpreted. Perhaps we have found confirmation of what we already know, perhaps we have recognized this moment as our moment, our hour of transformation, our profound change of mind and heart.

When this happens, beyond the brain, in the mind of the human being, in the heart of said being (where the “messages” from the beyond arrive) ideas arrive in search of conscious and coherent thoughts that point towards directions of search. of truth at superconscious levels. A truth accompanied by beauty and goodness that drives the human being to find the facts, the meanings and the values of real life.

> The mind that opens to a new idea will never return to its original size.
> Albert Einstein

After a deep reflection, in the exercise of our will, we can begin the search for the “treasure” in something that possibly has been stored in the unconscious since our childhood. We must do it on the cosmic plane or universal sketch, keeping in mind that the steps that guide the path are slow and sometimes unresolved. Nothing and no one should intimidate our search desires. The total confidence and security in that **signal** that has been heard and established in our soul must guide us with total security for the development of that eternal adventure. The **signal** does not confuse, it guides our will.

This does not lead us to establish a procedure or expertise, they are rather common situations and experiences of all truth seekers. The setting is already real on another level, it already has its existence in another “place.” What happens is that we are still not very aware of that reality, we need to know from good ink what this is about. For this there is nothing better than trying to make it real through experience.

The only way to experience this metamorphosis is to know how to choose the best **manual** (the best cosmic plan or sketch), the best indicator, the best compass to help us live these types of habits. We must also recognize that everything is possible if we are really determined to achieve it. We must acquire the security of knowing how to select what or who is going to organize our future life, since that is going to be the model or mentor that is going to guarantee the conscious evolution of our existence. Let's not try to develop these initiatives out of distrust and hesitation, but rather from the certainty that everything that is desired and in which one puts will and effort ends up being achieved.

Normally, many of the decisions that we want to make are influenced or supervised by a series of circumstances experienced previously and that are part of our culture and education. With everything and with this we should not doubt, the **signal** is accurate, it is correct, it coincides with our hidden pattern. The ego does its job to try to confuse us. We must stop and think that in that sketch there is a **plan**. We must observe his trajectory with the hope that the **model or mentor** will lead us to a good port.

Finding the moment is something that each one of us must do with the total certainty that, in those moments, all the universal agencies will conspire to respond to our call. They are waiting for us to decide when to start this new journey towards new horizons, since they are previously established, so that we can live them within the choice of our free will while waiting for new experiences.

A firm decision, an express will, establishes in us the ideal moment, the beginning of something in which there is no going back.

We have to be very honest with ourselves, knowing that we are starting from the starting banner to gain momentum on a trajectory of new events. We must not run a lot, we must dose ourselves, as in a long-distance race. Time is important but not decisive, we know that the journey is long, but we must bear in mind that our will is stony and will not allow us to faint. You have to get used to new experiences, they will make us grow. Let's get soaked in them! We are going to perceive that, as we progress, everything becomes more comprehensible, easier to understand.

In this way, with a determined purpose and established in the certainty that it is the best and most beautiful thing that we want to develop, all that remains is to set the objectives in an endless future full of ideas that will become ideals for a personality of eternal durability. Let us not worry, let us trust, let us make sure that each day we live it in total communication with those living universal agencies and in constant communion for the aggrandizement of our soul. In this way we will travel along that path where we will achieve a turn of many degrees in our own lives.

Sincerity and altruism must accompany us at all times. The ego must not be allowed trust; on the contrary, we must be wary of what is sometimes transmitted to us through thoughts. This is more serious than it seems. At this point, we have to recognize that we are part of something that is very important, we are not people by chance. We are something else, we are part of a perfectly established **plan**. We should recognize that Creation and all that it entails is not a fluke. Logic leads us to deduce that all Creation has a Creator.

If we contemplate that possibility, we would be talking about God, about something unprovable but very real. Just follow the **signal**. She will lead us to understand that God as Father is a Reality. If that is so, it is very likely that, as a Father, he already loves us as his children. The mere fact of following the **signal**l, of selecting the corresponding **manual**, looking for the treasure through the cosmic plane, will allow us the possibility of not misrepresenting events, of being frank in situations and above all that, as humans, we can hit and miss in our decision making.

If we continue to travel this journey in search of the most precious thing, we must be very sure of the moments we live in each circumstance of our life, we must not go from one experience to another if we are not sure of the experiences we have lived before. Sometimes it is desirable to repeat the course before proceeding to the next one. Each experience lived in a conscious way reinforces in security the persistence of the one that we are going to live next.

It can be said that daring to start this endless adventure is to recognize in advance that most of us live in error.
