For the first time, on the occasion of the International Conference of readers of _The Urantia Book_ in Spain in May 2009, the news was made public and the new Urantia Book, European Edition was presented. Many Spanish readers 10 celebrated enthusiastically.

Throughout this journey it has been possible to verify that the first 2,000 copies published have almost sold out, in contrast to the 100 or 200 books that were sold over the course of a year through the distribution company Alfa & Omega.

Currently, the Urantia Association of Spain has a greater number of members, friends and sympathizers than in its origin. In Spain there are currently 9 Study groups with an average of between 6 and 10 members per group, approximately. It is verified that, in this short period of time, the new edition has helped to promote the Urantia movement in Spain.

The new adaptation of _The Urantia Book_ has contributed to explore and develop new horizons for its dissemination. It is considered that, as the Spain of the Spaniards is currently confused and disoriented, due to the crisis, fraud, abuses of materialism, secularism, etc. In short, because of fear and selfishness, it is a good time to try to reach those who “have eyes to see and ears to hear” the content of such a wonderful book.

The way and the way in which this revelation can be made to reach the rest of mortals, is something that each reader, within their commitment and responsibility, must develop with the maximum of success and independence. From the Urantia Association of Spain it has always been intended and is intended today, to do so in the manner determined by Art 1st section. 1.2 of its Statutes, plus brochures and various propaganda.

The Urantia Association of Spain has published on the Internet, a very topical medium today, a web page to provide all kinds of help to the readers of the book and to inform the neophyte of the existence of the 5th Revelation.

It is found in a very varied and effective way various and interesting topics contained in the book. From this informative magazine entitled “Luz y Vida” that it publishes quarterly, to articles by various, going through all kinds of schemes and presentations.

Within the various sections of the web page there is a work that was laborious but convenient and adequate, such as the complete text of the European Edition of _The Urantia Book_ in pdf and html format. And another of the latest commitments has been the preparation of an illustrated presentation of the latest version.

Once again it is shown that union, effort, perseverance and patience achieve objectives that help human evolution. It is hoped that this new translation will help put into practice all the theory contained in _The Urantia Book_, in a more vigorous way.
