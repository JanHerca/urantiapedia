I've been reading a lot lately about the disclosure of the Revealed Documents. I have tried to understand each and every one of the exposed topics and, today, I have come to the conclusion, in my modest opinion, that it has to be an ambitious macro-project based mainly on the union of knowledge, patience and insight. of the people involved and in the certainty of its projection. It also has to be related to time, since it will not develop in a single day, nor in a whole year.

Like most of the readers that make up this movement, we all know that this revelation is for more than a thousand years. Getting to know how to spread it correctly is quite a challenge. I believe that we must be very aware and very responsible in the individual work that each member contributes to the plan, as well as the collective.

The success of the project, contrary to what the most “purists” may think, does not have to come from the content of the documents, nor from the disinterest or altruism shown by the members of this group when putting it into practice. , but rather because of the planning of the schemes and taking into account the changes that come to be consolidated in the mind of the person who has read the revelation.

We all know what it's like to be in front of the revealed documents for the first time. Living its content is finding yourself before an exclusive, unique experience. You find yourself immersed in a spiral of confusing and somewhat tangled events. Reading them means acquiring deep knowledge, something you never imagine is possible. Certain conflicts come over you in which you question important premises of your life about what you have come to believe, about human relationships and about your feelings. These aspects should be taken into account when sharing them within the group and the movement.

After a while, you think differently and one of the first ideas that come to your mind is to communicate to all the people closest to us what has transformed you. You have to know how to control that impulse. Let's think for a moment that we have just been born, to wake up to new thoughts. That in us the conscious being emerges. That we are learning to live with new desires.

The most sensible and appropriate thing is to share relationships and feelings with other readers who are close to us. Form small groups and interrelate in a homogeneous and flexible way where there are no strict rules, dogmas or obstacles, which is susceptible to changes or variations according to circumstances or needs, as all this helps in commitment and coherence. This way of cooperating leads to making agreements and reaching unanimity in ideas and projects; very important aspects to take into account within the activity of the macroproject.

> “_Association with one’s fellows is essential to the renewal of the zest for life and is indispensable to the maintenance of the courage to fight those battles consequent upon the ascent to the higher levels of human living. Friendship enhances the joys and glorifies the triumphs of life. Loving and intimate human associations tend to rob suffering of its sorrow and hardship of much of its bitterness._” (<a id="a50_410"></a>[UB 160:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p2_8))

Organizing into groups represents, within the macro-project, among many other things, taking care and committing to grouping ideas, defining priorities, knowing how to listen, involving its members in comments and debates, collaborating in the various tasks of current data collection around the outreach and publicity, and work together. There may be what is called “creative conflict” between members and between groups, but we have to be very aware and understanding to know that we are developing everything with the healthy intention of cooperating from different ideas.

Intentionality is very powerful if we know how to apply it in our daily actions and it is something that we must take into account when interacting. It is something like a part of the inner “force” of our mind that in turn helps creativity. Well then, when it is applied for purposes such as grouping together to create ideas around a large project, which will not see results in the short or medium term, it must be based on frankness and sincerity, to obtain efficiency in the final results.

The entire movement will be filled with honor if it incorporates human values in the basic development of the schemes, objectives, purposes, etc. At the same time, it is desirable to establish the bases in the growth of shared leadership to promote the participation of all the people who make up the current. The whole of this movement has to know how to move the corresponding “springs” to try to create its own future and not allow the future to condition the movement. You have to establish punctual and opportune changes at key moments, for the visualization of new horizons.

The organization has to introduce valuations to knowledge. It has to set new parameters in what is coming to be called in Europe 'organizational learning'. The introduction of changes in the conventions is required and annulment of the anachronistic systems of persuasion. You have to examine how your dissemination is carried out, your plans and your structures. You must observe and try to understand the variety of interesting and momentous topics, current and innovative.

An “a priori” objective is to become an intelligent corporation and for this the majority of its members have to acquire the habit of spending their time continuously learning about science, philosophy and religion. Each reader, each member of the group, individually lives a series of experiences in which they learn to relax and calm down; At the same time, he is acquiring wisdom and more confidence in God. Discover and understand the great enigmas of humanity, doors open to the secrets. One goes from lamenting seeking the compassion of others to using the force of new and renewed thoughts that help to become aware of a broader and more real reality; In a word, you start to feel creative. Possibly life will no longer be as it was, hence your wishes are to collaborate with the movement.

As long as the project is based on continuous learning, the concepts, objectives and methods are not exhausted. It is an open process in which new models and new theories continually appear. All human beings learn a little more every day about the reality of life. In this specific case, it is about organizing.

Over time we have been able to see how mental, rational, intellectual, cognitive and logical processes are involved in regular educational training. What is currently involved is adding the emotional quotient to these processes. Why? Very easy. Love is found in almost the entire treaty of the revealed documents. Those of us who have read the texts in depth have stopped thinking, a bit, in the Descartes way, learning to relativize things.

The wise exercise of love greatly expands people's emotional intelligence. It is important to know how to introduce all kinds of loving exercises into movement. I am referring to a type of love that is intermediate between romantic and spiritual, that is, loving socialization. The healthy “intention to please” our fellow men. So much so that, if we manage to apply the theory of the “mathematics of love” we will be completely correct for the structure. It makes it clear that one of the important things for brotherhood among human beings is the intention to please. Without her, it seems like love doesn't exist.

We must be aware that, throughout our journey through the lines of revelation, we have introduced changes in ourselves, in our beliefs, in our habits and in our values. Now we perceive reality differently. Now our “inner house” is much better furnished. Our “thinking machine” and our circumstances have an important relationship and performance. Now there is a conscious action and a reaction that is understood. Now a series of reactions are produced in us that help to harmonize and coexist

Human beings have great potential. If the majority of the members that make up the movement assist with the best of our talent, we contribute to promoting the development of all the components. In this way we obtain better skills to perform the corresponding tasks and we get to encourage innovation and change.

We have to recognize that we live in a world that is constantly changing. Some are right, others are wrong. Transformation and new methods are essential skills to improve different objectives. Let's be eloquent and choose those that will provide success.

At this point, I believe that we should not proclaim Revelation in the old fashion, as the apostles did, for example, or as the Catholic Church currently does, in such a conservative way, or as some groups of the Islamic movement try to develop. I believe that it should be done by establishing references in the manner and form in which they are exposed in the most proportionate and coherent circles of young ideas, modern transformations, recent alternatives, the latest innovations, etc.

We must also keep in mind that several concepts live with us that humanly accompany us throughout our existence and can hinder objectives and premises. I mean two of them: egocentrism and fear. Fear grips, compresses, prevents change and makes dialogue impossible. It is not good for the system, we must fight it with confidence, determination and courage. Egocentrism simulates power, strength in personality and apparent wisdom. It hinders good intentions and good purposes, we must contain it through self-sacrifice, generosity and philanthropy. They seem to be the only ones, the egocentric ones, the ones who have the answers to everything.

Everything stated is theory. To be able to put it into practice, you only have to use the corresponding utensils. It is not an easy business since it must be taken into account that aspects that have a certain influence on each and every one of the members of the corporation are involved in the process. The most important aspects may well be the genetic inheritance, the acquired character, the educational habits, the way of relating and the transformation that the documents have made in the person himself.

The behaviors to be established are the following: Personal control, which is good for planning developments. Group teaching and study are very good to be applied in human relations. The interrelated teaching between the different sets, its application reinforces the practices within the institution. Mental patterns or archetypes are desirable to avoid confusion and help differentiate your environment. Methodical, consistent thoughts; with them you broaden the horizons that help you see beyond. And finally the relationship of the spoken word; people, even talking about the same thing, do not always understand each other. That is why it is important to learn how to say things very well, at the right time, with the right words. This document is short, concise and specific, but it entails a long, wide and expansive diversity in its content. I think it simply invites you to think. Time will convince of the congratulations of this new philosophy since this type of organizational projections are applicable to all types of organizations and, if it is good for the various corporations, it is good for society.

Let's establish the general bases and let's get to work on the project. Let's pool knowledge. Let's expose the sketches. Let's take human value into account. Let's not waste time, let's study daily. Let's communicate, nowadays it is not a very difficult task. We know a lot about love, let's put it into practice. Let's avoid fears, let's throw ourselves into the arms of courage. Let's not pay much attention to those who only talk, let's guide our own ideas and expose them. Let's be alert to changes, knowing how to choose the best premise invites victory. Only wise decisions made in a group lead to success.
