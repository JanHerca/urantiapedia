<br style="clear:both;"/>

I come from a humble family and I remember when I was little that my feet were covered by simple canvas shoes with a ribbon across the instep that were tied with a fat, rounded button. 

My memory takes me back to those moments when I helped my father clean his shoes on Sunday mornings for Mass. Big, worn shoes, but sturdy and clean. 

Sometimes, I dreamed of the day when I too would have my own pair, as elegant and well-kept as his. There I would go, hand in hand with my tall, elegant father, impeccable in his Sunday clothes and his fascinating shoes, to my Sunday routine. I imagined growing up with that bearing, those shoes, and that distinction.

Today I wear shoes, and I've known another Father for thirty years. I've sometimes heard something like "wearing God's shoes" or "feeling like you're in God's shoes." 

Whenever people talk about shoes, I think back to my childhood, and I remember how my father felt in his shoes and how much I wanted to imitate him.

When I dare to try to put myself in God's shoes, I usually do so when I meet with my fellow human beings, eager to share the concerns and doubts of our daily lives, and not all of them end up being pleasant. 

I understand, from what I interpret from the book we are reading, that trying to fit into the Father's shoes is something like feeling an obligation and the intention to put into practice qualities that only his shoes possess. 

The qualities that this book is trying to teach us, and that we should fulfill every time we meet to discuss doubts and give opinions about what we interpret from *The Urantia Book*, are: 

To carry out a service of love with unwavering faith. To be loyal and courageous and give ourselves selflessly. To strive to be sweet and spontaneous. To be fair and, above all, sincere, thoughtful, and intelligent. To possess undying hope and faithful trust. To be kind to all odds with forgiving tolerance. To possess proven temperance and unbeatable joy. Sharing unwavering patience, humble gentleness, and lasting peace. 

Let's hope that every time we meet, we try to put ourselves in the shoes of the Universal Father and thus achieve good understanding, effective socialization, and effective fellowship. 

A hug.
