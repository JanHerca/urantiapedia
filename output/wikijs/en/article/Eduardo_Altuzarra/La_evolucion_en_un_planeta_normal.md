| SPIRITUALITY | Some men may temporarily have a Thought Adjuster. <br> Religion is only fear and superstition. | Thought Adjusters appear in ever-increasing numbers. <br> The planet is installed in the Systemic Circuits. <br> Religion advances, and higher truths about the universal organization are revealed to them. | There are more and more Thought Adjusters for men and for the Adamites. <br> Great spiritual progress is made. <br> Truth is revealed at a deeper level. | The horizon of revealed religion is extended. <br> Local Universe affairs are revealed. <br> Almost every mortal is inhabited by a Thought Adjuster. There is a religious awakening and spiritual enlightenment throughout the planet. | The revelation of truth broadens to include the entire Superuniverse. <br> When this epoch ends, the “Spirit of Truth” is sent. <br> The bestowal of the Thought Adjuster becomes universal. The truth about the Superuniverse is revealed. | The revelation of truth extends to the Central Universe and Paradise. <br> The wisdom of the Gods is about to manifest |
| OTHER FEATURES | When the Planetary Prince and his staff arrive, primitive men greet them with fear, respect, and adoration. | In just a few millennia, great social changes occur. <br> Large contingents of Seraphim and Celestial Helpers arrive. | Internationalism spreads | The Magistral Sons can make themselves visible to men. <br> When their mission is complete, they return to Paradise. <br> They can return to the planet several times. | The Son of Bestowal establishes a “new and living way” | The Planetary Prince is elevated to the rank of Planetary Sovereign. |
