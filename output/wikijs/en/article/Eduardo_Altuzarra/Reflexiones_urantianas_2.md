We all have a genetic heritage, a biology that has been with us since birth. In it, creeds are disguised from which unfortunate behaviors occur, so many of them carry our misfortunes. To this we have to add the education received and the social environment in which we have developed. All this has made it possible to sow, throughout our lives, in a field where the plant that has sprouted has not given the ideal fruits that represent happiness, coherence, altruism, responsibility, humility, understanding, empathy etc

We have to keep in mind that if we do not modify the seed, which is something like the content of our thoughts, we will not be able to obtain good fruits, good words, sincere dialogues, etc., much less will we vary our actions and their results. If we don't try to change, our life will not change.

> “Who sows winds, reaps storms.” (popular saying)

Living in error means not benefiting from the gifts that the Father grants to all those who make an effort to face life within the established plan. Practicing false beliefs make us experience tribulations, afflictions, conflicts, calamities, etc. These behaviors can be temporary if we decide to start reading the corresponding manual, if we follow the sign, if we do the will of the Father, if we accept that we finally want to wake up and get out of the error. Those desires will bring us new winds of freedom, willpower and availability to exercise brotherhood and altruism. To sincerely and humbly recognize the missteps and mistakes made is to take the first step towards liberation, towards change, towards a new life.

It must be considered that when we enter the crystal clear water, dirty with the mud of errors, we will surely dirty the clean waters and never finish cleaning ourselves. It's not easy to get rid of that mud, it's hard to get clean before bathing clean of mud in the transparent pool. Getting out of our mistakes is difficult to recognize, because we have lived for a more or less long time in confusion, between conflicts and that way of life that has become comfortable living with us. It is so and it is something established in our lives. It is very important to gradually change the way of thinking, the way of expressing ourselves and the actions of our daily lives.

> Take care of your thoughts, because they will become your words.
> Take care of your words, because they will become your actions.
> Take care of your actions, because they will become your habits.
> Take care of your habits, because they will become your destiny.
> (M. Gandhi)

If we add our willpower to this, the days of the ego that has been born from all the experiences lived before are numbered. He will try to convince us once again that it is not difficult to get out of those mistakes, he will try to dissuade us from the fact that we can get out of mistakes, missteps, etc., by our own means, and he will trying to do as always: proposing easy self-convincing exits, but always false.

Thank God, that audible signal penetrates into the heart. That guide nestles at the top of the superconscious level of our mind and is not willing to leave us. He will do the unspeakable to guide us with ideas that we must know how to transform into good thoughts. He is going to stand up to our adversary, the ego. It will make us see how wrong our ego can be if we let ourselves be carried away by its incompetent advice.

If we place all our trust in that new being that has appeared as a result of having heard that signal that comes from the depths of Creation, from that immeasurable cosmos, we have won the game. We will checkmate the ego. Having reached those limits of the board, we can say that each and every one of the smallest parts of our body have been impregnated by the great breath of the spirit. Our biology is likely to improve. “_Mens sana in corpore sano_”. Our education and wisdom will reach high knowledge and the scope of our relationships will move in fraternal circles.

Finally, if we place all our hope and trust in that power possessed by that guiding spirit that represents our God, our Universal Father, who lives within us, recognizing that He is the truth, that truth that has been hidden from our consciousness human that has led us to live in false beliefs and condemned errors.

He has qualities to make us understand that science helps, religion unites and philosophy balances. Once we have decided to evolve under these premises, it is not difficult to develop patterns of understanding and behavior that can make our lives an example for others.

Let us not be ashamed to recognize his power and his worth, let us gladly accept that he can transmit his divinity to us throughout our journey with him. in which we have to make decisions with some responsibility. Let us go to Him thanking Him for our good situations and asking Him for forgiveness for the mistakes made. Let us deposit our affairs in Him so that, with His magnificence, He establishes them in the corresponding order.

> The existence of God can never be proved by scientific experiment or by the pure reason of logical deduction. God can be realized only in the realms of human experience; nevertheless, the true concept of the reality of God is reasonable to logic, plausible to philosophy, essential to religion, and indispensable to any hope of personality survival. (<a id="a69_353"></a>[UB 1:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p2_7))

From here and now, we are ready to position ourselves at the starting line. We are ready to start the most important and transcendent career of our life, besides possibly being the only one, because there may not be an opportunity, at least in this life and in this world.

However, let's not expect great events, let's not imagine for a moment that the experiences we are going to live are going to be spectacular, we are not going to feel that relationship with the spirit in a special way at all. This happens in a silent way, without noise, without shocks or other forms or modes of advent.

$$
\text{THE HUMAN MIND—LEVELS}
\begin{cases}
\text{SUPERCONSCIOUS} \begin{cases} \text{SPIRIT OF TRUTH} \\ \text{HOLY SPIRIT} \\ \text{THOUGHT ADJUSTER}\end{cases} \\
\text{CONSCIOUS}\\ \\
\text{SUBCONSCIOUS}
\end{cases}
$$

The first thing that we are going to perceive from his presence is a peace, a harmony and a happiness that we have never experienced before. He is already inside: well, rather, he was already there, let's say that the signal has “activated” him.

He is already a dynamic collaborator in our affairs, we just have to ask him for help to guide us in this surprising endless adventure. So that it enlightens us when the road gets dark. So that each and every one of the cells of our body is soaked in a healthy well-being. So that our soul can discern a different faith from the previous one, a faith that will make all these new truths the product of communion with our spirit, with God, with our Universal Father.

Now we are going to begin to be new beings. We were potentially so, but from now on we begin the experience of living all that potential: we are going to update ourselves in reality.

Let's think that we started for the first time here on earth with the help of the Spirit of God in the endless adventure (the upward race), the one that crosses the threshold of death to rise again through our soul in a new world and with a new body, where reality develops in a much more tangible way.

The Adjuster will continue with us, he will continue accompanying us, there will be no great differences or great variations. We already arrived at the place instructed from here, from earth, provided that we have developed each and every one of the operations in accordance with the indications of the revealed manual. I'm sure we won't encounter any major difficulties.

We can already say that, at this point, we are ready to know what has been revealed. Knowing from a very good source that this manual revealed to humanity can do us a lot of good and without a doubt it will help transform us, since in it we will find all the facts, meanings and values that all human beings should know equally. We know all the letters of the alphabet.

We talked about _The Urantia Book_.

A book revealed to humanity for its transformation.
