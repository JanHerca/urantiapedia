Betty, would you like to have an image of the human mind?

Audience: Yes, I would love to!

Have you ever been to a planetarium?

Public: Yes

Have you all been to a planetarium? I'd like you to visualize a double planetarium. One that has another hemisphere besides the upper one. And in the center is a platform with its stand. And on the platform is a reflector, and this reflector can rotate 360 degrees around the planetarium and can move in an arc a little bit up and down. It can illuminate what we might call the torrid zone of the planetarium—if I may use some geographical terms. It can do this all along the equator and a little bit above and below. When we go into the southern temperate zone, below the torrid zone, I think we encounter the true subconscious. I think the northern temperate zone is the superconscious. I think at any given moment, the spot of light that's projected onto the hemisphere is the conscious. And you can move it around, and you know you can.

When they go to sleep at night, they turn off the spotlight. And there's a soft green glow all around. I believe that above the torrid zone, specifically above the northern temperate zone, in the upper hemisphere, in the polar regions, is the embryonic soul. And I visualize the Adjuster at the north pole.

This soul is a true embryo carried in the womb of the mind and conceived when the Adjuster invades this hemisphere. And this soul is a growing entity.

Well, below the platform—well, you could take it further down to the unconditioned reflexes of the South Pole—is, as you know, the autonomic nervous system. On this platform, there's a red button; it's the red button of decisions. And all decisions take place at the conscious level of the mind; they're all conscious decisions. You can't make decisions at the soul or superconscious level. And this is because you can't reach up there with a searchlight. You can only reach so high. Do you follow me? There's a continuous trickle from the areas of darkness above to places where we can reach with a searchlight, okay? There's a continuous flow from the subconscious levels below to the level where you can see with a searchlight. When we wake up in the morning with the surprise of a good solution to a very complicated problem, we may ask ourselves where it came from. From below or from above?

I don't consider the underlying part to be nefarious, although it is clearly mammalian at its lowest levels. Incredible “IBM work” can be done in the underlying part: processing memory cards and creating a beautiful mending, an ingeniously patched-together solution to a purely material and temporal problem. I think a lot of good things can come from the subconscious, as well as a lot of nonsense.

I believe the Spirit of Truth works in the upper hemisphere. I believe all spiritual influences are in the upper hemisphere. I would say the five mammalian helpers work in the southern hemisphere. The two human helpers, who are the helpers of the midwayers—the one of worship and the one of wisdom—the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, and the Adjuster work in the northern hemisphere.

This is my working model for the human mind. (Bill Sadler)

Representation of the human mind, according to Bill Sadler.

A double planetarium. One that has another hemisphere in addition to the upper one.
