**XX National Meeting of Readers of _The Urantia Book_ in Spain**

**June 28, 2024, Toledo**

**BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION**: I understand that positioning or placing oneself in an ideal situation in the face of the new changes that are coming and acquiring the knowledge provided for the times to come are aspects and situations that society has to consider in the short and medium term in order to be able to face future challenges and contradictions and, in turn, take advantage of the opportunities that normally arise in a changing world.

IN DOCUMENT 50 (The Planetary Princes) in SECTION 6. PLANETARY CULTURE it says:

> The development of civilization on Urantia has not differed so greatly from that of other worlds which have sustained the misfortune of spiritual isolation. But when compared with the loyal worlds of the universe, your planet seems most confused and greatly retarded in all phases of intellectual progress and spiritual attainment.
> 
> Because of your planetary misfortunes, Urantians are prevented from understanding very much about the culture of normal worlds. But you should not envisage the evolutionary worlds, even the most ideal, as spheres whereon life is a flowery bed of ease. The initial life of the mortal races is always attended by struggle. **Effort and decision are an essential part of the acquirement of survival values.**
> 
> **Culture presupposes quality of mind; culture cannot be enhanced unless mind is elevated.** Superior intellect will seek a noble culture and find some way to attain such a goal. Inferior minds will spurn the highest culture even when presented to them ready-made. Much depends, also, upon the successive missions of the divine Sons and upon the extent to which enlightenment is received by the ages of their respective dispensations. [UB 50:6.2-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p6_2)

**Even so, we must not lose confidence and hope!!**

This topic is based on four scenarios and two questions.

## 1. THE BOOK

It is well known that this book was written so that humanity may nourish itself with its wisdom and strengthen its knowledge for a thousand years. It is therefore understood that this book is here to stay. If it has come to this world with the sole purpose of showing this dull humanity the reality of existence, we must extract the full potential of its teachings and apply them in our daily lives.

## 2. UNDERSTANDING AND COMPREHENSION

I understand that in order to face the new events that face us in the future, we must be very conscious of understanding the environment and society. It's not easy to tackle a series of new projects without taking into account the reality of the events, situations, and circumstances that drive today's society.

The book we read and study provides us with a background on where the future should lead, if we truly wish to do it well. We must value the aptitude of the members responsible for developing all processes and projects aimed at new social developments for the good of humanity.

In principle, all scientific advances, whether aimed at new technologies, social networks, Artificial Intelligence, telecommunications, 5G, the Internet of Things, or machine-to-machine interaction, must be developed with the goal of social interaction that minimizes harm to people.

> Unless the moral insight and the spiritual attainment of mankind are proportionately augmented, the unlimited advancement of a purely materialistic culture may eventually become a menace to civilization. A purely materialistic science harbors within itself the potential seed of the destruction of all scientific striving, for this very attitude presages the ultimate collapse of a civilization which has abandoned its sense of moral values and has repudiated its spiritual goal of attainment. [UB 132:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p1_3)

## 3. FUTURE EDUCATION

If we start from the fact that, as has been well discussed, the family, marriage, and society will be the upholders of the true and honest values derived from science, philosophy, and religion; and if these concepts are developed by humanity as a whole under the protection of spiritual growth, there will be no doubt that this entire movement will enhance the human being as a whole.

If we observe behaviors that can serve as examples for our lives, future society, through young adolescents, will have to develop new patterns and new techniques to help cope with the terminology and peculiarities of the moment. They will strive to achieve a strong and unified personality. Men and women must acquire a strength of character that will lead them to balanced and symmetrical equality.

They must assume the responsibilities derived from the commitments established to enhance socialization, brotherhood, and fraternity among all of them. To this end, reasoning and logic will be their guiding principles in the face of potential conflicts that may arise from parts of the group that drift toward extravagant, eccentric, and misguided tendencies.

The new youth will be educated in courage to face life's adversities without resorting to recklessness or insults. They will be imaginative and practical. They will counsel prudence, confidence, and humility in return for the jeers, disputes, or confrontations that may arise from established dialogues.

Children and adolescents will be educated in the principles that Jesus encouraged them to possess: the cunning and prudence of a serpent and the innocence and trust of a dove.

> The inner and the outer worlds have a different set of values. **Any civilization is in jeopardy when three quarters of its youth enter materialistic professions and devote themselves to the pursuit of the sensory activities of the outer world.** Civilization is in danger when youth neglect to interest themselves in ethics, sociology, eugenics, philosophy, the fine arts, religion, and cosmology. [UB 111:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p4_4)

## 4. HUMAN BEING'S FACULTY TO BE WISER.

LONGEVITY AND AMALGAMATION

If, as I said before, this book is here to stay for a long time, many new generations will benefit from its existence. We must be very aware, as I said before, that family and marriage are the fundamental pillars for achieving a good future society.

It's a matter of guidance, consultation, and observation. Human beings in the last hundred years have lived longer than their ancestors, around fifteen to twenty years longer. People die later and have a better quality of life. Human relationships are improving every day, overcoming unique situations and irregular idioms produced by the decline of spiritual growth.

A new generation is born approximately every thirty years. If three new generations enter the world in a hundred years, that would be three hundred new generations in a thousand years. Today, China is controlling its birth rate, and so is the Western world. However, African nations still haven't got this situation under control. Time will take its course, I'm sure.

We can dare to think that, if every hundred years the human being lives fifteen years more, in a thousand years he could live from one hundred and fifty to two hundred years of life, knowing that currently he lives about seventy-five to eighty years on average.

To this we must add that Chinese and African society and culture are merging intensely with the Western world, largely because distance is no longer a problem for travel. This will make it possible for everyone to be so mixed in a thousand years that color will be a very common feature of humanity.

Considering that they are two predominantly purebred “races,” each with unique qualities in their natures and behaviors, the mixtures will surely contribute to the evolution of future society.

If we add to this the fact that books, as time goes on, will be introduced into libraries and various education systems, including religious regimes, and that science will also benefit from their content, I am fully convinced that future society, despite adversity, will be able to rise to the challenge.

> The real test of marriage, all down through the ages, has been that continuous intimacy which is inescapable in all family life. Two pampered and spoiled youths, educated to expect every indulgence and full gratification of vanity and ego, can hardly hope to make a great success of marriage and home building—a lifelong partnership of self-effacement, compromise, devotion, and unselfish dedication to child culture. [UB 83:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p7_6)

## CONCLUSION

What do I think about the above topics?

In conclusion, I would venture to say that new technologies are driving human beings to gain a deeper and more confident understanding of this type of emerging science, given that it can impact people's personal, professional, and social lives.

I would advise, based on what I understand from the book, that it's important to focus on short-term goals and objectives. Likewise, it's crucial to have a long-term vision of our future and the aspirations it entails. This will help us make coherent and firm decisions to position ourselves for future ideals.

I understand that ethics and morality in human beings are essential elements for their own evolution. Based on this, I understand that, with rapid technological advancement, there is a need for a solid and emerging technological ethic. Ethics and morality in medicine and biotechnology. A coherent ethic in the development of programs and projects with comprehensive and integral values dedicated to eliminating certain prejudices and stereotypes inherent to each culture.

Adolescent society is considering new concepts of coexistence in the face of changing interpretations of gender and the future development of gender equality or complementarity. It would be desirable to assess the diverse situations encompassed by the broad scenarios where these coexistences develop.

A comprehensive and detailed study of the different roles, norms, and expectations of these identities must establish new guidelines for behavior in this new society so that it feels understood and accepted. A shared coexistence fosters human evolution. We must promote harmonious coexistence between cultures and strive for tolerance.

May we soon be done with the third age of _material comfort_, and may we soon be able to begin the fourth age of _the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom_. [UB 50:5.6-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p5_6)

## WORKSHOP DEVELOPMENT

In the development of the workshop, I will only present two Questions and for this I will rely on two quotes:

> It was at Ur that Ganid had a long talk with Jesus regarding the difference between knowledge, wisdom, and truth. And he was greatly charmed with the saying of the Hebrew wise man: “Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom. With all your quest for knowledge, get understanding. Exalt wisdom and she will promote you. She will bring you to honor if you will but embrace her.” [UB 133:9.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p9_3)

We all know that the effort to put knowledge into practice results in wisdom. If this opportunity to learn can be offered to all children and adolescents, there is a great chance that they will develop a hunger for knowledge and a thirst for wisdom. Education is the watchword of the ages.

1st Question: Are the new generations prepared to obtain knowledge and wisdom within understanding and comprehension?

> Man tends to crystallize science, formulate philosophy, and dogmatize truth because he is mentally lazy in adjusting to the progressive struggles of living, while he is also terribly afraid of the unknown. **Natural man is slow to initiate changes in his habits of thinking and in his techniques of living.** [UB 132:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p3_3)

Attaining knowledge—the purpose of education—must be directed toward acquiring skills, seeking wisdom, developing individuality, and attaining spiritual values. The future of discernment lies in obtaining a vision of a new, higher, cultural society. Education must be propelled to new levels of value by philosophical and scientific leaders.

2nd Question: Do you think that science, philosophy and religion “under the protection” of what The Urantia Book says could be material to be introduced into the current educational system, without mentioning the origin?

THANK YOU SO MUCH!
