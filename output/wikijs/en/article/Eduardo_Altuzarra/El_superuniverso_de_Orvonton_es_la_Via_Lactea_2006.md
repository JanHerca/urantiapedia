**<ins>Provisional presentation</ins>**, according to various paragraphs in UB documents 11-12-15-32-41-49-57 and [“ASTRONOMY AND THE SUPERUNIVERSE”](/en/article/Troy_R_Bishop/Astronomy_and_superuniverses) by Troy R. Bishop © 1982 [“HOW IS ORVONTON REALLY?”]() by Antonio Moya 1987 “FROM URANTIA TO THE MASTER UNIVERSE, INTERESTING FACTS” by Humberto Andrade 1997 [“HOW BIG IS ORVONTON REALLY?”](/en/article/Norm_Duval/How_big_is_Orvonton) by Norm Du Val, and Hubble photos, displayed and discussed at the VI Meeting.

It is important to get a proper understanding of the physical makeup ([UB 15:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p0_3)) of the Grand Universe. Out there, all universes are in an orderly, well-understood, and perfectly controlled procession ([UB 15:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p1_1)). We also need to be consistent between what the revelators have expounded, what is written, and what we come to interpret. (Troy). We must try to understand that the dimensions and forms are simply astounding. Everything is homogeneous and orderly. I dare say that to achieve a little order in our minds, we must take into account the names of things.

<ins>NEBULA</ins>: I consider them to be the “mother of the lamb.” They are the ones that give rise to the Local Universes, the suns, the planets, and the satellites ([UB 15:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p4_7)), although with some exceptions. There are 10 forms of nebulae ([UB 15:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p4_4)), and all of them are the origin of the 7 Super Universes. They have four or more levels of development. There are small ones, which are found **within** our Super Universe; one of them, located in the north, has created 40,000 suns. Currently, there are not many more within our Super Universe creating stars. There are also large ones, they are found **outside** the limits of our SU and can create on the order of 100,000,000 suns ([UB 15:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p4_5)).

Nebulae do not necessarily have a direct relationship to administrative units such as Major Sectors, Minor Sectors, Local Universes, etc. Although some ULs are the product of a single nebula ([UB 15:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p4_6)).

<ins>GALAXY</ins>: The Milky Way is composed of a large number of ancient nebulae ([UB 15:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p4_8)). The Magellanic Clouds are deformed nebulae resulting from an internal catastrophe ([UB 15:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p4_8)). Are they within or outside the limits of our Sun? Let us bear in mind that Andronover is a deformed nebula that has produced 1,013,628 suns.

We know that the Milky Way represents the central core of Orvonton, but it's not the physical center of the SU. I consider it to be much smaller. As I understand it, the SU doesn't have “arms,” only the nebulae do, and each rotates according to its own metamorphosis. A Major S, a Minor S, a Constellation, or a Local System don't necessarily have appendages.

The Local Universes can have extremities, depending on their degree of evolution and the type of nebula: primary, secondary, etc., spiral, barred, etc., respectively. Some ULs may contain one, two, or more nebulae ([UB 41:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p0_3)). Let us consider the ten forms of nebulae.

A Constellation is an administrative part of a Local Universe, a Local System is another administrative part and a Physical System is the smallest part of space, with 1, 2 or 3 suns, several planets and various satellites.
