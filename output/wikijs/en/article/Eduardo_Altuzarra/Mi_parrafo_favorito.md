> The existence of God can never be proved by scientific experiment or by the pure reason of logical deduction. God can be realized only in the realms of human experience; nevertheless, the true concept of the reality of God is reasonable to logic, plausible to philosophy, essential to religion, and indispensable to any hope of personality survival. (<a id="a42_353"></a>[UB 1:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p2_7))

Most of us who are dedicated to reading books almost always point to, underline, copy, reference a series of paragraphs because we consider them interesting, enlightening or transcendental.

In _The Urantia Book_, which I have been reading for several years, I have many paragraphs marked as favorites. If I start at the beginning I have to say that this is one that surprised me on my first reading.

Many years of reading and studying have passed before I realized in this “sphere” of my existence that this paragraph carries a very important truth.

With time and the experiences lived, a certain mental maturity is reached, and that helps us to discern the conscious from the subconscious and the superconscious. These three levels in which human consciousness moves are what make it possible for us to become aware of an inevitable reality.

Trying to want to know God is trying to communicate with that invisible entity, which does not emit words but which can provide us with a series of new ideas in order to become aware of its existence. Coming to understand God is good and that helps to understand human and divine life and existence.

From our limitations that today we must recognize, we can come to understand a God as Creator, a God as Father, a God as Coordinator and Controller and, in terms of personal form, as Spirit.

Science will hardly be able to prove that God exists, and yet we need it for our evolution. Philosophy and religion help to understand its existence. How can we ever know if all this is true or if it is just a mistaken illusion?

We can do something as simple as an examination of conscience. A deep and sincere reflection on our life experiences. How we are, how we think, how we speak, how we do and the degree of coherence that exists between all these behaviors. If all this is in a reasonable way within a logic, it is that we are on the right track.

Conscience, that human quality that helps in an ethical and moral way to sincerely recognize good and bad, is going to be the determining factor that is going to make it possible to get rid of doubt.
Everything begins, in my opinion, in the world of ideas. On most occasions, ideas make us think, we even share those thoughts, and sometimes we take action on the thoughts that promoted those ideas.

To be honest, I am not very clear about the origin of the ideas. There are theories that say that ideas are produced from deep thoughts, others that come from reflective inspirations, others that come from the mind. For now, I prefer that ideas come from the mind.

I consider that the mind is the tool, the structure subject to time and space that the brain uses to think, perceive or feel. To live all kinds of conscious and unconscious experiences. To develop intellectuality, the intelligence coordinated with the emotional life that can elevate the person to the level where that invisible entity is found, which does not emit a word but can provide us with a series of new ideas through adoration and prayer. wisdom.

In the mind there are three levels: the subconscious, the conscious and the superconscious. Most human beings operate on the subconscious and conscious levels. The important thing is to rise from the conscious level to the superconscious.

Human beings think, order, reason, prioritize ideas. We come to believe, see and live things beyond feelings. The mind is also related to other higher faculties such as purpose, will and aptitude. Thus understood, if it depended on the cerebral organ, all human beings would have the same clarity of purpose and the same will to carry them out. But, nevertheless, it is not so.

The bases are in the brain, but it is the mind that opens doors to knowledge, and one step further, making use of intelligence, turns knowledge into wisdom, into vital experience. The brain is the physical support through which the functions of the mind are manifested and, depending on the case, different degrees and depths of consciousness are expressed. The extensive space of operations in which the mind works is consciousness. Physical impressions and perceptions, emotions, intuitions and the world of imagination are also involved. It is a whole universe that is based on matter, but it expands to inconceivable planes, to superconscious levels. It is the one that allows a reflective knowledge of ourselves, of our aptitudes and possibilities. Discover inner changes and discover the outer world, giving space to one's own, intimate and non-transferable personality.

God is understood and known when we come to believe in his existence and want to know him.

And I end this article by saying that Albert Einstein had a very deep concept of what God is. He admired the idea of a superior spirit that we can detect in the details of the universe and in our mind's ability to be moved by how infinitely incomprehensible God is:

> “My religiosity consists of a humble admiration of the infinitely superior spirit that is revealed in the small details that we can perceive with our fragile and weak minds. That deeply emotional conviction of the presence of a higher reasoning power, which reveals itself in the incomprehensible universe, forms my idea of God.”

> When my children once become self-conscious of the assurance of the divine presence, such a faith will expand the mind, ennoble the soul, reinforce the personality, augment the happiness, deepen the spirit perception, and enhance the power to love and be loved.
