George Donnadieu

In the third paragraph of a document from _The Urantia Book_ we can read these few notes:

> “During the Middle Ages, around the 13th century, the United Midwayers of Urantia petitioned for permission to convey to humanity a new revelation in the form of The Urantia Book. The request was approved, but the human context of that time was not yet fit to receive such a revelation.”

At the age of around 14, I was confronted with an echo of this Revelation of the Middle Ages, in “a history of French literature”.

One of the parts of this Revelation (11 pages) narrates a mysterious epic, full of enigmas, poems, cabalistic signs and other geometric symbols.

An enigma, a poetry.

My first steps on the path will be limited to citing:

## The Enigma

The enigma on page 55/111 is introduced by the sentence: "She (the young girl) smiled at my curiosity. I dared to ask her her name, she did not give in but replied: 'My name is equal to fifty-five (GD underlines) and has only eight letters; the third is a third of the fifth. If we add the sixth, we obtain the number whose root, reduced by the first, equals the third, a root which is also half of the fourth. The fifth and the seventh are identical, as are the last and the first and this one, added to the second,

## Poetry

The longest poem has 46 lines and 7 stanzas of 7,8,8,8,6,6 and 3 lines, or 1 septet, 3 octets, 2 sextets and 1 tercet. The 7 numbers listed above are framed by the 7 (the sevenfold creation) and the 3, number of creators of the Trinity.

If there were 4 creators, there would be no more than 15 possible creations.

To go from 7 to 3, you have to go through 12, here represented by 3 x 8 = 24 = 2 x 12 and by 2 x 6 = 12:

12 apostles, the Seraphim engendered in unitary formations of 41,472 = 3481 x 12 and the 24 of the planetary council of Supervisors on Jerusem, $...$ currently chaired by John the Baptist.

This poem is mysteriously introduced into the story by the sentence: “The nymphs immediately lined up in a circle around the ships and began to sing in a melodious voice. (GD underlines)”

But in fact, who are “our king and our queen”? And how do we designate, in the UB, the operation “by this fire of love, together they melt during the sacred hour”? (stanzas V and VI)

And, connecting stanzas I and VII: “So that we may become like God, this suffering, with great joy transmitted to many young people, is transformed into Divine eternity” (GD underlines). equals the sixth which is equivalent to four plus triple the third. Tell me, noble friend, what is my name?'". Dear readers, do not be afraid! There is no need to be the philosopher and mathematician LEIBNITZ to solve a system of 8 equations (6 of the first degree and 2 of the second degree) with 8 unknowns! All those among you who know the second degree equation will indulge in a mathematical recreation on this occasion!

<p style="text-align:center;">
I<br>
<br>
Love is the most beautiful thing on earth,<br>
Nothing is more noble, more elevated,<br>
That we may become like God,<br>
And may suffering no longer touch us,<br>
With our song let us honor the King,<br>
Let the whole sea be glad.<br>
We ask, you answer!<br>
<br>
II<br>
<br>
Who, one day, gave us Life?<br>
Love.<br>
Who gave us grace?<br>
Love.<br>
Where do we come from?<br>
Of Love.<br>
How did we get lost?<br>
For lack of Love<br>
<br>
III<br>
<br>
Who begot us?<br>
Love.<br>
Who took care of us, watched over us?<br>
Love.<br>
What do we owe our parents?<br>
Love.<br>
Who always makes them so patient?<br>
Love.<br>
<br>
IV<br>
<br>
Who makes us conquer?<br>
Love.<br>
How to find Love too?<br>
By Love.<br>
Where to make good works shine?<br>
In Love.<br>
Who can bring two together?<br>
Love.<br>
<br>
V<br>
<br>
Therefore, we sing,<br>
What sounds like:<br>
Homage and praise to Love,<br>
That it may grow,<br>
In our King, in our Queen;<br>
Their body is here, their soul is far away.<br>
<br>
VI<br>
<br>
And if we live,<br>
God will give us<br>
To transmit love to them, with great strength,<br>
For them to acquire high Power,<br>
So that through this Fire of Love,<br>
Together they merge during the sacred hour.<br>
<br>
VII<br>
<br>
So this suffering, with great joy<br>
Passed on to many young people,<br>
</p>

Dear readers, to your Urantian meditations, in these times of great ideological struggles.

Yes, in the Middle Ages as in the twentieth century, the Revelations always liked to address the imagination of humans, particularly friends of poetry, music, and mathematics.

In the Middle Ages “the nymphs sing with a melodious voice”, the poets tell us “let us all sing, let Homage and Praise to Love resound”.

In 1955, in the twentieth century, the UB was not left behind:

> “18. Impatience is a spirit poison; anger is like a stone hurled into a hornet’s nest.” (<a id="a148_91"></a>[UB 48:7.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_20))

> “The best music of Urantia is just a fleeting echo of the magnificent strains heard by the celestial associates of your musicians, who left but snatches of these harmonies of morontia forces on record as the musical melodies of sound harmonics. Spirit-morontia music not infrequently employs all seven modes of expression and reproduction, so that the human mind is tremendously handicapped in any attempt to reduce these melodies of the higher spheres to mere notes of musical sound. Such an effort would be something like endeavoring to reproduce the strains of a great orchestra by means of a single musical instrument.” (<a id="a150_627"></a>[UB 44:1.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/44#p1_14))

Among the 36 occurrences in UB of the words “mathematics” and “mathematicians” let us cite the following:

> “The Romans bodily took over Greek culture, putting representative government in the place of government by lot. And presently this change favored Christianity in that Rome brought into the whole Western world a new tolerance for strange languages, peoples, and even religions.” (<a id="a154_282"></a>[UB 195:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p2_1))

> “When they had finished breakfast, and while the others sat by the fire, Jesus beckoned to Peter and to John that they should come with him for a stroll on the beach. As they walked along, Jesus said to John, “John, do you love me?” And when John answered, “Yes, Master, with all my heart,” the Master said: “Then, John, give up your intolerance and learn to love men as I have loved you. Devote your life to proving that love is the greatest thing in the world. It is the love of God that impels men to seek salvation. Love is the ancestor of all spiritual goodness, the essence of the true and the beautiful.”” (<a id="a156_616"></a>[UB 192:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p2_1))

Dear readers, I invite you to search and find “the name of the young girl” and/or that of the part of the revelation of the Middle Ages where she appears. Without internet, I await your feedback at:

06 32 07 14 07

Your names will appear in the prologue to the second stage of the journey, showing that the UB is indeed an extension, citing in a hidden way, this triple revelation of the Middle Ages.

> Ultimate universe reality cannot be grasped by mathematics, logic, or philosophy, only by personal experience in progressive conformity to the divine will of a personal God. Neither science, philosophy, nor theology can validate the personality of God. Only the personal experience of the faith sons of the heavenly Father can effect the actual spiritual realization of the personality of God. (<a id="a164_397"></a>[[UB 1:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p7_5))
