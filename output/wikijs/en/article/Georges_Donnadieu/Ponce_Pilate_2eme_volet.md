_This second article will reinforce some information taken from the “GOLDEN LEGEND”, about Pontius Pilate - and given in LINK No. 62 - with similar information taken from The Urantia Book on the one hand and from the Larousse encyclopedia (1979) with the words ***PILAT*** and ***PILATE***. For many of its readers, The Urantia Book (UB), gives information at the “top level” of what can currently be revealed to Urantians, in accordance with divine reality. Let us recall that the GOLDEN LEGEND (LD) was written in Italy, in the 13th century, by Jacques de Voragine, born in 1230 in VARAGGIO near GENOA, bishop of GENOA in 1292 and died in 1298._

Let us first compare, with the UB, three of the facts and gestures of Pontius Pilate according to the $L D$, cited above in Link No. 62, on page 24, penultimate paragraph of our article:
“_PILATE was accused by the Jews, before TIBERIUS:_
- _of having allowed the massacre of the innocent,_
- _of having placed pagan images in the temples,_
- _to have allocated for his personal use the money deposited in the boxes._ »

- As for the massacre of the innocents, according to the LD: “_Herod learning of the skill of this man (PILATE), invited him to come to Jerusalem and gave him his power over the Jews_”. The chronology of the UB sets the massacre of the innocents and the flight to Egypt in mid-October of the year - 6 (<a id="a45_302"></a>[UB 122:10.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p10_4)). Pilate could “_have allowed the massacre of the innocents_” (in Bethlehem) if he was already present in Jerusalem before the date of the massacre. However, there is no mention of Pontius Pilate (<a id="a45_545"></a>[UB 122:10.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p10_2)) and he was not procurator of Judea at that time. Therefore, without power vis-à-vis HEROD THE GREAT.
- Regarding “temples and pagan images”: The UB (<a id="a46_48"></a>[UB 185:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_3)) says: “_Pilate's disfavor with the Jews resulted from several unfortunate encounters. First, he had not taken seriously their deep-rooted prejudice against all images considered symbols of idolatry. He therefore allowed his soldiers to enter Jerusalem without removing the effigies of Caesar from their standards, as the Roman soldiers were accustomed to doing under his predecessor_” and “_Being a skeptic himself, Pilate did not understand that men with strong religious feelings would not hesitate to die for their religious convictions_”.
	The UB therefore clearly mentions pagan images (effigies of Caesar on the standards), and not directly “_the temples_”, but the religious feelings and religious convictions of those who frequented the Temple of Jerusalem.
	Here then, the $L D$ seems to give in the 13th century a plausible echo of events which occurred in Jerusalem in the year 26, when Pilate took office as procurator-governor of Judea. The URANTIA chronology mentions “_Undetermined date of the year 26: beginning of the reign of Pontius Pilate as governor of Judea_”.
- As for “allocating the money deposited in the treasuries for his personal use”: here again, the <a id="a49_98"></a>[UB 185:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_5) sets the record straight in the LD: “Another thing earned him great disfavor with the Jews: he dared to take money from the temple treasury to build an aqueduct to provide more water to the millions of visitors to Jerusalem during the major religious festivals. The Jews believed that only the Sanhedrin could dispose of the temple funds; they never stopped inveighing against Pilate about this ordinance, which they considered abusive.”

---

_The UB is silent on Pilate's career before he took office in Jerusalem in the year 26, except (<a id="a53_96"></a>[UB 185:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_1)): “If Pontius Pilate had not been an acceptable governor of the minor provinces, Tiberius would have hardly tolerated his remaining procurator of Judea for ten years. Although Pilate was a fairly good administrator, morally he was a coward. He did not have the stature to understand the nature of his task as governor of the Jews. He did not understand the fact that these Hebrews had a real religion, a faith for which they were ready to die, and that millions and millions of them, scattered here and there throughout the empire, considered Jerusalem as the high place of their faith and respected the Sanhedrin as the highest tribunal on Earth.”_

Here are some recreations and entertainments alluding to the name of the governor of Judea and... the number 4.

First of all, four definitions taken from the Larousse encyclopedic dictionary (1979) for the words PILAT and PILATE:

- **PILAT** (mountain) massif on the eastern edge of the Massif Central to the east of Saint-Étienne 1432 m.
- **PILATE** (mountain) Swiss mountain overlooking UBCERNE and Lake Lucerne 2132 m — funicular.
- **PILATE** (Pontius) Roman knight, procurator of Judea (from 26 to 36). His harsh and clumsy administration earned him being dismissed from his duties by the legate of Syria. He is mentioned in the Gospels for having pronounced the death sentence against Jesus.
- **PILAT-PLAGE**, seaside resort in the Gironde (commune of La Teste) on the Landes coast south of Arcachon, at the foot of the PILAT dune (103m).

The <a id="a66_4"></a>[UB 185:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_6) confirms that it was indeed the legate of Syria who “_ordered Pilate to go to ROME_” “_for having needlessly massacred Samaritans over a false messiah who led troops to Mount Gerizim, where he claimed that the temple vessels had been buried (sic). Fierce riots broke out when he failed to reveal the hiding place of the sacred vessels (sic) as he had promised_”.

We will return in the third part of this study, to the presence of a Mount Pilat less than 50 km from Lyon. Similarly, Mount Pilatus in Switzerland was part, under Augustus and Tiberius, of the imperial province of Gaul-Belgium. The UB (<a id="a68_237"></a>[UB 185:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_6)) mentions “_the province of Lausanne, where Pilate withdrew and ended up committing suicide_”.

In reality, the province of LAUSANNE is “Gaul-Belgium” and nothing says that it was in LAUSANNE itself that Pilate committed suicide. This real suicide site is perhaps closer to Mount PILATUS overlooking UBCERNE than to LAUSANNE, located 140 km as the crow flies from this 2132 m summit.

In <a id="a72_3"></a>[UB 132:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p7_3) of the UB, we read: “_It was in the mountains, during their journey to Switzerland, that Jesus had, with the father and the son, a whole day's discussion on Buddhism_”.

From Lucerne to Locarno, at the origin of Lake Maggiore, in Ticino Switzerland, the distance as the crow flies is shorter than that for Lausanne! Where did Pilate direct his steps before committing suicide?

See you in a future Link for the 3rd part of the GOLDEN LEGEND / PILATE series. We will find **VOUBSIEN**, **VÉRONIQUE**.....and the city of **NAMUR** in the imperial province of Gaul-Belgium!

We end this 2nd part, as entertainment-recreation for friends of UB and numerology, with an analysis of the PILAT root of the summits thus named and their altitudes. From the root to the summits, we find the SQUARE (number 4) or the double square (number 8=4+4), called Barlong square, from which we can draw the golden rectangle, in connection with the golden number $(1 + \sqrt{5}) / 2 = 1,618$ ....

- **PILAT** = 7 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 22 = 2 + 2 = 4
- **1432** = 1 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 10 whose secret value is **4** (10 is in fact the triangular number rank 4, the holy Tetrakys of the Pythagoreans: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10)
- **2132** = 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 8 = 2 x 4 or 4 + 4
- **103** = 1 + 3 = 4

**Conclusion**: with **PILAT** (US), there is squareness in the air at altitude!

_P.S. Even the 881 meters of altitude of the fateful Mount Gerizim have to do with the double Barlong square: 881 = 8 + 8 + 1 = 17 = 1 + 7 = 8 =_ **4 + 4**!
