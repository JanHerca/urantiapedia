> “20. Only a poet can discern poetry in the commonplace prose of routine existence.” (<a id="a38_87"></a>[UB 48:7.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_22))

October 12, 1955: publication in Chicago of the _Urantia Book_. The year 1955 is an exceptional vintage for past, present and future readings of the _Urantia Book_.

The excerpt below from “Historical Perspective—100 Years of Revelation” published for the Urantia Foundation Jubilee is evidence of this.

On Wednesday, October 12, 1955, “the momentous transaction” took place, the publication of the Fifth Epochal Revelation. The first copies of “The Urantia Book” were published under international copyright.

The news that the first books had been delivered to 533 Diversey Parkway spread immediately. Forum members rushed to obtain copies of “The Urantia Book” that were finally waiting for them; they were eager to share them with friends and family who, until that moment, had not heard of the revelation. Appointments were canceled, transcontinental phone calls were made: the big day had finally arrived! Children of Forum members remember that day with great fondness: the first time their parents brought home The Urantia Book.

Many of them received their first copy that day. Some were relieved to know that their parents had been involved in such a noble project, after wondering all those years what they could possibly do on Sunday afternoons and Wednesday evenings. Although family members of those who participated in the Forum attended the social gatherings, only Forum members read the Papers or knew of their existence at this time.

***1955***: the poet and songwriter **Pierre Delanoë** takes the copyright of “Je t'appartiens” music by Gilbert Bécaud who will perform this text, used in the film STARDUST. This film song, used by Eddy Mitchell in his CD “Grand Écran” 2009 was listened to in Sologne, the last evening of our 2010 national meeting.

Here are the 26 verses, including 6 stanzas of 4 each:

1. Like clay, fragile insect, docile slave, I belong to you.
2. Of all my being, you are the only master, I must submit, I belong to you.
3. If you condemn, if you damn me; here is my soul, here are my hands.
4. With sorrows, love and hate, flowing through my veins, I belong to you.
5. I am only a man, just a poor man, here is my soul, here are my hands,
6. Sometimes I think that in your immense, silent palace, you must be fine.
7. I belong to you.

It takes some listening time to see where this song is going: it is in fact a metaphysical, philosophical, religious reflection on the place of man and on the earthly condition. “I belong to you” appears 5 times in the text, and 2 times each of the words “soul”, “hands” and “man”.

The reader of the _Urantia Book_ may be challenged by the following words in the text: “_Clay, veins, man_”: on the level of etymology and terrestrial homophony, the word ADAM can evoke the following Hebrew words.

- Adama: Earth (clay)
- Adom: Red (Red clay, red blood, red man).
- Dam: Blood (The blood flowing in my veins).

As for the UB on page 580, it tells us that the Original Material Son of Satania is Adam and those who go to the worlds of the system as biological elevators always bear the name of this first Original Son of their unique order!

- “I must submit”: the word islân means submission to God but also, religious practice which is distinguished both from inner adherence or imân and from doing good or ihsân.
- “As for I belong to you”, the reader of the _Urantia Book_ will be able to meditate on whether he belongs to the Creator Son, Christ Michael of Nebadon and/or to the Universal Father who delegated to him a fragment of himself: the Thought Adjuster — Mystery Monitor — and what about our position in relation to the different celestial legions who take care of ascending mortals?
- “In an immense palace of silence”: on page 510 of the UB we read: “Number 7 the world of the Father. It is the silent sphere of the system (The palace of silence). No group of beings is domiciled there. The great (immense) temple of light occupies a central location, but no one can be discerned inside, all beings from all the worlds of the system are welcome as worshipers.

***In 1955***, the mental sphere of the Earth (the noosphere) was enlivened by the thoughts of nearly 500 people from the Forum who participated in the transcription of the Epochal Revelation.

The poet Delanoë was able to capture some of these thoughts and evoke them in his text “I belong to you” from the year of the publication of the _Urantia Book_.

This poem of worship is addressed to the Creator(s) of ascending mortal man from the evolutionary worlds.

_Note 1_: Pierre Delanoë wrote a number of Gilbert Bécaud's hits — of the 14 titles on the 1980 gold cassette, 5 are by Delanoë: “_When you dance 53-The day the rain comes 57 -And now 61 — Nathalie 64 — Charlie, you won't go to Paradise 70._”

_Note 2_: The Noës... and the floods: Noë, from the Hebrew nuah (to rest), a name which seems to be more or less a translation or an adaptation of the name of the hero of the Sumerian flood Ziusudra (life of long days).

The <a id="a86_4"></a>[UB 78:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p7_2) “_The floods of Mesopotamia_” speaks precisely of this Sumerian flood and of Noah, winegrower of Aram. In Hawaiian legends the hero of the flood is called Nuu and he is called Nuwa in Chinese legends.

In this article, the poet Pierre Delanoë mentions Bertrand Delanoë, current mayor of Paris, a city whose motto “_Fluctuat nec mergitur_” is quite a program, in the event of a flood.

Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose mother's name was Delano, but who did not avoid the deluge of fire and shrapnel on Pearl Harbor, of which he would have been warned in time.

_Note 3_: Wanted notice: thank you to seasoned readers of UB for indicating the passage where it is a question of the well-being of the Father pouring out his love on his creatures and receiving their adoration from them. “_In your immense .... you must be well_”.

\* Wednesday: day of the week dedicated to Mercury-Hermes, the message of the Gods.

Georges Donnadieu
