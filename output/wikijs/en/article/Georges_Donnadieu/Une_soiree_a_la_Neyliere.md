The 2012 national meeting of French-speaking readers of the _Urantia Book_ took place at Pentecost at the Domaine de La Neylière. Some participants were able to listen, during the recreational evening of Saturday, May 26, to the song Suzanne performed by Alain Bashung (album “Bleu Pétrole” 2008). The lyrics of the 2nd verse and chorus are as follows: original lyrics in English by Leonard Cohen and French adaptation by Graeme Allwright, Australian folk singer.

Original text (L Cohen) | French adaptation (G. Allwright)
--- | ---
And Jesus was a sailor | He was a fisherman who came to Earth
When he walked upon the water | Who stayed up for a very long time
And he spent a long time watching | From the top of a lonely tower
From his lonely wooden tower | When he understood that only
And when he knew for certain | Lost men saw him
Only drowning men could see him | He said we would sail
He said "All men will be sailors then | Until the waves set us free
Until the sea shall free them » | But he himself was broken
But he himself was broken | Long before the sky opened
Long before the sky would open | Abandoned and almost a man
Forsaken, almost human | It sank under your wisdom
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone | Like a stone
And you want to travel with him | You want to stay by his side
And you want to travel blind | Now you are not afraid anymore
And you think maybe you'll trust him | To travel with your eyes closed
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind. | A flame burns in your heart.

Only the French adaptation was read, then listened to on the CD, the listeners being invited to summarize in three words maximum, on a piece of paper, their feelings upon reading the poem. In the mind of the host, three words maximum were capable of synthesizing the text: “Jesus of Nazareth” or “7th effusion Michael”. None of the 10 testimonies collected saw or were able to retain this aspect of the text - Apart from 3 blank butterflies, the 7 others mentioned respectively:
- Loneliness kills more than crowds
- Birth — (arrives?)
- Water — disaster — death
- Doubt
- Broken hearts
- Sad

It is indeed unusual for us to appreciate only three elements in universal reality, namely: the FACT, the IDEA, then the RELATIONSHIP. Religious consciousness identifies these realities as SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY, TRUTH. (READ booklet 196 the faith of Jesus, \& 3) or as the Urantia Book speaks of: THINGS, MEANINGS, VAUBES or even MATERIAL, MORONTIAL, SPIRITUAL LEVELS. The Adjuster constantly invites us to climb the 3 steps towards the SOUL.

Let us now compare the English original (which a friend present at La Neylière was able to provide us with 7 days later) with the French adaptation. The original is very explicit, this from the first two lines of the verse: “_And Jesus was a sailor when he walked on the water, ” allusion to the evangelical legend, rectified in_ <a id="a68_330"></a>[UB 152:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/152#p4_1) _of the UB under the heading, “The night vision of Simon Peter_”. The French adaptation enhances the value of the message in “_He was a fisherman who came to Earth_” “_Abandoned and almost a man_” and _the Son of Man..._ “_He sank under your wisdom_” (that of the Sanhedrin and its leader Caiaphas, the wisdom of men, even religious ones, being very often madness before God!).

The three quotes make it possible to unambiguously identify the “fisherman” (without an acute accent) who, when he was very young, often spent 2 months of vacation with his 2 uncles (and aunts), one of them being a fisherman on the Sea of Galilee. Later, many of the apostles were also fishermen. The mention “came to Earth” highlights the mission of the “7th bestowal of Michael”, where he chose to come to Urantia.

The last two lines of the original chorus are different from their adaptation: “_And you think that maybe you can have confidence (faith) in him, because he has touched your perfect body (your soul) with his spirit_”. But the French adaptation is much more evocative and poetic. You can follow it “_with your eyes closed: a flame burns in your heart_”!

Cohen and Allwritgh are authors - composers - performers of great quality in this work “Suzanne” “Liliane the rose and the lily), the princess sleeping beauty, the soul which awaits ”the divine lover living in man" (cf. Antepenultimate paragraph page LXVI of the table of contents of the UB), namely the Thought Adjuster, Monitor of Mystery very discreet tenant of our mind.

On the wings of poetry, our imagination becomes fertile and takes each of us to regions that could not be more diverse, with varied feelings according to our present or past experiences lived on Urantia. Page 557 of UB nº20 “Only a poet can discern poetry in the banal prose of everyday life”!

- from the Greek poiêsis, action of doing (with art, ingenuity) — example of another use of this Greek word “hematopoiesis” formation of red blood cells which takes place mainly in the red marrow of the bones.
- Note 1: Léonard Cohen (in concert on 09/26/2012 at the Zénith in Toulon) has a name which means in Hebrew: Priest of kahen: to celebrate the office.
- Note 2: The Tower (“wooden” in English, which became “solitary” in French... unless we put the comma before solitary!) is called MIGDAL in Hebrew — MIGDAL GADOL “the great tower” and to be related to MAGDALA. In [Joshua XIX.38](/en/Bible/Joshua/19#v38), one of the cities that fell to NEPHTHALI is MIGDAL-EL “the tower of God”. It also seems that MAGDALA is identical to MAGADAN cited in [Matt. XV. 39](/en/Bible/Matthew/15#v39) or to DALMANUTHA in [Mark VIII. 10](/en/Bible/Mark/8#v10) but it is difficult to affirm this. This last quote from the CHERPILLOD toponymic dictionary is in contradiction with the UB: MAGDALA is on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee, between Tiberias and Capernaum, while the MAGADAN park seems to be “a magnificent park to the south of BETHSAÏDE -JULIAS” ... and therefore on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee; (<a id="a80_855"></a>[UB 152:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/152#p2_1) “the supply of the 5000”. paragraph 1).
- Note 3: The 2nd verse of SUZANNE begins on the Sea of Galilee and ends on the hill of the Skull (Golgotha) in Jerusalem. The Sea of Galilee (altitude 209 m) receives the rains from the western slope of Mount Hermon (altitude 2814 m), lower than Mount Lebanon, literally the White Mountain of the Middle East: (altitude 3083 m). A watercourse receiving the rains from the eastern slope of Mount Meron (altitude 1208 m) also flows into Lake Tiberias. The Jordan connects the Sea of Galilee and the Salt Sea or Dead Sea (altitude 396 m) - The Mount of Olives, near Jerusalem - a mid-mountain town - peaks at 812 m.
