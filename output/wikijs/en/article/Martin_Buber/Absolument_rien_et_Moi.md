**Absolutely nothing**

When Rabbi Aaron was asked what he had learned from his Master, the Grand Maggid: “Absolutely nothing!” he replied.

Pressed to explain these words, he continued:

“_Absolutely nothing, that's what I really learned: the meaning of absolute nothing._
_Because I learned that I was absolutely nothing and yet I existed._”

**Me**

After a few years at his school, a disciple of the Great Maggid \*\* had decided to return home. Having set off, he thought of passing through Karlin to visit Rabbi Aaron, a disciple of the same Master and who had been his study companion a few years earlier. He entered the city around midnight, but not wanting to wait until the next day to see his friend, so eager was he to see him again, he went straight to his house, knocking on the pane of a window, where there was still light. “Who's there?” asked his friend's voice from inside.

“Me!” replied the visitor, sure of being recognized by his voice.

But no answer came and the window remained closed. The visitor knocked on the pane again and again, but to no avail.

“_Aaron!_ he ended up shouting, why don't you come and open the door for me? Deep and serious, the voice of his friend was heard then, so serious even that he had difficulty recognizing it: ”_Who is he who calls himself “Me” as is fitting for God alone?_" These words having reached him, the heart of the young disciple opened, and he admitted to himself that his time of study was not over. Turning around immediately, he returned to Mezritsh.

Excerpt from The Horseradish Man and Hasidic Stories \*

\* _Hasidic Judaism is a religious revival movement, founded in the 18th century in Eastern Europe. Its ideological and historical origins are generally associated with Israel ben Eli'ezer, known as Ba'al Shem Tov (Master of the Good Name; abbreviated Besht) ... Hasidim place particular emphasis on joyful communion with God, especially through song and dance. Hasidism is today one of the two major forces in Jewish orthodoxy._

\*\* _Maggid: preacher_
