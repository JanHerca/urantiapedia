It seems that Ruth Renn (1896-1996) had always been around - dependable, shy and unassuming. Yet, when you got to know her, you realized that she was a woman of great ability.

Renn can be cited for important contributions to the Urantia movement. In 1958 she formed the first Junior Urantia class, comprising 10 children of Glenview Society members. She brought them to perform for the First Urantia Society, Chicago, June 5, 1960 , and they charmed their audience to ecstatic praise.

Their class motto was Progress. Renn developed lesson plans that encompassed the teachings of _The Urantia Book_, including the master universe, the central and grand universes with their architectural divisions, the geologic history of our planet, Andon and Fonta, the various races of mankind, and the five epochal revelations. She also devised creative depictions of the adjutant mind spirits, values, fruits of the spirit, and Thought Adjusters. Perhaps most effective were her versions of Jesus' ministry to the people he encountered.

In short order there was demand for her lessons to be published. Copies of the material were tested by several parents with their own children, but results were inconclusive. It was conceded that without the impact of a dynamic personality such as Ruth Renn's the lessons would not be as effective.

Renn oversaw the children's program at the 1978 General Conference at Geneva Lake, Wisconsin.

In 1975 Urantia Foundation published Renn's 103-page book, _Study Aids for Part IV of The Urantia Book — The Life and Teachings of Jesus_. It was a well-organized compilation of the teachings of Jesus, which emphasized the parables, his religion, promises, miracles and teaching methods. The past bestowals of Michael, Jesus' family lineage and timetables of significant events were also arranged in a handy format.

Her family isn't quite sure when she joined the Forum, but she often reminisced about events that occurred in the 1930s. Grandson Randy Renn related how she had consulted Dr. Sadler professionally and expressed an inner quest for something more spiritual in her life. The doctor invited her to join the Forum.

Soon after, her husband Leroy appeared at Dr. Sadler's front door, hat in hand, announcing that he, too, would be going to the Forum with her. Leroy served as president of the Seventy in 1949. 

Renn herself was vice president of the Seventy in 1953. She later served on the Miscellaneous Activities (now Special Projects), Foreign Extension (now International Fellowship), and Fraternal Relations committees of Urantia Brotherhood (now Fellowship). When she could no longer attend study groups, she kept up a lively personal ministry with _Urantia Book_ readers, often writing notes of sympathetic warmth, commendation and encouragement.
