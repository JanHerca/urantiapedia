<p>Song of Joy</p>
<p>Whilst Western Society celebrates Christmas with rituals and symbolism consisting of tree worship, remembrance of the death of St Nicholas, and the birth of Mithra (for convenience, also being nominated as Jesus’ birthday), the unchristianised land of Japan has decided to have its own 25th December celebration. And so this day is set aside for country wide renditions of Japan’s ‘second national anthem’—that part of Beethoven’s ninth symphony known as  “Oh sing a song of joy.”</p>
<p>The media reports that, throughout Japan, people cue for as long as two hours to hear local orchestras and choirs render their version of this magnificent melody sung  in German. Apparently the song was first brought to Japan in 1916 and, since that time, it has steadily grown in favour with the Japanese to the extent that it is played at practically every public celebration. Now it is given its official day—25th December.</p>
<p>Oh sing a song of joy—the anthem of brotherhood of man! Whatever music is played on the day when Urantia reaches Light and Life, there is a strong possibility that, amongst it, there will be Beethoven’s ninth symphony!</p>
<p>Ludwig Van Beethoven (1770- 1827)</p>
<p>One of the greatest composers who ever lived, Beethoven’s bold, rugged, and dramatic style made a complete break with the sophisticated elegance of his immediate predecessors (Mozart and Haydn).</p>
<p>Beethoven was born in Bonn, of Flemish ancestry, the son of a chorister in the service of the Archbishop-elector of Cologne.</p>
<p>Beethoven studied music from an early age, and became deputy court organist at the age of fourteen. He went to Vienna to study under Mozart when he was seventeen but was forced to return home after a few months to help his family. Finally, he made his home in Vienna when he was twenty seven.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty nine he suffered the first blow in a tragedy which was to change the course of the remainder of his life—he began to go deaf. Perhaps subconsciously he realised that composition might be the only form of music making left to him, and he turned his talents steadily from the playing of the piano to writing music.</p>
<p>By 1815 Beethoven was so deaf that he was no longer able to play in public. By the age of forty four, he was totally unable to hear the storm of applause that greeted the first performance of his ninth symphony.</p>
<p>Main compositions: Opera, ‘Fidelio’; 9 symphonies, 6 overtures, 5 piano concertos, 1 violin concerto, triple concerto for piano, violin and cello; incidental music; chamber music: 17 string quartets, 10 violin and piano sonatas, quintet, sextets, septet, and octet; piano solos:32 sonatas, bagatelles, rondos; songs.</p>
