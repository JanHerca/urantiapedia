The apostles passionately desired the ‘kingdom’ to be an earthly one which would come in power and glory, and James and John Zebedee perceived themselves as being in a position of honor, the first chosen ambassadors. Returning from their search for Jesus in the Perean hills to discover that Peter and Andrew “had become the first accepted counselors of the new kingdom” saddened them to the extent of waking Jesus demanding an explanation.

Four months later, the next blow to their perceived position came when Jesus instructed each of his now six chosen apostles to choose “one man from among his early converts for membership in the projected corps of apostles.” (<a id="a38_226"></a>[UB 138:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p1_2)) John immediately requested clarification of the proposed rank for these proposed additional six, with Jesus affirming that “the men you choose shall become one with us.” (<a id="a38_442"></a>[UB 138:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p1_2))

John and his brother, James, solved what was apparently a dilemma by choosing James and Judas Alpheus, very effectively ensuring no equality, for the Alpheus twins “were the least of all the apostles; they knew it and felt cheerful about it.”

There is not much to be said about these two commonplace fisherfolk. They loved their Master and Jesus loved them, but they never interrupted his discourses with questions. They understood very little about the philosophical discussions or the theological debates of their fellow apostles, but they rejoiced to find themselves numbered amongst such a group of mighty men.

Andrew assigned them to the work of policing the multitudes. They were the chief ushers of the preaching hours, and, in fact, the general servants and errand boys of the twelve—and they were always ready to lend a helping hand to any one of the apostles. (<a id="a44_256"></a>[UB 139:10.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p10_3))

Rarely are the referred to separately in the Urantia Papers. Never is there a reference to Jesus speaking to them individually. The “mediocre twins” were “almost identical in personal appearance, mental characteristics, and extent of spiritual perception. What can be said of one should be recorded of the other.”

Only on two occasions is there reference to Judas Alpheus making “bold to ask one of the few questions which either he or his brother ever addressed to the Master in public.” (<a id="a48_176"></a>[UB 180:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p4_4))

The first mentioned gives an indication of the pervasiveness of the “chosen few” philosophy amongst the twelve apostles when, after Jesus had talked about revealing himself openly to the world, Judas Alpheus “felt a little disappointed that there were to be no more secrets among the twelve, and he made bold to ask: But, Master, when you do thus declare yourself to the world, how will you favor us with special manifestations of your goodness?” (<a id="a50_448"></a>[UB 139:10.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p10_10))

The second, at the Last Supper, was again by Judas Alpheus, when he questioned Jesus as to how they would recognize the new teacher (Spirit of Truth) and although “Judas Alpheus did not fully understand what the Master said, he grasped the promise of a new teacher, and from the expression on Andrew’s face, he perceived that his question had been satisfactorily answered.” (<a id="a52_375"></a>[UB 180:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p4_6))

However, the twins loved Jesus, they “served faithfully until the end, until the dark days of trial, crucifixion, and despair. They never lost their heart faith in Jesus, and (save John) they were the first to believe in his resurrection. But they could not comprehend the establishment of the kingdom.” (<a id="a54_305"></a>[UB 139:10.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p10_11)) Nor could they comprehend Jesus’ mind, “but they did grasp the sympathetic bond between themselves and the heart of their Master. Their minds were not of a high order, they might even reverently be called stupid, but they had a real experience in their spiritual natures. They believed in Jesus; they were sons of God and fellows of the kingdom.” (<a id="a54_702"></a>[UB 139:10.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p10_6))

Despite the motives of John and James Zebedee who chose the twins as apostles, “Jesus welcomed these young men of one talent to positions of honor on his personal staff in the kingdom because there are untold millions of other such simple and fear ridden souls on the worlds of space whom he likewise wishes to welcome into active and believing fellowship with himself and his outpoured Spirit of Truth. Jesus does not look down on littleness, only upon evil and sin. James and Judas were little, but they were also faithful. They were simple and ignorant, but they were also big-hearted, kind, and generous.” (<a id="a56_611"></a>[UB 139:10.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p10_8))

The ordination of the apostles as public preachers of the gospel of the kingdom was a momentous day in their lives. That night while Jesus went for a walk upon the beach, the apostles talked among themselves, and “the twins built a small fire to give them warmth and more light.”

Later, despite Jesus’ request that they “go to their rest so as to be ready for tomorrow’s work,” each requested a private talk—with the exception of the twins “who had fallen asleep.” (<a id="a60_186"></a>[UB 140:6.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p6_14)) To Andrew’s question to Jesus as to whether he should waken them to see if they too would like a private talk, Jesus “smilingly” replied, “They do well, trouble them not.” And at Gilboa, whilst the apostles puzzled as to what the kingdom would be when it came,the twins were blissfully ignorant of the controversy.” (<a id="a60_550"></a>[UB 144:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p1_7))

Similarly when Jesus started to employ the parable method of teaching the multitudes, to the heated debate which arose on the interpretation of the parable of the sower, “with the exception of the Alpheus twins, each of the apostles ventured to make an interpretation of the parable of the sower before they retired for the night.” (<a id="a62_333"></a>[UB 151:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p2_8))

Whenever the apostles’ emotional and mental status is mentioned, such as at the crisis at Capernaum leading to the closing of the synagogues to Jesus’ teaching where “there was a tension of uncertainty and suspense of apprehension resting upon all of them. . . .The only word of cheerful greeting or well-wishing from any of his immediate followers came from one of the unsuspecting Alpheus twins, who, as Jesus left the house on his way to the synagogue, saluted him cheerily and said, ‘We pray the Father will help you, and that we will have bigger multitudes than ever’.” (<a id="a64_576"></a>[UB 153:0.1-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p0_1))

On Palm Sunday. . . “to the Alpheus twins this was a perfect day. They really enjoyed it all the way through and not being present during the time of quiet visitation about the temple, the escaped much of the anticlimax of the popular upheaval. They could not possibly understand the downcast behavior of the apostles when they came back to Bethany that evening. In the menory of the twins, this was always their day of being nearest heaven on earth. This day was the satisfying climax of their whole career as apostles. And the memory of the elation of this Sunday afternoon carried them through all the tragedy of this eventful week, right up to the hour of the crucifixion. It was the most befitting entry of the king that the twins could conceive; they enjoyed every moment of the whole pageant. They fully approved of all they saw and long cherished the memory.” (<a id="a66_869"></a>[UB 172:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p5_11))

However by the Monday night after Jesus had cleansed the temple, “Even the Alpheus twins were at last aroused to the realization that the events of the Master’s life were moving swiftly towards their final culmination.” (<a id="a68_221"></a>[UB 173:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/173#p5_6)) And, on Tuesday morning in greeting each of the apostles personally, “To the Alpheus twins, he said, ‘Do not allow the things which you cannot understand to crush you. Be true to the affections of your hearts and put not your trust in either great men or the changing attitudes of the people. Stand by your brethren.’” (<a id="a68_586"></a>[UB 174:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p0_2))

Despite their being “stupid” Jesus embraced them as his “apostles and you always shall be” and he promised to remember them in the kingdom to come. (<a id="a70_149"></a>[UB 181:2.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/181#p2_19)) He also affirmed their survival as a fact, and portrayed a future on “other and better worlds where you shall likewise work for me. And in all of this work, on this world and on other worlds, I will work with you, and my spirit shall dwell within you,” (<a id="a70_450"></a>[UB 192:2.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p2_13)) even defining this future, at the Last Supper, as one in which he would receive them “on high, where in glory you shall tell of your salvation to seraphic hosts and to multitudes of the high sons of God.”

And at Galilee in his morontia appearance, Jesus in speaking to both of the Alpheus twins, reiterated the advice he had given them at the Last Supper, advice which I attempt, albeit disappointingly, as I plod along through the menial chores of my daily life, “Have faith in God to the end of your days on earth. Never forget that, when you are a faith son of God, all upright work of the realm is sacred. Nothing which a son of God does can be common. Do your work, therefore, from this point on, as for God.” (<a id="a72_511"></a>[UB 192:2.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p2_13))

The Alpheus twins “lived and died conscious of having been honored and blessed with four years of close and personal association with a Son of God, the sovereign maker of a universe.” (<a id="a74_185"></a>[UB 139:10.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p10_11))
