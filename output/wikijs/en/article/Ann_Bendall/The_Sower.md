Jesus opted to teach in parables, “_to the end that our friends and those who so desire to know the truth may find that for which they seek, while our enemies and those who love not the truth may hear without understanding._” (<a id="a36_227"></a>[UB 151:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p1_4))

The first of his parables was that of:

> “_A sower went forth to sow, and it came to pass as he sowed that some seed fell by the wayside to be trodden underfoot and devoured by the birds of heaven. Other seed fell in rocky places where there was little earth, up because there was no depth to the soil, but as soon as the sun shone, it withered because it had no root whereby to secure moisture. Other seed fell among the thorns, and as the thorns grew up, it was choked so that it yielded no grain. Still other seed fell upon good ground and, growing, yielded, some thirtyfold, some sixtyfold, and some a hundredfold._” (<a id="a40_583"></a>[UB 151:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p1_2))

And this parable was one of the few where he actually interpreted its meaning as being, “_First, it was a review of his own ministry up to that time and a forecast of what lay ahead of him for the remainder of his life on earth. And second, it was also a hint as to what the apostles and other messengers of the kingdom might expect in their ministry from generation to generation as time passed._” (<a id="a42_400"></a>[UB 151:3.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p3_13))

Following his explanation, Jesus added, “_the last of the parable of the sower. . . The kingdom of heaven is also like a man who cast good seed upon the earth; and while he slept by night and went about his business by day, the seed sprang up and grew, and although he knew not how it came about, the plant came to fruit. And then when the grain was ripe, he put forth the sickle, and the harvest was finished._” (<a id="a44_414"></a>[UB 151:3.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p3_15)) I wonder if this addition could be interpreted as representative of Urantia finally reaching the age of light and life?
