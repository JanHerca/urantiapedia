Jesus had the ability to think before he spoke. There are a number of references in _The Urantia Book_ certifying to his “pausing” before he replied—a technique which I try so hard to acquire, and so abysmally fail to accomplish. Particularly this is so in those instances when emotion is triggered by a comment, an action, by frustration, or anger.

Jesus commented at great length on the relation of prayer to careless and offending speech, quoting from scripture, “_Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips._”

“The human tongue,” said Jesus, “_is a member which few men can tame, but the spirit within can transform this unruly member into a kindly voice of tolerance and an inspiring minister of mercy._” ([UB 146:2.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p2_13))

At the synagogue at Capernaum, Jesus stated: “_It is not that which enters the mouth that spiritually defiles the man, but rather that which proceeds out of the mouth and from the heart._” ([UB 153:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p3_5))

When reading _The Urantia Book_ last, I tried to interpret the “heart” as meaning the brain which appears to be the center for emotions, some of them pre-wired at birth such as fear of heights or fear of snakes. The ‘mind’ I take as being the brain as it connects with the Adjutant Mind spirits and with potential of connection to cosmic and superconscious mind wherein functions the Thought Adjuster.

Consequently our minds have a choice of either reacting to the “self” or, in utilizing the services of the mind spirits, to respond with wisdom, etc.

Thus, if the mind “pauses,” it has the capacity to respond in a God-like manner under the guidance of the Thought Adjuster. And the reaction will be in the form of an emotion and associated thought.

Despite the rapidity of emotions welling within us, there is a pre-thought which dictates what emotion will surface. In psychology, cognitive therapy is based on the premise that what we consciously think is what mainly determines how we feel. However, our thoughts are often automatic, very quick phrases or sentences so well practiced as to be almost unnoticed and unchallenged.

In therapy a person learns to identify, and then dispute their automatic thoughts. They learn to recognize and question the old assumptions governing so much of what they do. It is a challenging but rewarding process which initiates change. As all truth is from God, by this psychological process, I suspect the person is making themselves accessible to the adjutant mind spirit of wisdom, and also to the superconscious mind arena of the Thought Adjuster rather than continuing to function on the mind/brain arena.

With this hypothesis, I continued to read Jesus’ statement on that day at Capernaum, when, in response to Peter’s request for an explanation, he said, “_Know you not that every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up? Turn now your attention to those who would know the truth. You cannot compel men to love the truth. Many of these teachers are blind guides. And you know that if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the pit. But hearken while I tell you the truth concerning those things which morally defile and spiritually contaminate men. I declare that it is not what enters the body by the mouth, or gains access to the mind through the eyes and ears, that defiles man. Man is only defiled by that evil which may originate within the heart, and which finds expression in the words and deeds of such unholy persons. Do you not know it is from the heart that there comes forth evil thoughts, wicked projects of murder, theft, and adulteries, together with jealousy, pride, anger, revenge, railings, and false witness? And it is just such things that defile men, and not that they eat bread with ceremonially unclean hands?_” ([UB 153:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p3_5))

A person who had a problem in controlling his tongue was Simon Peter who “_had grown up permitting himself freely to indulge strong feelings. And Peter was constantly getting himself into difficulties because he persisted in speaking without thinking. . . .the only reason Peter did not get into more trouble because of his thoughtless speaking was that he very early learned to talk over many of his plans and schemes with his brother, Andrew, before he ventured to make public proposals_” ([UB 139:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p2_3))

At the Last Supper, in addressing Peter, Jesus said: “_I am distressed that your years of such close association with me have not done more to help you think before you speak. What experience must you pass through before you will learn to set a guard upon your lips? How much trouble have you made for us by your thoughtless speaking, by your presumptuous self-confidence! And you are destined to make much more trouble for yourself if you do not master this frailty. You know that your brethren love you in spite of this weakness, and you should also understand that this shortcoming in no way impairs my affection for you, but it lessens your usefulness and never ceases to make trouble for you. But you will undoubtedly receive great help from the experience you will pass through this very night._” ([UB 181:2.27](/en/The_Urantia_Book/181#p2_27))

And it was only as the cock crowed that Peter realized he had denied his Master. “_Not until Jesus looked upon him did he realize that he had failed to live up to his privileges as an ambassador of the kingdom._” ([UB 184:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p2_11))

> With mortal man, only that mind whichfreely submits itself to spirit cErection can hope to survive the mortal time-space existence as an immortal Child of the eternal spirit world of the Supreme, the Ultimate, and the Absolute: the Infinite. ([UB 42:12.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p12_15))
