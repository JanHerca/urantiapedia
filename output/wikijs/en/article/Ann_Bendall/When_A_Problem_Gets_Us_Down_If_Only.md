What a wonderful world this will be, when folks who have a problem can turn to others who are experts in assisting in the solution of same. Those who have been through similar experiences and successfully resolved the issue in question can help. Each day the number of self-help groups grows, and with them the removal of so much unnecessary trauma, as people render a wise, caring, listening ear to the problems of fellow human beings.

Each and every one of us, by the time we are in our mid thirties (as a hypothetical date) has amassed a wealth of valuable knowledge and skill in growing both as an individual and a member of society, and all too often we do not recognize the value we carry within our being, nor are we given the opportunity to know the joy of extending out our hand to another person, in caring consideration.

We decry the coldness of our culture, the isolation caused by suspicion and the insular existence that we lead, and yet culture is made by people and can be changed by its creators. The individual feels so small, so insignificant, only because when we look at the news on TV, the sad state of society depicted appears to be beyond the sphere of one individual to change. We cannot change the world but we can change our world.

A self-help group is formed by one person having the courage to say to another: “I have a problem, would you have the time to listen!” The problem may not be enough laughter in your life, and you simply want to be with people who give you a respite from the drudgery of each day. The big step is taken once you decide to have faith and trust in someone else.

And how do we find that someone? We are currently living in a very exciting period in time, where notice boards are available in neighbourhood centres; most church groups are into pure social service; newspapers abound, and there are local advisory centres and the good old Yellow Pages list an ever growing number of groups set up by folks just the same as us, not deeming themselves to be experts but simply to be friends.

Trust is the price of admission, and the bonus is that you will learn so much about life, yourself and the uniqueness of each of the members of the group, whilst, at the same time imparting to the group the benefit of your experiences and the colour of your personal presence.
