One of Jesus' favourite stories was the “Prodigal Son”. It certainly was a happy-ever-after ending for the dad. He had both of his sons back with him on the farm. However, from the sons' point of view I suspect there was going to be trouble!

The prodigal son had seen the other side of life, and older, wiser, humbler and more appreciative, he returned home. He fully realized how stupid he had been and how much he had hurt his father. He did not seem to think much about one of the reasons why he left—the fact that he had  a decidedly dull and sober brother to work beside. But he must have taken all this  into account, and his love for his dad was so strong that it overcame the unpleasantness of working with his brother. Perhaps, as he trudged his way home, he imagined that his brother could have changed.

No such luck! There was brother still as sober, self-centered, surly, and conceited, and as much a workaholic  as ever. And the older brother was very angry and disgusted with his father for throwing an impromptu party for the member of the family who had succeeded in dissipating one third of the family's estate. His dad tried to explain how he viewed his son's return, but the older son refused to see his father's viewpoint. As far as he was concerned the fools, the unreliable, the indolent and the irresponsible got all the goodies of life. They were given a third of the estate to “blow” and then were wined and dined like royalty for the job they had successfully completed.

The story ends with the father appealing to his unhappy son:

> “Since this father truly loved both of his sons, he tried to reason with this older one: ‘But, my son, you have all the while been with me, and all this which I have is yours. You could have had a kid at any time you had made friends to share your merriment. But it is only proper that you should now join with me in being glad and merry because of your brother’s return. Think of it, my son, your brother was lost and is found; he has returned alive to us!’” [UB 169:1.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/169#p1_13)

I wish that that had not been the finish of the story! A further short paragraph in which the older son went in and gave the prodigal son a big hug and said:“Gee it's good to have you back  home!” That would have been a really nice happy-ever-after ending. It was one of those stories which left a sad feeling in my heart.

Now I know that Jesus told parables so that we could all gain what we wished from what they symbolized. I also appreciate that he has some big messages in that Prodigal Son parable. And we are told that he loved to tell this parable of the lost son, “_the reception of the returning prodigal, to show how complete is the restoration of the lost son into his Father's house and heart._” [UB 169:1.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/169#p1_15)

And so I undertake a Cecilia Ann version of the Prodigal Son.

Our Universe Dad loves us as we are (not as we think we are). He sees us clearly, warts and all, and loves us in spite of them. He gives us everything earmarked for ourselves. In doing so, He is prepared for a Father's sadness should we decide to squander all of our precious gifts. We all know what we have, but some may choose to see it of little value. He gives us intellect, wisdom, truth, beauty and goodness —all placed within our being, subject to our will. And, with many He watches us squander the lot. We, like babies who believe that the world goes away when they shut their eyes, “leave” our Paradise Dad. Down the primrose path of dalliance we trip. He gives us our personality and we  hold it of no value. Instead we display to the world the illusion of roles we play—jolly good person, materialist, poor little frightened rabbit etc.  We daily dress ourselves up in the appropriate garb, dependent upon the company we are keeping. We run around trying to buy, bribe or manipulate others to gain what cannot be bought or asked for—that which our Father gave without any pressure  or coercion—love, understanding and acceptance. We appear to score a win every so often, but it is only an illusion.

We become so far removed from our selfhood that one day  we recognize that we are spiritually bankrupt. Morality? We have none!. We take a good look at ourselves and our life, and start to understand what our Father is really like; how much He loves us; how much He believes in us. And we become ashamed that His trust and faith in us was so misplaced. And yet, in our hard won wisdom we also realize that all we hoped to find in the illusionary world we had actually had all along in the world of reality of His home.

For those prodigals who decide to trudge back home, genuine forgiveness speech rehearsed; recognizing fully our own lack of worth, we are greeted with a tearful face, radiating happiness and a great big spiritual hug. Gosh, our Paradise Dad does not even let us complete our forgiveness speech. For He knows. All He has been hoping for is for this day to arrive.

He does not expect the rest of His kids to understand, only to respect what and why He feels as He does.  One day the other children will grow a little in love and then they will share His joy. All He asks in the interim is that they do the “proper”  thing and join with their Paradise Dad “ in being glad and merry because of your brother's return.” He tries to help them understand the way he views His son's return: “Think of it, my son, your brother was lost and is found; he has returned alive to us!” And then He leaves it to the brother of the prodigal son to adjust/accept whatever.

The older brother? Being in the family of God can be rough for those steadfastly, determinedly and humourlessly growing God kids. They do the “right thing”, and then what happens? The larks of the family—the indolent ones, the ones who cause their Dad so much sadness have the homecoming parties! This learning to love as our Father loves can be really  a shock to our idea of fairness. The universe marches to the beat of a different drum to that of our planet. Mercy comes first and justice a poor second. For the prodigal sons—they earn their maturity hard. They have the need to discover, and know in depth, the wrong way to go before they can appreciate the right way. For the older brothers, they need to learn to “love as our Father loves”. Sure they do not get the tears shed, they are too sensible for that. But it would be nice for their Dad if they tried to have His eyes filled with tears of laughter occasionally, rather than have His eyes express sadness at their refusal to understand why and how He loves as He loves.

Perhaps if the older sons declared a truce with the prodigal sons then they could teach the prodigals how to be industrious and accept responsibility, whilst the prodigals taught the older sons to laugh. Then the family would really be a happy one. 

God as a Father, is patient and long suffering. He waits a long time for His prodigal sons and daughters to return.  He is always on the watch, waiting and hoping for the day.

> I have learned silence from the talkative, tolerance from the intolerant and kindness from the unkind. I should not be ungrateful to those teachers. 
>    Kahlil Gibran
