The first time I read _The Urantia Book_ I had the impression that I was not understanding anything, as I still know that there are many things in this mysterious book that I do not understand. I could fall into the error of staying with the data. For example, there are as many or as many celestial worlds in the superuniverse or in Havona, and lose sight of the importance of the fact that there is a heaven and a paradise. It really is a long text, but I think you should not feel overwhelmed by it. It is important that, in a world like ours, so given to agnosticism, someone makes things clear: God exists, he is the “architect” of the universe, and the human being transcends material nature.

And it is that living with your back to spiritual reality is an act of suicidal ignorance. The consequences of materialism are catastrophic, both for the individual and his soul and for society and its progress.

If someone told us that it is with faith that the world will change as we approach utopia, what would we think? Currently, that is naive. But if we don't become like children, we may end up like the sophisticated scholars, deceived by the appearances of “knowledge” and getting nowhere. Be aware that faith is simple and simple like a flower. However, natural intelligence accompanies believers. We say that an atheist and literate doctor is very clever, and that a believer is a simpleton, according to the measuring stick of a world under the influence of rebellions... But many intelligent people in this world have not been fooled by the sophistry of materialism. I give, for example, Leonardo da Vinci or Albert Einstein, whose genius no one doubts.

Sometimes I have the impression, and it is also a self-criticism, that it is the spirit that is important, and not mentalisms. That I get lost in speculation, and forget conviction, faith. As the authors of the _Urantia Book_ indicate, it is this same faith, which inculcates the spirit, and this same spirit, which leads to the approach to the truths. That the truth is experienced, felt, as a reality. That they are not just a dead letter.

And it is in this personal reality that life unfolds.

I believe that with faith, simply, you live better.

Health!
