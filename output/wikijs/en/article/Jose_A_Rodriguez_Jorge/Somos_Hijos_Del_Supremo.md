We are children of the Supreme. The supremacy is with the good of God. We, when we do good, are simply uniting ourselves with the will of God. Perhaps here lies the secret of eternity, of the survival of the soul, of the future immortality of the human being, of the progression towards worlds of glory. In that the union with the Spirit yields its fruits, and they are fruits of life.

I think _The Urantia Book_ is quite clear on this. Human beings, children of God born of the Spirit, are more than children of the Absolute, children of the Supreme. If I am not mistaken, also God the Supreme works from Paradise-Havona for the entire Universe. The challenge for the human being consists in this collaboration. To work side by side with the Father-Mother, without forgetting that one is as small as a drop of sea in the divine ocean. It seems a great mystery, that from finitude the divine Infinity is glimpsed.

Jesus also makes it clear in his commandments: be perfect, as God in heaven is perfect. But how can a mortal creature, with defects, reach this Spirit? It may be because of the true freedom that God grants. We can choose. The son of God already chooses. Life is like a polished jewel, like a lotus flower, which strives in this world as if it were living in the other, in glory and, why not, even in “power”, that which has the one who serves the humanity; follow the golden rule, treat the other as oneself and, thus, the Infinite God.
