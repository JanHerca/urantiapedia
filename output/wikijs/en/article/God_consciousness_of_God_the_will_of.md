## God—consciousness of

The existence of God is utterly beyond all possibility of demonstration except for the contact between the God-consciousness of the human mind and the presence of the God-Spirit that indwells the mortal intellect and is bestowed upon man as the free gift of the Universal Father.

If mortal beings are wholeheartedly spiritually motivated, unreservedly consecrated to the doing of the Father's will, then, since they are so certainly and so effectively spiritually endowed by the indwelling and divine God-Spirit, there cannot fail to materialize in the individual's experience the sublime consciousness of knowing God and the supernal assurance of surviving for the purpose of finding God by the progressive experience of becoming more and more like him.

The recognition of spiritual values is an experience which is super-ideational. **There is no word in any human language** which can be employed to designate this “sense,” “feeling,” “intuition,” or “experience” which we have elected to call **God-consciousness**. The spirit of God that indwells us is not personal—it is pre-personal—but this Monitor presents a value, exudes a flavor of divinity, which is personal in the highest and infinite sense. If God were not at least personal, he could not be conscious, and if not conscious, then would he be infrahuman.

Consciousness of presence of your indwelling God-Spirit is consciousness of God's presence. Its eternal fusion with the evolutionary soul of man is the factual experience of eternal union with God as a universe associate of Deity.

To see God—by faith—means to acquire true spiritual insight. And spiritual insight enhances spirit guidance, and these in the end augment God-consciousness. And when you know the Father, you are confirmed in the assurance of divine sonship, and you can increasingly love each of your brothers in the flesh, not only as a brother—with brotherly love—but also as a father—with fatherly affection.

> For I see now that I am asleep that I dream when I am awake.
> _Pedro Calderon de la Barca_

> A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin oflittle minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency, a great soul has nothing to do.
> _Ralph Waldo Emerson_

## God—the will of

Sooner or later we all become aware that **all creature growth is proportional to Father identification**. We arrive at the understanding that **living the will of God** is the eternal passport to the endless possibility of infinity itself.

Mortals will sometime realize that success in **the quest of the Infinite is directly proportional to the achievement of Fatherlikeness**, and that in this universe age the realities of the Father are revealed within the qualities of divinity. And these qualities of divinity are personally appropriated by universe creatures in the experience of living divinely, and to live divinely means actually to live the will of God.

Every mortal who is consciously or unconsciously following the leading of his indwelling God-Spirit is living in accordance with the will of God. Consciousness of its presence is consciousness of God's presence.

Fail not to remember that the will of God can be done in any earthly occupation. Some callings are not holy and others secular. All things are sacred in the lives of those who are spirit led; that is, subordinated to truth, ennobled by love, dominated by mercy, and restrained by fairness—justice. The spirit which my Father and I shall send into the world is not only the Spirit of Truth but also the spirit of idealistic beauty.

The kingdom of God in this world—consists in the supreme desire to do the will of God and the unselfish love of mankind which yields the good fruits of improved ethical and moral conduct.

“When God's will is your law, you are noble slave subjects; but when you believe in this new gospel of divine sonship, my Father's will becomes your will, and you are elevated to the high position of the free children of God, liberated sons of the kingdom.” (Jesus)

Though we cannot see God, we can know him. And **by daily living the will of the Father** in heaven, **we can reveal him to our fellow men.

In the coming kingdom, be not mindful of those things which foster your anxiety but rather at all times concern yourselves **ONLY** with doing the will of the Father who is in heaven.

The human Jesus saw God as being holy, just, and great, as well as being true, beautiful, and good. All these attributes of divinity he focused in his mind as the “will of the Father in heaven.”

The will of God does not uniformly prevail in the heart of the God-seeking material mortal, but if the time frame is enlarged beyond the moment to embrace the whole of the first life, then does God's will become increasingly discernible in the spirit fruits which are borne in the lives of the spirit-led children of God.

> Experience is never limited and it is never complete; it is an immense sensibility, a kind of huge spider web of the finest silken threads suspended in the chamber of consciousness, and catching every airborne particle in its tissue.
> _Henry James_

> Man is an intellectual animal, and therefore an everlasting contradiction to himself. His senses center in himself, his ideas reach to the end of the universe; so that he is torn in pieces, without a possibility of its ever being otherwise.
> _William Hazlitt_
