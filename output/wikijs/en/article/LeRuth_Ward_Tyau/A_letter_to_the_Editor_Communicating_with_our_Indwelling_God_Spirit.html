<p>A letter to the Editor. Communicating with our Indwelling God-Spirit.</p>
<p>What follows is part of a letter to the editor from Le’Ruth Ward Tyau, a reader living in Hawaii who tried out the revelators’ recommended method for  improving contact with our Thought Adjusters. The method was discussed in the January/February Innerface in an article entitled, “On Worship.” Le’Ruth discovered a variation of the method that, for many, would probably be a great help. She wrote:</p>
<p>Last year about this time I took a class called “The Personal Journal Circle,” taught by Dr. Abe Arkoff, Professor Emeritus, UHM Psychology Department. In the class Abe asked us to write our journal in an  “altered point of view,” as by a third party observing  and discussing our day with us. We were to address the letters to ourselves. I had difficulty with the thought until I got the idea that I would write the letters as if my Divine Adjuster had written them!</p>
<p>I really got into that idea and found it so delightful. I was doing this journal all on the computer in a nice script and then cutting each page and gluing them into a nice journal about 7 x 9. I was addressing the letters to Dear Le’Ruth and wondered how I would sign them. The thought came to me to use the initials D.S. for Divine Spirit and besides, my husband’s Chinese middle name was D.S. so it appealed to me. Then as I tried out different fonts for the D.S. suddenly there were the Greek symbols for DS!(dS)</p>
<p>I liked how it looked and not feeling comfortable about signing them “Divine Spirit” and thinking this was presumptuous, as you indicated in your talk, I decided on using  Greek symbols. I went next door to show my grandsons and I asked them if they knew about those symbols and they told me that they are used in mathematics to mean to change and to sum!</p>
<p>I was really excited about it then! This is from one of my letters:</p>
<p>“P.S. I know you intended my signature to be DS for Divine Spirit, but I had a surprise for you when I prompted you to see how the DS would look in other fonts. You happened on the Greek alphabet and you discovered Delta Sigma is my signature! Delta means ‘change’ and Sigma means ‘sum’, so you can see how perfect my name is because I am bringing about change to the sum of your mortal self to make you much more that you are now! You are a pilgrim in time who will discover Eternity through me!”</p>
<p>On the day that I shared what I was doing with the class, a comment by a classmate caused me to cease from writing those “Dear Le’Ruth” letters for a while and to add a page in the front of the Journal with explanation! I wrote about the assignment as I have shared above and then wrote:</p>
<p>“A class member, after hearing about what I had done, commented that I would be good at automatic writing and it shocked me, as I do not believe in automatic writing! Besides I never intended to uplift my thoughts to presume they were divine words to me and I didn’t want any one to ever think I had done that! So I quit and for a time just wrote letters addressed to “Dear Journal,” and signed by “Le’Ruth!” However, I have gone back to writing them from a third party viewpoint because it is so enjoyable to have a divine lover’s response to my day! Having someone who loves you either commend you or correct you is a wonderful learning experience. So, I have gone back to that format but will place this note of explanation in the front of my journal to say that I have written all the letters and never have I done more than ‘pretend’ they are written by my Divine Spirit!”</p>
<p>I did go back to writing the letters from the Divine Spirit and it was such a rewarding experience. But I didn’t realize the great spiritual value of the experience until I read your paper on Worship! Suddenly the light went on and I realized how great it was that I was developing a dialogue experience with my Divine Adjuster through those letters!</p>
<p>I already have my sharing in my worship, prayer and receptivity time which I have each morning, so this evening time of writing a commentary about my day is an excellent way to complete the circle of dialogue.</p>
<p>After the class ended and my journal was full I began using letters for my journal. Your article has changed that! I started on February 1st and wrote of the profound effect your Worship article had on me and quoted the paragraphs you wrote after you told of your son’s desire for a “method.” I just want you to know how they have had an important influence in my life. I quoted several paragraphs including these three choice ones in my journal:</p>
<p>“Even after reading this, I was still a bit slow on the uptake but eventually it sank in that the technique being recommended to us by the revelators was really intended to be a dialogue. We are supposed to be both ourselves and also to speak the part of our own Spirit, replying to ourselves exactly as if we were truly our indwelling God-spirit.”</p>
<p>“To take the part of God in a conversation would appear to be somewhat presumptuous if it were not for the fact that it has the sanction of the revelators who recommend it. But to do so effectively it becomes essential that we already have a reasonably accurate idea of what God might say to us in any particular circumstance. How can we do this? The revelators inform us that: ‘The nature of God can best be understood by the revelation of the Father 	
which Jesus unfolded in his manifold teachings and in his superb mortal life in the flesh.’”</p>
<p>&quot; That comment leaves us without doubt that the best way for us to know how God might respond to us is to be thoroughly familiar with the life and teachings given to us by Jesus. Once we achieve this, in a dialogue in which we also take the part of our own Spirit, when an answer is required we simply need to ask ourselves, ‘What do we think Jesus would
have done?’&quot;</p>
<p>Well done, brother Ken! Then D.S. responded:</p>
<p>&quot;Now you understand why writing this journal can help you grow spiritually! As you imagine what I would say to you about your day, you will begin to be more aware of how you should think about your activities while you are experiencing them. You will be more aware when you confirm your daily plans with me, just what the ‘Father’s Will’ would be for your day. Now you have begun to let me have a voice again in your day, realize that it is never too late to be what you are supposed to be. Inward, Onward and Upward.</p>
<p>“Love Eternally, D.S. The Archivist of your Mind, The Architect of your Soul, The Artist of your Life.”</p>
<p>I hope this will bring a smile to your face and you will feel rewarded in some way for your sharing. I call it an “enrichment service!” Thank you.</p>
<p>Your Sister in the GOOD NEWS,</p>
<p>Le’Ruth Ward Tyau</p>
