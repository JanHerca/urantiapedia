_By Joyce Anderson, New York, United States_

What does _The Urantia Book_ mean to me? It provides a foundation for living and a promise of what is to come as we move toward the far distant future when we will become perfect, even as our Father in heaven is perfect.

As _The Urantia Book_ teaches: “God's primal perfection consists not in an assumed righteousness but rather in the inherent perfection of the goodness of his divine nature. He is final, complete, and perfect. There is no thing lacking in the beauty and perfection of his righteous character. And the whole scheme of living existences on the worlds of space is centered in the divine purpose of elevating all will creatures to the high destiny of the experience of sharing the Father's Paradise perfection.” [UB 2:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p2_5)

As a second-generation reader, I grew up with the book. Its clear descriptions of the universe and our path to perfection always made sense to me. The concept of an infinite future of growth and development continues to be both inspiring and logical. It’s also been intellectually satisfying to have an understanding of cosmology, the personalities of the grand and local universes, and the history of Urantia (including how we became so confused). It is comforting to know of the celestial influences that surround and enfold us, the Spirit of Truth, the guardians of destiny, our Thought Adjusters, and hosts of others.

I recognized many years ago that knowledge is helpful only if it changes how we live our lives. When I read the book, I ask myself: How does this impact what I will do today? How does this help me to be of greater use to my brothers and sisters on this planet? Sharing God's love is one way to serve others, with a kind word, a helping hand, or a listening ear. If we can learn to understand and love another human being each day or week we make spiritual progress on our path to Paradise.

One of the beauties of the book is that I continue to glean new insight from familiar passages every time I read them as a result of my growing experience. Reading the book also enhances my ability to recognize truth in other sources, whether in conversation, literature, or theater.

If there is one overarching lesson the book seeks to impart, it is that patience is critical to our growth and evolution, both individually and as a planet. The double default of our Planetary Prince and Material Son and Daughter was the result of impatience and hubris. There is no substitute for humility and living experience. So, I am committed to living each day loyally as the nascent “soul” I am with the assurance that I will eventually transform into a robust daughter of God if I seek to do the Father's will as best I can each day.

What does _The Urantia Book_ mean to me? It provides an answer to the age-old question, What is the meaning of life?

> The disciples early learned that the Master had a profound respect and sympathetic regard for every human being he met, and they were tremendously impressed by this uniform and unvarying consideration which he so consistently gave to all sorts of men, women, and children. [UB 138:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p8_9)
