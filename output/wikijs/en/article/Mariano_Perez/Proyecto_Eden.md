**Abridged transcript of an introduction based on a Power Point presentation**

The revealed truth of the _Urantia Book_ is sinking into our hearts. The teachings of the blue book become a way of thinking, seeing life and living it. When we understand the how and why of our life, the divine flame arises in our hearts and we feel the need to <ins>serve</ins> in the achievement of the great work.

In the “Mandate for publication”, a text where the revelators gave a series of instructions to the contact commission, it is said that, although _The Urantia Book_ is not given at the time when it will be fully understood and accepted, an early publication has been decided that would be available for the training of guides and instructors. Also, they say, their presence is needed to attract the attention of people with means who can provide funds for translation into other languages.

That is, the celestial supervisors wait for guides, instructors, teachers to come out... for what? Well, to make known the revealed truth, to transmit the teachings of the _Urantia Book_ and of Jesus.

Why publicize such teachings? So that human beings recognize a creator of all things, know the existence of a purpose of creation, a divine project... and wish to participate in it. In short, it is about “winning souls for the kingdom”, contributing to the evolution of the planet.

The general objective of the EDEN project is to awaken in individuals the desire to undertake the personal search for God. This project is aimed at all those who need to search, for these possible reasons:

They don't find meaning in their lives.
- They do not believe in a creative being or in the - They are not satisfied with institutional religions
- They have a “poor” concept of God.

They are the ones who have to come to us.

EDEN will be a training center where minds will be enlightened for the revival of the soul. These are the general ideas of the training method:

- There are 7 phases or courses (the number is not a whim, but has a symbolic intention)
- Students must pass the 7 courses in stages.
- In each course or level the revealed concepts are expanded.
- Each course has objectives, each objective includes lessons and each lesson implies teachings or revealed concepts. eternal life

As for the rest of the courses, these would be their objectives:

- Course number 2: - Inner transformation (true alchemy)
- Commitment to change
- Promote virtues. - Course number 3:
- Awareness of a higher reality
- Strengthen faith
- Desire to start the upward career.
- Course number 4:
- Relationship with the Universal Father
- Prayer: talk to God
- Know the origin and evolution of religions: personal religion
- Course number 5:
- The universal unit
- The brotherhood of all beings: love your neighbor
- Commitment to altruistic service
- Course number 6:
- Expand the concept of the mind
- Expand the concept of soul and spirit
- Know the creation. Part One: Paradise and Havona
- Course number 7:
- Know the creation. Part Two: Superuniverses, Local Universes
- Know the divine plan: the upward race
- Worship the creator

For the development of the EDEN project, human resources, didactic and creative methods and means, and physical space are needed.

These are the characteristics that the physical space should have:

- With enough rooms for the different levels.
- Each room will be equipped with sufficient resources for its level.
- Availability of other necessary spaces: office, warehouse, other rooms, etc.
- That its construction has a symbolic relationship with Creation.

The following figure is a proposal for the layout of the physical space of EDEN:

## Comments from attendees

We must be very alert to the danger of hierarchization, although this does not necessarily have to occur. It is assumed that 2,000 years do not pass in vain. On the other hand, this is a project that can be covered in stages; it is not necessary to tackle everything at once.

The symbology used (the 3 concentric circles) seems especially important to us. It must not be forgotten that the symbol is the language of the high spheres of thought.

As a suggestion, it must be emphasized that we are part of a project of God. It would be a good idea to take positive ideas from other religions: Buddhist meditation, overcoming attachments, Course in Miracles, etc.)

Regarding the way to carry out this school with the current means, a suggestion would be to create a virtual classroom on the Internet (for example, from Second Life). This virtual classroom would not cover 100%, since personal contact is vital, especially when dealing with spiritual matters.

In any case, the important thing is that the idea arises, because right after the means to carry it out appear.

It would be convenient for the students of higher courses to tutor those who are behind, and avoid that there are “authorities” of the Book.

It is evident that throughout the Urantia movement there is an interest in dissemination, which is reflected in the subject matter of the articles published in the magazines of the international association. It is possible to make a difference with respect to other movements, especially if we emphasize our anti-dogmatic attitude.
