Talk given in the virtual room http://www.urantia.com.br/sala
October 25, 2015


## INTRODUCTION

In this, my second virtual talk in the room provided by our brothers in Brazil, I wanted to address a complex topic, a problem that is somewhat frightening and with which we must tread carefully. I am referring, as you may know from the title of the talk, to whether something should be done to biologically improve the human races of this planet, and if so, how to do it.

This is a matter that, when addressed in _The Urantia Book_, has sparked much controversy. I would say, without fear of being wrong, that it is one of the issues our revelators speak to us about in this fifth revelation that has raised the most _blisters_ among those who have read it, and that has even caused some readers, believers in God and who generally accept the explanations and teachings of _The Urantia Book_, to distance themselves from it and even reject this marvelous revelation. And for other readers who, while they have not rejected the fifth revelation as a whole, it does create many doubts and uncertainties. Of course, for those who are against or do not accept _The Urantia Book_ as a revelation, this is one of the issues they cling to in order to defame the book as a whole.

It's true that the biological evolution of the human race remains a delicate subject, but I sincerely believe that in many cases it has been misunderstood, and phrases that speak of it need to be contextualized, rather than taken literally.

Aware of this problem, I've decided to delve deeper into the topic with an open mind and a critical spirit. To this end, I'm going to describe the path, the steps, I'll take in my talk/conference.

First, I will quote a selection of paragraphs from _The Urantia Book_ that deal with the biological evolution of the races, their problem on Urantia, the need to address the problem, etc.

Next, I will propose what I understand to be the path, or rather the tools, for the biological optimization of the human race; and then, in a bold move on my part, I will propose what might be the standards that will govern this endeavor.

But first of all, perhaps it would be convenient, to put things in context, especially for the most novice readers, to briefly explain that, on evolutionary planets like ours, there is a divine plan to biologically elevate the evolutionary races of the planets, and this is carried out when the races of the worlds have reached the maximum of their biological level coming from their animal origin, which has been achieved through evolution over time. When this happens, an Adam and an Eve are sent to the planets, materialized in bodies of flesh and blood, and their main mission (though not the only one) is to have a large number of direct descendants and these children in turn as well, spanning several generations until reaching a large number of children descended from the original couple. Specifically, half a million was advisable by the Melchizedeks, and from there, to mix with the evolutionary races and thus elevate them biologically.

On this planet, as you know, long before reaching that point, the plan was thwarted by Adam and Eve's infidelity, when the latter allowed herself to be deceived by Caligastia, the planet's traitorous prince. About 105 years after their arrival, Eve agreed to interbreed directly with a descendant of the Nodites, intending to accelerate the plan of biological uplift, thus breaking the oath of loyalty to the ruler of the universe, which prohibited precisely this, that the “original” Adams and Eves intermix directly with the races; thus, the entire plan collapsed.

From then on, they ceased to be immortal in this world, the garden was abandoned, many of the children of Adam and Eve left the planet, and, in short, the descendants of this violet race (as it is called) were weaker, although something remained and in fact has influenced the other races, especially the blue one.

I'll digress here, as this has always caught my attention: I'm referring to the drastic measures taken after the offense. It is true that the plan was disobeyed, but curiously, one can deduce that this rule against the Material Sons of Jerusem mixing with mortals does not always apply, since we are told in [UB 51:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p1_7) that this function of biological uplift generally falls upon the progeny of the Planetary Adams. They say “generally,” which leads us to think that this is not always the case.

Now that we've addressed the problem that has plagued this planet ever since, let's see what the revelators have to say about it.

## QUOTES FROM THE URANTIA BOOK REGARDING BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION ON URANTIA.

### How it should have been

> _When the summit of biologic evolution is reached, a high level of civilization has been attained, but there is little development of a mechanical type; invention is the characteristic of the succeeding age. The races are purified and brought up to a high state of physical perfection and intellectual strength before the end of this era. The early development of a normal world is greatly helped by the plan of promoting the increase of the higher types of mortals with proportionate curtailment of the lower. And it is the failure of your early peoples to thus discriminate between these types that accounts for the presence of so many defective and degenerate individuals among the present-day Urantia races._ [UB 52:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p2_9)

> _One of the great achievements of the Prince Age is this restriction on the multiplication of the mentally deficient and socially unfit. Long before the time of the arrival of the second Sons, the Adams, most worlds were seriously engaged in the task of race purification, a task which the peoples of Urantia have not yet seriously undertaken._ [UB 52:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p3_5)

_This epoch_ (referring to the post-Adamic period) _generally sees the completion of the elimination of the unfit and the further purification of the racial strains; on normal worlds, defective bestial tendencies are almost entirely eliminated from the reproductive stocks of the realm._

As you can see, the task of biologically improving breeds should be much more advanced than it is. In fact, as we're warned, nothing has even been done about it.

But we haven't talked about the benefits of this improvement. Let's see what the LU has to say about it.

### Benefits of Biological Improvement

> _The amalgamation of the evolutionary races with the sons of Adam enhances and seals all these relationships, resulting in the immediate improvement of biological status, the stimulation of intellectual potential, and the increase of spiritual receptivity._ [UB 51:6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p6)

> _The donation of Adamic life plasm to the mortal races results in an immediate elevation of intellectual capacity and an acceleration of spiritual progress. There is also usually some physical improvement._ [UB 52:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p3_5)

> _The capacity of material creatures to effect spirit response is entirely dependent on the associated mind endowment, which, in turn, has directionized the course of the biologic evolution of these same mortal creatures._ [UB 36:2.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p2_18)

It must be clear, therefore, that the biological elevation of human races is not a matter of whim, nor of having a better and stronger physique, nor even of having a superior intellectual capacity alone. The most important aspect of this improvement is the increase in spiritual receptivity, which must lead to greater spiritual progress. Hence the importance of addressing this issue.

Despite the current state of the planet in this regard, due to the failure of Adam and Eve, the LU tells us:

> _Great progress has been made on your world, despite the failure of orderly plans, since the life plasm of Adam was donated to your peoples._ [UB 51:5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p5)

> _What Adam contributed to the biological condition of the races, notwithstanding the partial failure of the enterprise, greatly improved the people of Urantia._ [UB 78:1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p1)

> _When all is summed up, Adam and Eve made a mighty contribution to the speedy civilization and accelerated biologic progress of the human race._ [UB 76:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p6_4)

Apparently, although the plan failed, it was only partially so. Let's see what the whistleblowers tell us about the current situation.

### How we are/Current problem

> _Classes in society, having naturally formed, will persist until man gradually achieves their evolutionary obliteration through intelligent manipulation of the biologic, intellectual, and spiritual resources of a progressing civilization, such as:_
> 
> _1. Biologic renovation of the racial stocks—the selective elimination of inferior human strains. This will tend to eradicate many mortal inequalities._
> _2. Educational training of the increased brain power which will arise out of such biologic improvement._ [UB 70:8.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p8_14)

> _No society has ever made much progress by permitting laziness or tolerating misery. But poverty and dependence can never be eliminated if defective and degenerate strains are abundantly supported and allowed to reproduce without restriction._ [UB 71:3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p3)

> _This problem of race improvement is not such a major undertaking when attacked at this early date of human evolution_ (speaking of the time of the Planetary Prince). _The earlier period of tribal strife and severe competition for racial survival had eliminated most of the abnormal and defective stocks. An idiot does not have much chance of survival in a primitive, warlike tribal social organization._ [UB 52:2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p2)

> _Since racial harmonization has not been achieved by the Adamic technique, ***you must now solve your planetary problem of racial improvement by other methods of adaptation and control, primarily human methods***._ [UB 51:5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p5)

> _The Planetary Prince and the Material Son, with other suitable planetary authorities, pass upon the fitness of the reproducing strains. The difficulty of executing such a radical program on Urantia consists in the absence of competent judges to pass upon the biologic fitness or unfitness of the individuals of your world races. Notwithstanding this obstacle, it seems that you ought to be able to agree upon the biologic disfellowshiping of your more markedly unfit, defective, degenerate, and antisocial stocks._ [UB 51:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p4_8)

> _But these measures can bear their true fruits only in the distant millenniums of the future, although much social improvement will immediately result from the intelligent, wise, and patient manipulation of these acceleration factors of cultural progress._ [UB 70:8.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p8_18)

### Current comprehension error

> —Man After the Planetary Prince— _It is neither tenderness nor altruism to bestow futile sympathy upon degenerated human beings, unsalvable abnormal and inferior mortals. There exist on even the most normal of the evolutionary worlds sufficient differences between individuals and between numerous social groups to provide for the full exercise of all those noble traits of altruistic sentiment and unselfish mortal ministry without perpetuating the socially unfit and the morally degenerate strains of evolving humanity. There is abundant opportunity for the exercise of tolerance and the function of altruism in behalf of those unfortunate and needy individuals who have not irretrievably lost their moral heritage and forever destroyed their spiritual birthright._ [UB 52:2.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p2_12)

> _It is the false sentimentality of your partially perfected civilizations that fosters, protects, and perpetuates the hopelessly defective strains of the evolving human races._ [UB 52:2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p2)

It seems as if we are accused of false sentimentality and sterile altruism. I ask: Could this be due to our lack of spiritual perspective? Our lack of cosmic vision? Our failure to understand the divine plan? This causes us to lavish tenderness and sensitivity on unsalvageable beings—that is, those without an Adjuster—when there are many other opportunities for altruism.

Finally, I have selected the quotes that:

### They warn us of the danger

> _The dangers to Urantia's fledgling industry are:_ [UB 70:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p2_11)
>
> _5. The development of an undesirable racial weakness, biological degeneration._ Among other things

> _When a primary Sangik race amalgamates with a secondary Sangik race, the latter is considerably improved at the expense of the former. And on a small scale—extending over long periods of time—there can be little serious objection to such a sacrificial contribution by the primary races to the betterment of the secondary groups. Biologically considered, the secondary Sangiks were in some respects superior to the primary races._ **Here he tells us about the benefits of racial mixing between primary and secondary races, which should not be confused with inferior lineages, and then goes on to say:**
>
> _After all, the real danger to the human species lies in the uncontrolled multiplication of the inferior and degenerate stocks of the various civilized peoples, rather than in the supposed danger of their racial interbreeding._ [UB 82:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/82#p6_10)

Finally, there is a very interesting paragraph, which says:

> _For many thousands of years, so the records of Jerusem show, in each generation there have lived fewer and fewer beings who could function safely with self-acting Adjusters. This is an alarming picture, and the supervising personalities of Satania look with favor upon the proposals of some of your more immediate planetary supervisors who advocate the inauguration of measures designed to foster and conserve the higher spiritual types of the Urantia races._ [UB 110:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p4_6)

As we can see, this matter worries our older brothers a lot.

## WHAT IS THE PATH TO FOLLOW FOR THE BIOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT OF BREEDS?

Once we are convinced of the need for this biological improvement that brings with it a potential for greater spiritual development, the key question arises: what can be done?

The big problem is determining which individuals are the most biologically fit, or worse yet, which are not. As stated in one of the paragraphs I read earlier, the problem lies in “the absence of competent judges to decide on the biological fitness or incapacity of individuals of the races of your world.” Or, to put it colloquially, who bells the cat?

This is truly a serious problem, perhaps the most important of the entire issue. But we should first determine which aspects of human beings can be biologically inherited and have an influence that could be considered as grounds for control by national governments. For me, there are three aspects or facets to consider:

1. The physicist
2. The mental or psychiatric
3. The sociological

To work on the control of these three facets of human beings, which I will develop later, I can think of only one effective tool, or at least the most appropriate one thanks to scientific advances, since it is through this that we find the way to achieve control over individuals' genes, which would ultimately achieve biological improvement. I am speaking, naturally, of GENETIC ENGINEERING.

Thanks to scientific advances in recent years, we are increasingly able to work on people's DNA.

Let me give you a brief introduction to genetic engineering, as it's important for us to understand the potential that lies in this line of work.

## GENETIC ENGINEERING

### Introduction

To begin with, DNA is one of the cells, if not the most important cell in our body, as it gives us our individuality and facial features, predefined by the number of chromosomes and the way they are arranged. This discovery is one of the most important scientific achievements in the history of humanity. The DNA molecule was discovered by Friedrich Miescher in 1869, who discovered it by inspecting salmon sperm and the pus from open wounds. Since he found it only in nuclei, he named it nuclein. Later, it was called nucleic acid and finally deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

What is DNA?

DNA is a nucleic acid that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of living organisms, and is also responsible for hereditary transmission. The function of the DNA molecule is the long-term storage of hereditary information that will be used throughout our lives. Everything necessary for the development of each of us and other living organisms is concentrated in this molecule. This is, without a doubt, where the Life Carriers have programmed the designs for life on this world.

Genetic engineering encompasses several biotechnological techniques. Among them, to name a few, are:

- Recombinant DNA technology;
- DNA sequencing;
- Polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
- Plasmacytosis
- Molecular cloning
- Exceptional mutation
- Transgenesis
- Gene blockade

I don't know them all; I don't want to bore you with all this; that's not the point of this talk. But it is necessary for us to have an idea of how advanced science is in this field. The fields of work we are all familiar with are the plant kingdom, the animal kingdom, and, to a lesser extent, human beings. This last field of work, genetic manipulation, is the one that interests us.

Genetic biotechnology aims at the in vitro manipulation of DNA, the introduction of this modified DNA into living cells, and its incorporation as part of the cells' hereditary material. In this way, DNA from various sources, for example, the portion of human DNA that regulates insulin synthesis, can be introduced into bacteria, becoming part of their genome and thus enabling the bacteria to acquire the ability to produce insulin.

### Gene therapy

Gene therapy involves replacing or adding, as appropriate, a normal copy of the defective region of DNA in order to resolve and restore the altered function, preventing the development of genetic diseases, such as the ability to defend against infectious diseases. Some of its applications in medicine are: 1) Manufacture of proteins or peptides of health interest. 2) Manufacture of hormonal substances in cow's milk. 3) Substances for pain relief. 4) Solutions to heart problems. 5) Cancer treatments. 6) AIDS treatments. 7) Manufacture of transgenic vaccines. 8) Manufacture of antibiotics.

Work has begun on diseases such as ADA deficiency, known as bubble boy deficiency, and DMD, or Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

The possibility of curing genetic diseases with specific treatment justifies the efforts being made in this regard.

This leads us to very reasonably accept the use of genetic engineering to prevent hereditary diseases. Because, if it were in their power, who wouldn't prevent a future child from being born with this genetic burden that would lead to such diseases?

Therefore, we have almost unwittingly addressed the PHYSICAL aspect, the first of the three aspects or facets to be addressed. Here, genetic engineering must work on human embryos through what is called PGD (preimplantation genetic diagnosis). PGD consists of studying the DNA of human embryos to select those with certain characteristics and/or eliminate those with some type of congenital defect. Cell biopsies are extracted from these embryos, the size of which can vary depending on the number of days of development.

In PGD, two concepts must be distinguished: first, the diagnosis of the embryo's genotype with respect to the presence or absence of the allele[^1] causing a disease or chromosomal alteration carried by the parents; and second, the selection of chromosomally normal embryos from a cohort in which the proportion of chromosomally abnormal embryos is suspected to be elevated above normal.

This technique could prevent many genetic diseases. Although there is still a long way to go in this field, I sincerely believe it is the path we should take.

Let's move on to the second aspect to consider, which may become more controversial: the PSYCHIATRIC aspect, that is, what we call MENTAL ILLNESS.

Although both the environment and hundreds of genes can affect the likelihood of developing certain diseases, psychiatric genetics attempts to describe these disorders based on the premise of what causes them, rather than simply describing the symptoms.

In this regard, some progress is being made, and five mental illnesses are now identified as having a genetic link. These illnesses are: autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia.

This conclusion was reached after an international study that compared the genetic codes of 33,000 people with mental illnesses with those of 28,000 without disorders. According to the results, four genetic variants appeared to increase the risk of the five aforementioned diseases. Two genes were involved in calcium balance in the brain, which appears to increase the risk of bipolar disorder, depression, or schizophrenia in adults.

It cannot be categorically stated that having all these genetic variations leads to the development of a psychiatric disorder, but statistically speaking, it is certainly more likely.

The course of action would be the same, in my opinion, that is, to select, through genetic engineering, the appropriate genes that do not carry these genetic codes (let's call them “poisoned”).

Because, I ask: who wouldn't avoid, if they could, having a child with a high probability of developing one of these diseases?

Let's move on to the third aspect to consider: the SOCIOLOGICAL aspect, which could also perhaps fall under the behavioral branch of psychology.

Although various studies have been and continue to be conducted on the relationship between certain behaviors and their genetic inheritance, this is a field in which little progress has been made, and where much remains to be discovered.

First of all, it would be a mistake to think that all human behavior—aggressive, criminal, etc.—is attributable to genetic inheritance, as biological determinism or, more specifically, genetic determinism postulates, which tells us that human behavior is controlled by an individual's genes. This would go against free will.

However, on the other hand, there is a branch of biology called sociobiology. Sociobiologists postulate that both animal and human behavior cannot be satisfactorily explained solely by taking into account cultural and environmental factors. Sociobiological theory posits that, to fully understand the behavior of animal species, it must be analyzed through the lens of their evolutionary origins.

For sociobiology, all behavior results from a complex interaction between heredity and environment.

In short, it can be stated that there is a set of tendencies of genetic origin that, when faced with environmental stimuli, can lead to antisocial behavior, depending on the intensity with which such tendencies are present in each individual.

For example, several syndromes or genetic abnormalities have been found to explain the violent tendencies of certain people:

Klinefelter syndrome: abnormal number of chromosomes (47) with an extra X chromosome. It is associated with violent sexual behavior.

XYY trisomy: sex chromosome endowment 47, XYY. Violent traits and attention deficit.

However, according to the approach of criminal biology (criminogenesis), not every individual with violent, irascible, aggressive, or excitable tendencies commits crime, but only those who lack the ability to restrain them. Personality structure plays a vital role in this.

A very interesting study that has been conducted to examine the tendency toward criminality due to genetic factors is genetic studies of criminal families. These studies are based on the creation of descent tables, often called family trees, which allow us to understand what has happened over time to the descendants of a given individual. It is claimed that genetic studies of criminal families date back to the 19th century. Curiously, one of them, reported by Dugdale in 1877, concerns a man named Juke, an alcoholic living in New York. He is said to have had 709 descendants, of whom 292 were prostitutes and kept men, 77 were criminals, and 142 were vagrants. The research is similar to that of other families.

I believe, in my opinion, that this approach should also be addressed through biogenetics or genetic engineering—that is, through DNA manipulation—to the extent that criminal behaviors such as excessive aggression, rape, social maladjustment (vagrants), criminal tendencies, etc., are discovered and linked. In this regard, we should discuss and agree on exactly what constitutes abnormal behavior worthy of treatment through genetic engineering. The degrees to which these tendencies can manifest should even be considered.

Another behavior about which there is uncertainty as to whether it is due to genetic factors or more closely related to family and social environment is the risk of suicide. Various studies have shown that the risk of suicide is higher in individuals with a family history of suicide. Willour and others have even stated that suicidal tendencies are determined by a region of chromosome 2.

The most logical conclusion is that, although there is evidence of genetic factors that contribute to the risk of suicidal behavior, this does not mean that suicidal behavior is inevitable in individuals with a family history; it simply means that such people may be more prone to suicide.

It's highly debatable whether suicidal tendencies due to genetic factors should be considered when classifying them as detestable social behaviors, and therefore should be taken into account when working in the field of genetic selection. There are bound to be opinions for all tastes.

Well, once I've talked about what to do—that is, the importance of biologically improving human races for the purpose of achieving a higher potential for spiritual development; and once I've talked about the tools available for this purpose—that is, the how, through genetic engineering selection, carrying out artificial or in vitro inseminations in the laboratory after classification and selection; once I've talked about the aspects of human beings to be taken into account for this genetic selection—that is, avoiding physical defects and illnesses, some mental illnesses, and some criminal social behaviors, all of which involve hereditary factors—it would be necessary to consider the norms that should govern these actions, so that they are always dominated by love for others and fidelity to the divine plan. That is, without losing sight of the intended objective.

I'm going to dare to make an initial proposal of how I think things could be done in this regard, and then of course I will listen very carefully to any opinions on the matter. We start from the premise that we are in the realm of philosophy and it's not something that will be implemented, since it doesn't depend on us. But at least the readers of The Urantia Book, who can have a somewhat clearer cosmic vision on this matter, free from the taboo of speaking about these topics, something that is very difficult in our society because it is immediately linked to perverse stories from humanity's recent past, such as Nazism in Germany, can, as I said, address this issue, or at least try.

First of all, to carry out something like this, committees should be created with specialists in the scientific field, specifically in the field of genetics, including physicians closely related to the field of genetically derived physical diseases, as well as experts in the field of psychiatry, psychologists, and sociologists knowledgeable about antisocial and criminal behavior. This committee would be responsible for determining the genetic potential of individuals. That is, each person would have a “classification,” so to speak, of the physical and psychological illnesses and behavioral risks detected in their genes. To achieve this, obviously, all diseases, deformities, or risks in the human genome must be clearly established. There is still work to be done in this area of research. But as I mentioned before, through preimplantation genetic diagnosis in embryos, those with a type of congenital defect could be identified and ruled out.

This classification would be like a kind of genetic card and would be taken into account when the individual wanted to have offspring.

Therefore, my proposal does not include any action on people with any type of mental illness, criminal behavior, etc., outside of the current work of medicine, prison regulations, or social services, but rather on procreation. This is a long-term, very long-term mission, and therefore, immediate results should not be expected.

The regulations that could govern biological improvement, in general terms, could be something like this:

Couples who have not been found to be at risk of genetic transmission of these diseases (and there are some) and who therefore do not list any risk on the genetic card of the future father and mother will be able to have as many children as they want. Governments would even provide financial incentives for this to happen.
- On the other hand, people without genetic transmission risks would also be encouraged to donate their sperm and eggs to laboratories or banks created for this purpose, so that they can be used by other parents with problems, not only infertility, but also problematic genetic inheritance.
- Couples in which one of the members is likely to transmit a physical, mental, or behavioral illness to their future children would be given these two options:
  - One, having the first biological child naturally and the second or third would be done through genetic manipulation, replacing the gene that influences the development of said disease with a healthy one, and after developing it in the laboratory, introducing it into the oocyte, or replacing the complete DNA of an egg with another without problems.
  - The second option would be for the first child, and of course the rest, to be the result of sperm or egg replacement from the parent with a genetic problem. That is, assisted reproduction would rule out the parent with a problematic genetic inheritance. The couple would be given the choice, but this option would be encouraged over the first.
- If both partners in a couple have negative genetic traits, they would be encouraged to have their first child biologically through in vitro fertilization from donors with no problems. Genetic engineering could also be a second option, that is, as in the previous case, replacing only the problematic genes of both partners with other, problem-free genes from donors. A third option would be to choose to have their first child naturally, but this would entail paying a tax that would be donated directly to these centers where genetic engineering is being carried out.

We should also take into account the type of genetic inheritance that can be transmitted; there may be degrees of this, so we can't rule out a parent whose genes may carry a suicidal tendency in the same way as one who has a high probability of genetically transmitting highly aggressive or criminal behavior. The same applies to physical illnesses, where some won't be so serious as to completely rule out the person who transmits them. Therefore, it's not black and white, as with many other things in life. There are shades of gray, there would be nuances to take into account, but in general terms, this would be my proposed course of action, in which the right to have children is respected for couples who so choose, even if in many cases they are not 100% direct biological offspring.

At this point, another question arises: what do we do with those who don't comply with these regulations? Because on paper, it may seem more or less fine, but putting it into practice is complicated, not to mention the governments of countries that wouldn't want to embrace this great project of contributing to the biological evolution of the human race. In this sense, I think it would be like many other things that have existed throughout human history. At first, they may be reluctant, but when they see the advantages it brings, I'm sure they would adopt it in their countries as well. The savings in disease treatment alone, which would be seen more in the medium term, would be enough to make them think about it.

Returning to the issue of what to do with those who have children born naturally who exceed the imposed limit, in the event that one or both parents are not entirely fit, we enter difficult terrain, where each government could take different positions. But several options are possible:

- Respecting the existing legal timeframes for abortion, that is, before three months, this could be an option, although certainly not the most desirable, and it also requires prior declaration of the fact by the couple.
- If the above situation does not apply, you could choose to have the child but undergo sterilization to prevent it from happening again, at least in cases that could be considered serious.
- Another option is those applied when someone breaks the law, primarily financial penalties. It doesn't seem to make sense to imprison someone for this, but they would think carefully about it if there were financial penalties. Unfortunately, currently, when a government wants to induce or prevent its citizens from doing something, money as a reward in the form of a subsidy or punishment in the form of a financial penalty is the best way to achieve it, at least today.

What is clear is that any action taken in this regard must be widely communicated to the public, and educational campaigns must be conducted to raise awareness of its importance, thanks to the benefits it would bring in the aforementioned physical, mental, and behavioral aspects, not to mention the ultimate goal: the spiritual.

Another question would be: what would we do with maladjusted people, those with criminal behavior, or serious mental illnesses who want to have children? Would we simply allow them to have children, even if it were through genetic manipulation?

Let's see what the LU tells us about what they do on the advanced continent of a neighboring planet:

> _The feeble-minded are trained only in agriculture and animal husbandry, and are committed for life to special custodial colonies where they are segregated by sex to prevent parenthood, which is denied all subnormals. These restrictive measures have been in operation for seventy-five years; the commitment decrees are handed down by the parental courts._ [UB 72:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p4_2)

In another section of this same document it tells us:

> _Efforts to prevent the breeding of criminals and defectives were begun over one hundred years ago and have already yielded gratifying results. There are no prisons or hospitals for the insane. For one reason, there are only about ten per cent as many of these groups as are found on Urantia._ [UB 72:10.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p10_3)

It is true and well known that children who live in certain family environments can be influenced to follow this pattern of behavior. That is to say, as I said at the beginning, not all those with “poisoned” genes necessarily pass this problem on to their offspring; cultural and environmental factors also play a role. Therefore, it is a question of prevention, in the case of dangerous people or hopeless criminals, and in the case of the mentally handicapped, it is obvious, and in fact, it already happens that in many cases they are sterilized to avoid offspring, both for the good of the children and for their own good, since they are not capable of carrying that responsibility. Only in these cases do I believe that paternity should be regulated (or rather, prevented); in physical aspects, it has no significance.

We must not forget that it is one of the most important and necessary experiences for mortal souls; I mean having the experience of raising children and experiencing fatherhood, a reflection in its measure of the fatherhood of the Universal Father. Therefore, depriving someone of it must be fully justified, and only extreme cases should be considered.

Now, our revelators tell us in various places in the UB that the Adjuster indwells only normal minds, and therefore that career-ascendant potential to Paradise, for which the experience of child-rearing, here or on the mansion worlds, is indispensable, is for normal minds. When I say career-ascendant potential to Paradise, I am not discounting the survival of other human beings, feeble-minded, etc., but rather their ultimate destiny.

I have only collected three paragraphs containing this message in the LU:

> _While the hereditary legacy of cerebral endowment and that of electrochemical overcontrol both operate to delimit the sphere of efficient Adjuster activity, no hereditary handicap (in normal minds) ever prevents eventual spiritual achievement. Heredity may interfere with the rate of personality conquest, but it does not prevent eventual consummation of the ascendant adventure._ [UB 109:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p5_5)

> When the mind is thus endowed with the ministry of the Holy Spirit, it then possesses the capacity to elect (consciously or unconsciously) the spirit presence of the Universal Father, the Thought Adjuster. But not until the bestowal Son has released the Spirit of Truth for planetary ministry to all mortals is all normal minds automatically prepared to receive Thought Adjusters. [UB 34:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p5_4)

> _Therefore have the divine Adjusters been universally bestowed upon all normal minds of moral status on Urantia ever since the day of Pentecost._ [UB 108:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p2_3)

I've reached the end of my presentation, but I'd like to recommend that you watch the following documentary on YouTube when you can. It's very interesting on the topic of genetic engineering at hand. It's called “Dr. Frankenstein's Farm,” but don't be fooled by the title, really. Here you can see the advances in this field, with animals and plants, focused primarily on the benefit of humanity, efficient nutrition, and, of course, the prevention of human disease. It also discusses biotechnology in the reproduction of human tissue, although this has, for me, a much more limited and temporary application, since it's more about repair than prevention. However, it's also interesting for cases of accidents. And you'll also see the current legislative blockage to its implementation in society.
