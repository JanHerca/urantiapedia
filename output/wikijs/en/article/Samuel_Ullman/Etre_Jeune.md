_Youth is not a period of life, it is a state of mind, an effect of the will, a quality of the imagination, an emotional intensity, a victory of courage over timidity, of the taste for adventure over the love of comfort._

_We do not become old by having lived a certain number of years, we become old because we have deserted our ideal._

_The years wrinkle the skin, giving up one's ideal wrinkles the soul._
_Worries, doubts, fears and despairs are the enemies that slowly make us lean towards the earth and become dust before death._

_Young is he who is astonished and marveled._
_He asks like the insatiable child: “And then”?_

_He defies events and finds joy in the game of life._

_You are as young as your faith._
_As old as your self-confidence._
_As young as your hope._
_As old as your dejection._

_You will stay young as long as you remain receptive._
_Receptive to what is beautiful, good and great._
_Receptive to messages from nature, man and infinity._

_If one day your heart were to be bitten by pessimism and eaten away by cynicism, may God have pity on your old soul!_

Samuel Ullman
