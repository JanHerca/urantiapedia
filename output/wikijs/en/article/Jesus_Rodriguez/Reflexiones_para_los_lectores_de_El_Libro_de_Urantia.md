1.- The Cosmic Mind responds without fail (recognizes the response) in the three levels of universal reality “causation, duty, adoration”. These reactions are self-evident for minds of clear reasoning and deep thought, they are innate in every “cosmic mind”, the experience of living of evolutionary creatures never fails to develop these three cosmic intuitions, since they constitute the self-awareness of reflective thought. But it is sad to record that so few people on URANTIA rejoice in cultivating these courageous and independent cosmic thinking qualities. (<a id="a38_566"></a>[UB 16:6.6-10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_6))

2.- Urantia does not proceed in the normal planetary order; It is a confused and disordered planet, it is out of the rhythm of the planetary procession, therefore the realization of the brotherhood of man requires a longer time and a greater effort than that of a normal planet. (<a id="a40_280"></a>[UB 52:6.2-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p6_2))

3.- The planetary realization of the age of light and life on URANTIA is far beyond the wildest hopes of Urantian mortals who have not had more visionary concepts. (<a id="a42_165"></a>[UB 52:7.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p7_16))

4.- Among the mortal races of URANTIA there exists a deep abyss between the human and the divine, their reactions are considerably controlled electrically and chemically and so highly similar to animals in their common behavior, so emotional in their daily reactions, that it is extremely difficult for adjusters to guide and direct them. (<a id="a44_340"></a>[UB 110:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p4_5))

5.- Only so few Urantian mortals are true thinkers, you do not spiritually develop or discipline your minds to the point of developing a favorable link with the divine adjusters. (<a id="a46_180"></a>[UB 110:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p7_7))

<figure id="Figure_1" class="image urantiapedia">

6.- Adjusters accept a difficult assignment when they volunteer to indwell beings as complex as those who live on URANTIA. (<a id="a52_124"></a>[UB 108:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p5_2))

7.- The material self; the entity of the ego in the human identity, depends during its physical life on the continued function of the material vehicle of life, on the continued existence of the UNBALANCED BALANCE of energies and intellect that e URANTIA; it has been given the name of life. (<a id="a54_292"></a>[UB 112:2.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p2_20))

8.- Most of the inhabited worlds value the higher life potentials possessed by the evolutionary mortals of time and space more highly than do the mortal races of Urantia. (<a id="a56_172"></a>[UB 49:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p2_1))

9.- Just as we are the mortals of Urantia, we can appreciate little of the advanced state and of the progressive nature of the mortal races of the most evolved and perfected worlds. (<a id="a58_183"></a>[UB 55:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p6_3))

10.- The human races of Urantia are mixed in a complex way, they are a combination of many races and strains of different origins, this compound nature makes the efficient work of the adjusters extremely difficult. (<a id="a60_216"></a>[UB 111:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p7_4))

11.- “What life and on what planet” (the difficult Urantia life) (<a id="a62_66"></a>[UB 111:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p7_5), <a id="a62_111"></a>[UB 111:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p7_5))

12.- Angels develop great affection for their Urantian human associates, they share most of your emotions and experience some more, but it is difficult for them to understand the inheritance of animal fear that occupies so much place in the mental life of the average inhabitant of Urantia. (<a id="a64_292"></a>[UB 113:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p2_5))

13.- The Urantia races are so considerably electrically and chemically controlled and so highly animal-like in their common behaviors and so emotional in their daily reactions, that it is extremely difficult for the resident adjusters to guide and direct them. (<a id="a66_262"></a>[UB 110:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p4_5))

14.- The mortals of Urantia are so devoid of making courageous decisions and of consecrated cooperation, that it is almost impossible for the thought adjusters to communicate directly with the human mind.(<a id="a68_205"></a>[UB 110:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p4_5))

15.- The adjusters must be patient throughout the many years of silent sojourn to get in touch with the Urantian mortal mind, since despite being present in the creature from an early age, these divine monitors are incapable of to make way for a long time through the animal resistance that the human mind presents during the course of its earthly life. (<a id="a70_355"></a>[UB 110:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p7_7))

16.- The ear of the human mind is almost deaf to the spiritual requests that the adjuster translates from the multiple messages of the universal transmissions of love that come from the Father of Mercies. (<a id="a72_206"></a>[UB 110:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p7_6))

17.- The subnormal beings of Urantia do not exercise normal will power, do not make average decisions, lack capacity for intelligent worship, and cannot understand God. (<a id="a74_170"></a>[UB 113:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p1_3))

16.- If the mortals of disturbed Urantia could only visualize one of the most advanced worlds in light and life, they would never again doubt the wisdom of the evolutionary model of creation. (<a id="a76_193"></a>[UB 55:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p6_9))

17.- Your isolated, sectional, finite, crude and highly materialistic point of view, and the limitations inherent in our animal nature, prevent us from understanding the wisdom and goodness of many of the divine acts that seem to you loaded with such cruelty. devastating. (<a id="a78_274"></a>[UB 3:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p2_10))

18.- The evolutionary mortals who inhabit normal worlds of spiritual progress do not experience the acute conflicts between the spirit and the flesh that Urantia mortals suffer, nor do they experience that constant struggle between their material and spiritual natures that so characterizes the races. today on Urantia. (<a id="a80_321"></a>[UB 34:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p7_2))

19.- Your planet appears highly confused and greatly retarded in all phases of intellectual progress and spiritual achievement. (<a id="a82_129"></a>[UB 50:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p6_2))

Sadly, this is the intellectual and spiritual state that we “evolutionary mortals of Urantia” keep before the eyes of the universe of Nebadon, and these are only some of the reflections contained in _The Urantia Book_. Reflections that, by the way, in the twelve years that I have frequented the circles of my brothers (the readers of the book), whether they are in study groups, conferences, round tables or other types of meetings, and even in the same networks in which the readers of the book navigate, I have not heard from them, not the slightest comment_of our precarious spiritual and intellectual state in which we find ourselves, nor of the deficient communication that we have with our resident adjuster; which by the way has caused that on Urantia in each generation there live fewer and fewer beings who can function safely with the self-acting adjusters (<a id="a84_869"></a>[UB 110:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p4_6))

And much less have I observed that the readers of the book make a “serious reflection” on how complicated it is for us Urantians to reach an intellectual and spiritual state that allows us to achieve “the achievement of the survival of the human Self” (<a id="a86_253"></a>[UB 112:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_6))

But what I have heard from most readers is how well they communicate with their Adjuster, what a fine spiritual and intellectual state they are in, and what a glorious eternal upward career to Paradise awaits them after death. death.

We mortals on Urantia have not yet been able to comprehend that there is a wide chasm between the human and the divine, between man and God. And this is because the Urantia races are so considerably controlled electrically and chemically, that their common behavior is so highly animal-like, and so emotional in their daily reactions, that it is extremely difficult for Adjusters to guide and guide them. direct them (<a id="a90_418"></a>[UB 110:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p4_5)) For, even when the adjusters manage to convey a glimpse of the new truth to the evolving mortal soul, that spiritual revelation frequently so blinds the creature that it sends him into a convulsion of headlong fanaticism or initiates some other intellectual disorder that is disastrous.

Such communications have been misunderstood and many new religions and many strange “isms” have been born from the misinterpretation given to those spiritual revelations that were transmitted by the Thought Adjusters (<a id="a92_218"></a>[UB 110:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p4_5)). It is about time we began to understand the “difficult and complex Urantia personality we possess” and take very seriously what we say about this “possible and potential upward career” to the mansion worlds after death. Due to the state of intellectual and spiritual backwardness in which we find ourselves with respect to other mortals of the inhabited worlds of the Nebadon universe, we must work harder intellectually and exert ourselves much more spiritually than our other mortal brothers from other planets, to achieve the achievement of “survival of our immortal soul” after death. Let us no longer continue to believe that by knowing the existence of the mansion worlds we already have a direct pass to those morontia worlds after death, much less that we have already won that glorious and wonderful ascending and eternal career towards Paradise. , as naively expressed by many readers of _The Urantia Book_. They have not yet correctly discerned that, despite the fact that an integral part of the Father's divinity resides in his mind in each mortal being on this planet, it still does not belong to us by right of possession, since this fragment of the Father that resides in us was intentionally conceived to become one with us if we truly achieve mortal survival. (<a id="a92_1543"></a>[UB 1:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p4_3))

As readers of the book that we are, let us not continue to make the same mistake as our other Urantian brothers, who by the simple fact of being believers in some religion have already earned a place in heaven.

Since we as mortals of the “individual ascension order” can only achieve direct passage to the mansion worlds after death, if first during the course of our lives we are able to achieve mastery of the seven cosmic circles of progression mortal (intellectual, social, spiritual values and cosmic discernment).

The “Human Jesus” at the age of thirty-one completed the deadly task of conquering the circles of mind understanding and personality control.(<a id="a98_142"></a>[UB 134:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p8_4))

When the most advanced mortals of spiritual state die and have reached the seven cosmic levels, they immediately proceed to the mansion worlds; This provision only works for creatures that have been assigned a personal seraphic guardian (<a id="a100_238"></a>[UB 112:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_10)), but for creatures that cannot reach that state due to the accidents of time or the difficulties of material existence and whose intentions and wishes are of survival value, the universe governments will issue a decree extending the probation period, that is, the creature will be allowed additional time to probate itself (<a id="a100_609"></a>[UB 112:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_6)). Thus these mortals will be detained until such time as the adjudication of their affairs is complete, after which they may proceed to the mansion worlds; and if this is not the case, the creature will be assigned to the ranks of the sleeping survivors, who will be repersonalized en masse at the end of the “present planetary dispensation” (<a id="a100_996"></a>[UB 112:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_10)).

The “planetary dispensational adjudications” occur in view of the fact that the beings that were accredited for survival were not able to achieve that level of mastery of intelligence and endowment of spirituality that would allow them to have personal guardians; that is to say, they did not reach the domain of the cosmic circles. Therefore, these beings who have not achieved their accreditation cannot go directly or immediately to the mansion worlds. Said surviving souls must rest in an unconscious sleep (sleeping survivors) until the judgment day of a new dispensation (<a id="a102_578"></a>[UB 30:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/30#p4_11), <a id="a102_623"></a>[UB 113:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p6_8)). It is time that, through the correct discernment that we make of the reading of _The Urantia Book_, we understand that the only spiritual state that we can reach here on Urantia is that of “sons of God by faith” (<a id="a102_882"></a>[UB 40:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p6_1))

But not that type of religious faith that we were taught and continue to practice, but that invincible spiritual faith that Jesus practiced so marvelously, and that paper 196 tells us IN AN EXEMPLARY WAY, with which by the way the content of the blessed revelation of _The Urantia Book_ (<a id="a104_288"></a>[UB 196:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p0_1)).

Really, let's do a careful reading and a detailed study of the narratives of “the life and teachings of Jesus” (<a id="a106_112"></a>[UB 32:2.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p2_13)). Thus, we will know in detail “the life of human perfection” that Jesus lived through his “PERSONAL MINISTRY” (the purely human life that he lived until he was twenty-nine years old), when Jesus virtually ended the experience of living life as and as required of human beings in the material worlds of time and space (<a id="a106_475"></a>[UB 129:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p3_6), <a id="a106_520"></a>[UB 129:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p4_8)).

In addition, the unique teachings of Jesus can only be understood when viewing his life within his immediate environment (his personal ministry), “SINCE IT IS HIS LIFE” and not the lessons he gave his apostles, nor the sermons he gave to the multitudes which will help us to reveal the divine character and the loving personality of the Universal Father (<a id="a108_355"></a>[UB 140:8.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_20)).

And we will only be able to learn about God through Jesus when we observe the divinity of his life, NEVER DEPENDING ON HIS TEACHINGS, since only through knowing in detail the life of the teacher each one of us will be able to assimilate that concept of God that represents the measure of our ability to perceive spiritual and divine realities (<a id="a110_344"></a>[UB 169:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/169#p4_3)).

And if we are able to truly know the divinity of his life (his personal ministry), we will already be able to know the path that will guide us to the Father, since to find the Father we must first find the Son, since he is the way , truth and life (<a id="a112_249"></a>[UB 180:3.7-9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p3_7)). Jesus, through his life of “human perfection”, dedicated it totally to the fulfillment of the will of the Father in heaven, he showed humanity the new path of mortal life through which they should travel (<a id="a112_502"></a>[UB 34:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p7_6)). BROTHER READERS OF THE URANTIA BOOK, AFTER ALL OF THE ABOVE DESCRIBED:

Are we really already traveling through that new path of mortal life that Jesus showed us in such an exemplary way?

Have we really already been able to correctly discern the exemplary life of “human perfection” (his personal ministry) that Jesus reached at the end of his twenty-nine years of age?

By the way, in this period Jesus of Nazareth, the greatest of all Urantians, created from the humblest circumstances of a common life, the full exhaustion of “spiritual values” achievable in mortal experience (<a id="a118_210"></a>[UB 109:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p6_6)) . In addition, Christ Michael, in his seventh bestowal as Jesus of Nazareth, would reach shortly after (31 years of age), the perfected sovereignty of his universe by direct decree of Paradise, which was communicated by the highest authority of the local universe and of the world. superuniverse (<a id="a118_552"></a>[UB 136:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p3_5)).

Have we really already managed to escape from the acute conflicts between the flesh and the spirit and from that constant struggle between our material and spiritual natures that allows us the survival of our “potential eternal personality”?

Truly, with the complicated “Urantia personality” that we possess, will we be able to achieve the conquest of the seven cosmic circles that are required to achieve the direct pass to the mansion worlds?

Is it possible for us mortal races on Urantia to achieve so easily that state of “human Self survival” which enables us to begin our morontia career immediately after death?

Brothers of the community of _The Urantia Book_, what do you think?
