> _There is in the mind of God a plan which embraces every creature of all his vast domains, and this plan is an eternal purpose of boundless opportunity, unlimited progress, and endless life. And the infinite treasures of such a matchless career are yours for the striving!_ (<a id="a38_277"></a>[UB 32:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p5_7))

But for us as finite creatures it is difficult for us to grasp the idea of a DIVINE AND ETERNAL PLAN in which we are directly involved, since due to our material and temporal state we are completely unaware that each one of us is directly responsible for OUR OWN DESTINY. ETERNAL AND DIVINE. We are virtually incapable of comprehending the eternal purpose that the eternal GOD has for all his children. It seems that our existence only covers an isolated stretch of time and everything we know has a beginning and an end; we are completely unaware that the events of time and the struggles of material existence are nothing more than the transitory scaffolding that leads us to the other side of the bridge, to the promised land of spiritual reality and eternal existence.

Man, due to the scant knowledge he has about his potential eternal destiny, only thinks within a finite conceptual framework and is incapable of visualizing other higher conceptual frameworks of universal reality within which the thought of eternity can fit (p. 1260.3). To facilitate the understanding of the above, it is necessary for the evolutionary mind of man to understand the existence of the various levels of universal reality that make up the “grand universe.” These levels of universal reality are known by the name of: (<a id="a42_533"></a>[UB 115:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p1_3))

1. <ins>FINITE LEVEL</ins>: The realms of the finite exist by virtue of GOD's eternal purpose of bringing into existence finite creatures (evolutionary mortals of time and space), ascending creatures with potential for life eternal.

2. <ins>ABSONITE LEVEL</ins>: This level of universal reality exists for the highly spiritual purpose of the universal father, and in which are involved creatures of spiritual origin (superhuman personalities) and finite creatures that achieve the survival of your mortal soul. At this point it is important to emphasize that both creatures, mortal and spiritual, have the same degree of eternal potentiality and the same possibilities of arriving before the presence of the UNIVERSAL FATHER.

3. <ins>ABSOUBTE LEVEL</ins>: This level of ABSOUBTE PERFECTION is located on THE ETERNAL ISLAND OF PARADISE; which is the center of all creation and the abode of the UNIVERSAL FATHER and of the DIVINE DEITIES, as well as the final destiny of the spiritual beings and of the finite creatures that achieve the survival of their MORTAL SOUL.

These three levels of universal reality are part of a GIGANTIC PLAN OF DIVINE PERFECTION, a plan of spiritual achievement that will allow the material creatures of time to rise to the perfection of eternity. A plan that encompasses creation, spiritual evolution, ascension, and perfection of mortals inhabiting the evolutionary worlds of time and space (p.85, 86). This plan of perfection of the EVOUBTIONARY MORTAL creatures, projected by the UNIVERAL FATHER and unreservedly accepted by the ETERNAL SON to make mortal creatures IN HIS OWN IMAGE AND LIKENESS, also includes the granting of a fragment of the UNIVERSAL FATHER; the divine spirit residing in mortal mind (the thought adjuster), as well as_also_a_series of spiritual attributes (the Spirit of Truth and the Holy Spirit). That TRIPLE SPIRITUAL NUCLEUS (<a id="a50_816"></a>[UB 12:9.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p9_6), <a id="a50_859"></a>[UB 101:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p3_2), <a id="a50_904"></a>[UB 194:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_11), <a id="a50_951"></a>[UB 196:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_6)) will spiritually guide mortal creatures who yearn to achieve the achievement of HUMAN PERFECTION that demands the UNIVERSAL FATHER to all EVOUBTIONARY MORTALS that inhabit the material worlds of time and space.

It is important to point out that, only through the spiritual achievement that mortal man reaches, he will be able to be recognized as an authentic SON OF GOD; since it is in a spiritual sense that GOD is present in man (<a id="a52_221"></a>[UB 101:10.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p10_4)). This is true, since THE UNIVERSAL FATHER, by creating mortal man IN HIS IMAGE AND LIKENESS, he is forced to reach the SPIRITUAL STATE of the FATHER, as well as his LIKENESS IN PERFECTION. But, due to the limitations that we have imposed on our mortal evolutionary mind, we are totally incapable of correctly discerning the meaning of what was expressed by THE GOD-FATHER when he stated “let us make mortal_creatures in our own image and likeness” (<a id="a52_717"></a>[UB 7:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/7#p4_4)), and we have been left with the poor literal concept that as mortal men we are similar to GOD.

It is time to begin to understand that, as evolutionary mortal creatures, we must: first, show the sincere desire to start searching through our own acts and under the spiritual guidance of the fragment of GOD that dwells in us, the same spiritual similarity that emanates from each of the acts carried out by the UNIVERSAL FATHER, as well as exhibiting the ardent desire and the supreme ambition to try to achieve the HUMAN PERFECTION that the FATHER asks of his mortal children, since the supreme mandate that the UNIVERSAL FATHER has ordered to the creatures of his immense creation is: “Be you Perfect, just as I am Perfect” (<a id="a54_630"></a>[UB 1:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p0_3), <a id="a54_671"></a>[UB 40:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p7_5)).

To achieve such an attainment of perfection, the mortals of earth must be aware that there exists within their cosmic mind (<a id="a56_124"></a>[UB 16:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_1), <a id="a56_167"></a>[UB 16:6.10-11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_10)) a set of spiritual forces and sources of supermaterial power that directly link them. with the paradisiacal deities. There is the direct connection of the thought adjusters with the UNIVERSAL FATHER, the vast spiritual influence of the ETERNAL SON through the Spirit of Truth and the spiritual presence of the INFINITE SPIRIT through the Holy Spirit; as well as a series of spiritual personalities of the local universe and the superuniverse, who will lovingly and forever lead the honest-hearted man upwards and inward towards the ideals of divinity and the attainment of supreme perfection (<a id="a56_808"></a>[UB 9:2.4-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/9#p2_4) ).

The beginning of the race to achieve perfection practically starts during the course of our earthly life and will manifest itself through the conscious act of seeing men in the same way that the FATHER sees his creatures. That is to say, the act of showing towards our fellow men the same paternal love that the UNIVERSAL FATHER bestows on us. The same paternal love that JESUS OF NAZARETH manifested towards all his fellow men, but mainly towards those who persecuted him, outraged him and crucified him. That is why JESUS <ins>always preached the following to his disciples</ins>: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you and pray for those who abuse you. And everything that you think I would do for men, do it too (<a id="a58_754"></a>[UB 140:3.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p3_16)) During all his public ministry (his preaching stage), the MASTER JESUS taught his followers to manifest <ins>“fatherly love” instead of “brotherly love”</ins>. “Brotherly love” means loving your neighbor as yourself, but “fatherly love” requires the extraordinary act of “loving your fellow men as JESUS loves you” (<a id="a58_1117"></a>[UB 140:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p5_1)). Thus, this is the state of HUMAN PERFECTION that THE UNIVERSAL FATHER requires of us through his “supreme mandate of perfection.”

It is important to note that mortal man is the ARCHITECT of his own eternal destiny. And only HE will be the only one responsible for building the foundations of his future eternal life in this life, since on this basis he will have to develop an authentic spiritual work that will allow his EVOUBTIONARY SOUL to survive death, so that it continues to evolve in the scale of immortal life, <ins>which encompasses every possible stage or phase of universal reality</ins> (finite, absonite and absolute). And so, after a glorious ascending spiritual career, achieve the immortal state of PERFECTED SPIRIT and fulfill THE WILL OF GOD to “Be Perfect as God is perfect.”

It is necessary to highlight that the fact of starting this glorious ascending race towards PARADISE, from the lowest level of the existence of intelligent creatures, entails a “greater satisfaction”, since those who start from below with tenacity and effort will ascend in the future. life scale; which covers every possible phase of universal existence, which goes FROM ANIMAL TO ANGEL, FROM ANGEL TO SPIRIT, AND FROM SPIRIT TO GOD (<a id="a62_435"></a>[UB 48:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p8_4)).

For the achievement of this extraordinary spiritual evolution of mortal man, it must be kept in mind that the UNIVERSAL FATHER has generously granted his evolutionary creatures a set of spiritual attributes, which will guide men who truly have the desire to achieve the survival of their mortal soul through authentic spiritual work. These attributes are:

1. THE MIND (evolutionary cosmic mind)
2. THE SPIRIT (the thought adjuster, the spirit of the FATHER)
3. THE SOUL (evolving soul with potential for eternal life)
4. THE PERSONALITY (evolving personality with eternal potential)

Based on the above, it is necessary to understand the authentic meaning of each of these spiritual gifts that we possess, as well as the role they play through our cosmic mind and during the course of our earthly life.

It is important to point out that the spiritual progress that the evolutionary mortal develops will be through the joint action of these spiritual attributes and the following values of human development: INTELLECTUAL, SOCIAL, MORAL, SPIRITUAL and cosmic discernment (<a id="a73_268"></a>[UB 49:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p6_9)) .

1.- **<ins>THE MIND</ins>**: The Infinite God has bestowed on each of his finite creatures a system of intellect (a personal energy system) that has been lent to them for their temporary use within of the finite level in which they operate, but with a universal and infinite potential (cosmic mind) that will give mortal creatures the innate ability to formulate higher intellectual thoughts, which will allow them to have contact with the other levels of universal reality (absonite and absolute). The human mind possesses a triple spiritual nucleus, which will allow it to be the indispensable channel of communication between material realities and spiritual realities.

The mind is the mechanism of the human organism that thinks, perceives and feels; it is the totality of conscious and unconscious experience, it is the intelligence associated with emotional life, and it goes ever upwards through worship and wisdom until it reaches the level of spirit.

The mortal mind is the cosmic instrument (cosmic mind) on which the human will can play the discord of its destruction, or can extract the most exquisite melodies of its communion with GOD and its consequent eternal survival. Just as it is also the arena in which human personalities live, make decisions, choose God or abandon him, perpetuate or destroy themselves.

Thus, in your hands subject to your _SPIRITUAL FREE WILL_ you have been given your EVOUBTIONARY COSMIC MIND, and it is through your mind that you live and die, and it is within your mind and with your mind that you make those spiritual decisions that allow you to achieve communication with your thought adjuster, that DIVINE SPIRIT of the FATHER that dwells in you and that is the purest spiritual reality that can exist in the great universe (<a id="a81_445"></a>[UB 0:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p5_8), <a id="a81_486"></a>[UB 12:9.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p9_6), <a id="a81_529"></a>[UB 42:10.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p10_6), <a id="a81_574"></a>[UB 56:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p2_3), <a id="a81_617"></a>[UB 85:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p7_3), <a id="a81_660"></a>[UB 111:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_3), <a id="a81_705"></a>[UB 111:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_6), <a id="a81_750"></a>[UB 115:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p1_1)).

2.- **<ins>THE SPIRIT</ins>**: The infinity of the PERFECTION OF GOD is of such magnitude that it will forever be a mystery. But the greatest of all the impenetrable mysteries of GOD is the mystery of the residence of his DIVINE SPIRIT in the minds of evolutionary mortals. The way in which the UNIVERSAL FATHER coexists with the creatures of time is the deepest of all the mysteries of the universe. The divine presence of the Spirit of the Father in the minds of the creatures of time is the mystery of mysteries. From this fact, the physical body of man becomes THE TEMPLE OF GOD, but due to the spiritual ignorance that we mortals on URANTIA suffer from, we search for GOD everywhere and in all the temples, and we go after the treasures of the kingdom with a longing heart and tired feet because we never found it, and sadly man dies without knowing that his body is THE TEMPLE OF GOD and that within it lives a divine fragment of the UNIVERSAL FATHER (<a id="a83_958"></a>[UB 1:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p4_1), <a id="a83_999"></a>[UB 1:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p4_2), <a id="a83_1040"></a>[UB 159:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p3_8)).

It is time for us to know that the FATHER, in an act of infinite love, descends from his glorious and eternal paradise home to fraternize with each one of his finite mortal creatures through his DIVINE SPIRIT (the thought adjuster), that fragment of GOD that will reside in the intellect of every mortal creature that is normal in mind and sincere in heart. In this way, the GOD-FATHER makes personal contact with the mind of his mortal son in order to grant him a part of his infinite and eternal spirit so that he lives and dwells in him, and thus man can have the certainty of communication With God. Because of that divine presence, man can more fully understand the presence and transformative power of other spiritual influences (the Spirit of Truth and the Holy Spirit) (<a id="a85_778"></a>[UB 101:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p3_2), <a id="a85_823"></a>[UB 194:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_11)). The UNIVERSAL FATHER is not a distant or remote GOD; On the contrary, there is in HIM an infinite greatness, a great generosity and a sublime love that lead him to yearn for an intimate communication with all created beings who can understand him, love him and who are truly willing to fulfill his supreme mandate of perfection.

The evolutionary mortals of the grand universe may have great inborn, intellectual, physical, economic, social, and even moral or religious differences, but as far as their spiritual capacity is concerned, this will be uniform and unique. All equally enjoy the same divine spiritual presence, all have the same privilege of having intimate personal communication with the resident adjuster of divine origin. At the same time all equally with their SPIRITUAL FREE WILL can accept the uniform spiritual guidance of the thought adjuster. GOD does not show preference for any person, whether they are spiritual or material. It will only be the indolence of the creature that will restrict the spiritual action of the divine presence that resides in any child of the FATHER (<a id="a87_770"></a>[UB 5:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p1_5), <a id="a87_811"></a>[UB 110:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p3_4)).

If mortal man is spiritually inhabited by the adjuster, if man's mind is spiritually motivated, if such a human soul sincerely wants to know GOD, if he wants to become more and more like “HE” and if he honestly wants to fulfill the will of GOD “if we are perfect just as he is perfect”, there will be no negative interference that could prevent the certain ascension of said soul to the gates of eternity, since the FATHER wants all his children to reach paradise. GOD has already reserved a place to receive all mortal creatures who have attained THE ATTAINMENT OF IMMORTAL SURVIVAL, since the forces of divine love and the means of divine administration are linked to facilitate the spiritual advancement of all deserving intelligences that they want to reach the presence of the UNIVERSAL FATHER (<a id="a89_800"></a>[UB 5:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p1_6), <a id="a89_841"></a>[UB 5:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p1_7), <a id="a89_882"></a>[UB 5:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p1_8)).

We mortals on Urantia can still attain the achievement of immortal survival. The time has come to be aware that GOD is accessible, that THE FATHER is reachable and that THE PATH OF ETERNAL LIFE is open, as long as we strive to fulfill his mandate of HUMAN PERFECTION, just as he taught us. a mortal man named JESUS OF NAZARETH during the course of his exemplary earthly life and through his RESURRECTION.

**Can we really understand the true reason why the divine Spirit of GOD resides in us?**

**Will we dare to participate in the upward race of eternal survival?**

That race of “FAITH” and “HOPE” in which we depend at every step on the guide of our thought adjuster, that divine spiritual presence that will allow the morontia evolution of our potential “IMMORTAL SOUL” (<a id="a97_207"></a>[UB 0:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p5_10)).

3.- **<ins>THE SOUL</ins>**: Unlike the other spiritual gifts that were granted to the mortal races of Urantia, the soul is going to be the product of the joint action of the mortal evolutionary mind and of the thought adjuster. This union of mind and spirit will conceive a new spiritual reality of eternal potential: “the morontia soul”, which, due to its embryonic state, should begin to evolve in the human personality from a very early age. The soul is a spiritual attribute that man obtains through his relationship with GOD, and can only evolve to the extent that the mortal creature chooses to comply with the will of the FATHER to “Be perfect as He is perfect.”

THE SOUL is of an entirely new, original and unique universal value. She is the daughter of the UNIVERSE and can only be known through the true cosmic and spiritual discernment made by the evolutionary mind of the creature. It is of eternal potentiality since, if he manages to survive mortal death, he will start the glorious ascending race towards PARADISE.

The evolving soul, by sharing the qualities of the human mind and the divine spirit, will become more persistent in discovering the true meaning of the highest spiritual values, which will allow the mortal SELF to achieve, through spiritual experience. acquired, to transcend beyond physical death, so that the surviving mortal ME gives birth to a new universal and eternal reality called SOULMORONTIAL.

What is morontia? The “morontia” is a term that will designate the vast intermediate level that separates the material level from the spiritual level; and it exists because the UNIVERSAL FATHER is never going to convert his creatures of animal origin into spiritual beings in a single step. Since, when the creators wish to produce perfect beings, they do so through direct and original creation. The morontia level, as it extends through the various stages of the local universe ascendant career, is the only possible path by which the surviving mortal soul will have to travel in order to eradicate all vestiges of its animal and material origin, and so it can be transformed, through successive morontia transformations, into an authentic perfected immortal spirit (<a id="a105_769"></a>[UB 48:0.2-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p0_2)).
