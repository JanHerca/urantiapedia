## Foreword

The purpose of the eternal God is of a highly spiritual ideal, where the events of time and the struggles of material life are nothing more than the transitory scaffolding that builds a bridge to the other side, towards the promised land of spiritual reality and of heavenly existence. In the mind of God there is a divine plan that involves every creature in his vast domain. This plan consists of a purpose of eternal life, unlimited opportunities, unlimited progress and absolute perfection. But, with the finite material mind that we possess, we are mortally incapable of comprehending the thought of eternity, something that has neither beginning nor end, and everything that is familiar to us always has an end.

Frankly, eternity is incomprehensible to the finite temporal mind. We are not capable of comprehending or understanding the universal values of infinite essence and eternal meaning. And when it comes to an individual life, the length of a kingdom, or the chronology of any interconnected series of events, it would seem that we cover only an isolated stretch of time where everything seems to have a beginning and an end, and that such successively linked experiences, lives, ages, or epochs constitute only an isolated event in time that flashes momentarily across the infinite face of eternity. But such an explanation is inadequate, disconnected, and utterly inappropriate to adequately explain temporal transactions, the purposes underlying the basic reactions of eternity. The most appropriate thing for our evolutionary cosmic mind would be to locate the material events of time as a temporary cycle that is connected and synchronized with the eternal cycles of time and space.

These temporary material cycles of mortal life practically begin on the evolutionary worlds with the appearance of intelligent life, and as the evolutionary creature develops progressively on that scale of material life, the mind of primitive man gradually begins to manifest the action of the “seven adjutant spirits of the mind”, which are known as follows: spirit of intuition, understanding, courage, knowledge, advice, worship and wisdom.

It is important to point out that the action of the sixth spirit of adoration and the seventh spirit of wisdom in the mind of the creature will eternally distinguish man from the animal, since when primitive man, after a long evolutionary process, begins to cross the threshold of the spiritual ministry, appears in him the will to be able to choose to adore and ascend, a fact that indicates the manifestation of the first spiritual impulse of his evolutionary mind. The existence of intelligent life on an evolutionary planet is already beginning to glimpse for the first time.

The appearance of intelligent life was of such importance for the human race that, from that event, the Earth was formally recognized by the highest universal authorities as a planet inhabited by intelligent creatures.

From that moment on, all the material struggles of mortal man are no longer in vain; the evolutionary mortals of Urantia become part of an immense family, of a gigantic enterprise, of an eternal project, of a highly spiritual ideal that marches through time and space, to the beat of the music of infinite thought and according to to the eternal and divine purpose of our Universal Father.

For a better understanding of the content of the subject, we must bear in mind the following definitions: BODY: it is the living electrochemical mechanism of animal nature and origin. It is the material or physical organism of man. MIND: is the mechanism of the human organism that thinks, perceives and feels. It is in constant upward evolution through worship and wisdom.

<ins>The organic evolution of man through the evolutionary levels of the mind</ins>

Every living organism, be it plant or animal, has the innate ability to evolve to achieve a better adaptation to the environment in which it develops, but this will only be achieved through a constant effort to develop the best adaptation conditions. to the environment in which it lives. These endless adaptation efforts of all living things through evolution show that it is not spontaneous or fortuitous. Evolution has a specific and determined purpose, since in all living beings there is a mental spiritual endowment (the spirit helpers of the mind) that will allow them to achieve a high degree of adaptation within the level of life through evolution. in which it takes place (<a id="a60_684"></a>[UB 65:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p7_6)).

The appearance of the first lower forms of animal life through the biological evolution of the species shows us that evolution in the animal kingdom had the well-defined purpose of originating through a long evolutionary process the appearance of the human race in the planet (<a id="a62_277"></a>[UB 62:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p1_3)).

This organic evolution of the animal kingdom was conditioned from the beginning by the presence of the first five helper spirits of the mind (of intuition, understanding, courage, knowledge and advice), since the lower forms of animal life that They initially appeared on primitive worlds and were fully sensitive to the natural environment in which they appeared (the Ice Age). But as they ascended the scale of animal life, the five helpers of the mind gradually came into operation one by one, and thus the animal mind became more receptive to adjustments and mastery of the environment in the process. that they developed. It is important to highlight that the ability of animals to adapt to air, water and land is not accidental, it is a superphysical adjustment that the brain makes through its nervous system, which has the innate ability to respond to the ministry of nature. mind.

But it will be the action of the seven adjutant spirits of the mind that will influence the orderly organic evolution of the creatures that live in the primitive worlds. The seven spirits are the versatile adjutants of the mind that serve the inferior creatures of a planet and also represent the presence of the Infinite Spirit in the lower orders of intelligent life of the evolutionary worlds of time and space (<a id="a66_415"></a>[UB 36:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5_2)).

The seven adjutant spirits of the mind will act from the lower levels of the mind and they will manifest according to the evolutionary achievement that the primitive creature is achieving through the following order: intuition, understanding, courage, knowledge, advice, worship and wisdom.

The action of the first five helper-spirits in the minds of the first orders of lower animals is, to a certain extent, essential to the emergence of the incipient human intellect. Thus, in summary, the presence of the seven helping spirits in the mind of the primitive creature is indispensable for its organic, intellectual and spiritual evolution. And it will be the action of the last two helpers of the mind, that of adoration and wisdom, that will forever differentiate MAN from ANIMAL.

A little over a million years ago, the ancestors of the human race first appeared, arose through the evolution of the life plasm possessed by some lower-type animals. This organic evolution, which gave rise to the first types of lemurs that predated primitive man, arises through a series of successive mutations, which resulted in the appearance of the proto-human races of the lemur type of placental mammals. The appearance of these mammals took place in the Mesopotamian or Persian peninsula (<a id="a72_497"></a>[UB 62:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p2_1)).

These Mesopotamian proto-human mammals were direct descendants of the North American lemur type of placental mammals. They were very active creatures, standing close to a meter in height, and although they could not walk on their hind legs, they could stand upright with ease. They were hairy and agile, babbling in the monesque fashion, but unlike the ape tribes, they were carnivorous. They possessed a primitive thumb, their big toes were extremely useful for grasping, and over time that protohuman species developed their thumbs more and more, thus progressively losing the ability to grasp with their big toes, due to the fact that they used more frequently the thumbs of their hands to carry out their activities. These proto-human mammals reached their full development at three or four years of age and had a potential lifespan of twenty years. They usually had only one young at a time, occasionally gave birth to twins, and members of this new species had larger brains than other animals of their kind.

Practically with the appearance of the proto-human mammals, the assistant spirit of intuition also made its appearance in the primitive mind of the animal creature. This is the first of the mind's assistants, which will act more widely in the lower orders of life. animal, which will provide them to a large extent with the numerous primitive instincts for self-preservation, as well as with the emotions that would later characterize primitive man. It also gave them the instinct to feed, and the instinct of sexual desire manifested definite sexual selection in the crude form of courtship and mate choice. They were tender in their family relationships and defended their clan even at the cost of their lives.

These early proto-human mammals multiplied and spread throughout the Mesopotamian peninsula for over a thousand years. During that time they developed a better physical type and a greater intelligence and, after sixty generations of this species having originated, a new class of creatures appeared, the intermediate mammals, which already showed a superior behavior of life. With the appearance of this new type of creatures of animal origin, the next step in the evolution of the human race was taken (p.704, 705)

These creatures were larger than their predecessors. They measure a little more than a meter and a half; in all respects they were greater than their progenitors. They had longer legs and shorter arms, they had thumbs that functioned almost perfectly and were as efficient as the thumb of modern humans in adapting to various tasks, they already walked upright, they had feet well adapted to walking like later human races, and their brains were smaller but with more intelligent behavior.

Several rudimentary human traits appeared in this new species: their body was already sparsely haired, and compared to their ancestors, they were truly beautiful.

Throughout fifteen thousand years and six hundred generations, they continued to evolve through the action of the mind's second assistant, the spirit of understanding, which was able to endow intermediate mammals with the drive for coordination, spontaneous and automatic association. of ideas, the action of reasoning and rapid judgment and the ability to make decisions immediately.

As the intermediate mammals evolved, it was possible to observe in them the action of the third helper of the mind, the spirit of courage, who endowed them with a simple form of self-awareness and protection, which is the basis of character, of the intellectual root. , of moral fiber and spiritual intrepidity, which will give the creature the impulse to evolve through the channels of intelligent and conscious self-direction, thereby promoting the appearance of superior mammals or primates, which were the ancestors direct and immediate of the human race.

Primates were more human and less animal than their intermediate mammalian predecessors. The dimensions of the skeleton of this new species were very similar to those of the primitive human races. The human type of hand and foot had reached its full development; these creatures already knew how to walk and even run. Also, like any of his later human descendants, the increased use of his hands contributed much to the development of his brain power. Although primates differed little from their predecessors in their emotional nature, they exhibited a more humane bent in all their emotions. They were indeed more splendid and superior animals, reaching maturity at ten years of age and their maximum average lifespan was almost forty years. As they evolved, the mind's fourth helper, the spirit of knowledge, was observed to manifest itself in increasing measure, giving the creature the gift of adventure and discovery, as well as the first scientific impulse and the action of directing its endowments of value. towards paths of progressive growth through the action of the fifth counseling spirit, which endowed the mind of primates with the social impulse and the consequent development of the instinct to live in peace with other creatures of the same species.

With the appearance of the higher primates also appeared a species of backward primates, which were the founders of the modern ape tribes. Thus man and ape can be seen to be related only because both descended from intermediate mammals. Modern man and the apes descended from the same tribe and species but not from the same parents. The direct ancestors of man descended from the highest specimens and the most elite of the intermediate mammals, while the modern apes descended from the most retarded group of intermediate mammals.

Thus, through the gradual appearance of the first five helper-spirits in the minds of proto-human mammals, intermediate mammals, and higher mammals, and after almost nine hundred generations of organic evolution, spanning about twenty-one thousand years , a female primate suddenly gave birth to two amazing creatures, the first true human beings. These remarkable twins (one male and one female) would practically become the parents of the entire human race. They were clearly superior and radically different from all their other ancestors.

These two remarkable creatures were true human beings. They had perfectly human thumbs and feet as perfect as those of the current human races, they walked and ran. These early humans (and their descendants) reached full maturity at twelve years of age, and had a potential half-life of seventy-five years. Many new emotions appeared early in these human twins. They manifested admiration for both objects and other beings and displayed considerable vanity. But the most extraordinary advance in the emotional development of these twins was the appearance of the sixth helper, the spirit of worship, which, working in the human mind of the twins, caused them to suddenly begin to manifest a set of new feelings that were truly human. They began to show a type of primitive worship, which included: awe, reverence, humility, gratitude and fear of natural phenomena. This set of human feelings will give birth to primitive religion. This manifestation of primitive worship is the first differential impulse that is going to separate the creatures of mind into two basic classes of existence: the animal and the human. The spirit of adoration will forever differentiate man from the animal (those soulless creatures of mental endowment). It is important to point out that the practice of genuine adoration towards the Universal Father by evolutionary mortals will provide them with the candidacy for spiritual ascension (<a id="a94_1418"></a>[UB 36:5.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5_12)).

The twins not only manifested such human feelings, they also manifested many other highly evolved feelings. They knew little of pity, shame, or blame, and were acutely aware of love, hate, and revenge, and susceptible to marked feelings of jealousy. Very early they learned verbal communication and by the age of ten they had already invented and improved a language of signs and words. They greatly improved and expanded the clumsy communication technique of their ancestors (<a id="a96_477"></a>[UB 62:5.5-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p5_5)).

When the twins were about nine years old, they discussed a matter of momentous importance for the proliferation of the human race. They both agreed that they would live with each other and for each other. This was the first of a series of agreements that would later culminate in the appearance of the human race. They also made the decision to flee their lower animal companions and undertake a journey north in the near future to an isolated region to avoid possible biological degradation through mating with their lower relatives from the primate tribes (<a id="a98_559"></a>[UB 62:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p5_8)).

Thus, when the twins were eleven years old, through intelligent and meditative thought they made the decision to flee north to segregate their future offspring from the rest of the lower primates with the intention of preserving and uplifting the race. human to higher levels of evolution. This fact originated the appearance of the seventh assistant, the spirit of wisdom, in the nascent evolutionary mind of the twins, and endowed them with the tendency towards an orderly and progressive evolutionary advance, as well as the innate ability to survive and subsist within the world. hostile and dangerous environment that surrounded them.

This relevant event of the appearance of the spirit of wisdom in the evolutionary mind of the twins through their first intelligent thought, caused the earth to be recorded in the archives of the universe as a planet inhabited by intelligent life. The biological evolution of the species, from a prolonged organic evolutionary process, had finally managed to reach the levels of human dignity.

This fact originated that, approximately a million years ago, the evolutionary man appeared on the face of the earth for the first time, which from that recognition already possessed the potential to ascend spiritually (<a id="a104_220"></a>[UB 62:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p7_1)). This great event allowed Urantia (the name assigned to Earth within the planetary system) to be formally registered as a planet inhabited by intelligent life by the superhuman authorities of the universe of Nebadon (name of the universe in which Urantia is located). This event was broadcast from Nebadon headquarters through the following message: It is with great pleasure that it is communicated to the entire universe of Nebadon; the appearance of the evolutionary human mind type on Urantia, from the twins' intelligent decision to flee north to segregate their future offspring from their lesser ancestors.

This formal planetary record closed with the declaration of an archangel in Nebadon: the human mind on Urantia has appeared through the twins. The parents of this new race will be named Andon, which in Nebadonian name means “the first creature in the likeness of the Father to exhibit the human desire for perfection,” and Fonta, which means “the first creature in the likeness of the Son to exhibit the human desire for perfection.” human for perfection. And all the archangels of the universe pray that this new race may soon receive in its evolutionary mind the endowment of the divine spirit of the Universal Father, the purest spiritual reality that can exist in the Grand Universe and which bears the name “Thought Adjuster” ( <a id="a106_733"></a>[UB 63:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p1_4)).

In this way, the extraordinary performance of primitive man on the face of the earth concludes, setting the stage for the next chapter of the work: the spiritual evolution of man for the achievement of immortal survival, in which evolutionary man, with potential to transcend beyond the temporal cycle in which he lives, he will have to perform his best spiritual performance within the material level in which he develops, so that his mortal evolving soul after death achieves survival and passes to the next cycle of life. eternity, that glorious and perfect immortal spiritual career ascending towards paradise.

The Universal Father who inhabits eternity has emanated the following supreme mandate: BE YOU PERFECT, JUST AS I AM PERFECT, which is of general observance for all the creatures of his great creation, even for the lowest creatures of animal origin, such and as are the mortal races of URANTIA (<a id="a110_294"></a>[UB 1:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p0_3), <a id="a110_335"></a>[UB 7:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/7#p5_1), <a id="a110_376"></a>[UB 40:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p7_5)). So, brothers, it is time that we truly begin to prepare ourselves spiritually, to begin to fulfill the will of GOD, to be perfect just as the Father is perfect.
