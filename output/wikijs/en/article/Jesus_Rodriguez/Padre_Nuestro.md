<p style="text-align:center;">
Universal Father, eternal and infinite, <br>
First source of life that originates everything, <br>
Absolute Deity who resides in the Eternal Island of Paradise, <br>
Which is the center of all creation<br>
and the place of origin of the main spiritual personalities <br>
and source of all universal energies.<br>
Your Dainal Children, trinized, paradisiacal, <br>
havonal, angelic, morontial and us,<br>
The potentially ascending evolutionary mortals of time and space,<br>
In permanent praise we adore, venerate and glorify you <br>
For being the Absolute God and our Creator Father <br>
That resides in each one of his children<br>
Through the Thought Adjuster or by other means of fragmentation;<br>
So that, under that divine, wise, perfect and loving guide <br>
All the members of your great universal family <br>
Let's develop a true spiritual state <br>
That allows us to be able to fulfill your will.<br>
Of being perfect in the same way that you are perfect,<br>
and so we evolve together with the Supreme<br>
So that the era of light and life is established within your great creation<br>
As is your eternal and divine purpose, <br>
and so, as true spiritual children of God<br>
Let's start that glorious ascending and eternal spiritual career towards Paradise,<br>
In search of our beloved Universal Father.<br>
</p>
