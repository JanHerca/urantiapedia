Next time you see geese flying in their characteristic “V” formation, consider what science has discovered about why they do what they do.

As each bird flaps its wings, it creates uplift for the bird immediately following. So by flying in formation, the flight of the whole flock becomes more efficient to the point that the range of the flock is increased by as much as 70% more than the individual bird is able to achieve by itself.

People who share the same direction and sense of community can get to where they are going considerably more quickly and easily because they are feeding upon the thrust of one another.

When a goose falls out of formation, it suddenly experiences increased drag. Hence the added resistance due to going it alone is the incentive for it to get back into formation.

If we all had goose sense, we would stay in formation. When a lead goose gets tired, it rotates back into the formation and another takes its place. In the geese formation there is no one leader. All but the weakest take their turn.

Sharing the burden and taking turns at doing the hard work makes sense, be it people or geese. The Urantia movement needs people who will take their turn and share the work load, each according to their ability. That also makes sense.

> You cannot change yesterday. You can only make the most of today, and look with hope toward tomorrow.
