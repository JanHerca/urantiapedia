It is impossible that any government, or political or military operation can be carried out, even less like that of the Master Jesus on earth, proselytizing in defiance of the established religious authority, can function without a system and an Intelligence Chief and his respective team of agents that gather the necessary information to be able to take the steps properly. Let's not forget that information is power. The movements of Jesus, although it is true that he knew the end from the beginning, but he never used that prerogative by his own decision, in the sense of only sticking to his purely human mind, were advised with great precision, dedication and loyalty by David Zebedee, own brother of James and John Zebedee. David was one of the Thunder Brothers, as Jesus called James and John. David was not an apostle, nor was he called by the Master, but he was, alone, slowly taking responsibility for keeping Jesus informed with the body of messengers, and providing him with protection through permanent vigilance, helping him with the logistics of the trips, shops, food and to inform him of the state of the places where he was going, and the progress that the evangelists were making.

THIS IS MY TRIBUTE TO THIS GREAT MAN, “MY HERO OF THE URANTIA BOOK”

The first mention of David Zebedee is related to the roundup of the fish in <a id="a41_76"></a>[UB 145:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p1_1). After an intense instruction to the crowd, Jesus was surrounded and pushed towards the seashore where David's boat was, which bore the name of Simon, since it had previously belonged to Simon Peter and had been built by him. Master himself. David and a certain Simon (his assistant) were cleaning the nets after a long night without results. Jesus, after having interrupted his work to speak to the crowd from the boat, invited him to sail away and cast the nets again. Simon, David's helper, told Jesus that it wasn't worth it, but he was willing to follow the Master's instructions because David told him to. They cast the nets in the place Jesus told them to, and the catch was so great that they had to call their partners who were on land and they brought three more boats, which they filled to their rails. From that day on, David Zebedee and this Simon left their nets and followed the Master.

Later, between May and October of the year 28 AD, when Jesus and the apostolic body resided in Bethsaida in what was the house of Zebedee, his headquarters, a camp was set up that came to house 1,500 people, seekers of the truth, curious, loyal followers of the Master, etc. This tent city was under the supervision of David, who was assisted by the Alpheus twins. The camp, the revelators tell us, was a model of order, sanitation, and administration. The sick were in a field hospital under the command of a believing Syrian doctor named Elman. The apostles went out fishing at least one day a week, they sold the catch to David, who in turn fed the passengers of the camp. David managed this great city in such a way that it became a self-sufficient company.

Around those days, a prophet or something like that came to the camp from Baghdad, who went into a trance and according to him had peculiar visions. Simón Celotes wanted to give what he deserved to this misnamed prophet named Quirmet, but the Master let him continue for a few days. They soon found out that he was crazy and he returned to Baghdad quickly, after David, along with some helpers, gave him several plunges into the sea. Great David, he gave that false prophet a good lesson.

Throughout this period and until the last trip to Jerusalem of Jesus and the twelve, David maintained his headquarters in his father's house at Bethsaida. This was the distribution center for Jesus' work on Earth and the message transmission center used by David among the workers of the kingdom in the different areas of Palestine and adjacent regions. He kept between forty and fifty messengers in this kingdom workers information division. The most important thing, the revelators emphasize, is that all this David did on his own initiative, with Andrew's approval. This is remarkable, he kept fishing to be able to support himself and maintain all that infrastructure, but he did it because he believed in Jesus and his work.

They constantly resorted to the messengers of David, Jesus included, to indicate instructions and news and news to the evangelists scattered throughout the different regions where the work of the Master was being carried out.

When the Master called the first ten women who made up the body of women evangelists, it was David and his messenger service who summoned them before the presence of Jesus.

On preaching tours, Jesus would spend two or three days with different groups of evangelists, continue on to join another group, and learn the location and movement of each one from David's messengers. Through these messengers each of these groups was kept informed of the progress of the tour, and the news from the other groups was always stimulating to these separate and scattered workers.

During the rest week, during the last days in Capernaum, the Master used to go fishing with David, and although he remained alone for a long time, he was always guarded, at a prudent distance, by two or three David's messengers, who in turn he always knew where his Master was.

Jesus approved that David Zebedee continue with the messenger service throughout the country, and David, saying goodbye to the Master said: «Master, go out and do your work. Do not get caught by the fans, and do not doubt that the messengers will always be within your reach. My men will never lose sight of you, and through them you will be informed about the progress of the kingdom in other regions, and through them we will know about you. Nothing can happen to me to interfere with this service, because I have appointed substitute leaders in first, second and even third terms. I am not an instructor or a preacher, but my heart demands that I do this, and no one can dissuade me.

Here we have the greatest demonstration of a man's loyalty and love for Jesus. He was ready for anything, including giving his life.

Around those same days in May of the year 29 AD, in Tiberias, after several failed attempts, the religious and political leaders of Jerusalem managed to convince Herod Antipas to approve a plan for the leaders of the Sanhedrin to arrest Jesus and take him to prison. Jerusalem charged with religious offences. On May 22 of that year, David's messengers arrived at the house of Zebedee, the headquarters of Jesus and of David as well, with the news that Herod had authorized and ordered the arrest of the Master by the officials of the Sanhedrin. As you will understand, this completely revolutionized the day. Jesus had to flee from there. They notified the family of Jesus, who rushed to see him but could not because of the crowd that surrounded the Master, who was speaking to the people. As he got on the boat that would take him to the other side of the lake, he told David to explain what had happened to his family.

He left with his twelve apostles and twelve evangelists from Bethsaida to the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee, followed by a smaller boat with six of David's messengers with instructions to follow every step, every move of Jesus and this group, permanently reporting to him, who would be at his father's house, the headquarters. From there, David monitored and followed in the footsteps of the twenty-five truth instructors and vice versa.

Permanently during all these adventures of the Master and his followers, David always knew where he was and where he would go.

In the year 29 AD, specifically on Sunday August 7, through David's messengers, the Master arranged a meeting with all his family in Capernaum, since he was in Caesarea Philippi, which would be held in the boat workshop. of Zebedee. David made this appointment with Judah, the Master's brother, so that the entire family of Nazareth would be present. It was the intention of Mary and her brothers to attend that call of Jesus, who went with Andrew and Peter.

Unfortunately, a group of Pharisees arrived at Maria's house to find out from the Master what they knew, that he was on the other side of the lake in Philip's domain. It could not be, the Pharisees camped at the door of Mary's house and none of her brothers or sisters could come out to meet with the Master. All this was accurately reported by David's messengers, who were always aware of what could happen to Jesus, and with this valuable information the Master's early arrest was avoided. Unfortunately this reunion with his earthly family could not take place.

The Master, Andrew, and Peter were still on the shores of the lake, near the boat workshop, when a tax collector from the temple recognized Jesus, called Peter aside, and asked him the following question: “Doesn't your teacher pay the temple tax? Peter was tempted to express indignation at this collector who came, on top of him, to collect taxes for the temple from the sworn enemies of Jesus, but in those conditions, and even more knowing that they were in lands where the Master could be arrested, he replied : ”Of course, the Master pays the tax, waits by the gate and I'll be right back with the money.“ But Pedro, for a change, spoke without thinking, Judas had the bag and was on the other side of the lake, and neither he nor his brother nor the Master had brought money. Nor could they go to Bethsaida to get the money, because the Pharisees were following in the footsteps of the Master. Peter went and told Jesus what was happening, and his response was that he had to pay, ”you will be a fisherman again,“ Jesus told him, ”you will cast your net and, with what you catch, you will sell it and pay the man.“ collector, here we will wait for you”. But no one knew that there was a secret messenger from David who overheard the conversation and signaled to an associate who was fishing near the shore to come back soon.

Pedro was already preparing to go fishing, when this messenger and his friend brought him several baskets of fish and helped him take them to the buyer, who paid him much more than the tax they had to pay. Once again David's messengers, timely and efficiently, fulfilled their duty to care for the Master and his associates, always.

They were in Betsaida Julias, and the funds were coming to an end, they were in the house of Celsus waiting for the messengers with some money that David would send them. After the collapse of Jesus' popularity, the apostolic treasury was empty. Mateo, who was in charge of raising funds, did not want to leave them at that moment and had no money to give to Judas. But David Zebedee foresaw this situation and instructed his messengers, as they made their way through Judea, Samaria, and Galilee, to act as collectors of money to bring back to his exiled apostles and Master. That same day at night David's messengers arrived with sufficient funds until his return. Here we can see, in this situation, that these courageous and helpful messengers, instructed and selected by David Zebedee, even collected money so that the Master could carry on with his magisterial work.

During the tour of the Decapolis, already back in Magadan, none of Jesus' associates or followers really appreciated the great value of David's messengers. Not only did they keep believers in touch with each other, with Jesus and the apostles throughout Palestine, but in these difficult times, they also collected funds not only for the maintenance of Jesus and his associates, but also to help the families of the twelve apostles and the twelve evangelists. They were a group of excellence, of great importance in the megalabor of Jesus.

This is how intelligence services always work, with a very low profile, and this was no exception.

From Magadan, Jesus moved to Perea near Pella, where he had been baptized in the Jordan. They settled where the camp of John the Baptist had been. David raised the camp from Magadan. And he moved things on the back of animals to Bethsaida.

Pilgrims began to arrive from all parts of Palestine, from other parts of the Roman Empire, from east of the Tigris, and from Mesopotamia. He and his messengers reloaded their pack animals and proceeded south along the lake shore along the Jordan to about a kilometer north of the apostolic camp. In less than a week it was ready to receive fifteen hundred people. It was the rainy season in Palestine, therefore it was essential to make these camps.

David did all this on his own initiative, although he took advice from Felipe and Mateo. Most of his messengers became assistants in this small tent city, and about twenty continued with the work of messengers and listeners to find out the footsteps of Jesus' enemies.

Jesus continued with his preaching trips and was always aware of the progress of the presentation of the kingdom of heaven thanks to David's messengers, reports from all over Palestine, Alexandria and Damascus.

On the departure of Pella, David's camp was closed on the instructions of Andrés on the fifteenth of March. At that time, some four thousand pilgrims resided there and another thousand in the apostolic camp. David reluctantly sold everything to various buyers and headed to Jerusalem with the funds, later turning them over to Judas Iscariot.

It must not be forgotten that David was present in Jerusalem during the entire tragic week that ended in the Master's crucifixion. When he waited for Jesus and the apostles, he did so in Bethany at the house of Lazarus, Martha, and Mary, and he was very agitated to see how the Pharisees mistreated and persecuted Lazarus. On Andrés's instructions, he disarmed the messaging system, and he felt like he was out of a job. He accompanied Lazarus until the time of his departure to Philadelphia, where Abner was, and helped Marta and Maria to sell all their goods so that they could go to their brother. David later went permanently to Philadelphia, where he took charge of the finances of the Abnerian church.

Already in Jerusalem, on Sunday, April 2, David gave Judas Iscariot the funds from the sale of the stores and belongings of the previous camps. That same Sunday, April 2, was the day that the Master decided to enter Jerusalem riding a donkey, and it was David again who went ahead to Jerusalem, warning the crowd of pilgrims that Jesus would enter triumphant that afternoon. He was followed by several of his former messengers, who achieved a great convocation as they spread among the people announcing the arrival of the Master.

When things entered the final stage and the death of the Master at the hands of the high priests was imminent, and the fact that Jesus would not exercise his divine power, David, who was looking a little from the outside, with perspective, because he received reports from here and there, that is, from the apostolic group and its agents scattered throughout Jerusalem, plus what he had heard from the Master, and since he believed him wholeheartedly, on his own initiative, as almost always, he sent a messenger to Bethsaida where his mother was to come to Jerusalem and bring the mother of Jesus, Mary, and all his family. The news soon reached him that the Master's family and his mother were on their way, and that the next day in the afternoon, or at the latest the day after, they would be in Jerusalem. David, as we said, decided this on his own initiative, and for this reason he preferred to keep this coming of the Master's family, which was already on its way, a strict secret. That same night, Jesus inquired carefully about the family of each of his apostles and, turning his gaze on David, asked him if anyone knew anything about his own mother, his younger sister, and other members of his family.

David looked down and didn't dare answer. That was a very complex night, David's messengers came and went, communicating only with him, and that same night David was told of Lazarus's departure for Philadelphia, before being arrested by order of the Sanhedrin.

The next day, Thursday April 5, after the Master was with his closest followers gathered near the Olivete camp, they returned at noon and David had lunch prepared for them.

Shortly after this lunch, the apostles learned of the flight of Lazarus from Bethany to Philadelphia, which caused them greater anguish because they felt the determination of the Sanhedrin to end the life of Jesus and his teachings. David, through the work of his secret agents in Jerusalem, had detailed information on the steps of Judas Iscariot, the role he played in this plot, and the progress of the plan to arrest and assassinate the Master. He never revealed this information to the apostles or the other disciples. This is proof of your tremendous discretion. Shortly after lunch he took Jesus aside, daring to ask him if he knew; but he could not continue his question because the Master raised his hand, interrupted him and said: «Yes, David, I know everything, and I know that you know, but make sure you don't tell any man, just don't doubt your heart that in the end the will of God will triumph.“ At that moment a messenger arrived from Philadelphia with a message from Abner, who asked if it was necessary for him to travel to Jerusalem, since he knew of the plot against the Master. And this one answered him, so that he might tell Abner, saying: «Continue with your work; if I abandon you in the flesh, it is only so that I can return in the spirit. I will not abandon you. I'll be with you to the end.”

To all this, Felipe approached the Master to ask him about what they would do and where the Easter dinner would be. Jesus sent him after Peter and John. Judas, upon hearing this conversation, approached, Pedro, Juan and Felipe arrived. David, seeing this scene, approached Judas and talked to him about other things pending between them, preventing him from hearing what the Master talked about and ordered the other three apostles. That was the moment when Jesus instructed the three, Peter, John and Philip, to go to John Mark's house, where the last supper would take place, but without Judas Iscariot finding out, thanks to the skillful maneuver of the chief. of intelligence, David Zebedeo. Judas wanted to follow the three of them, but David had several unfinished business with Judas, so it was not difficult for him to prevent him from going after the three apostles and staying with him. David made him see that, in view of the difficulties they were facing, it would be good if he gave him some money for future events, and Judas, reflecting, gave him all the money from the apostolic fund. So, David at that time received all the money in cash and the receipts for the money on deposit. The apostles learned of this the following night.

They found out to their great surprise when they returned to the camp that Judas Iscariot was not there.

While the eleven were heatedly discussing the matter of this traitor, David and Juan Marcos separated Jesus a short distance to reveal to him that they knew of the footsteps of the accursed man, who would hand him over to his enemies. Jesus listened to them and said: “My friends, nothing can happen to the Son of Man unless it is the will of the Father in heaven. Let your heart not be troubled; all things will work together for the glory of God and the salvation of men.”

At that point in the proximity of the worst tragedy on this planet, some of the apostles fell asleep because they were exhausted and others followed Simon Zelotes, who had weapons to defend Jesus. Nine of them received them and went to sleep. For these men, at that moment, it must have been terribly scary to think about the betrayal of the accursed Judas. They had lived together, had shared so many experiences. Amidst this situation, the Master called David and asked him to bring his fastest and most reliable messenger. David went and returned with a certain James, who had been a night runner in the messenger service between Jerusalem and Bethsaida, and Jesus, looking at him, said to him: “Go quickly to Abner's in Philadelphia and say: the Master has sent you.” greetings of peace and says that the time has come for him to be delivered into the hands of his enemies, who will kill him, but that he will rise from the dead and appear before you soon, before going to the Father, and then It will guide you until the time when the new Master comes to dwell in your heart». The Master sent him saying: “Jacob, do not fear any man in your way, since tonight an invisible messenger will run by your side”.

Only people like David Zebedee can be entrusted with such delicate and highly trusted missions, and David knew how to choose his men, which speaks of his good sense and knowledge of human beings.

The apostles thought that the guards would come for Jesus the next day since there were no activities, but David and John Mark understood that the enemies of Jesus would come with Judas that same night.

It is remarkable and we must highlight Juan Marcos because he was a young man. The conversations he had with Jesus were full of love and mutual feelings. I'm sure he could have been the head of intelligence if he'd been older. That is why with David they had an absolute coincidence. His devotion to the Master was total.

David had arranged a surveillance point for himself and another for Juan Marcos, and before going to his post he said goodbye to the Master saying: «Master, I have known great happiness in serving with you. My brothers are your apostles, but I have rejoiced in the lesser things that should be done, and I will miss you with all my heart when you are gone. Then Jesus said to David: “David, my son, others have done what they were told to do, but this service you have done from your own heart, and I know your devotion. You too will one day serve with me in the eternal kingdom.

You can imagine the load of emotions that must have gone through the mind and body of this human being at that moment, saying goodbye to his Master, to whom he dedicated his life, to whom he understood and believed in him, even more than several of his closest.

Then, before leaving to take up his post as sentinel, David said to Jesus: “You know, Master, I sent for your family, and I have news by messenger that they are in Jericho tonight. They will be here early tomorrow before noon, since it would be dangerous for them to walk the bloody road at night. And Jesus, looking down at David, only said: “So be it, David.”

Until the very end of the crucifixion, John Zebedee remained always close, just as Jesus had instructed him, and he was the one who supplied David's messengers with information from hour to hour, which they brought to David in the garden of the camp; then it was transmitted to the apostles who were hidden and to the family of Jesus. There, where David was, Judah, the brother of Jesus, arrived and David sent them a message with him telling them to go to the house of Lazarus in Bethany and to wait there for the news that he would send them regularly. I also bring you the news that Jesus was already under arrest.

This was the situation for the latter half of Thursday night and the early hours of Friday morning, and everyone knew moment by moment what was going on, and kept in touch through the courier service that David continued to operate from his headquarters. general, now in the Gethsemane camp.

During all these fateful hours of the ignominious end of the life of Jesus, and also tragic for the entire family of Jesus and his followers, they knew hour by hour of all the events thanks to the service that David Zebedee had implanted with such courage and sagacity. He relocated the camp inside Gethsemane, anticipating that surely the Roman soldiers and the temple guards would come for the apostles, and they did. And it was there, in that place, where he again maintained contact with his messengers, who brought him minute by minute what was happening to Jesus, and in turn he sent others notifying his followers of these news. And as soon as Pilate handed Jesus over to the soldiers for crucifixion, a messenger arrived with this news, and David immediately sent runners to Bethsaida, Pella, Philadelphia, Sidon, Shechem, Hebron, Damascus, and Alexandria. The news was that Jesus was about to be crucified by the Romans, at the insistent request of the Jewish rulers.

During this tragic day, until the message came that the teacher had been laid in the tomb, David sent messengers every half hour with reports to the apostles, the Greeks, and Jesus' earthly family gathered in the house of Lazarus in Bethany. When finally the final news was that Jesus was entombed, he dismissed his agents to celebrate the Passover and Sabbath Sabbath, with instructions that they appear before him on Sunday morning, in secret, at Nicodemus's house, where He planned to hide with Andrés and Simón Pedro.

David was a guy with a very peculiar mind, the revelators tell us, and he was the only, mind you, the only one of his closest followers who took Jesus' statement that he would die and rise on the third day literally and as a matter of course. . I believed him. He was totally faithful to Jesus, and without a doubt the one who most understood the mission of self-bestowal. He never questioned the veracity of Jesus' words, while the others were often eaten away by doubts. They were human. He realized very soon that no one expected Jesus to rise from the grave so quickly, and he said nothing of his belief, he only discussed it with his agents whom he summoned, as I said, to Nicodemus's house on Sunday morning. In the midst of the sandstorm that occurred on the day of the crucifixion, at about half past three in the afternoon, David Zebedee sent the last messengers with the news of the Master's death. The last of all sent him with the news to the house of Marta and Maria, the sisters of Lazarus in Bethany, since the mother and the rest of the family of Jesus were supposed to be there.

Then came the period when Jesus remained in the tomb. Apart from David, José de Arimathea and surely Juan Marcos, very few believed in the resurrection of the Master from the grave on the third day.

In Nicodemus's house there were assembled with David Zebedee and Joseph of Arimathea some twelve or fifteen of the most prominent disciples of Jesus in Jerusalem. In the house of José de Arimathea, in turn, there were about twenty women, all faithful believers.

It was dawn on Sunday the ninth. The women found the tomb empty. The morontia Jesus appeared, the first morontia appearance of the Master, to a group of women. They went; Maria Magdalena, Maria the mother of the Alfeo twins, Salome the mother of the Zebedee brothers, Joana the wife of Chuza and Susana the daughter of Ezra of Alexandria.

The apostles refused to believe this report from the women. Everyone thought that the tomb was empty because the Jewish priests would have ordered to take away the remains of the Master. Shortly after six in the morning, the daughter of Joseph of Arimathea and the four women who had seen Jesus went to Nicodemus's house and there they related these events to Joseph of Arimathea, Nicodemus, David Zebedee, and the other assembled men. over there. Nicodemus and the others doubted that Jesus had risen from the dead. Joseph and David believed the report, went to inspect the tomb, and found it just as the women said. From the tomb, David and Joseph went to the house of Elijah Mark, where the apostles were, and conferred with them. Only John Zebedee was willing to believe, albeit vaguely, in the Master's resurrection. David did not want to argue with them, and told them: “You are the apostles and you should understand these things. I am not going to argue with you; yet now I return to the house of Nicodemus, where by our agreement I will meet the messengers this morning, and when they have assembled I will send them on their last mission, as heralds of the Master's resurrection. I heard the Master say that, after his death, he would rise on the third day, and I believe him”. Thus speaking to the depressed and forlorn ambassadors of the kingdom, this self-appointed head of communications and intelligence bade the apostles farewell. On the way to the upper room, he dropped the Judas bag, which contained all the apostolic funds, into Mateo Levi's lap.

It was approximately nine-thirty in the morning of this hectic Sunday when the last of David's twenty-six messengers arrived at Nicodemus's house. David called them all together and said to them: “Men and brothers, all this time you have served me in accordance with your oath before me and before yourselves, and I call you to witness that I have never sent false information through you.” . I am about to send you on your last mission as voluntary messengers of the kingdom, and in doing so I release you from your oath and by doing so I am disbanding this messenger corps. Men, I declare to you that we have finished our work. The Master no longer needs mortal messengers; he has risen from the dead. He told us before he was arrested that he would die and that he would rise on the third day. I have seen the tomb: it is empty. I have talked to Mary Magdalene and four other women, who talked to Jesus. Now I dissolve this group, I say goodbye to you and I send you on your respective task, and the message that you will take to the believers is: Jesus has risen from the dead, the tomb is empty.

Most of those present tried to dissuade David from sending this news, but they could not sway him. So, they tried to do it with the messengers directly, but they did not listen to expressions of uncertainty. This is how, shortly after ten o'clock in the morning, these twenty-six runners came out with the news of the truth of the fact of the resurrected Jesus. Thus, they fulfilled their own oath and the oath made before David. These men fully trusted David Zebedee, the intelligence chief, undisputed leader, with a rise in command among his subordinates and with a foolproof character.

In turn, the apostles, the spiritual body of the kingdom, are in the house of the Marcos, on the second floor, and there they manifest fear, express doubts, while these laymen, who represent the first attempt to socialize the gospel of the Master of the brotherhood of man, under the orders of their fearless and efficient leader, they go forth to proclaim the risen Saviour. And they undertake this full service even before their chosen representatives are willing to take their word for it or accept witness evidence.

The twenty-six were dispatched to the house of Lazarus in Bethany and to all the centers of believers, from Beersheba in the south to Damascus and Sidon in the north; and from Philadelphia in the east to Alexandria in the west. David said goodbye to his brothers and went to look for his mother at Joseph's house and went to Bethany with Martha and Mary until after they sold their land, and he accompanied them until they met with Lazarus, their brother, in Philadelphia. . About a week after that day, John Zebedee took Mary, the mother of Jesus, to Bethsaida. James, the older brother of Jesus, stayed with his family in Jerusalem. Ruth, the younger sister of Jesus, stayed in Bethany with the sisters of Lazarus. The rest of Jesus' family returned to Galilee.

David Zebedee left Bethany with Martha and Mary, on his way to Philadelphia, in the first part of June, the day after he celebrated his wedding with Ruth, the Master's younger sister.

David did not have to wait long to be reunited with his beloved Master, now in a morontia state. When he appeared for the third time, in the house of Lazarus and was with his brother Santiago, David said: «it is not only emotional women who see him anymore; even strong-hearted men have begun to see it. I hope to see it too." David did not have to wait long, the fourth apparition was in the same house as Marta and Maria, shortly before two in the afternoon, when he appeared before his earthly family, about twenty in all.

David Zebedee ended his days in Philadelphia as head of finances for Abner's church, in the company of his wife, neither more nor less than the younger sister of Jesus, the most faithful of all his family, the one who never questioned the mission from his father brother.

In the love of the Father.
