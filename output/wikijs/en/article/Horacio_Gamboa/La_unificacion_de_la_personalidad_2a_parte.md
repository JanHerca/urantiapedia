It is necessary to clarify that there are personalities of the Third Source and Center, the Infinite Spirit. These personalities are not part of the Father Personality circuit, but these personalities can connect and contact all kinds of personalities. For more understanding of these personalities, in <a id="a38_303"></a>[UB 9:8.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/9#p8_14) are each and every one of them and their functions.

> _The spirit personalities of the vast family of the Divine and Infinite Spirit are forever dedicated to the service of the ministry of the love of God and the mercy of the Son to all the intelligent creatures of the evolutionary worlds of time and space. These spirit beings constitute the living ladder whereby mortal man climbs from chaos to glory._ (<a id="a40_355"></a>[UB 9:8.25](/en/The_Urantia_Book/9#p8_25))

I could not continue without dwelling on this wonderful revelation, which makes me feel so accompanied, so assisted by beings so dedicated to service. Beings that are from the Third Source, at least havôneros and others paradisiacal, who have decided to leave the comfort of infinite perfection to come to the universes of time and space to minister to intelligent beings. And the final point: that they represent the living ladder by which we mortal men can ascend from chaos to glory. It simply calls me to the greatest humility and smallness, and at the same time to the importance and responsibility that all this knowledge and discernment represents.

> _The Father bestows personality by his personal free will. Why he does so we can only conjecture; how he does so we do not know. Neither do we know why the Third Source bestows non-Father personality, but this the Infinite Spirit does in his own behalf, in creative conjunction with the Eternal Son and in numerous ways unknown to you. The Infinite Spirit can also act for the Father in the bestowal of First Source personality._ (<a id="a44_433"></a>[UB 9:8.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/9#p8_10))

By his free will the Father bestows personality, and we are told by this Divine Counselor of Uversa, commissioned by the Ancients of Days to describe the nature and work of the Infinite Spirit, that they can only conjecture why he does it, but not how he does it. . I think, reading in <a id="a46_286"></a>[UB 6:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p7_1) about the personality of the Eternal Son, that this is where the reason comes from. The Eternal Son is that infinite personality from whose bonds of unqualified personality the Universal Father escaped by the technique of trinitization, and by virtue of which he has continued to bestow himself ever since in endless profusion upon the ever-expanding universe of Creators and creatures. The Son is absolute personality; God is parental personality: the source of personality, the bestower of personality, the cause of personality. Every personal being derives personality from the Universal Father, just as the original son eternally derives his personality from the Paradise Father. And here we return to the origin of our personality. The personality of the Son of Paradise is absolutely and purely spiritual, and this absolute personality is also the original divine and eternal pattern, first of the Father's bestowal of personality on the Conjoint Actor, and, later, of the bestowal of personality on the myriads of his creatures from the vast universe. Therefore, the reason he does it would be to escape, as the Counselor tells us, from the bonds of the unqualified personality, and he escapes through the trinitization technique. Returning to <a id="a46_1577"></a>[UB 9:8.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/9#p8_11), we find that the Spirit grants personality not from the Father, but does so in his own name and in conjunction with the Eternal Son. Obviously, in many ways unknown to us. And finally, at this point it must be noted that the Conjoint Actor can act for the Father in the bestowal of personality from First Source. This can be contradictory to us, since they insistently tell us that only the Father grants personality, but it is not so, since the Conjoint Actor, as its name indicates, can and must do for the Father and in his name, that and further. In fact, it is the ministry, the acting arm of the Father and the Son in the revolving universes of space.

> “_It is through the mediation of mind that the self and the environment establish meaningful contact. The ability and willingness of the organism to make such significant contacts with environment (response to a drive) represents the *attitude* of the whole personality._”
> 
> “_Personality cannot very well perform in isolation. Man is innately a social creature; he is dominated by the craving of belongingness. It is literally true, “No man lives unto himself.”_”
> 
> “_But the concept of the personality as the meaning of the whole of the living and functioning creature means much more than the integration of relationships; it signifies the *unification* of all factors of reality as well as co-ordination of relationships. Relationships exist between two objects, but three or more objects eventuate a *system,* and such a system is much more than just an enlarged or complex relationship. This distinction is vital, for in a cosmic system the individual members are not connected with each other except in relation to the whole and through the individuality of the whole._”
> 
> “_In the human organism the summation of its parts constitutes selfhood—individuality—but such a process has nothing whatever to do with personality, which is the unifier of all these factors as related to cosmic realities._”
> 
> “_In aggregations parts are added; in systems parts are *arranged.* Systems are significant because of organization—positional values. In a good system all factors are in cosmic position. In a bad system something is either missing or displaced—deranged. In the human system it is the personality which unifies all activities and in turn imparts the qualities of identity and creativity._” (<a id="a56_393"></a>[UB 112:1.15-19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p1_15))

Well, we are going deep into this topic. Through the mediation of the mind, we feel, we think, we have our intellect, our sensations, etc. Therefore, it is through its mediation that we relate to the environment, and it is through it that we will establish contact with the environment that surrounds us. The organism's ability and consent to make such contacts with the environment (impulse response) represent the attitude of the entire personality. This must be related to the behavior that we will have, how we are going to react to such impulses, to such contacts, and this will represent the complete attitude of our personality, be it a group of people, situations, physical environment, etc.

We will all agree in the sense that no human being can live in isolation. We would become cavemen if we lived only for ourselves and in solitude. We all long to belong to whatever: the fire department, the tennis club, the Rotarians, the municipality, the neighborhood council... whatever, but to belong. It is necessary to wear each other down; there grows tolerance, respect, ideas, altruism, etc. All of them fundamental for our growth and development. And now we are told that the concept of personality as the total sense of the living, functioning creature means much more than the integration of relationships: it means the UNIFICATION of all factors of reality as well as the coordination of relationships.

We are seeing the concept of personality as the total meaning of the living creature. Total sense, how tremendous. It is more than an integrator of relationships: it UNIFIES all the factors of reality and coordinates relationships. They also tell us that the relationships are between two objects, but 3 or more result in a system and this system is much more than a relationship, extended or complex. The distinction is vital because, in a cosmic system, the individual members are not connected to each other, except in relation to the whole and through the individuality of the whole.

Let's see: deep down we can relate to our peers, and in turn form a system, and in this system we are not connected among ourselves by ourselves, but with the whole and through the whole, which is the giver of personality and in whom and through whom we have our being, our life. And we continue to clarify concepts. In the human organism, the sum of its parts constitutes the self, the individuality, but this process is not the personality, which is the unifier of all these factors insofar as they are related to cosmic realities. What a point this is: as soon as they are related to cosmic realities, of course they are, because the personality, which wants to return to its origin (the Father) has absolutely cosmic qualities. Unfortunately we see at every step, at every moment of our lives, that there are many people who spoil their personality, distorting it in such a way that it even leads to iniquity.

And finally, continuing with the same point; in aggregates the parts are added, in systems they are arranged. Systems are significant because of organization, because of positional values. In a good system, all the factors are in cosmic position. In a bad one, logically something is not in its place. And they end by telling us that in the human system it is the personality that unifies all activities and in turn imparts the qualities of identity and creativity.

What a tremendous revelation, what a tremendous responsibility to ourselves, since we know how things are. Therefore, we cannot play dumb or wait until later to put into practice all the knowledge imparted by the revelators regarding what we are and how we are, and they give us the perfect guide to know what to do with ourselves. It is up to us to do the Father's will, come back to Him with each other's personality, and let the Thought Adjusters work on building our morontia souls, thinking of things of value. Authentic cosmic self-realization is the result of identification with cosmic reality and with the finite cosmos of energy, mind, and spirit, limited by space and conditioned by time.

> “_The possibility of the unification of the evolving self is inherent in the qualities of its constitutive factors: the basic energies, the master tissues, the fundamental chemical overcontrol, the supreme ideas, the supreme motives, the supreme goals, and the divine spirit of Paradise bestowal—the secret of the self-consciousness of man’s spiritual nature._”
> 
> “_The purpose of cosmic evolution is to achieve unity of personality through increasing spirit dominance, volitional response to the teaching and leading of the Thought Adjuster. Personality, both human and superhuman, is characterized by an inherent cosmic quality which may be called “the evolution of dominance,” the expansion of the control of both itself and its environment._” <a id="a72_385"></a>[UB 112:2.14-15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p2_14)

Here we see how important the constituent parts of our bodies are. The genetics we inherit from our parents; the basic energies, the main tissues, the fundamental chemical overcontrol, for my point of view this has to do with our bodies, and continues with what is rather mental: the supreme motives, the supreme objectives, and of course, our Adjusters of Thought, pure spirits coming from the same Father of personalities, the secret of self-awareness of human spiritual nature. Obviously, that is the reason, the secret that we are achieving more and more self-awareness of our spiritual and human nature. And follow this point with even more discernment; the purpose of cosmic evolution consists in acquiring the unity of the personality through an increasing mastery of the spirit, with a response of our will to its guidance and its teachings. The human and superhuman personality is characterized by a cosmic quality that is called the EVOUBTION OF THE DOMINATION, the expansion of control both of the self, our animal tendencies, and of the environment, what surrounds us.

> “_When physical conditions are ripe, *sudden* mental evolutions may take place; when mind status is propitious, *sudden* spiritual transformations may occur; when spiritual values receive proper recognition, then cosmic meanings become discernible, and increasingly the personality is released from the handicaps of time and delivered from the limitations of space._” (<a id="a76_371"></a>[UB 65:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p8_6))

Here we see how important it is to keep ourselves in good physical condition, healthy, well fed, away from excesses, etc., in order to opt for these sudden mental evolutions. Our healthy minds, with little prejudice, little fear, little anxiety, etc., can opt for sudden spiritual transformations. And if we give spiritual values the recognition they deserve, cosmic meanings become discernible, and the personality on the increasing scale (unification) can be freed from the obstacles of time and redeemed from the limitations of space. And how, very simply, this is achieved with morontia thoughts, of transcendental value for our next states of life, through mental silence, prayer, adoration, contemplation, etc.

> “_The worship experience consists in the sublime attempt of the betrothed Adjuster to communicate to the divine Father the inexpressible longings and the unutterable aspirations of the human soul—the conjoint creation of the God-seeking mortal mind and the God-revealing immortal Adjuster. Worship is, therefore, the act of the material mind’s assenting to the attempt of its spiritualizing self, under the guidance of the associated spirit, to communicate with God as a faith son of the Universal Father. The mortal mind consents to worship; the immortal soul craves and initiates worship; the divine Adjuster presence conducts such worship in behalf of the mortal mind and the evolving immortal soul. True worship, in the last analysis, becomes an experience realized on four cosmic levels: the intellectual, the morontial, the spiritual, and the personal—the consciousness of mind, soul, and spirit, and their unification in personality._” (<a id="a80_946"></a>[UB 5:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p3_8))

At this wondrous point words fail, and we come to worship, how and why we worship, and how it is brought to fruition by the Adjuster on four cosmic levels: the intellectual, the morontia, the spiritual, and the personal, all unified. Because of the staff, the personality. Over and over again, at each step, at each level that we find ourselves, it will always be the personality that unifies everything and the one that will unite us, with Michael first and from there to eternity, passing through the rest of the Orvonton superuniverse, and receiving our passports from the Ancients of Days to depart for eternity. And here on p. 998 there is a point that is related to prayer, and it says: As the concept of the other self of prayer becomes supreme and divine, in the same way the ideals of man are elevated from the merely human towards exalted and divine levels, and the result of every prayer of this type is the exaltation of the human character and the PROFOUND UNIFICATION OF THE HUMAN PERSONALITY. The deep unification. Wonderful then to know that through prayer we are also deeply unifying our personality. Let us then pray with more and more passion, sincerity, altruism and faith, because this also results in the growth of our souls and our values, and our personality advances decisively towards its unification.

> “_In all your contemplation of universal phenomena, make certain that you take into consideration the interrelation of physical, intellectual, and spiritual energies, and that due allowance is made for the unexpected phenomena attendant upon their unification by personality and for the unpredictable phenomena resulting from the actions and reactions of experiential Deity and the Absolutes._” (<a id="a84_398"></a>[UB 12:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p6_4))

Simply fantastic, they make it very clear to us the importance of contemplating the phenomena of the universe, and also how related physical, intellectual and spiritual energies are. Again they make us understand that nothing is out of control, and they make us take into account the unexpected phenomena corresponding to their unification by personality and the unforeseeable phenomena resulting, by such action, from the reactions and actions of the experiential Deity, the Supreme, and the Absolutes. The Supreme undoubtedly reacts to each of our actions, good or bad, to each of our decisions, good or bad, since He is the experiential Deity, and experiences in each one of us, in addition to millions of other phenomena that they are not revealed to us in this current state we are in. But without a doubt He will experience a gratifying sense of achievement for each personality that is unified, very insignificant if that achievement is solitary, but since we belong to a whole, in this way we contribute our grain of sand to the consummation of his final achievement: Regarding the reactions of the Absolutes, I don't even have the remotest idea of what could happen, beyond assuming that we also make a great contribution to unifying our personality, especially if we agree that it is part of our Father's mandate Universal so be it.

> “_Man does not unite with the Supreme and submerge his personal identity, but the universe repercussions of the experience of all men do thus form a part of the divine experiencing of the Supreme. “The act is ours, the consequences God’s.”_” (<a id="a88_245"></a>[UB 117:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p5_5))

This point definitely clarifies our relationship with the Supreme Being.

> «_Los hombres no encuentran al Supremo de una manera espectacular y repentina como un terremoto que abre abismos entre las rocas, sino que lo encuentran lenta y pacientemente como un río que desgasta suavemente el lecho subyacente. Cuando encontréis al Padre, habréis encontrado la gran causa de vuestra ascensión espiritual por los universos; cuando encontréis al Supremo, descubriréis el gran resultado de vuestra carrera de progreso hacia el Paraíso. Pero ningún mortal que conoce a Dios estará nunca solo en su viaje por el cosmos, porque sabe que el Padre camina a su lado en cada etapa del camino, mientras que el camino mismo que atraviesa es la presencia del Supremo_». <a id="a92_680"></a>[UB 117:6.25-27](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p6_25)

I could not finish this work on the personality without paying a moment of gratitude to the magnificent Supreme Being, to the Supreme personality, we literally live in it, we grow in it. He is the evolution and synthesis of experience, and he will be the totality of experience. He is the path we are walking.

> “_WITH God the Father, sonship is the great relationship. With God the Supreme, achievement is the prerequisite to status—one must do something as well as be something._” (<a id="a96_174"></a>[UB 115:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p0_1))

Each one of us has his instructions, his mandate and his orders to advance, so let's get to work, let's give expression to our prepersonal spirits. To them, the Thought Adjusters, who chose us and bet on us, humans with the potential to be ascending beings. They will be the pilots that guide us and take us wisely along the paths of this life and of the many that we will have ahead of us. They come from the Father, from our Father, the same one who gave us the personality, what we truly are and will always be, since the personality is “PERMANENCE IN THE PRESENCE OF CHANGE”.

> “_The God-knowing man describes his spiritual experiences, not to convince unbelievers, but for the edification and mutual satisfaction of believers._” (<a id="a100_155"></a>[UB 1:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p6_6))

What a beautiful description of the feelings that overwhelm all of us who walk after the Will of the Father.

> “_The Master displayed great wisdom and manifested perfect fairness in all of his dealings with his apostles and with all of his disciples. Jesus was truly a master of men; he exercised great influence over his fellow men because of the combined charm and force of his personality. There was a subtle commanding influence in his rugged, nomadic, and homeless life. There was intellectual attractiveness and spiritual drawing power in his authoritative manner of teaching, in his lucid logic, his strength of reasoning, his sagacious insight, his alertness of mind, his matchless poise, and his sublime tolerance. He was simple, manly, honest, and fearless. With all of this physical and intellectual influence manifest in the Master’s presence, there were also all those spiritual charms of being which have become associated with his personality—patience, tenderness, meekness, gentleness, and humility._” (<a id="a104_910"></a>[UB 141:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p3_4))

Nothing to add to the descriptions of the Master, only to regret that the evolutionary religions linked to Christianity in the world have described the Master as a poor, skinny, malnourished, suffering and almost as dispossessed of all attributes of the world, and not as he was indeed, just as they describe so many times in this revelation, and just as they do in the quote above. But what led me to bring her to this work is because of the wonderful appeal that the spiritual charms of being achieve. They tell us that they have been associated through time with their personality and they are; patience, tenderness, meekness and humility. Therefore we, beings endowed with personality, have all the possibilities, following the Master's example, to achieve these charms, and by achieving them, with the example that we will set, we will be, without even thinking about it, humbly perhaps illuminating the path for so many millions. of beings that today wander through the darkness in our world.
