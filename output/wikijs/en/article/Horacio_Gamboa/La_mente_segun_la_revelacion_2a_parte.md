## Cosmic Mind

The origin of the cosmic minds are the 7 Master Spirits. They are the intellectual powerhouse of the Grand Universe. I have already clarified previously that the intellect is also donated by the Infinite Spirit, through the Master Spirits and the Divine Ministers.

On worlds like Urantia, the Master Spirits have no direct influence on the human races, but dominate the basic mental reactions of creatures as they are the sources of intellectual and spiritual potentials, which have been specialized in the local universes to function in the life of those individuals who inhabit the evolutionary worlds of time and space.

The cosmic mind also explains the similarity and great attraction of human minds. Not only are like spirits attracted; minds alike are brotherly to each other. There are some human minds that work in inexplicable agreement.

In the associations of personalities of the cosmic mind there is a quality that the revelators call “THE REACTION TO REALITY.” It is this universal cosmic endowment of willed creatures that saves them from being helpless victims of the a priori assumptions of science, philosophy, and religion. This reality sensitivity of the cosmic mind responds to certain phases of reality in the same way that matter and energy respond to gravity. It is more correct to say that these supermaterial realities respond to the mind of the cosmos.

> _The cosmic mind unfailingly responds (recognizes response) on three levels of universe reality. These responses are self-evident to clear-reasoning and deep-thinking minds. These levels of reality are:_
> 
> _1. *Causation—*the reality domain of the physical senses, the scientific realms of logical uniformity, the differentiation of the factual and the nonfactual, reflective conclusions based on cosmic response. This is the mathematical form of the cosmic discrimination._
> _2. *Duty—*the reality domain of morals in the philosophic realm, the arena of reason, the recognition of relative right and wrong. This is the judicial form of the cosmic discrimination._
> _3. *Worship—*the spiritual domain of the reality of religious experience, the personal realization of divine fellowship, the recognition of spirit values, the assurance of eternal survival, the ascent from the status of servants of God to the joy and liberty of the sons of God. This is the highest insight of the cosmic mind, the reverential and worshipful form of the cosmic discrimination._ (<a id="a51_398"></a>[UB 16:6.5-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_5))

These 3 endowments of mind to the local universes, the 3 scientific, moral and spiritual discernments, are innate in the cosmic mind that endows all volitional creatures. The experience of living never stops developing these 3 cosmic intuitions; they constitute the SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS OF REFLECTIVE THOUGHT. But it is sad to see that here on Urantia so few people rejoice in cultivating these courageous and independent cosmic thinking qualities. In the mind endowments donated to the local universes, these 3 discernments of the cosmic mind are the premises that enable man to function as a rational and self-conscious personality in the realms of science, philosophy, and religion. These 3 infinite realities are recognized through a cosmic technique of self-revelation: matter-energy is known through the mathematical logic of the senses; the mind-reason intuitively knows its moral duty; spirit-faith (worship) is the religion of the reality of spiritual experience. <a id="a53_971"></a>[UB 16:6.9-10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_9)

These 3 factors of reflective thought can be coordinated in personality development or become disproportionate and unrelated in their respective functions. But if they are unified they produce a strong character, which consists in the correlation of a factual science, a moral philosophy and a genuine religious experience. These 3 cosmic intuitions give objective validity (reality) to the human experience in and with things, meanings and values.

It is the purpose of teaching to sharpen these innate endowments of the human mind; of civilization, express them; from life experience, understand them; of religion, to ennoble them; and personality to unify them. <a id="a57_215"></a>[UB 16:6.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_11)

The cosmic mind is the sevenfold diversified mind of space and time, each phase of which is ministered to by each of the Seven Master Spirits of one of the 7 super universes. The cosmic mind comprises all levels of finite mind and is experientially co-ordinated with the evolutionary deity levels of Supreme Mind and transcendentally with the existential levels of absolute mind: the direct circuits of the Conjoint Actor. On Paradise, the mind is absolute; in Havona, it is absonite; in Orvonton, it is finite. Mind always connotes the presence-activity of the living ministry as well as various energy systems, and this is true on all levels and in all types of mind. But beyond the cosmic mind it becomes more and more difficult to describe the relations of the mind with non-spiritual energy. The havonera mind is subabsolute but superevolutionary; Being existential-experiential, it is closer to the absonite than to any concept revealed to you. The paradise mind is beyond human comprehension; it is existential, not spatial, and not temporal. Yet all these levels of mind are under the aegis of the universal presence of the Conjoint Actor, the mental gravity pull of the God of mind on Paradise. <a id="a59_1204"></a>[UB 42:10.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p10_6)

## Premind

The mind of the Eternal Son is like that of the Father, but unlike any other mind in the universe, and with the mind of the Father it is ancestral in relation to the various and vast minds of the Conjoint Actor. The mind of the Father and the Son, that intellect which is ancestral to the Absolute Mind of the Third Source and Center, is perhaps best illustrated in the Premind of the Thought Adjuster because, although these fragments of the Father are completely off the circuits of the mind of the Conjoint Actor, have some form of Premind; they know and are known, they enjoy the equivalent of human thought. <a id="a63_613"></a>[UB 6:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p6_3)

We will see how this continues, because in Paper 107, in <a id="a65_57"></a>[UB 107:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p5_1), the title of point 5 is: ADJUSTERS HAVE MIND. And so it is, and they say: _Evolutionary mortals are prone to look upon mind as a cosmic mediation between spirit and matter, for that is indeed the principal ministry of mind as discernible by you. Hence it is quite difficult for humans to perceive that Thought Adjusters have minds, for Adjusters are fragmentations of God on an absolute level of reality which is not only prepersonal but also prior to all energy and spirit divergence. On a monistic level antecedent to energy and spirit differentiation there could be no mediating function of mind, for there are no divergencies to be mediated._

Adjusters plan, work, love, communicate with each other. The Revealers tell us that little is known of its purpose, nature, and contact. They tell us that they have to have some kind of mind, otherwise they could never be personalized. At this point, the mind of the Adjusters, they say, must be like that of various other orders of prepersonal entities, also originating from the First Source and Center, unrevealed on Urantia, but all have minds. These entities unite with non-mortal and other non-evolutionary beings, but who have developed a capacity for fusion with those Deity fragments.

> _When a Thought Adjuster is fused with the evolving immortal morontia soul of the surviving human, the mind of the Adjuster can only be identified as persisting apart from the creature’s mind until the ascending mortal attains spirit levels of universe progression._ (<a id="a69_270"></a>[UB 107:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p5_5))

As we can see, there are other beings totally unknown to us, even non-evolutionary ones, but that merge at some point with fragments of the Deity. And as the cited point says, the mind of the Adjuster and the mind of the human ascendant act separately until the full spiritualization of the ascendant. Here we are also told that the mind of the Adjuster is like the mind endowment of the Universal Father and the Eternal Son, which is ancestral to the minds of the Conjoint Actor.

## The Human Mind and Thought Adjusters

Material (physical) evolution provided us with the vital machine for this life: our body. The Father donated to us the highest spiritual reality of the universes: the Thought Adjuster. But in our hands, subject to our free will, we have been given our mind, and it is in it that we will live or die. It is within her and with her that we make those moral decisions that allow us to resemble our Adjuster, who is our Father. The mortal mind is a temporary system of intellect loaned to men for their use in this material life, and according to how we use the mind, we are accepting or rejecting the potential of eternal existence. The mind is practically all we have of universal reality that is subject to our will, and the soul, the morontia self, will faithfully illustrate the harvest of temporal decisions that the mortal self makes. And pay attention to this: the human consciousness rests gently on the electrochemical mechanism that is below, and delicately touches the spirit-morontia energy system that is above. During human life we are never fully aware of these two systems; therefore we have to work on the mind, of which we are aware. And be careful with this: it is not so much what the mind understands, but rather what it wants to understand, that ensures survival; it is not so much how the mind is but how the mind is trying to be that constitutes spiritual identification. It is not as important that you are aware of God as it is that you yearn for God. What you are today is not as important as what you become day by day and in eternity. The mind is the cosmic instrument where the human will can play the discord of destruction, or upon which the will itself can play the exquisite melodies of identification with God and eternal survival. The mortal mind can be distorted, twisted and made evil and ugly by the sinful machination of an evil human will, AND EYE here: SELF-GRATIFYING. Likewise this mind can become noble, beautiful, true and good. Great indeed if it agrees with the will illuminated by the spirit of a human being who knows God.

The evolutionary mind is only stable and reliable when it manifests itself in the two extremes of the cosmic intelligentsia; the totally mechanical end and the other totally spiritualized. In between these two extremes is that huge group of evolving and ascending minds whose stability and tranquility depend on choice, personality, and identification with spirit.

We do not passively surrender our will to Adjusters, rather we choose to actively, positively, and cooperatively follow the Adjuster's guidance, when and as such guidance consciously differs from the desires and impulses of the natural mortal mind.

Adjusters manipulate but never dominate the mind of man against his will, for them the human will is supreme. They so respect and reverence the human will that they work for the achievement of their spiritual goals of thought adjustment and character transformation in the almost limitless arena of the evolving human intellect. Let us not forget that the intellect is the domain of the Conjoint Actor, therefore it is also his endowment for the evolutionary races of time and space.

> _Mind is your ship, the Adjuster is your pilot, the human will is captain. The master of the mortal vessel should have the wisdom to trust the divine pilot to guide the ascending soul into the morontia harbors of eternal survival. Only by selfishness, slothfulness, and sinfulness can the will of man reject the guidance of such a loving pilot and eventually wreck the mortal career upon the evil shoals of rejected mercy and upon the rocks of embraced sin. With your consent, this faithful pilot will safely carry you across the barriers of time and the handicaps of space to the very source of the divine mind and on beyond, even to the Paradise Father of Adjusters._ (<a id="a83_673"></a>[UB 111:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_9))

Throughout the length and breadth of the mental functions of the cosmic intelligence, the mind dominates the parts of the intellectual function. (Let us not forget that the intellect also proceeds, like the mind, from the Infinite Spirit)

The mind, in its essence, is a functional unit (for me this is the best description of the mind) It never stops manifesting this constitutive unit, despite the difficulties that a straying self puts on it. Unity of mind invariably seeks coordination of spirit at all levels of its association with willed selves and ascension prerogatives.

The material mind of man is the cosmic loom carrying the morontia fabric into which the indwelling Adjuster weaves the spirit designs of a universal character of enduring value and divine meaning; a surviving soul from ultimate fate and endless race, a potential finisher.

The human personality is identified with mind and spirit, functionally linked by life in a material body. This functional link of mind and spirit does not result in a combination of the qualities or attributes of mind and spirit, but rather gives an entirely new, original and unique universal value of potentially eternal duration: THE SOUL.

There are three factors in the evolutionary creation of such an immortal soul, these antecedents of the human morontia soul are:

1. The human mind and all cosmic influences antecedent to it, and related to it.
2. The divine spirit that indwells these human minds and all the potentials inherent in such a fragment of absolute spirituality, together with all the associated spiritual influences and factors in human life.
3. The relationship between the material mind and the divine spirit connotes a value and carries a meaning that is not found in any of the factors contributing to that association. The reality of this unique relationship is neither material nor spiritual but morontia. IT IS THE SOUL.

Midwayers refer to this evolutionary soul as midway mind, to distinguish it from the material or lower mind, and the cosmic or higher mind. This intermediate mind, we are told, is a morontia phenomenon, since it exists between the material and the spiritual.

The potential for morontia evolution is inherent in the two universal impulses of mind: the impulse of the finite mind of the creature to know God and attain the divinity of the Creator, and the impulse of the infinite mind of the Creator to know man. and attain the experience of the creature.

In essence, it should be clear to us that our Adjusters, from their arrival in the human mind, (<a id="a103_96"></a>[UB 133:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p6_5)) at the age between 5 and 6 years old, begin to work on the soul, at that moment the soul is born . And the soul, that intermediate and morontia mind, is what we will take from here, and it is definitely in our souls where the Creator knows us and reaches our experience, and where we begin our evolution towards spirituality.

For now we are here.

Thus, the material and mortal reality of the self transcends the temporal limitations of the physical life machine and reaches a new expression and a new identification in the evolving vehicle for the continuity of the self: THE MORONTIAL AND IMMORTAL SOUL (<a id="a107_258"></a>[UB 111:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p2_10) )

The errors of the mortal mind, the mistakes of the human conduct retard the evolution of the soul, although said morontia process is not stopped when it is initiated by the indwelling Adjuster with the consent of the human will. But the same will and prior to mortal death, has the power to decide to reject survival. Even after death and during ascension, prior to Adjuster fusion, you can reject survival.

## End of Mind

At the moment of death, the functional identity associated with the human personality is interrupted through the cessation of vital movement. The human personality, although it transcends its constituent parts, depends on them for its functional identity. The interruption of life destroys the physical brain schemata for mental endowment, and the destruction of the mind ends mental awareness. The consciousness of that creature cannot later appear again until a cosmic situation has been established that allows that same human personality to function again in relation to living energy. <a id="a113_590"></a>[UB 112:5.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_14)

Here they tell us with absolute clarity that, after we die here, our organismal apparatus, the mind, that functional unit that was described to us earlier, stops working, that is, it only serves us in this life. And it is also clear that, as long as there is no new identity (morontia in this case), we will not have consciousness or personality again.
