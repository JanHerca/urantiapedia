_Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be your name, come to your kingdom, your will be done Lord here on earth as it is in heaven..._

This prayer, which is the one that the Master Jesus taught his brothers, and that I at least pray since I can remember and every day, began to haunt me inside my head before I found _The Urantia Book_. “Thy will be done here on earth as it is in heaven” is a very powerful concept that in the readings of the L.U. I have discerned more and more deeply.

By understanding what is revealed to us about the administration of the universes, about the conformation of their transformations from power to force until reaching matter, due to the slowing down of the different powers, electrical, electronic, chemical, gravitational processes, the different forces of gravity, force, energy and power, the breathing of space, space itself and its movements, space and time, etc., and the different Sons of God that act in them (here I only refer to what has to do with the different forms of matter), it is nothing other than our lives themselves and all the life of all the worlds, planets and systems of the vast domain of the seven superuniverses and the Master Universe in each of its stages of formation and even beyond, to the infinity of infinities, even in the eternal of eternity, is nothing other than the WILL OF THE FATHER, our Father.

The Sons of God, the Sons of the Sons of God, even ourselves, beings endowed with will, are nothing other than the will of the Father. When I observe the birds, the insects, the permanent beating of the waves of the sea, the wind, everything that happens around us, the nights upholstered with stars, the rain, are nothing other than said powerful and sovereign of our Father.

Today's human beings, heads bowed behind impossible goals, bombarded by ruthless marketing, cannot observe, stop to listen to the flight of a fly, not even time allows them to raise their children, even if that happens it is also the will of the Father.

How can the Father allow this wickedness? The day will come when they will realize it, and it will be the necessary contrast, a marvelous contrast, that will make man see reason and correct his mistakes, but it will continue to be the will of the Father. We live in school worlds, even stronger is everything that has to do with the creation of life. Let's look at the wonder of reproduction on this planet in the different species that make it up, how we are evolving, slowly one step after another, always towards better and higher destinations, although groups that dream of looking at the past persist, everything happens forward.

We are going forward spinning in space in our rotation movement of the planet at 1,675 km/h, and we are traveling around the sun at 107,000 km/h. Always forward, evolution is forward. It can be desperately slow at times, as well as the hope of better times and things, and that is the will of the Father.

With all this information, it is very poor to be able to assure that we are the product of an explosion, of a coincidence, and to continue denying the creation of a design by a great Designer, whose will is visible at every breath, at every moment of our short lives. It is true that few of us are involved in this, but it is our duty to be alert to make those who only look and do not see the grandeur of the Father's will see that, thanks to it, through it and in it, things happen to us. and life itself.

Nothing happens outside of the will of the Father. Our short life has no other purpose than to recognize God our Father, to try to be better people, to be upright, to recognize our affiliation with God, which is what elevates us from the category of subjects to Children of God, and wow, what a tremendous difference.

Let us ultimately be those lights that illuminate the path of darkness in this world, the lights that the Master himself will show us to be, because many millions of human beings today, now at this minute, all they want is to believe in the truth, the beauty and goodness of the WILL OF THE FATHER.
