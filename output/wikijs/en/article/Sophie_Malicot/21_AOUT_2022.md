Balloons with the words “Happy Birthday” written on them and a sign saying “Michael” visible to all guided the participants to the August 24 party. There were 11 of us readers, from different groups. We met in the living room because the heat, which was still very present, did not allow us to stay outside. After a welcome coffee for the reunion, the opening words were addressed to the participants and their Thought Adjusters, as well as Jesus. Then we began the study proposed by Sophie, addressing the multiple situations in which Jesus came to bestow himself. From Emmanuel's recommendations to the genealogy of Jesus, from the socio-political situation to the evolutions of the Hebrew concept of Yahweh, we approached this space-time, with the difficulties of measuring the differences in morals, customs, situations and mentalities. A good exercise to understand the extent of the work of the Supreme, and its unwavering line of progression more perceptible on a scale of 2500 years.

The midday meal began with the sharing of wine and bread, in the approach of the spirit that the Master proposed, that is to say in connection with him but without the ritualistic constraints that enclose the breath of the Spirit of Grace and Truth. On the contrary, free words flowed, emphasizing the importance of combining the unity of fraternity with the richness of the plural differences carried by the uniqueness of each. A word was emphasized on the balance between these two contributions of the Master: the Spirit of Grace, which gives its gentleness and its temperance, and the Spirit of Truth whose intransigence is not to be discussed. Then sharing of what each had brought in addition to what the hosts had prepared. Result: we had enough to eat for 3 days!

The afternoon saw the study continue and close. Then the discussions took off to share with each other in great fraternity. Some difficulty in leaving, while ensuring that these meetings are essential, vital in the inner strength that they stimulate. Conclusion: see you next year.

Thank you to everyone, that is to say to the visible and invisible participants.

And thank you to our Master Jesus.
