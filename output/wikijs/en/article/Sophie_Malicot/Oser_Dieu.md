Dare God, in ordinary life. Without departure but presence. Penetrate the Divine Life; let yourself be penetrated. Touch Christic Love — let yourself be set ablaze. Love so immeasurably overwhelming that the upheaval is barely bearable. He loves everything, overturns everything, armor, feelings, attractions and aversions: nothing stands up to it and no reference remains; poor references! This Love transgresses, pierces and transfigures.

Absolute Love, it dominates, penetrates to the depths of the soul, of being, of self and non-self in Unique unity. With a breath it encompasses, provokes and engenders a burning pain: interior, intense, indescribable, ineffable. Without circumference, reaches everything beyond. And we let go with a full gesture because nothing holds. Transcend the construct so meticulously erected. Nothing keeps: from a quarrel is dismissed.

So, there remains for Him. This Love, without setbacks, without escape, cultivated to escape the unstoppable Divine Life without compromise.

How to sustain the Supreme Incandescence? The soul suffocates, the heart palpitates, the being abdicates, not from greatness but from the miseries to which it debases itself - shamefully. There, the Call is so powerful, without manner or matter. The Call to the Unconditional.

And the possibility of saying Yes.
