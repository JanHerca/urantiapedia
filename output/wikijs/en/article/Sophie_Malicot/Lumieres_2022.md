A successful bet to be able to meet again, after all this time of restricted meetings! We were 12 happy future finalists, learning from here below teamwork and the art of human relations. There were some rough edges to point the tip of their noses but we overcame them all with joy.

After the joy of the reunion on Thursday evening, the announced program concerned “***the mind, the personality and the soul with a view to talking about it around us***”.

Friday morning we started with booklet 36, chapter 5, description of the 7 Adjutant Spirits-Minds. Study of the divine circuits which allow us to progressively spiritualize our minds. The continuity of the Adjutant Spirits-Minds continued with the sharing of my research questioning the affiliation of each person to a particular Divine Spirit, in connection with the 7 Master Spirits and their spiritual donations up to the Adjutant Spirits-Minds, integrating the mortals that we are. Attached is a calligraphy illustrating this research.

Friday evening the evening gathered around Georges and his unfailing oratory skills.

Then the study focused on booklet 111 “***The Adjuster and the Soul***” on Saturday morning. Questions about the differences between the self, the mind and the personality continued to accompany us. The importance of the choice to move towards the tal in order to move from our primary animal behaviors to an opening towards worship and wisdom. Many questions and discussions were made around the differences between the self, identity, the soul, the personality. These complex themes could be the subject of another national meeting.

Friday afternoon, the Father's will was regularly emphasized, with its strengths but also its difficulties. We discussed what the inner “feeling” is, differentiated from perceptions.

Saturday afternoon was devoted to the General Assembly, accounts and voting in order to stay grounded in our world of unavoidable legislation. A report was made on the international meeting which had just taken place in Spain, and that of 2025 which will take place in France. Call to all goodwill to prepare it. 3 years are not too many. I personally proposed the theme of the distributivity of the Deity.

Saturday evening propelled us into the future thanks to the 2010 film “Nosso Lar”, taken from the book of the same name written in 1944 and concerning what could be the first World of Houses, through management of oneself, others and relationships according to spiritual ethics.

Sunday morning resumed the study with our Adjuster and the soul. Then a round table for the synthesis of this shared time. Time a little out of ordinary time, which reinflated the confidence in the faith which animates us all, time having sown and seen the seeds of a hoped-for fraternity bloom. The good will of each one allowed the germination of the fruits of the Spirit.

Let us not forget our external hosts - the welcome was successful on the part of the Lumières team, a big thank you to all of them - nor especially our internal hosts; we were much more numerous than appearances suggested, thanks to our Adjusters, angels and all those who rejoiced and worked with us to grow the Kingdom of Heaven.

After separations that have stretched out to preserve this precious time of spiritual joy, we will meet again next year. Prepare your calendars so that we can meet up in even greater numbers.

***Nosso Lar (Our Home) Life after death is the main theme of this story.***
