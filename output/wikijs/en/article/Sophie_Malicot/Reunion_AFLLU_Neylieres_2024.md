Sunday evening. Night has settled on the earth and fills space; the celestial vault opens its veil of magnificence. I look at the starry sky, absorbed in it. Over there, somewhere, Jerusem and its inhabitants... They must have been enriched by a message like this: "Transmission of activities related to the Fifth Revelation on the planet 606 Urantia.

A group of 15 mortals gathered in the name of Revelation, these last few days in central France. A charming place, full of greenery and flowers; some aromatic herbs for those who like to maintain their health through plants.

They were all in good faith and full of heavenly joy to be reunited. What a pleasure we had to see the fraternity advance!

One of them, named Jean Pierre Wymann, presented a remarkable work in three parts. The first on the circuits of the Seven Adjutant Spirits of our Divine Mother. Excellent in-depth study, very rich and exhaustive which, we hope, can be published for the benefit of all. This gave rise to many discussions and it is our greatest joy to see the passion they put into their very personalized points of view.

The second presentation concerned prayer, having understood of course that the Seven Adjutant Spirits lead to prayer and the adoration of our Universal Father. Again their exchanges were intense.

They worked on another presentation given by a mortal named Georges Michelson Dupont. It was the last part of a triptych devoted to the diffusion of our Unique source of existence: “I AM”.

They devoted an evening to addressing what they called “the Vanites and the Nodites”. By this, understand the torments of their time between luminous forces and dark forces. This presentation, made by Georges Donnadieu (a particular name!) raised a wave of disputes between the presenter, wanting to inform his people of the evils of the world, and the listeners - already aware of these perversities and preferring to focus on the advancement of the Light. However, to summarize their subsequent exchanges in spiritual language, they confronted the positions of those who opt for eternal life and those who - for the moment - reject it. These debates focused on the essential place of spiritual choice.

They celebrated the dinner of remembrance as Jesus proposed to them. Sharing bread and wine - for the story, their bottle was called “The Unique” a great moment where many of us accompanied them. The Spirit of grace and Truth our Master Michael of Nebadon shook some. They then shared around the table how their faith is unique and it was extremely beautiful to see these primary mortals open their souls to sharing. A strong testimony showing that the mind is indeed subordinate to the higher spirit, because none have used these disastrous psychic stratagems that they call defense mechanisms to hide the profound truth of being and the soul.

Their last morning emptied the tables: the $2 / 3$ left, preoccupied by a political vote to be made - they must give Caesar his due and exercise their role as temporal citizens. The five remaining mortals found the space very sparsely inhabited but - around the third presentation of the first mortal mentioned - the exchanges continued in great fraternity and openness, to our great joy, around the four creatures controlling the goniometric level, of Salvington.

The group then completely dispersed to return to their respective homes.

We note their tenacity in studying themes which at first seem very far removed from their daily concerns, but they gradually manage to see the interest and make the link between these revelations and their ordinary lives.

We also note that their sincerity in sharing and their desire to advance the Kingdom of Heaven is real despite their primary level: there are still difficulties in listening, they still interrupt each other, always speak aside during a presentation and sometimes make inappropriate remarks. Despite this, and not being able to demand any perfection from them, their fraternal quest cannot be called into question; if we take into account what they want to do and be more than what they do and are, the result is very encouraging. We encourage the mental and spiritual circuits to stimulate more other mortals, so that their small group can grow, so that other participants come to swell the ranks of fraternal sharing and advance the Kingdom, thanks to the divine knowledge offered to them by the Fifth Revelation.»....

I stay for a long time admiring the stars, the sky and its deep black where so many invisible forces are at play. The dance of the stars is not perceptible but their roundness evokes it so beautifully. Everything is even more magnificent with this perception of the future and spiritual destiny.

And there, in this garden filled with the lights of the night, I renewed my choice for heavenly citizenship.
