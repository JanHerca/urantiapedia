The women and men of those times had some suspicion of His existence and His Greatness.
He was born in Judea and was called Jesus, the Galilean of Nazareth.
Everywhere he went he embodied the Father's Love.
Only once did I see him pass by and all my life this God-Man spoke to me.
He is for ages to come the surest and most faithful Friend in the kingdom of men.
Two thousand years after His earthly passage, millions of men and women from all over are questioning, wondering and searching!
When the Master passed,
The greatest love story has been written,
When the Master passed,
He forever inscribed the Truth in my memory.
