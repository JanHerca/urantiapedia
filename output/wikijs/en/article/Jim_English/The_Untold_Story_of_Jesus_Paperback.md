_By Jim English, California, United States_

_Editor’s Note: The paperback version of_ The Untold Story of Jesus _would not exist without the tireless expertise of Jim English, a longtime reader and volunteer who donated countless hours of editing and book formatting to this project. Our collective thanks to Jim for his commitment to seeing this project through, with stellar results._

The first edition of _The Untold Story of Jesus_ was published in 2019 by Urantia Press, the imprint label of Urantia Foundation. This professionally designed coffee-table book became a best-selling secondary work, thanks to the exquisite and often-original artwork, sidebar elements, and captivating narrative of the Jesus we all know and love. In 2020 a second printing included improved maps and additional paintings.

As time passed, the team paused to consider an important lesson in the world of book publishing—new often equates to higher sales. But what could possibly be “new and improved” in such a beautiful book?

The quality content is well established. But, quite frankly, it’s large, and hardly a book to carry around or read in a coffee shop, so we set about redesigning it into a more portable paperback edition.

It is not your standard paperback. We designed it to be large enough to fit all the content (a bit over 7" x 9½" x ¾" at 400 pages) and it features high-quality art paper, so the paintings still shine. The redesign allowed us to add some additional paintings. Most importantly, we were able to include some of the Master's well-loved stories and teachings that just wouldn't fit before.

The cover was redesigned as well, and it looks lovely with a laminated gloss gatefold. Slimmer, lighter, yet never compromising on the artistic beauty of the original hardback, this new version will fit into your backpack, handbag, mailbox, and bookshelves. It will also be better suited for placement in neighborhood “little libraries,” hospitals, hospices, libraries, hotels, cruise ships, youth hostels—or to give as a personal gift to someone you love.
