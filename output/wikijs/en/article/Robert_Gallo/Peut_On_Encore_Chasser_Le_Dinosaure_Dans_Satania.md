My adolescence was marked by the novels of Henri Vernes and his hero Bob Morane and I have always kept a fond memory of his novel “_The Dinosaur Hunters_” whose characters were able to go back to the Jurassic period. It took decades for Hollywood cinema to take hold of this theme with the famous Spielberg film “_Jurassic Park_” and its sequels which worked to make these animals an almost banal quasi-reality. On Urantia, the large dinosaurs disappeared more than 60 million years ago and it is impossible to go back in time to find them; but in the Satania system there are still 381 worlds which have not reached the stage of inhabited world and which are in various states of animal evolution.

So! Would it be possible that one of these worlds still contains monstrous animals comparable to our dinosaurs and where it would be possible to rub shoulders with them, as long as we can be teleported? To answer this question we will need to have an idea of the time remaining before the registration of the thousandth and last world of Satania in order to be able to estimate the delay of these worlds.

To have an idea of the time remaining, we would need to have an indication of the average time separating two world registrations.

As long as we know how to observe and deduce, The Urantia Book gives an answer...

We know (<a id="a46_9"></a>[UB 62:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p7_7)) that our world has been considered a “skilled world” for 993,408 years before 1934; and as such Urantia has become the first inhabited world of Satania.

We also know that in 1934 there were 619 inhabited worlds in Satania, an increase of 13 in the space of 993,408 years.

We can therefore deduce that on this sequence of 13 imprints, the average time between two numberings is 76416 years (993408 / 13); and perhaps less if the last numbering (619) is fork before 1934.

This average delay between two planetary emergences of human beings is sufficiently important for it to be a rare event and to each time arouse great joy on Jerusem, on Edentia and even on Salvington (<a id="a52_201"></a>[UB 62:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p7_3)).

If this information about the average time to wait until the emergence of the next inhabited world is a reflection of the general average in Satania for the future; then we can conjecture that the 1000th world of Satania could emerge in approximately 29 million years (76000 x 381).

Therefore, the most backward world of Salania (the one that will be registered last) would currently be 29 million years before the advent of a recognized human.

To get an idea of the state of this world, let's see what ours was like 29 million years ago.

> “*30,000,000* years ago the modern types of mammals began to make their appearance. Formerly the mammals had lived for the greater part in the hills, being of the mountainous types; *suddenly* there began the evolution of the plains or hoofed type, the grazing species, as differentiated from the clawed flesh eaters. These grazers sprang from an undifferentiated ancestor having five toes and forty-four teeth, which perished before the end of the age. Toe evolution did not progress beyond the three-toed stage throughout this period.” (<a id="a60_541"></a>[UB 61:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p2_8))

We see that in those distant times, the era of the dinosaurs was a distant past and our world was already entering the era of higher animals.

### Conclusion

If the thousandth world of Salania presents an evolutionary system of its species roughly (even with a gap of several million years) similar to the number, then it is very unlikely that it could still shelter large Eransitory animals similar to our dinosaurs.

Therefore, it would seem that it is already too late to go on a dinosaur hunt or safari in a Salania world.
