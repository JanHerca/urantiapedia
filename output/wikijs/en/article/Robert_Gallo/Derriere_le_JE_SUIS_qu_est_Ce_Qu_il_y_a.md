Preamble: This short analysis is inspired by reflections raised during a group reading and has the sole objective of contributing to the understanding of the greatest of mysteries: The I AM.

In reference to the Origin of the Universe, The Book explains in <a id="a41_65"></a>[UB 105:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/105#p1_6) “Infinity is filled by the Infinite; the Infinite encompasses infinity. It is the hypothetical static moment of eternity_...... However, even in this hypothetical situation, we must admit that the possibility of autonomous will exists”

To solve this problem the philosophers of the universe attribute to the Universal Father operating as the infinite, eternal and absolute I AM; the absolute primordial causality in infinity.

We know that it is the self-metamorphosis of the I AM which is at the origin of our universe and that this self-metamorphosis could only have been the result of a decision, of a will.

It is specified in <a id="a47_19"></a>[UB 105:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/105#p2_2) “By following chronologically the description of the origins of reality, it is necessary to admit a supposed theoretical instant, of <ins>first</ins> volitional expression and <ins>first</ins> reactive repercussion within the I AM” Since what is above is like what is below and vice versa; then what is evident below can be so for above.

Here below, every voluntary decision is the consequence of an understanding of the situation or of a conviction or of a pre-established plan.

Therefore, in all similarity, the voluntary decision of the I AM cannot be the result of chance and without causes; it must also and necessarily depend on a PLAN. OR any plan can only be the result of a considered and prior will.

BUT according to the revelators (<a id="a53_33"></a>[UB 105:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/105#p2_2) ) the I AM has just expressed its **first** volitional expression!

At this point, the question that immediately comes to mind is “What is this prior will that conceptualized the plan?” Even before the I AM expresses its **first** volitional expression. Refusing all conjecture by leaving it to the reader to reflect on it, I prefer to remain on the purity of the questioning of the head:

**What is behind the “I AM”?**
