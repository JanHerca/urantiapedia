Jesus was born at noon on August 21, 7 BC (7 BC), and therefore on August 21, 2021 we will celebrate his 2027th birthday on Urantia. Furthermore, it is written in paper 93:2.1:

> “It was 1,973 years before the birth of Jesus that Machiventa was bestowed upon the human races of Urantia. His coming was unspectacular; his materialization was not witnessed by human eyes. He was first observed by mortal man on that eventful day when he entered the tent of Amdon, a Chaldean herder of Sumerian extraction. And the proclamation of his mission was embodied in the simple statement which he made to this shepherd, “I am Melchizedek, priest of El Elyon, the Most High, the one and only God.”” (<a id="a39_511"></a>[UB 93:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p2_1))

Consequently, the addition of these two numbers (2,027 and 1973) will give, as of August 21, 2021, the time elapsed since the effusion of Machiventa, i.e. exactly 4000 years!

This vintage is sufficiently exceptional for the Urantia movement as a whole to manifest this event.

Let us not forget the enormous importance of Machiventa's action on our world. Indeed, after having been the sage of Salem and inspired the third revelation, he was attached to the service of Urantia on Jerusem as one of the twenty-four administrators. He is currently Michael's personal ambassador on Jerusem with the title of “Vicegerent Planetary Prince of Urantia”.

It would be very appropriate to activate our global authorities to make this the global event of the year.
