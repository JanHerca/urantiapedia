The numerology of the _Urantia Book_ is faithful and constant with regard to certain numbers which incontestably serve as the basis for the cosmic edifice on both the material and spiritual planes. Everything seems to be built around the numbers 3, 7, 10 (7+3) and multiples of the latter.

In this regard the number 100 appears to conceal a particular purpose by probably being the constant factor of a universal progression. To be convinced of this, let us observe the perfectly regular construction of a Superuniverse where:

- 100 systems make a constellation,
- 100 constellations make a local universe,
- 100 local universes make a minor universe,
- 100 minor universes make one major universe.

This construction seems astonishing, the systematic superposition of the same number seems to respond to an order of things which escapes us.

Let us then suppose that this number is the vector of a certain universality and look for another area where such a progression could apply. As far as I am concerned, I looked towards a progression that is dear to us: The one that must lead us from our planet of origin to Paradise.

What do we observe?

That lives fit together like Russian dolls in the manner of systems with constellations, constellations with local universes etc... Indeed, man is born from the mother, the soul is born from the earthly life of man then merges into morontia life and then into spiritual life.

What do we see?

That the first phase of life (gestation in the mother's womb) lasts 9 months. That the second phase of life (life on our planet) lasts on average 75 years, that is to say 900 months!! (75 x 12)... Re the factor 100.

Let’s unroll the thread and continue the progression:

Morontia life = 100 times terrestrial life or 7500 years.
Spiritual life = 100 times morontia life or 750,000 years.
Consequently, the normal duration to reach Paradise would be 757,575 years (750,000 + 7,500 + 75) at least for those resurrected on the 3rd day, for the others it would be appropriate to add the time between earthly death and resurrection on Maisonnia 1.

I wanted to deliver this theory to the sagacity of each and every one...
