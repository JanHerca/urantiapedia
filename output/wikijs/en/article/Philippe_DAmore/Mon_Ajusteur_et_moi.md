Like all readers of the Urantia Book, I try without pretension to get closer to my thought adjuster, to get in touch with him, for that I have my method, I don't know if I succeed but I want to believe in it.

I seek it through love, because love sanctifies life, it lets us glimpse what the sacred is. It puts us on a **promontory** to consider the world and others with a celestial gaze, it is also the opportunity for a profound spiritual awakening. So when we love, all the usual boundaries fall, dissolve, and suddenly we no longer feel alone in the universe.

Love is our gateway to the divine.

The distinction between human and spiritual is made by human beings themselves, but in fact there is no separation, they are nested within each other, we are not human beings having a spiritual experience, we are human beings having a human experience.

**The real moments, or rather** the real moments I should say, that we can have with our adjuster, having a sacred character, occur when we feel like we are part of a whole, with ourselves, our environment, another person. Throughout the day, spot the sacred moments and daily miracles; the big hug that your child has just given you for no particular reason, the beauty of a flower that catches your attention, the flight of a bird in the blue sky, a book, a message that we needed to hear, a song, in short a tribute to each day that passes.

What I seek to do with my adjuster, if I can achieve it, is to have full awareness of the things that transform ordinary tasks into extraordinary experiences, let us listen to our adjuster, our inner guide, let ourselves be guided by our inner voice. Let us imagine ourselves connected to a powerful source of wisdom and truth, let us ask it to send us messages that we need to hear.

Let us pay close attention to everything that comes to our minds, and why not write down what we “hear”. Let him speak, let us not stop to analyze and understand what has come to our minds. Wait until it is finished to dwell on what has been “sent” to us; and we would be amazed at the wisdom that our adjuster will have instilled in us.

You have to be able to go within yourself, which allows you to come out in a much stronger way, to enter into silence.

The power of silence lies in its emptiness, silence is a receptive space. It creates a sacred void, an opening through which one is able to receive truth, revelation, strength, through silence one transcends words and comes into contact with a world where words are useless. One transcends form and comes into contact with that which is formless. One fills oneself with a soothing knowledge. Silence is not the same as prayer, prayer is a way of directing our emotions, sensations and thoughts, of concentrating on them and projecting them towards a source.

Silence is about listening, receiving, being. Through prayer we seek to reach the source and enter into communication with it. Silence allows us to hear the source from within ourselves, to become one with it.

Prayer is outward oriented, while through silence we are “the receiver.”

I believe that God, the cosmic intelligence, the supreme energy exists to be prayed to, called upon, thanked, or appreciated. But I believe that communication with our thought adjuster works like a radio transmitter, we can receive messages as well as send them ourselves. If we do not feel as close to our Adjuster as we would like, and yet we have prayed as hard as we can, perhaps we should pray a little less and listen a little more.

Perhaps God has tried to get in touch with us but our assiduity in prayer has prevented Him from doing so!
