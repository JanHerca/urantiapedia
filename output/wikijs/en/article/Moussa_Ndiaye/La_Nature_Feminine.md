In his seminars, Moussa Ndiaye described feminine nature in all its facets!

If this eternal feminine deserves its place in history and anthology books, it could just as well appear within the AFLUB itself and therefore have a few lines devoted to it in the Link.

So, call on all those who have imagination and a little time to describe or combine spiritual femininity.

What is the contribution of the presence of our “Joint Actresses” in our Urantian life? Then imagine the criteria for future collaboration!

Even if we suspect it a little, it would be nice to transcribe it in an issue of Lien.

Grab your pens and free yourself!

Thanks in advance !

\* To encourage and inspire you, attached are the chapter headings of Moussa's conferences. With his permission, we will publish excerpts in a future edition.
