**THE STUDY OF CREATION**

The study of Creation comprises 3 parts:
I. The study of creatures: man, trees, animals...
II. The study of the worlds of Creation: the Earth, the Sun, the stars...
III. The Creator: God.

This division contains everything that exists, but we can't study everything at once; we have to choose. We'll start by studying ourselves.

## I. Study of man

_Introduction_

The most complete creature we know is man. If we look closely, we'll see that he consists of three elements:

1. **The body** (the physical presence). It is highly differentiated and highly organized (made of “organs”) on the outside (eyes, head, arms...) and on the inside (stomach, heart...). These organs function for life; each has a very specific function. We consider them very useful; none are superfluous. Each organ is highly specified and _functional_. Could we imagine the body arranged in a different way? As it is, it is perfect.
2. **Consciousness**, intelligence. This allows us to know and recognize things, to learn new things. If man didn't have intelligence, he wouldn't understand anything. Like the body, human consciousness also has several faculties: _imagination, attention or concentration, and reasoning_. Consciousness is organized like the body. Its faculties are also active and dynamic. We see the body; consciousness is invisible to the eye, but we know it exists. Its nature is immaterial; it's not made of the same substance as the body, but they are united and both are dynamic; they are not separate.
3. **Personality**. It allows us to express our will, what we want to do, what we choose to do. And with it, we can execute this will, which has _powers_: wanting things and being able to do them. Personality is different from intelligence. Although we can't see it either, we know we have it. We observe that this personality is linked to consciousness and the body. If one of these things were missing from a person, they wouldn't be a normal person (if their personality were unhealthy, they would be schizophrenic; one wouldn't be able to act normally with them).

If a normal man has a normal body, a normal consciousness and a normal personality, this man can communicate with others.

_Observation and analysis_

- a) Man is a Being (with body, consciousness and personality) Living (the body is alive; consciousness is active, dynamic; personality has the power to eat, to sing, to do things... Everything is alive.
- b) It is a Unity of Being: The body is united with consciousness, and consciousness with personality. The three are united; they are a unity of different things. Man is a unified being.

And how do all these things exist? The answer is God. He who chooses the elements, who puts them together, is the Creator. God made all these elements before making me. These things already existed before me. It was God who united them and created a human being.

Therefore, man is real and can be studied. He is not just a mass of matter.

After this introduction, let's now delve deeper into its study.

**MAN'S STUDY PLAN**

1. Study of consciousness
2. Careful study of consciousness
3. Personality study
4. Detailed study of personality
5. Study of faith
6. Careful study of the faith

## 1. STUDY OF CONSCIOUSNESS

We will not study human consciousness as psychology has done, nor as philosophy has. (Psychology studies human consciousness from childhood to adulthood. Philosophy shows how adult human beings use consciousness to study science, morality, social relations, politics, metaphysics, etc.)

We are going to study human consciousness <ins>by its constitution</ins>. Not by the way it develops, but by its nature. What is the nature of consciousness made of? It is made up of 7 faculties, which we will study one after the other. Whenever we study a faculty, we will do so by demonstration, and each person will see for themselves whether this demonstration is true or false. Then we will analyze the usefulness of these faculties in ordinary life and examine what man would be if he lacked them. These 7 faculties are called **adjutant spirits of the mind** (something totally integrated into human life):

### 1.1. Guidance and intuition assistant

We will proceed to demonstrate it: every human being can move straight ahead, walk backward, go left, go up, go down, turn... &rarr; Man can change directions, he can orient himself. In practical life, it is observed that when I am going to do something, I orient my movements &rarr; To perform a precise action in space, I orient myself. Everything I do in life requires orientation. If a man loses his faculty of orientation, he cannot do anything; he is blocked. &rArr; The <ins>orientation helper</ins> is part of my being, it is fundamental to my being. Since we began to walk as children, this helper has been necessary in my life.

Intuition is quick understanding, like solving a math problem. Quick understanding is necessary for life to function effectively. It's necessary, for example, to cross a busy street. Intuition and orientation go together and are part of being human. If intuition were lacking, it would be a sign of very low intelligence, weakness, or mental viscosity.

These help me move in space precisely.

### 1.2. Comprehension Helper

How are we going to demonstrate the existence of this helper? We always analyze things before understanding them. Analysis enables humans to understand. We note that humans also make overall perceptions (if they study only part of something, they cannot fully understand it because they don't see its entirety): this is coordination (for example, production lines in a factory).

Is this helper useful? Everything I do in life requires understanding. The <ins>helper of understanding</ins> exists in my human nature and is necessary in my life. It is fundamental. If a person didn't have it, he couldn't do anything.

### 1.3. Courage or action helper

People can have projects, organize themselves, and make the decision to carry them out. Realization is action, which all human beings possess. The action assistant intervenes in everything I do; it is also necessary for my life. If an individual lacked courage in their life, it would be impossible for them to act on anything. If life has no action, life has no meaning. &rarr; It is also fundamental in life. If I act, there are results.

### 1.4. Adventure Helper

Let's talk about four steps:
1. Adventure: “going into the winds,” discovering unknown things. Curiosity dwells within every human being (scientific research never stops).
2. Men change. When they experience new things, they change their perspective.
3. Progress. These changes are for gaining something; they must lead to progress.
4. Assessment: Did I achieve my goal? Have I made progress?

These four qualities define the <ins>adventure helper</ins>. This is very important for a person: I learn new things, change, and progress. Then I evaluate myself and value those changes.

### 1.5. Association or council assistant

It's cooperation to carry out joint projects. There are several cases in which we find this:

- Association of two: marriage.
- Group association: in sports (football team, etc.), in all games, at work...
- Community association: in a town hall, where common problems (school, hospital, etc.) are addressed.
- Partnership in a nation: major security projects...
- Association in the United Nations: international relations...

All this shows that men have the <ins>association helper</ins>.

_<ins>Observations on the first five assistants</ins>:_

- a) _<ins>Differences between humans and animals</ins>:_ animals possess the first 5 helpers, but in an _instinctive_ way; that is, they use the first 5 helpers with their bodily mechanism (by instinct). Example: a dog walks following its sense of smell. Animals use their bodies to orient themselves and also to understand. They have the capacity for adventure, they act (they hunt,...) and they associate (their gregarious instinct makes them reproduce, create colonies,...). They use these helpers instinctively. But _humans_ use them intellectually and _consciously_, through intelligence (if I look for a direction, I don't do it by sniffing the ground...)
- b) _<ins>Human dignity</ins>:_ Man can know himself through the sciences (biology, psychology,...). He can also know the Earth, the animals, the stars,... what is below, on the surface, above him,... Man is a thinker &rarr; his mind seeks and finds. Man can use things to create &rarr; he is an organizer. He can change to a new way of living &rarr; he is a man of civilization. Man can create new things &rarr; he is a creator. &rArr; Already with these 5 helpers, man is better than an animal.
- c) _<ins>The man and the helpers</ins>:_
  - a. The helpers immediately obey the will of man (it takes them less than 3 days to arrive), they are one with my will.
  - b. If I need a helper, only the one I need comes to my aid (the others are left alone). They are well-ordered and never run out as long as I live.

The helpers are subject to human will and are inexhaustible. All men who have ever been born (primitive man included) and who will ever be born have helpers; they are everywhere, universal. They have never been exhausted; their source is infinite. It is <ins>God</ins> who has given them to us, not man (not our parents). And God will not demand them from us; he has given us the freedom to use them and never opposes this use or imposes a rule. “The source” allows man to act freely &rarr; free will. It is God who has given me the freedom to use these helpers.

### 1.6. Worship Helper

To worship means: first, to know the nature of God; then, to know God's will; and then, to cooperate with God's will. Is this helper real in human consciousness? <ins>The helper of worship</ins> comes after the other five. When my consciousness realizes that it comes from God, the will to know Him arises. And to know is to love.

- From the point of view of <ins>sociology and psychology</ins>:
  - a) _The child_, from a very young age, innocently, if he asks his parents about the stars (and they answer him well), will bring out the worship helper.
  - b) _The adolescent_ _consciously_ asks who created everything. The problem is when they don't find the answers. But if they do, they open their hearts wide, and the helper emerges.
  - c) _The mature man_, when he grows old, groups with adults and with cultured people to ask and know what there is after death.
  - This shows that, as far as sociology and psychology are concerned, man has a faculty that pushes him towards the knowledge of God.
- From the point of view of anthropology:
  - From the primitive age, humans had religious worship. At first, primitive humans worshipped the sun; it was a primitive form of worship. As civilization advanced, humans worshipped their ancestors. Later, with the religion of revelation, it progressed toward a worship of a single God (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, etc.).
  - One might ask: What's the point of this? It's to create religions that have provided brotherhood and peaceful social life (religions have brought much peace to people).

### 1.7. Wisdom Helper

Wisdom means:
- a) To know without ever having learned (only God can &rarr; man wants to be like Him)
- b) Doing without ever having learned to do
- c) Unifying different things. (E.g., man is body, consciousness, personality: a unity of different things)

God knows how to make a human being without having learned it anywhere. This allows us to speak of wisdom. We cannot do either a) or b), although regarding ac) we are an example (human being manifests a complete divine action): I am made of three elements, and the three are unified. God is the First Artist; he created human beings.

God's technique is to bring together different things and unify them. Now, a woman gives birth to the unification resulting from an egg and a sperm. So, does divine wisdom work in man?
- a) In the field of agriculture, man applies divine wisdom without knowing it (sowing seeds in the earth, so that they grow and produce fruits).
- b) Man has an application of divine wisdom in reproduction. Both a) and b) are natural human abilities.
- c) In social life. In this case, people must live according to their own attitudes. Divine wisdom consists in unifying things; in social life, people must unify each other's gifts in order to progress (e.g., in the construction of a building). People discover life's projects and must discover the gifts that other people possess.

These are applications of the <ins>helping spirit of wisdom</ins> in the lives of individuals, examples of divine wisdom.

## 2. CAREFUL STUDY OF CONSCIOUSNESS

### 2.1. Guidance and intuition assistant

We have already studied how humans function, move, and act in space. Now we will see how humans become beings in space, how they exist in space, and their spatialization. We will study this spatialization in seven phases.
- A) <ins>Fetus</ins>: This is a period of approximately 9 months. During this period, we see the human body begin at a point, grow, and take the form of a well-structured human being for the space of life.
- B) <ins>Infant</ins>: from birth until 2 or 3 years old. During this period, the child's body develops, becoming increasingly capable of making gestures, kicking, eventually learning to pick up objects, crawling, walking, talking, etc.
- C) <ins>Early childhood</ins> (ages 3 to 6): During this period, children are very busy playing. They move away from their mothers and engage in their own games. Games develop their intelligence and their capacity for action. This is what is called “praxia.” While they play and improve, they work. They even tend to go outside the house, into a larger space, and adventure begins. They want to do what adults do. It is highly recommended that parents help their children play; games allow them to conquer space and their muscles develop better. This is the playful period.
- D) <ins>Second childhood</ins> (ages 6 to 12): In this phase, children discover the school environment. They begin to discover society through their relationships with their peers, their teachers, and their environment. They also discover the realm of knowledge; they begin to understand that society is organized, to see that everything has a place (institutions, hospitals, schools, etc.). They open up to the space beyond their homes, as citizens.
- E) <ins>Adolescence</ins> (13 to 18 years old): First, they notice that their body is changing; they realize they can reproduce through pregnancy. &rarr; The space for procreation develops. Second, they discover their emotional space, their sexual life. Third, they begin to feel that they are autonomous, that they have a personality, that they have a will. They understand the world in their own way (not like Mom and Dad). They discover a sense of responsibility: they can be parents, work in society. They have to discover their ambitions and direct their destiny, acting personally in their lives.
F) <ins>Adult level</ins>: First, it manifests itself in family life (marriage, children, etc.). Second, in society (through work). Third, in openness and full social development (through membership in other associations, etc.). Fourth, when one seeks to learn about other races, cultures, and nations. Fifth, to learn about the planet.
G) <ins>Cosmic level</ins>: in this phase, man wants to know the Creator of man, the Creator of the Earth, the Creator of all the stars.

### 2.2. Comprehension Helper

Its 7 levels:
- A) <ins>Fetal level</ins>: At this level, there is no understanding. The mother is the one who understands, and she must understand the relationship between herself and the fetus. She must know that the fetus eats what the mother eats. If the mother eats poorly, the fetus will not be very healthy. She must know that all her movements affect the fetus and avoid dangerous movements. She must understand that all her feelings are felt by the fetus as well; she must master her emotions. If the mother does not understand these things, she runs the risk of miscarriage. Everything is transmitted to the child. The father must also understand that the family environment affects the fetus.
- B) <ins>Infant</ins>: It is still the mother who must understand, she must develop this reflex so that the child's physical organism can learn to crawl and walk. She must provide good nutrition for the development of nerves and reflexes. She and the father must understand that the child will learn to walk and that they will have to help him. He will learn to speak, and they must help him develop good language skills, with a precise, accurate, and clean vocabulary, because words follow thoughts. Swearing and tantrums hinder and harden his morality.
- C) <ins>Early childhood</ins>: The child is already beginning to express themselves. They try to demonstrate that their thinking is working; they want to show that they are skilled. At the same time they play, they speak. They begin to communicate (e.g., talking to their dolls) and develop relationships. They want to understand themselves and the world, and parents will help them do so by showing them that they can understand. They must help them with everything they question.
- D) <ins>Second childhood</ins> (6-12): They want to know everything, and at school they are taught everything. Parents should help them enter the world of knowledge, as they finish school. At this age, they want to learn about society, travel, get to know their families... If their understanding is good, it lasts for a long time (parents should help them a lot).
- E) <ins>Adolescence</ins>: Parents must help them get to know themselves. A great change takes place, and they don't understand each other very well. There is a transition; the world presents itself in terms of relationships. The adolescent wonders who they are, and they must be helped to develop a clear sense of self, to realize that one day they will be active in society. They realize they have a gift. They ask difficult questions, and they need help to bring out their character. Parents must help them understand who they are and what they will become, and to be aware of the efforts that will be necessary.
- F) <ins>The adult level</ins>: they must understand a) family life b) social life (working to earn a living, choosing the profession that corresponds to their gift, etc.) c) personal development (openness) d) understanding other races and cultures e) understanding their planet at its current time.
- G) <ins>Cosmic level</ins>: Who created me? They must know the cosmic creation: the Creator, the other creatures, and the relationships of the creator with the creatures and those of the creatures themselves with the other creatures of this creator.

### 2.3. Courage or action helper

- A) <ins>Fetal level</ins>: At this level, the person who can most influence the fetus is the mother. She can influence its nutrition; she can even influence its emotions, since everything in her thoughts is reflected in the body. Therefore, the mother must have beautiful and good thoughts, so that the child will be beautiful, intelligent, strong, brave, etc. She can consider the help of all those helpers. Thus, the mother can foresee the child who will be born and influence her child's destiny.
- B) <ins>Breast-fed child</ins>: During this period, the mother must influence her child's diet, monitor his sleep, and especially when the child begins to crawl, walk, talk, and want to communicate. During this period, if the mother does this, she truly influences her child's growth rate with her gentleness.
- C) <ins>Early childhood</ins> (3-6 years): This is the playful stage, when the child is always playing. Mothers can influence their child's play by purchasing toys that suit them. It's always good for children to have playmates; if these aren't available, it's the mother who should play with them. She should also appreciate her child's achievements in play. A child who plays is a child who works; they don't have fun, they work. They show their mother everything, and she should encourage and stimulate them.
- D) <ins>Second Childhood</ins> (6-12): Parental action must consist of loving and valuing their bodies, but also everything that knowledge brings. Parents must make children see the usefulness of thought in obtaining knowledge, which is used to invent useful things for man, such as the bicycle, the airplane, etc. Man's own thoughts lead him to improve his habitat, his environment and the expression of life. It is good to show him the power of thought, which makes man better. Give them an education in applied thought, practical, creative thought. They must be taught to be strong, given responsibilities. At this stage, they are very attached to the family.
- E) <ins>Adolescence</ins>: Parents' role at this stage is to help their children become aware that they are no longer children but adults. Parents must understand this well to help them successfully navigate this transitional stage, in which:
  - Your body changes
  - Your way of loving changes.
  - Your way of thinking changes.
  - Self-awareness also changes.
  - The meaning of society changes.
  - Parents should insist on teaching them to appreciate the importance of change. They will have to work hard to make adolescents aware of what is changing, since this transformation is not very clear to them.
- F) <ins>Adult level</ins>: the individual considers the action plan of his life as a plan to perfect his being in:
  - a. The family experience.
  - b. The social experience.
  - c. The racial and cultural experience.
  - d. The planetary experience.
  - If you do these things, you see that you become more. If you look at society, you realize that you have the talent to take care of yourself. This work frees you and allows you to develop as an individual. It broadens your human vision, opens your senses to other levels.
- G) <ins>Cosmic level</ins>: If he becomes aware that he is a thinking and achieving being, he comes to the conclusion that he has been realized by God, that he is a being of God &rarr; That he is the result of a plan of action &rarr; That he has his own plan of action: he wants to know God and why he created him. This raises him above himself and leads him to think about what the cosmic plan of action will be. Any helper will lead him to think about the question of God. In the human Being there is a Plan of Progression. What comes next will always be better, because it is a realization, a perfection.

### 2.4. Adventure Helper

In the adventure helper, what interests us is progress. If there is progress, there is change, there is evolution. That being the case, let's study this helper through the lens of progress.
- A) <ins>Fetal level</ins>: Between the first day of conception and the day of birth, the progression of the fetus is clearly visible. It emerged from a drop of blood to become an organized and fully formed being.
- B) <ins>Breast-fed child</ins>: if we observe the child from the time he is one day old until he is 2 years old, we see that there is a great change and progress.
- C) <ins>Early childhood</ins> (3-6): As a baby, he was attached to his mother. Later, he separated from her and became passionate about playing (even when his mother called him, he refused to leave the game to join her); he became independent. This was a new progression that didn't exist before. It took place within the home.
- D) <ins>Second Childhood</ins> (6-12): In this phase, the child leaves the family and goes to school. From 6 to 12 years of age, the child grows muscularly, becoming interested in strength and competition; he or she often enjoys athletics. The child enjoys learning about the world and wants to explore the entire planet. The progression of change compared to the previous phase can be seen.
- E) <ins>Adolescence</ins>: There are new things, the body changes morphologically and physiologically. The energy of sexuality has appeared. Sensitivity also changes; the individual becomes sentimental and possibly shares feelings with a partner. Thinking also changes, becoming more philosophical. We see the progression: their human nature is more complete.
- F) <ins>Adult level</ins>: Adolescence begins with the family experience, with the possibility of becoming parents and also citizens of society. In their adult phase, they become humanists and can even become planetary (if they are interested). The difference with the previous stage and the progression that takes place are evident.
- G) <ins>Cosmic level</ins>: When he has finished developing or realizing himself up to the planetary level, he wonders if things stop there or if there is a continuation, and where that continuation is. His persistence in knowledge and his commitment to a progressive and superior transformation leads him to become interested in God. Or, in other words, to also become a cosmic citizen. At this moment, the new being he will become will be superhuman (but it is necessary to be born again).

### 2.5. Association Helper

- A) <ins>Fetal level</ins>: At this level, the two parental factors are first associated in the mother's womb. At this moment, the conception of a child begins. As the child grows, the mother's energies are added to the development of the fetus (through the umbilical cord). Mental energies are also added, and they are associated in the development of the fetus.
- B) <ins>Breastfed child</ins>: The breastfed child is nourished by breast milk, porridge, and other foods; he or she breathes air directly and receives sunlight on his or her body. All of this enters his or her body; he or she associates with the family environment; that is, he or she walks, talks, and develops.
- C) <ins>Early childhood</ins>: At this level, the process of association moves to the level of play. Their lives are played out. Through association, they develop thought and action; they desire and develop the union of both.
- D) <ins>Second Childhood</ins> (6-12): Associated with culture and knowledge, as children attend school. They are introduced to social organization and family and social responsibilities. They learn about cooperation and teamwork. They observe the organization of all things and social solidarity.
- E) <ins>Adolescence</ins>: He undergoes a transformation in his physical, mental, and moral being. He must now realize that every change in his being leads him to certain responsibilities. His sexually transformed body shows him that he can be a father; his sensitivity shows him that he can commit himself to love through his association with another being; his moral development shows him that he must be responsible for himself in life. He also opens himself to a new relationship of associations.
- F) <ins>Adult level</ins>: the adult is associated with a program:
  - a. Of family life.
  - b. From society. The social contract: one must contribute to others and give back to them what society has naturally given to oneself. (Rousseau)
  - This is the planetary level, which depends on each individual, and which very clearly shows the social evolution of man (international association).
- G) <ins>Cosmic level</ins>: At this level, man seeks to associate with the Creator. Evidently, this association elevates him to a higher level. He must relate his attitudes to those of God. What will emerge from these relationships will be superhuman or human-divine.

### 2.6. Worship Helper

_As for God_

- 1st <ins>Transcendence</ins>: Astronomy explains that all bodies move around another body (the Earth around the sun, the Sun around the Andronover Nebula, etc.). There is a fixed point and everything revolves around this point. (Scientists have discovered that there is a point from which all energy emanates: “the causeless cause,” the center of gravity.) It is transcendental to all creation; it goes beyond everything, it is exterior to everything. It is called God. Everything emanates from Him (He is the source). Man knows that He is far away, but he wants to know Him.
- 2nd <ins>Immanence</ins>: When man reflects and seeks the solution to a problem, after a certain time, the answer comes. The answer is immanent to man, but he did not know it. And so, God is in man, is immanent to man. Man cannot understand the transcendental God, but he can understand the God immanent within him. “If God were not there, man would never know him.” All of man's ideas and thoughts are immanent within him. Man knows that he has an inner life, that he has a source from which the answers emanate, but it is necessary for man to think for ideas to emerge. This is very important to keep in mind.
- 3rd <ins>The nature of God</ins>: The 3 characteristics of God are: Goodness, Love (Truth), and Mercy (Beauty). The nature of God is spirit &rarr; God is <ins>Goodness</ins>, because he has given man the _body, consciousness, and personality_; and it is my own being that shows me that God is good. His goodness is unique (no other being can do it). &rarr; God is <ins>Love</ins>, because he has given me _life_ (my being is alive). &rarr; God is <ins>Mercy, or Beauty</ins>, because God creates without ceasing. _Creation_ is called Divine Mercy. The Beauty of God is action. I can also reproduce &rarr; I bear the mark of divine mercy; I can act and do many things in society.

_As for the man_

Man possesses _conscience_ (the seven helpers of the mind) and _personality_: he is therefore an intelligent creature endowed with a will. Thus, we have intelligence and will, but man also has _free will_. And this requires righteousness, since it makes man his own arbiter. Each person possesses a morality, by which he perceives and understands internally what is good and just for him. Freedom is the power of action; when a man arbitrarily chooses something, he is free to act. Man has self-awareness; he is aware that he has a body, a mind, a personality; he is aware that he has free will, he is aware that he is alive, he is aware of himself.

Man is intelligent, he has will, he is self-aware, he has free will.

What is worship? What happens when man worships? When man worships God, he wants to know God's nature, and he also wants to know why He created Him. &rarr; He is aware that he can cooperate with Him. Man wants to know Him in order to cooperate. When man worships, he wants to know God's nature; he walks toward Him. If man so desires, God will also react toward man. The consciousness, the personality, the life of man move toward God, and God also desires to move toward man. Then these two natures, human and divine, associate, interpenetrate. And when this happens, something emerges: the Soul. This is what Jesus called the New Birth. When man worships God, the response is the Soul. It is necessary for me to know God (He has given me everything), and then God will give himself to the man who seeks Him. These two wills create the soul, whose process of emergence constitutes a reality.

### 2.7. Wisdom Helper

We've said that there is knowledge. And there is the aspect of unifying things. We will study the application of wisdom to the facts of human life (as in the sciences, etc.), that is, we will study wisdom through the reality of the facts.

<span style="color:pink;">A close look at the wisdom helper:</span>

<span style="color:blue;">APPLICATION OF WISDOM AND REVELATION</span>

<span style="color:blue;">I. SCOPE OF CONSCIOUSNESS</span>

- <span style="color:blue;">Science (knowledge) leads to awareness of the facts.</span> <span style="color:pink;">Science always leads to God (source of all facts).</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Religion leads to awareness of values</span> <span style="color:pink;">(goodness, beauty, truth &rarr; love)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Wisdom leads to coordinating the awareness of facts and values</span> <span style="color:pink;">(unification of facts and God &rarr; the soul is wisdom)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Revelation leads to true awareness of Reality</span> <span style="color:pink;">(God)</span>


<span style="color:blue;">II. SOCIAL SCOPE</span>

- <span style="color:blue;">Science causes the emergence of social classes (or socio-professional classes)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Religion leads men to serve: it gives rise to morality and altruism</span> <span style="color:pink;">(because it deals with values, the same for all)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Wisdom leads to a higher knowledge of ideas</span> <span style="color:pink;">(in society) and of men (and puts them in relationship &rarr; brotherhood)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Revelation liberates men and launches them into the eternal adventure of knowing God.</span>


<span style="color:blue;">III. SCOPE OF THE FULLNESS OF THE SELF</span> <span style="color:pink;">(in society)</span>

- <span style="color:blue;">Science selects men</span> <span style="color:pink;">(it classifies them according to their training)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Religion makes men love themselves as much as themselves</span> <span style="color:pink;">(does not select)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Wisdom distributes justice to men when harmony is lacking among them</span> <span style="color:pink;">(Wisdom will make them agree)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Revelation glorifies men and reveals their abilities to associate with God.</span>


<span style="color:blue;">IV. SCOPE OF FRATERNITY</span>

- <span style="color:blue;">Science pursues in vain the creation of a fellowship of culture</span> <span style="color:pink;">(two people from different professions may not have much to talk about)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Religion brings into existence the brotherhood of Spirit</span> <span style="color:pink;">(God is common to all)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Philosophy seeks the brotherhood of wisdom</span> <span style="color:pink;">(combining science, culture and religion)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Revelation shows spiritual fellowship</span>


<span style="color:blue;">V. SCOPE OF PERSONALITY</span>

- <span style="color:blue;">Science makes pride appear in personality</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Wisdom is the awareness of the meaning of personality</span> <span style="color:pink;">(and of values: God in me)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Religion is the experience that reveals the value of personality</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Revelation is the certainty of the survival of personality</span> <span style="color:pink;">(when I worship, God manifests himself, expresses himself in me, reveals himself in me. God is associated with me $\alpha$ Personality is not going to die)</span>

<span style="color:pink;">So much for the 5 aspects of a man's life.</span>

<span style="color:pink;">Man has five important things: body, consciousness, personality, life, and free will. And who gave him all these things?</span>

<span style="color:blue;">VI. SCOPE OF THE COSMOS</span>

- <span style="color:blue;">Science deals with identifying, analyzing, classifying the fractional parts of the limitless cosmos</span> <span style="color:pink;">(astronomy)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Religion encompasses the idea of the whole, the whole cosmos</span> <span style="color:pink;">(it does not analyze)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Philosophy (wisdom) tries to identify the material segments of science with the concept of spiritual discernment of the whole</span> <span style="color:pink;">(it brings the scientist into agreement with the religious man)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Revelation achieves this when it affirms that the cosmic circle is universal, eternal, and infinite</span>


<span style="color:blue;">VII. LEVEL OF THE DEITY</span>

<span style="color:pink;">(God's nature is Spirit. Goodness: He has given me everything I am. Love: He has given me life. Beauty: His mercy has also given me the ability to create, to do things)</span>

- <span style="color:blue;">Science shows Deity as a fact</span> <span style="color:pink;">(every movement has a force)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Philosophy or wisdom presents the idea of an Absolute</span> <span style="color:pink;">[God has all ideas: Absolute Thought, Absolute Source of ideas, Absolute brain (facts are unlimited, ideas absolute)]</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Religion views God as a loving spiritual personality</span> <span style="color:pink;">(God has also done it out of Love: you belong to yourself, I give you yourself)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Revelation affirms (proves) that there is a unity between the fact of Deity, the idea of an Absolute, and the spiritual personality of God</span> <span style="color:pink;">(man himself is the proof).</span>


<span style="color:blue;">VIII. LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE</span>

<span style="color:pink;">(Man is a seeker. He knows nothing, yet he wants to know)</span>

- <span style="color:blue;">The pursuit of knowledge constitutes science – the pursuit of wisdom is philosophy</span> <span style="color:pink;">(if man knows the science of himself, if he knows himself, he achieves wisdom)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">The love of God is religion</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">The thirst for truth is a revelation</span>

<span style="color:blue;">But it is the inner Thought Adjuster that links the feeling of reality to the spiritual discernment of men in the cosmos.</span>

<span style="color:blue;">IX. LEVEL OF EXPRESSION OF REALIZATION</span>

- <span style="color:blue;">In science, the idea precedes the expression of its realization</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">In religion, the expression of realization precedes the expression of the idea</span> <span style="color:pink;">(I want to be like God and that's why I want to know his nature)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">There is an immense difference between the evolutionary will to believe (a product of the enlightenment of reason) or religious discernment on the one hand and the revelation of the growing will on the other.</span>


<span style="color:blue;">X. LEVEL OF EVOLUTION</span>

- <span style="color:blue;">In evolution, religion often leads men to create their concepts of God</span> <span style="color:pink;">(in primitive religion, man anthropomorphized God)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Revelation shows the phenomenon of men of God evolving from themselves</span> <span style="color:pink;">(God shows himself through me)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Evolution tends to make God similar to man</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Revelation tends to make man similar to God</span> <span style="color:pink;">(the idea of religion is always evolving).</span>


<span style="color:blue;">XI. PURPOSE LEVEL</span>

- <span style="color:blue;">Science is only satisfied with the first causes</span> <span style="color:pink;">(there are added causes, but they come from an origin, which is the cause of causes)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Religion with only the supreme personality</span> <span style="color:pink;">(the cause without a cause)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Philosophy only with unity</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Revelation states that the three are unified and that all are good</span> <span style="color:pink;">(and necessary)</span>

<span style="color:blue;">The Eternal Real is the Good of the Universe. In the spiritual experience of all personalities, it is always noted that the Good</span> <span style="color:pink;">(God)</span> <span style="color:blue;">is Real and that Real is Good.</span>

<span style="color:pink;">The relationship between facts and their source is wisdom, which serves revelation. Facts constitute science, and their source is religion; the combination of the two constitutes wisdom. Facts express what the source wants them to express &rarr; the source manifests itself through the facts &rarr; the source reveals itself in the facts &rarr; revelation.</span>

<span style="color:pink;">And these are the four aspects of truth: Man is a fact. Who made me? God. &rarr; These relationships constitute wisdom, from which the soul is born, which is revelation &rarr; This is the way God comes to man. These aspects are inseparable. All creation is based on them. For this reason, this quaternary application has been made.</span>

3. STUDY OF PERSONALITY

We have learned that consciousness has seven faculties, called the seven helpers of the mind. We have also discovered that personality has powers. Let us now analyze them. There are seven:

1) <ins>The power of emergency</ins> [Emerger]

We can see that when people have problems about issues they want to clarify, they awaken within, reflect deeply, and after a certain time, the answer emerges in their consciousness. They have brought forth the solution to the problem. It is the creative power.

2) <ins>The power of choice</ins>

You can't do everything; at any given moment, people can choose from several possibilities, so they select and end up choosing what seems best to them (what is best).

3) <ins>The power of decision</ins>

When men have chosen, they decide to make their choice. And so the choice comes to life.

4) <ins>The power of execution</ins>

Once I have made the decision, I have to act, execute that decision.

5) <ins>The power of discernment</ins>

This means rectitude and precision. To choose between several possibilities, I must seek the best method, and to execute my decision, I must require precision. God is upright and just (He uses a method to create a person through parents).

6) <ins>The power of love</ins>

When people undertake projects, they always destined them for other creatures. When people do good, it is always destined for other people. This is called loving. People will apply this power to social life. This power is within us. People can increase or decrease it, but it is within them.

7) <ins>The power to evaluate</ins>

Have you achieved your goal? Have you been 50% satisfied, 100% satisfied? And then you decide to act differently or not at all. &rarr; This allows you to progress.

4. CAREFUL STUDY OF PERSONALITY

***Introduction***

Personality has two manifestations:

- Human: that will lead him to love man
- Divine: which will lead you to love God.

Before dying, almost all men have this restlessness to question the subject of God; He is within them. It's very rare for a man not to have the slightest curiosity to know Him. What is normal is to question everything and reach God.

***The divine personality***

<span style="color:pink;">[There are two different forms of personhood: human personhood (the human self: the 7 powers) and divine personhood (when I want to resemble and be like God). Divine personhood is when my human self has the will to resemble God, to become divine.]</span>

- <span style="color:blue;">Personality is that quality in reality which is bestowed by the Universal Father himself, or by the Conjoint Actor (the Infinite Spirit, the 3rd source or 3rd person of the Trinity) acting in his stead.</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">It can be given to any living energy system that contains the mind</span> <span style="color:pink;">(the 7 adjutant spirits of the mind)</span> <span style="color:blue;">or the spirit <span style="color:pink;">(the Adjuster).</span> Animals are excluded.</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">It is not</span> <span style="color:pink;">(by free will)</span> <span style="color:blue;">completely subject to the obstacles of preceding causes</span> <span style="color:pink;">(man does not have to be subject to his parents because they brought him into the world).</span> <span style="color:blue;">It is relatively creative or co-creative.</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">When given to evolutionary material creatures, it causes the spirit to strive to master energy-matter through the mediation of the mind.</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">While devoid of identity, personality can unify the identity of any living energy system.</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Their sensitivity to the personality circuit is only qualitative</span> <span style="color:pink;">(as far as values go, one cannot have more personality than one has),</span> <span style="color:blue;">contrary to the three energies</span> <span style="color:pink;">(material: body / morontial: soul / spiritual: Adjuster)</span> <span style="color:blue;">which are both qualitatively and quantitatively sensitive to gravity.</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Personality does not change in the presence of change.</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">You can make a gift to God – the consecration of free will to do God's will.</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">It is characterized by morality - the awareness of the relativity of relationships with other people. It discerns the levels of behavior and makes a reasonable choice among them.</span> <span style="color:pink;">(in the evil of some act one can often see that it is caused by a reaction to another previous evil, that deep down this evil person is seeking justice)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Personality is unique, absolutely unique</span> <span style="color:pink;">(this provides great security)</span>: <span style="color:blue;">it is unique in time and space; it is unique in eternity and in Paradise; it is unique at the moment in which it is granted – there are no copies; it is unique at every moment of existence; it is unique with respect to God – who is no respecter of persons, but who does not add them either, since they cannot be added – They can be associated, but not totalized.</span> <span style="color:pink;">(One personality cannot be placed within another, nor can one be added to another)</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">The personality reacts directly to the presence of another personality.</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">It is an element that can be added to the spirit</span> <span style="color:pink;">(of God in man),</span> <span style="color:blue;">which illustrates the primacy of the Father over the Son. (The mind does not need to be added to the spirit).</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">Personality can survive physical death with the identity that is in the surviving soul. The Adjuster</span> <span style="color:pink;">(God)</span> <span style="color:blue;">and the personality</span> <span style="color:pink;">(man)</span> <span style="color:blue;">do not vary; the relationship between the two</span> <span style="color:pink;">(in the embryonic soul)</span> <span style="color:blue;">is only change, continual evolution; and if that change (growth) should cease, it would mean the end of the soul.</span> <span style="color:pink;">Personality shows itself very early in man. When the Adjuster arrives, contact is made between it and the personality, and the embryonic soul is born. Later, when man desires to seek God, when he cooperates with Him, the soul grows and develops. <ins>It must grow</ins> to survive.</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">The personality has a unique awareness of time</span> <span style="color:pink;">(experience will allow the personality to have an awareness of time and space),</span> <span style="color:blue;"> something different from the perception of time that the mind (of man) or the spirit (of God) have.</span>
- <span style="color:blue;">This personality is that part that allows us to recognize and positively identify a person as the one we have known before, even if he has changed a lot as a result of modifications in the vehicle of expression and manifestation of his personality.</span> <span style="color:pink;">A man always has the same personality, even if he has been able to change his character. The more he learns, the more stable he will become in his way of being.</span>


<span style="color:blue;">Personality:</span> <span style="color:pink;">manifest God.</span>

<span style="color:blue;">Reality:</span> <span style="color:pink;">God, who has given man the ability to go to Him through the local universe, the superuniverse, and the central universe.</span>

1. <span style="color:blue;">State of location: The personality functions (in all spaces) <span style="color:pink;">with equal efficiency in the Local Universe, the Superuniverse, and the Central Universe.</span>
2. <span style="color:blue;">State of meaning: Personality plays an effective role at the levels of the finite, the Absonite</span> <span style="color:pink;">(between the finite and the infinite)</span> <span style="color:blue;">and even at the borders of the Absolute</span> <span style="color:pink;">(the potentials of God).</span>
3. <span style="color:blue;">Value status: Personality can develop experientially in the progressive realms: material, morontial</span> <span style="color:pink;">(Local Universe and Superuniverse)</span> <span style="color:blue;">and spiritual</span> <span style="color:pink;">(Paradise).</span>

***<span style="color:blue;">The dimensions of personality in the finite</span>***

<span style="color:blue;">Personality has three dimensions in the finite:</span>

1. <span style="color:blue;">Length: represents the direction and nature of progress – movement through space and time – evolution</span> <span style="color:pink;">(through experience and willpower)</span>
2. <span style="color:blue;">Vertical depth: includes the organism's drives and behaviors, the varying levels of self-understanding, and the general phenomenon of reaction to what surrounds us.</span> <span style="color:pink;">(The more man knows God, the deeper he becomes and the higher he rises. Angels, .... can see the vertical light of the soul)</span>
3. <span style="color:blue;">Breadth: encompasses the domains of coordination, association, and ego organization.</span> <span style="color:pink;">(With everyone else and everything within reach)</span>

<span style="color:pink;">(4, 5 and 6 are the dimensions of the Absonite; 7 are those of the Absolute)</span>

5 and 6. STUDY OF FAITH

<span style="color:pink;">God made me with him in me; he gave me life. Then he gave me free will, so that I can decide whether or not to be born again, whether or not to be like him; it is I who decide to continue. He gave me all this without my asking for anything. Now, if I ask to be like him, he will grant it to me, but I must ask him. If this is so, I will have to give to others, as he once gave to me. And my soul will grow.

<span style="color:pink;">On Earth, all things die, everything that is built perishes, man is mortal. But he does not want this; he wants to be immortal, as God is. To be like Him, one must desire it. If it is a sincere desire, the soul is born. But one must not stop there; one must make the soul grow.</span>

<span style="color:blue;">Faith, which points the way to the goal of human salvation, to the ultimate goal of universal human achievement, liberates man:</span>

1. <span style="color:blue;">From material obstacles</span> <span style="color:pink;">(the limits of the body. E.g.: man cannot see God)</span> <span style="color:blue;">in the personal experience of filiation with God who is Spirit.</span> <span style="color:pink;">(“I was born in God, He was born in me”. Your moral being, through your experience, will come to know God &rarr; from there the Soul will be born &rarr; I will be born as a Son of God. But we must work to make the Soul grow.)</span>
2. <span style="color:blue;">From intellectual slavery</span> <span style="color:pink;">(from the ignorance of men who do not know God),</span> <span style="color:blue;">men will know the Truth</span> <span style="color:pink;">(the relationship of my being with my God, for the Love of God)</span> <span style="color:blue;">and the Truth will set them free.</span> <span style="color:pink;">“It is not that God exists because Jesus said so, but that he said it because it is true”.</span>
3. <span style="color:blue;">From spiritual blindness</span> <span style="color:pink;">(everyone is born without knowing God, even Jesus)</span> <span style="color:blue;">to reach the human concept of the brotherhood of men and the subsequent awareness of the brotherhood of all creatures in the Universe; to the discovery of spiritual reality through service</span> <span style="color:pink;">(if I don't know God, I can't make Him known to others),</span> <span style="color:blue;">and the revelation of Goodness</span> <span style="color:pink;">(I will also be Goodness, but to give it to others. If not, why?)</span> <span style="color:blue;">of spiritual values through the ministry of Love.</span>
4. <span style="color:blue;">Of the shortcomings of the human personality</span> <span style="color:pink;">(to unify with his Adjuster)</span> <span style="color:blue;">in regard to reaching the spiritual levels of the Universe and finally understanding the harmony and perfection</span> <span style="color:pink;">(which man can now begin to understand by what is within him)</span> <span style="color:blue;">of Paradise, the place of existence of the Absolutes.</span>
5. <span style="color:blue;">Of himself, by liberating him from the limitations of self-consciousness by reaching the cosmic levels of the Supreme Thought</span> <span style="color:pink;">(the thought of man when he rises to the cosmic levels)</span> <span style="color:blue;">and by coordination with the realization of all other beings conscious of them.</span> <span style="color:pink;">(Cosmic consciousness is God consciousness. I ask God that my human consciousness become cosmic consciousness in order to understand everything)</span>
6. <span style="color:blue;">Of time, for the realization of an eternal life of endless progress in the knowledge and service of God.</span>
7. <span style="color:blue;">From the finite, by a perfected unity with the Deity</span> <span style="color:pink;">(the nature of God in myself)</span> <span style="color:blue;">and by the Supreme</span> <span style="color:pink;">(Supremacy: when you have grown your Soul)</span> <span style="color:blue;">through whom the creature tries to transcendentally discover the Ultimate.</span>

<span style="color:pink;">In God, space is energies. Time is what transforms energies, time is transformation (like the fetus that grows to become a human being). Everything obeys a progression; things don't arrive like a bombardment. The wisdom of all this doesn't come immediately; it takes time. Time brings transformation and growth <ins>little by little</ins>.</span>
