The wonderful side of the life that is offered to us is that we are free to unite as well as to disunite, and to always realize that, ultimately, because the cosmic organization of God is pyramidal, all that is union tends towards the Creator, towards the Father, towards the summit, while all that is disunion implies the necessity of new future efforts to unite us again or to definitively resign ourselves from the divine project. It seems, in fact, that we can never succeed in progressing spiritually if we leave behind us fundamental enmities on which we cannot return. Jesus invited us to love even our enemies, having, in truth, no merit in loving only those who love us. The masterful example of this is given to us in The Urantia Book.

When a father, who for a long time believed his son was definitely lost, sees him return, what does he do? He runs to meet him and shouts with joy. But the son is a thug. Will he reproach him? He celebrates him, he who squandered his inheritance; he does not have the same attention for the other son who, himself, has shown himself to be irreproachable, but who, during his brother's absence, has benefited from the presence of the father and all the benefits of security within the family cocoon. An exemplary story that dominates the Good News! It immediately places love in its true and rightful place.

It is no longer quite the rules of justice, morality or common human reason that are applied here; we find ourselves in a completely different domain, in another order, which ignores, which annihilates the usual laws. The hand of this father on the shoulder of the boy in rags, kneeling at his feet, suddenly rejects society, with its logic and its values. It introduces another evidence, the evidence of the heart; it transfigures the image of the divine by placing at the hearth of this world not a judge, but a paternal hand. The old order is overthrown, its laws are outdated, love reigns and leads everything... Now, we understand this gesture of the father, we understand this with this sort of intelligence of the heart that Jesus' speech has the gift of mobilizing and which constitutes its difference.

Now, what is accomplished here by the father is the action advised to all sons; what is diligently shown by God is keenly and affectionately advised to man. What a father forgives a son, why should not a brother forgive a brother with as much love and joy manifested? It is to understand the unique meaning of evolution towards the spiritual to grasp and apply this intelligence of the heart which reveals to all men that they are irremediably brothers.

The parable of the lost son is enough to demonstrate the immense goodness of God. The best men have always been inspired by it. I will quote this fervent follower of the intelligence of the heart who wrote: “My heart knows how to welcome. It is a pasture for the gazelle, a convent for Christian monks, a temple for idols, the pilgrim's casbah, the table of the Torah and the book of the Koran. I let myself be guided by the religion of love, whatever route its camels take.” (Mohieddin Ibn Arabi)

Intelligence of the heart is therefore synonymous with open-mindedness, with looking at others while always trying to understand them more without ever condemning them a priori. It is naturally still Jesus teaching his apostles, who explains to us best, through a striking image, what we must understand by open-mindedness thanks to intelligence of the heart, what we must understand by tolerance thanks to the effort to understand others.

> “_In the mind’s eye conjure up a picture of one of your primitive ancestors of cave-dwelling times—a short, misshapen, filthy, snarling hulk of a man standing, legs spread, club upraised, breathing hate and animosity as he looks fiercely just ahead. Such a picture hardly depicts the divine dignity of man. But allow us to enlarge the picture. In front of this animated human crouches a saber-toothed tiger. Behind him, a woman and two children. Immediately you recognize that such a picture stands for the beginnings of much that is fine and noble in the human race, but the man is the same in both pictures. Only, in the second sketch you are favored with a widened horizon. You therein discern the motivation of this evolving mortal. His attitude becomes praiseworthy because you understand him. If you could only fathom the motives of your associates, how much better you would understand them. If you could only know your fellows, you would eventually fall in love with them._” ([UB 100:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p4_5))

Are there limits to the intelligence of the heart? We must answer in the negative, because, if it is only through love that everything can begin, it is also through love that everything can last forever.

This is the primordial emergence in which Jesus has invited us all to joyfully participate. May all those men and women of this world whom I have been able to anger forgive the faults that they have been able to notice in me and which have displeased them. I remain their well-intentioned servant.
