**Regarding “black holes,” The Urantia Book perhaps gives us an explanation without naming them. Indeed, in issue 46 we learn that groupings of architectural planets are not visible in space. We are told:**

> _The lighting system of Jerusem should not be so difficult for you to comprehend. There are no days and nights, no seasons of heat and cold. The power transformers maintain one hundred thousand centers from which rarefied energies are projected upward through the planetary atmosphere, undergoing certain changes, until they reach the electric air-ceiling of the sphere; and then these energies are reflected back and down as a gentle, sifting, and even light of about the intensity of Urantia sunlight when the sun is shining overhead at ten o’clock in the morning._ (<a id="a40_571"></a>[UB 46:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p1_4))

> _Under such conditions of lighting, the light rays do not seem to come from one place; they just sift out of the sky, emanating equally from all space directions. This light is very similar to natural sunlight except that it contains very much less heat. Thus it will be recognized that such headquarters worlds are not luminous in space; if Jerusem were very near Urantia, it would not be visible._ (<a id="a42_403"></a>[UB 46:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p1_5))

Thus the light coming from these worlds is reflected back to them. But what about the lights coming from outside, all these luminous cosmic energies that the inhabitants of these architectural worlds should see? Shouldn't they also be reflected, but this time outwards? And since they come from all sides, don't they collide with the same layers of gas in the ionospheres of these planets? We are then told:

> _The gases which reflect this light-energy from the Jerusem upper ionosphere back to the ground are very similar to those in the Urantia upper air belts which are concerned with the auroral phenomena of your so-called northern lights, although these are produced by different causes. On Urantia it is this same gas shield which prevents the escape of the terrestrial broadcast waves, reflecting them earthward when they strike this gas belt in their direct outward flight. In this way broadcasts are held near the surface as they journey through the air around your world._ (<a id="a46_577"></a>[UB 46:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p1_6))

We are told here that these reflective phenomena are not of the same nature everywhere. But in the two cases mentioned, that of Jerusem and that of Urantia, these are radiant emissions coming from these two planets and remaining there as if imprisoned. We can therefore suppose that what acts as a screen in one direction also acts as a screen in the other direction. This is what makes these worlds invisible, as we are told.

But, for a distant spectator, if the luminous energies coming from space are sent back outwards, should this phenomenon not appear to him as manifesting itself by their pure and simple disappearance?

Indeed, what allows us to distinguish where the light energy comes from is the existence of the obstacles it encounters. In the two cases cited, these are emissions sent back to the worlds concerned which thus act as a screen on all sides. But, with regard to external energies, they must necessarily be reflected towards the cosmic vault where they dissipate into the infinity of space without encountering surfaces large enough to make them visible to our observer.

Aren't sets of architectural planets of this sort simply what our astronomers call “black holes”?
