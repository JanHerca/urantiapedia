“What would Jesus do?” is the title of a bestseller written by Charles M. Sheldon, which answers the vital question “What does it really mean to be a Christian?” and which can be found almost everywhere in the United States. Naturally here this small but essential question is to be considered for us in the light of our dear Revelation and not according to the concepts which have become traditional in our current Western cultures.

What would Jesus have done (meaning: in similar circumstances?) This is the question I ask myself when I read this message from Christine Baussain, thrown into the sea of our questions. Yes, what would Jesus have done, or what would he have answered if he had been asked: “Is there not a way to commune with each other in the love of our Father?” What would he have answered, in fact, to people who had just read the _Urantia Book_ and who would ask him such a question?

## What is “practice”?

We can perhaps begin to answer in Jesus' place, because this can begin to be possible for us with the help of his example in his life and in his teachings. Naturally, it is not a question of copying Jesus, we are all most often quite incapable of doing so, but there are still some who come much closer than others. Thus a Mother Theresa or an Abbé Pierre were able to understand in humility that it was first of all a question of devoting one's life to loving others. So, what does “practicing” mean if “it becomes more and more a need for us”? What do these people do, whom I personally would not canonize but whose self-denial I admire very deeply? Do they ask to commune with others or do they rather go towards others, the most miserable, to help them with all their means and all their strength? Is it their own need or the love of others that drives them? I believe that the answer is in all hearts and in all minds. But, if we are not Mother Theresa or Abbé Pierre, nor even less Jesus, and if we are incapable of walking to this point “in his steps” in his footsteps, we are still capable of becoming aware of how he acted in certain circumstances.

## The three aspects of “How to practice”.

Since we are asking ourselves how to practice, we must consider the three main aspects of this question. We have, in fact, the choice between the practice being exercised “on” others, the practice being exercised “with” others and the

practice exercised on ourselves. I think that these three practices are excellent, but we should be careful, I think, not to mix them too much, because they are particular practices which each have their own method to respect and their own specific goals to achieve.

The first, the practice on others, is undoubtedly the one that requires the most self-denial. This is why rare are those who, like Jesus, devote their lives to going towards others in the absence of any personal interest. Moreover, Jesus never asked anyone, except a few apostles, to engage in this path, and those who engage in it have the greatest merit. His method is simple but how difficult; it is about loving without expecting anything in return. This is how, when faced with others, and when asked “What would Jesus do?”, Jesus always responds with the practice of giving of oneself.

The second, practice with others, is the one that undoubtedly provides the broadest possibilities for manifesting one's love for others. Many engage in it with their own particular personal means, and we owe it to them to follow their example as much as we can. Jesus devoted himself to it completely and showed us how to approach and accomplish all the facets of this difficult enterprise. We can try to imitate him, but because this path is inherently made up of the multiplicity of people, it is often a source of particular difficulties. It is to overcome these difficulties that the vital forces of those who devote themselves to it are often devoted. Its method is teamwork, and its goal is the improvement of the general condition both collectively and individually. This second type of practice requires less self-denial and less love than the first, but to be effective it also demands many human qualities. It is a less absolute practice and therefore more within the reach of the greatest number. It does not exclude less, and rather more and more often the need to ask the question: “What would Jesus do?”

The third, the practice toward oneself, is a strictly independent affair, and is exercised by the confrontation of the personality with its Adjuster, that is to say, it is perfectly foreign to any appeal to others. Its method is worship, and its immediate aim is the wisdom of the soul. Jesus had frequent recourse to it. He withdrew and communed with the Father. The dialogue of the man Jesus with his Father was a very special prayer, having nothing to do with our customary prayers, and which took into account the three practices mentioned. We are told: _Jesus never prayed as a religious duty. To him prayer was a sincere expression of spiritual attitude, a declaration of soul loyalty, an exposition of personal devotion, an expression of thanksgiving, a means of escape from emotional tension, a prevention of conflict, an exaltation of the intellect, an ennoblement of desires, a justification of moral decisions, an enrichment of thought, a strengthening of higher tendencies, a consecration of impulse, a clarification of viewpoint, a declaration of faith, a transcendental surrender of the will, a sublime affirmation of confidence, a revelation of courage, the proclamation of a discovery, a confession of supreme devotion, the confirmation of a consecration, a technique for smoothing out difficulties, and the powerful mobilization of the combined powers of the soul to resist all human tendencies to selfishness, evil, and sin. He lived precisely this life of pious consecration to doing the will of his Father and ended it triumphantly with a prayer of this order. (<a id="a52_1582"></a>[UB 196:0.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p0_10)) We have here the whole range of what the practice of the personality could be when it wants to turn to God in him, its Monitor of Mystery. There is not in all this a hint of a quest, not a single element of asking for oneself. The question: “What would Jesus do?” should be omnipresent in our attitudes of prayer, so that they increasingly resemble those of Jesus.

## Let's revisit these three types of practice.

Dear Christine, I feel very concerned to seek “this communion between us in the love of the Father” that you call for. And if others join us in doing this, I will be as happy as you. But, is there a fourth type of practice that I have missed? If so, then I pray with you that whoever knows it will share it with us, because it would be a new source of joy and astonishment for me. As you invite the readers of the Urantian Link, “let's talk about it!” Nevertheless, since it is, as you say, a question of seeking “a means of communing between us in the love of the Father”, I must examine whether this means does not already exist in the three practices mentioned above. However, upon examination, I find that each of them is an effective means of doing this. Let's examine them again one by one.

The complete abnegation of the first type of practice is, I think, to be ruled out again. It is clearly not on this attitude that we can count, because its character of absoluteness rather requires individual conduct, although it is moreover the most eminent way of communing with the Father by communing disinterestedly with his children in misfortune. We can also again eliminate the third, the practice with oneself which is a matter between oneself and God. There remains the second practice, that which is exercised with others. Let us examine it carefully.

The two possible methods for “communing together in the love of the Father”.

Since the practice carried out “with” others seems the most accessible to the greatest number, let us examine the two methods which apparently give us access to “communion together in the love of the Father”. These two methods have in common the fact that they are practiced and therefore must be considered one like the other within the framework of a community, small or large. Each person therefore has to position themselves in relation to this community, and this, in the love of the Father. What are they?

The first, it seems to me, is to listen to one's own inclinations and to look for other similar inclinations in others; this is what I would call “the attitude of prayer.” and it is, in this case, a prayer towards our brothers and not towards the Father.

The second, it seems to me, is to aspire to seek what the will of the Father is in such and such a circumstance, and this attitude joins our question from the beginning: “What would Jesus do?” It is what I would call “the attitude of adoration.” And here it is a question of adoration manifested by the acts of a united group.

To choose between these two methods the one which is clearly indicated to us in the life and teachings of Jesus, let us turn to The Urantia Book:

Did Jesus, in the midst of his apostles or in the crowd, not commune with them in the love of the Father? Was his conduct communion with the Father or not? Of course, he was in perfect communion with the Father when he taught them in small or large groups! Some adhered to this communion, others much less, still others did not commune at all. But in any case it was the most evident communion between men, since then, Jesus accomplished and strove to make them accomplish the will of the Father. I believe that the only valid practice to commune in the love of the Father is to accomplish his will! Apart from the three practices mentioned above, I definitely do not know of any others, because they sum up the will of the Father, namely that his will be done by worshiping him (practice towards oneself with the Adjuster), and by loving his children, our Urantian brothers, through our actions, whether by total self-denial to relieve them when they are in need (practice exercised “on” others), or by integrating into groups which strive to accomplish this will (practice exercised “with” others.)

Oh, of course, I understand this call for a “communion together in the love of the Father.” We all feel, I believe, this “need” for warmth and understanding that we think we can find in others; but this is a prayer, a desire, a quest and not an act of worship, an effort. Now, the will of the Father, as it is described to us everywhere, is made of efforts on our part and not of seeking ourselves through others. I believe that loving others is, at any level, working for them, even especially if they are not aware of it. We have all done

the effort of reading The Urantia Book and we enjoy telling each other how we made this wonderful discovery and how we understand it. But all this does not constitute the will of the Father, but only the inclination that we have to look at ourselves through our actions. We even go so far as to look at ourselves and comfort ourselves in our faith by relying on the story of the experiences of our brothers and sisters; and we ask for more. Of course, why not? But naturally we must see in this case that it is not a question of worship, but only of prayer, and as it is said above, of prayer to our brothers and sisters, that is to say most often of prayer over oneself in search of others and not of oneself in search of the Father. In this case it is good I believe to recall what the Book says about prayer in relation to worship: _Worship is sufficient in itself. Prayer incorporates an element of interest for oneself or for another creature. This is the great difference between worship and prayer. True worship involves absolutely no request for oneself or any other element of personal interest. We simply worship God because of our conception of what He is. Worship asks nothing and hopes nothing for the worshiper._ (<a id="a74_1228"></a>[UB 5:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p3_3))

## What if the Life and teachings of Jesus had not been told to us?

We all aspire more or less to borrow parts of Jesus' teaching; that is what I have just done. But I have often wondered what would have become of The Urantia Book if the “Life and Teachings of Jesus” had not been incorporated into it. Indeed, today we rely essentially on the teachings of Jesus and on the exemplary acts of his life to guide our thinking in certain circumstances and our actions in the best of cases. But what would become of our thinking, what would become of our actions, if we only had to take note of the first three parts of The Urantia Book? Let us therefore warmly thank these stubborn and well-informed Midwayers who have allowed us to better integrate this notion of “collective communion in the love of our Father;” For thus, following the example of Jesus, we can better understand the meaning of this expression, we can much better represent the scene.

## Learn to “Commune together in the Father’s love.”

What is this scene that Jesus wanted to show us, when he spoke to us so warmly about the Father? What is this scene that he described to us by declaring us brothers and sisters universally? What is this scene if not that of a Father and his children? And this scene is an image for us if we represent it in its ideal aspect, the one that is appropriate when we refer to the Father of all things and his children in all universes. Does not the communion of all these children in the love of this Father consist for these children precisely in

to be obedient, to respect and do his will? I believe that we can all easily understand from such a scene what is meant by the expression “communing together in the love of the Father.” It is about behaving as respectful children towards the Father, the first commandment of Jesus, and to help each other between brothers and sisters, the second commandment of Jesus. Then we will increasingly give the image of a united family.

All this is amply explained to us in The Urantia Book, which is why, for me, communion with the Father, whether individual or collective, begins first with attentive respect for this Revelation which strives to enlighten us on all the universal realities of its Creation. This is why we must first read and reread to always better understand what the Revelation is trying to teach us. It is in this, in my opinion, that we must say and repeat that the Revelation is first and foremost the subject of very attentive study. Indeed, the Revelation is a tool; it is the ideal tool to fight against general ignorance and individual blindness; it is the tool of the consciousness which wants to awaken; it is the tool, finally, of the mind against its inclinations towards indifference. We have to use it wisely, for we are told: _The mortal mind is a temporary intellectual system loaned to human beings for the duration of a material life, and we are also told that according to the way in which we use this mind, we accept or reject the potential for eternal existence. The mind is about the only fraction of universal reality that we possess and that is subject to our will._ What we decide today is therefore of capital importance. And I think of those frescoes carved and painted on the temples of Egypt where the soul is weighed according to a particular ceremony at the end of death. It is of these painted scenes of the ancients that I think when I read what follows: _The soul — the morontia self — will faithfully depict the accumulation of temporal decisions that the mortal self has made._ (<a id="a86_1598"></a>[UB 111:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_5))

This is what I had to say in response to Christine Baussain's invitation. The desire to commune together is common to all of us, and each of us has to find for himself what this communion should be for himself, which he is led to desire so much after a first reading of The Urantia Book. In all circumstances, should we not always ask ourselves the question: “What would Jesus do?” With Christine, therefore, I invite other readers to share their thoughts on this recurring subject, specific to all readers.
