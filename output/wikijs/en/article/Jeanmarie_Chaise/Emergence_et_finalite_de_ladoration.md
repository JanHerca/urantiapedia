(What is personal fusion with the Adjuster)


> “_<ins>In time</ins>, thought leads to wisdom and wisdom leads to worship. <ins>In eternity</ins>, worship leads to wisdom and results in the finality of thought._”
> 
> | We are given to think that: if the effort of the Personality to merge with the Adjuster can only be accomplished by the coordinated action of worship and wisdom, this action itself will only really take place with the oh so effective assistance of the Adjuster. The Personality and the Adjuster are allied as soon as the Personality takes note of the presence of the Adjuster.

A parallel must therefore be drawn between worship and wisdom on the one hand and the Personality and the Adjuster on the other. On the one hand, we know that worship is the value upon which the Personality must attempt to direct all its attention and all our efforts; on the other hand, we sense that wisdom is the value upon which the Adjuster’s efforts are always directed. Thus, even in our earthly existence, if the Personality can make itself sufficiently sensitive to the efforts of the Adjuster, it must become capable of raising its level of worship to the level of the wisdom with which it feels pervaded when it is in earnest listening to its inner voice. It is between worship and wisdom that the bond between Personality and Adjuster is formed; and as this bond becomes closer, it eventually becomes fusional. In this sense, we can say that the part of the Personality is fulfilled through worship, because through this realization, it puts itself in direct contact with the God who dwells within it. Similarly, we can say that the part of the Adjuster is fulfilled through wisdom which, through its pregnant confidentiality, opens the way to the most sincere aspirations of the Personality.

- Worship is the mental assistant on which the Personality must rely to open itself to the inner voice of the Adjuster who is God in it.
- Wisdom is the mental assistant on which the Adjuster relies to offer the Personality an opening onto eternity

For, “_the Thought Adjuster is the cosmic window through which a finite creature may, through sincere worship and loyal belief in the gospel of the kingdom, gain insight into the certain and divine aspects of the unlimited Deity, the Universal Father.” ([UB 103:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p0_1))

Let us reflect for a moment upon the place of worship, and hence upon its meaning and value, as we consider it before or after fusion with the Adjuster. Indeed, a Solitary Messenger of Orvonton describes to us these two facets of worship, first as a mode of emergence and then as a mode of finality. He says first:

> “_In time, thinking leads to wisdom and wisdom leads to worship; in eternity, worship leads to wisdom, and wisdom eventuates in the finality of thought._” ([UB 112:2.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p2_13))

This is indeed the process we use when we extend our efforts of thought toward the existence of the Eternal. It does not seem to us that we can access the Revelation of the Father otherwise than by a persistent strain toward wisdom, and we have just seen that wisdom seems to be the prerogative of the Adjuster in us. We have just seen also that once the voice of wisdom is heard, it becomes much easier for us to give ourselves entirely to worship. This first proposition is therefore well acquired by thought. Under these conditions, what is worship, if not the accomplished expression of our sincere motives and our decisions, our determinations and our supreme desires oriented toward the will of the Father and constituting real and effective cooperation with the Adjuster?

The Lone Messenger of Orvonton then said:

> “_In time, thinking leads to wisdom and wisdom leads to worship; in eternity, worship leads to wisdom, and wisdom eventuates in the finality of thought._” ([UB 112:2.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p2_13))

What does this new assertion mean? Do we not see that this is only the first proposition whose terms are now reversed? Yes! We see it clearly! And this constitutes an enigma as is found here and there in The Urantia Book, an enigma intended to sharpen our sense of the divine within us, our sense of future realities, our sense of the realities which await us in eternity.

According to this double expression of the reversed roles of thought, wisdom and adoration, as in a mirror, as by reflectivity, it appears that thought and adoration are always linked by wisdom, but that one and the other, according to the alternative, are considered, one as emerging, the other as the finality pursued. Thus, in the first proposition, which is exercised in temporality, thought is emerging and tends to accomplish it in adoration by means of wisdom. We know this approach well, because it is ours at present. But in the great proposition, the data are reversed, this time it is adoration which, in eternity, emerges from materiality and tends to accomplish itself in thought by means of wisdom. What does this reversal mean?

This is the moment to kindly remember that through the exercise of wisdom, the Adjuster lingers alongside the worshiping personality, and the goal they pursue is indeed the worship of a being considered divine who now knows the experientiality of the long journey to recover the thought of God, who seeks and finds Him. It is in this sense that we must understand, without doubt, the expression at first disconcerting: “The Personality is a level of deified reality”.

The significance of worship must be understood as the goal, the finality of the prefusion life with the Adjuster, while its postfusion value is one of emergence which must ultimately carry the Personality to the finaliter state within the mind of God.
