One of the remarkable particularities, when one becomes aware of THE URANTIA BOOK, is the almost constant reference that one finds there in the establishment of its organization according to the mathematical ordering of its essential components. It quickly appears to the reader that numbers play a leading role, and in particular the decade and especially the heptad which, respectively, organize more than the space and the conformation of things. And this observation brings an additional confirmation to the order in which the Deity wanted to unify and coordinate all his creation.

For example, we are told in <a id="a36_28"></a>[UB 13:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/13#p0_1): “_BETWEEN the central Isle of Paradise and the most central of the planetary circuits of Havona are intercalated in space three minor circuits of special spheres. The inner circuit is composed of the seven secret spheres of the Universal Father; the second group is formed by the seven luminous worlds of the Eternal Son and outside there are the seven immense spheres of the Infinite Spirit, the worlds constituting the administrative headquarters of the Seven Master Spirits._” And in <a id="a36_558"></a>[UB 3:5.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p5_15): “_In the universe of Havona, there are a billion perfect worlds with their perfect inhabitants.._” These worlds are distributed according to seven concentric circles.

“A billion perfect worlds with their perfect inhabitants.” presents the confirmation provided by the number 10 to the ninth power or the number 1000 to the power of 3. But this number “a billion” is so to speak “more than perfect”, because not content with being so by the number 10, it is also and in a conjugate manner with it by the number “7”. This assertion is proven by a demonstration answering the question: <ins>Since the worlds of Havona are distributed perfectly according to “seven” concentric circuits, how many worlds is each of these circuits composed of?</ins> Everyone can try to find this perfection by numbers before reading me further here. Otherwise, here is the solution:

From closest to Paradise to closest to the dark gravity bodies, the seven circuits have more and more worlds, according to a progression calculated by means of the combined data of the decade and the heptad, to finally total a billion worlds. To prove this, we must first take note of the fact that the decade is the set of ten symbols of our decimal system whose axial symbol is 5, as indicated here:

<p style="text-align:center;">
(0) 1 2 3 4 <ins>5</ins> 6 7 8 9 (10)
</p>

First: The number 10 is not a simple symbol, because it is composed of two symbols: 1 and 0. By this I mean that it cannot be the origin of the principle calculations. This is why, in the decade, we must first take into account its axial symbol, that is to say “5”. This symbol thus representing the decade combined with the symbol of the heptad, “7” provides us with the first initial element of the sought number which must constitute the number of worlds of the inner circle of Havona, that is 5 x 7 = <ins>35</ins>

Second: We must consider that, mathematically, creation presents itself as the infinite unity divided by the symbol “7”, since we see everywhere that this distribution is reproduced everywhere, and even in the number of effusions that a Creator Son of the universe must accomplish to access the sovereignty of his own creation. We will therefore have “1” divided by “7”, which gives the result: 0.14 2857, a succession which is reproduced indefinitely.

But, mathematically, we have only considered half of the decade in our “firstly”. This is why we must make up for it here by using the other half. The second part of the number representing the worlds of the first circle of the worlds of Havona will therefore be the product of what was missing from my firstly, namely “5” which is multiplied by my secondly, namely "0, 14 28 57 ...

The second element constituting the number of worlds in the first circle of Havona will therefore be: 14 28 57 x 5 = <ins>71 42 85</ins>.

The number of worlds in the first circle of Havona should therefore be: <ins>35 71 42 85</ins> (to within 1 world, we will see why.)

The successive and increasingly outer circumscribed circles will respectively count double, triple, quadruple, quintuple and sextuple of this number of worlds of the most central circle. The calculation is therefore very simple, and it is presented below on more columns to explain the distribution of <ins>4 worlds</ins> which are distributed as indicated on the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th circles, because they are the concretization of the retentions generated by the indefinite character of the numbers present, the succession of retentions of 3 to which is added the unit: This number “4” is also found present in other calculations of the same kind concerning the Urantia Book.

| &nbsp; | Withholdings: | **333 333 3<ins>3</ins>** | **333 32**
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| First circle: | 35,714,285 (+1) | **714,285** | = 35,714,286 worlds |
| Second circle: | 71,428,571 | **428,571** | = 71,428,571 worlds |
| Third circle: | 107,142,857(+1) | **142,855** | = 107,142,858 worlds |
| Fourth circle: | 142,857,142 | **857,140** | = 142,857,142 worlds |
| Fifth circle: | 178,571,428 (+1) | **571,425** | = 178,571,429 worlds |
| Sixth circle: | 214,285,714 | **285,710** | = 214,285,714 worlds |
| Seventh circle | <ins>249,999,999(+1)</ins> | **<ins>999,999</ins>** | = 250,000,000 worlds |

Total worlds of the Seven Circles of Havona:
999999999 + 1 = 1,000,000,000

999,999,999 worlds + 1 = 1,000,000,000 worlds

The proportionality between each circuit is therefore of the order of one twenty-eighth. We should not expect less from perfection. Indeed, just after the hexadecimal which is the first <ins>perfect symbol digit</ins>, 28 (4x7) is the <ins>first perfect number</ins>.
