## WELCOME TO THE FAMILY

***The Urantia Book*** emphasizes the family as the fundamental social unit and as a crucial factor in the development of individuals and society. In this study aid, we examine the family as the basic building block of human civilization.

We begin by examining the unity and diversity within the divine family, and God as a loving and merciful father to humanity. God loves each of us as an unique child in the heavenly family, which leads us to recognize our place in the family of God and the benefits we gain from understanding this network of family relationships.

We explore the evolutionary origins of the family institution, beginning with how marriage progressed from primitive to modern times and the differences between men and women. We study the development of the family from the primitive form to the more complex and organized family units that exist today, including issues of gender and sexual equality. The family is seen as essential to the physical, social, and moral development of individuals. It provides a supportive environment for the upbringing of children and is seen as a crucial factor in the transmission of cultural values and moral norms. We examine the responsibility of parents in the upbringing of children, emphasizing the importance of education and training in the early years of a child's life. While recognizing the practical and social aspects of the family, we also examine the spiritual dimensions of family life and the potential for spiritual growth and development within the family context. As an example, we study the family life of Jesus and the many qualities he learned as he grew from childhood to early adulthood.

***The Urantia Book*** indicates the importance of education and training and we study how our education system could change in order to develop more wisdom in children. We examine future trends and developments for the family in this difficult time of transition for the planet as society becomes increasingly complex. True religion and family life can help promote a better society in many ways. We can learn from these planets established in the light and life we aspire to. Love, mutual trust and faith come together in family life so that we can express our highest potential and experience the joys of love and companionship. Almost everything of value in society has its roots in the family.

> Marriage is the mother of all human institutions, for it leads directly to home founding and home maintenance, which is the structural basis of society. The family is vitally linked to the mechanism of self-maintenance; it is the sole hope of race perpetuation under the mores of civilization, while at the same time it most effectively provides certain highly satisfactory forms of self-gratification. The family is man’s greatest purely human achievement, combining as it does the evolution of the biologic relations of male and female with the social relations of husband and wife.

This study does not replace ***The Urantia Book***. Most of the texts are taken from _The Urantia Book_, but some pages are the result of my own research, which provides additional insight into the concepts.
