The human being, in his continuous evolution, has been conditioned and subjugated by religious power; a religious power of such social influence that, throughout history, and with the excuse of its spiritualization, but with hidden intentions of manipulative and political control, have turned it into a skeptical being with an almost total rejection of said religions “saviors”.

Because of all these falsehoods, hypocrisies, dogmas, myths, rituals, etc. that they have used with the intention of keeping it in the most opaque ignorance and lack of culture, these religions have managed to create a model of a skeptical society, devoid of values such as respect, morality, ethics... a human profile so incredulous, selfish and without hope for the future that the coexistence system has been disfigured to the point of absurdity, an irrational coexistence, where consumerism, ostentation, speculation, pollution and many more nonsense are the bases that sustain this “poor” society.

It is sad that, being a technologically and scientifically advanced civilization that we are, religions in general have achieved a worrying gap between science and spiritual philosophy. They have made values such as inner growth and awakening of consciousness hardly have meaning; a worrying social imbalance that is quite dangerous, because science, with all its technological advances, and without a solid ethical-moral foundation that harmonizes these great differences between the two, could lead us to chaos and even our possible annihilation as a civilization.

We should strive to motivate those skeptical hearts, bring a message of real and credible hope to those sleeping and anesthetized brothers; provide a breath of fresh air to that disenchanted society that senses a future without a decent future; a society that unconsciously (because it has no other options left) follows the dynamics dictated by economic and media interests (advertising-consumerism, pollution, multinationals), a manipulative dynamic whose interest and final result are the succulent benefits for its investors.

We are talking about complete societies, with broken and disoriented hopes that seek and yearn for an authentic credible and sincere truth... without deception!... A reality that excites our souls, that eliminates mistrust between us; certainties that dignify us as people above economic interests, racial differences, religions, nationalisms, etc.

So I wonder: how to bring that authentic truth to the world, if today society no longer believes in anything, due to this mental contamination of lies and deceit by all religious leaders in complicity with politics?

Because the truth exists!! It is not a utopia!!

It is not necessary to go to mass, or cross yourself, or prostrate yourself on a rug, or chant mantras; It is not necessary to follow any guru, teacher, shaman, guide, enlightened person, priest, pastor, elder, or leader who dictates what we have to do. We just need to believe in ourselves! Believing and feeling that this truth is authentic; having a broad vision, a perspective with a cosmic focus... it is simply a matter of letting ourselves be guided by our hearts, by our intuitive insight.

If, in addition to paying attention to our interior, we add something as familiar and simple as our ability to make decisions, that privilege can become wisdom for intelligent minds, knowledge that allows us to choose our destiny (sheep or truth seekers). We call that privilege _free will_, but it is not a human invention! It is the main universal law granted to us by that Creative Source that prevents us from being manipulated by anyone. What are we waiting for then? We already have all the ingredients to evolve as a society (personality, character, intuition, insight, free will, etc.)!

Really! Is someone with these minimal abilities capable of believing that we are alone in this immense universe? unique? A whole universe exclusive to us? Please!

I have never had the slightest extrasensory or paranormal manifestation throughout my life; and based on the faculties that this Source, or Unique and Eternal Energy grants us... I repeat, faculties such as insight, intuition, coherence, intellectual capacity that allow decision-making... I declare that we are not alone in the universe, manifest (by pure coherence) that there are innumerable solar systems with their corresponding inhabited planets! I am convinced of the reality of extraterrestrial life!

But currently, those of us who do believe face a great difficulty: due to the absence of truth in these religions, it is possible that this skeptical society does not believe in us either when we try to come up with credible information, with coherent and unmanipulated messages, with logical reasoning. about universal realities. This society should not associate us with typical popular religions. Religions that, as we have considered above, distort the truth according to their own interests. How then can we sensitize a frustrated and skeptical society? How can we open hearts and awaken consciences with the risk that these universal truths are interpreted as yet another hoax or religion?

It will be very difficult for them to come out of their skepticism and believe again in expressions and concepts such as: _God, Holy Spirit, Jesus, angels_, etc.

When considering the possibility of using this type of well-worn expressions, disrespectful concepts used with manipulative interests that cause immediate rejection, it leads me to the reasoning that, in order to try to reverse those incredulous and skeptical spirits, in addition to demonstrating with life examples, our message should be more current, more appropriate to our times.

It is evident that it will not work for those believers who are convinced that their religion is unique and exclusive; However, there are many souls who distrust what is established, are restless seekers of a true meaning of life, looking for an inner fulfillment that neutralizes their worries, an existence that does not imply pain, suffering, etc. There are many people (brothers), who hope to find a real and credible hope, an illusion that does not disappoint them.

In this globalized society we are an immensity of search engines that are not satisfied with what this society offers us in its current format; there is a misfit community that does believe that beyond our planet there are other intelligences, other similar or different beings, more advanced or backward.

Those of us who truly believe in that universal truth, in a truth of hope after this physical life, a truth where we will continue making mistakes and learning from them, but always with the right to decide... if we sincerely believe that we can enjoy other lives, great adventures loaded with attractive premonitions, with wonderful opportunities to continue perfecting ourselves until we reach our final home, up to that eternal light... then, and only then, could we conclude that all universal energies must proceed, emanate, originate, be born from an inexhaustible original source.

If we logically assume that this Source is intelligent and creative, we should also accept that said Source is aware of concepts such as _chaos_, _order_ and _love_. So, if as humans we already know from experience that chaos is the absence of order and that it can lead us to destruction, and we also know that order and love are synonymous with “life”... such certainty should convince us and fill us with hope with a perspective of universal life and eternal.

If that Original Source has to create or design something, it has to be based on energy of order and love, because otherwise it would not make sense. We ask ourselves: what can that intelligent Source do to make itself known? How can you teach us its entire structure, its administrative management and its universal laws? How to know it directly, if we are not mentally prepared as basic and dual beings, as well as incredulous skeptics?

For pure coherence, said original Source should provide us with those necessary tools and special beings, with fundamental, logical and understandable teachings for our intellectual and cultural level. We must understand then that only and exclusively with those personalities or “elder brothers” that our universal government provides us with, we will be able to understand, respect and love its laws... wise brothers, with elevated but understandable concepts and messages for our limited minds closest to the instinctive, to the animal

That great intelligent energy Source that designs and puts into practice the “Great Universal Scenario” defines Itself as Father, and as such, knows that only love energy is the only one that can make all the universal machinery work. neatly.

At this point, I consider it logical and coherent that this Great Source, Principal Actor or Master Architect has the power to create a Son, a first-born Son equal to the Father, also with his own personality, with spiritual energy and individual characteristics that are familiar to us. and understandable to our physical mind.

In the same way, and as a result of both main actors (Father and Son) a third actor can arise, and in fact arises, also with his own personality called Infinite Spirit; For a better understanding, we could define it as that mental energy that moves us to understand and feel the high and altruistic need to serve our neighbor, our brothers. An energy that induces us to any merciful gesture for the common good.

This would be, in a simple and understandable way, the “Original-Universal Family”, from which the rest of the universal spiritual personalities will be born or co-created, who will collaborate with us and show us the way in a simple way according to our concepts, language, and human culture. They will teach us the different ways, ways, laws and elevated thoughts to understand them, believe in their message, and evolve as future universal creatures towards our natural home. And this is so! This will happen! But with a backpack well loaded with experiences that will be useful to serve other beings, beings that behind us are beginning their own universal journey in other galaxies and worlds; and so forever!

Moral: to evolve spiritually, we do not need to be saints, nor accept them; it is enough to sincerely believe from the heart that there is a Designer of the Universe, that he is real and that one must learn to love him; feel within you that we are truly his children and that therefore he is our father and loves us. Finally, and if we are really capable of believing in it, for simple and pure coherence, we should also believe that all human beings are brothers.
