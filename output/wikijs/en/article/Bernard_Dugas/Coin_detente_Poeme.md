## Lumens

You, heart of my body, Flame
Who weaves my thoughts with your Truth
To bind me to you by building my Soul
You thus offer me all of Eternity

You, center of my life, divine radiance
Who plots with my Destiny
To strengthen me throughout the Path
Your only desire is to see us engaged
You, intimate presence, Glow of Paradise
You don't care about the body except to serve
To do your work, simple support of Life
You want to sublimate me by making him suffer

You, God in me, Sparkling Fragrance
Speak for me, to the author of my Life
To thank him for his gift of Existence
And tell Him that even if it’s hard, ah! Life is good

Bernard Dugas
