<p style="text-align:center;">

You, heart of my body, Flame<br>
Who weaves my thoughts with your Truth<br>
To bind me to you by building my Soul<br>
You thus offer me all of Eternity.<br>
<br>
You, center of my life, divine radiance<br>
Who plots with my Destiny<br>
To strengthen me along the way<br>
Your only desire is to see us engaged.<br>
<br>
You, intimate presence, glow of Paradise<br>
You don't care about the body except to serve<br>
To do your work, simple support of life<br>
You want to sublimate me by making him suffer.<br>
<br>
You, intimate presence, Glow of Paradise<br>
You don't care about the body except to serve<br>
to do your work, simple support of life<br>
You want to sublimate me by making him suffer.<br>
<br>
You, God in me, Sparkling Fragrance<br>
Speak for me, to the author of my life<br>
To thank him for his gift of Existence<br>
And tell him that even if it's hard, ah! Life is good.<br>
