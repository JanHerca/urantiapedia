In the slow harmony that the Universe forms
a pinhead was named Earth.
She turned endlessly and her sister the Moon
played hide and seek with her on the dune.

Quadrupeds or bipeds, microbes and plants
were very few in number and praised the Most High
to feel so good in such a peaceful place.
In short, everything was going well. But the Evil One, subtle,
realized one fine evening that things in this world
were going too simply and the world map
he suddenly decided to turn everything upside down:
firstly, question of apple, Adam and Eve too,
no one has ever known this taste before
and everyone enjoys biting into this fruit.
My faith, some discomforts came to disturb
of the overly greedy couple all serenity
but... if we had to always think about tomorrow
hell, you know, we would never do anything!

There was also Cain and that dirty eye
whose gaze pierced through mourning...

There was the flood and its forty days
there was Jesus and his excess of love,
Judah, the betrayals and for the death of the Just
the first of the Crosses which remained illustrious...

Finally, what misfortunes, in fact, we celebrated
since Lucifer interfered with our soul!
and yet his power continued to grow
and as the years go by, he becomes more and more idolized.
Our passion for him is such today
that he himself is surprised to have so much credit:
from wars to genocides, from crimes to attacks
assassins and pirates intertwine their steps
so that terrorism becomes the law in all
places and that the Evil One sits in God's place...

Instead of God...?
the Evil One protests
you want to laugh, you rascals,
this is not serious!
so you don't know
that I retire?
and I say it loudly
I made the planet
such a mess
that I leave serene
to have over the centuries
to confuse so many humans
and destroys the planet

Really? replied
God, how plumb Lucifer!
do you think, by golly,
to have destroyed the Earth
with your speculations..?
you forget a little too much
that man has his image
modeled on the Most High
and that Divine Love
that he thus carries within him
is the armor that in vain
strikes his enemies.
Come back to you Satan!
whatever wrong you have done
love will be greater
than your greatest misdeeds
and I can predict you
that if one day finally
you like to smile
to love...
we will become friends!
