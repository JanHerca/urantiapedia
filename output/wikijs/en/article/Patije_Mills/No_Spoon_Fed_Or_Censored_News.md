Six-O-Six is a quality newspaper! (I like the idea of the Part I and Part II so that Part II can be skipped by those who are sensitive to the information.)

Because I continue to keep my physical senses open to all information — which is then filtered through my communication with my Thought Adjuster, I feel you are doing a good job in reporting the “news” which comes through your office.

Editing is sometimes a very unpleasant task because readers have the ability to “second-guess” and criticize everything. Since the purpose of newsletters is to share information and personal perceptions and/or opinions, it is right and intellectually healthy to differ in our acceptance of all articles in the news source.

Just because we have _The URANTIA Book_ doesn't mean that we are all stamped out alike in feelings, intelligence, and abilities to perceive truth. However, because we all have _The URANTIA Book_ and know about our Thought Adjuster and the Spirit of Truth, none of us should be afraid to read and discern truth of any news reporting for ourselves. I for one, would be sorely insulted if I had to have my news “spoon-fed” and censored by any other than my own intelligence guided by my unseen helpers!

It is my life experience “motto” to always **follow Truth from wherever it comes and to wherever it takes us!** We cannot continue in a mistake unless we close our senses and our spiritual ears to the shenanigans of the ego, which usually takes its cues from out-of-balance emotions — fear.

I have 4 study groups in my home. _The URANTIA Book_ readers who attend are from different religious backgrounds ... and are currently practicing many forms of religion. Consequently, we have some very interesting and informing conversations — which quickly become arguments when any ONE person misunderstands the purpose of the discussion. If we can retain our sense of balance and realize that those not **taught**, or practicing a certain form of religion may not **understand a certain point** of reference, we can inform and teach. Perhaps they have been taught by their religious teachers that the point raised by another — taught by religious teachers from another religion — was wrong. Many times it is as simple as semantics — use of the word in different ways. As soon as they **understand** the situation from the second person's perspective, peace once again ensures the rest of the discussion and everyone has learned.

_The URANTIA Book_ teaches us to learn about others' religion. By understanding, one can peacefully accept the other point of view. The word tolerance has been used to mean: **“I accept your way of thinking as wrong but I won't fight you”**. This is not understanding, nor peaceful co-existence.

This can be applied to the news in your Part II of Six-O-Six. Let's at least know about and discern the truth, not hide our heads and intellects in URANTIA Fundamentalism which might make us blind to a new revelation. At this time, I personally have little interest in what is going on in Sedona, Arizona — even feel there is a great deal of “tares planted with the wheat” (Jesus' parable of Truth and untruth growing together until known by its fruit) — however, I have no problem with keeping up with developments until I can make a decision based on intelligence and spiritual knowing.

A few years ago I was impressed by a combination of truth from _The URANTIA Book_ ([UB 117:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p1_1) and [UB 126:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p2_5)) and having shared it (in a personal way) one artist in my study groups drew it out and framed it which now hangs above us when we study and discuss many points of truth and opinion. May I share them with you?
