August- 1973



Three years ago the Executive Committee asked members of our Committee to offer ideas for the promotion of Brotherhood growth and activity. An abundance of ideas was forthcoming; however more realistic is our interest in the steady stream of letters that come in to headquarters testifying to interest in the book and its acceptance. Much like the Thought Adjusters the Book has its own work to do. The primary job of the Urantia Book is to stimulate spiritual thinking and promote the inner life. Definitely secondary, though consequential, is the fostering of this Brotherhood of Believers, which we, in the implementation of our Constitution are striving to do. We all foresee a need for this Committee just because we have something of immeasurable value to share with the world.

Bernard Burton- Chairman
