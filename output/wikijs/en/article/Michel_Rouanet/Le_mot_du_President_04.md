On the occasion of the transfer of the head office from Paris to Marseille, I would like to thank Georges and Marlène Michelson-Dupont on behalf of all the members who have made up the AFLUB since its creation in 1996. Indeed, not only are Georges and Marlène founding members of the AFLUB (see list in the appendix of the new statutes) who actively worked on the transition from CERDH to AFLUB, now under the aegis of the UAI, but they hosted its head office in their premises at the Urantia Foundation SA France for eleven years.

The proximity of the two structures during this first decade of existence was the occasion for a fruitful interaction between the two entities, one participating in the mission of the other: sale of UB and social activity of studying UB were thus closely linked.

With maturity, these two structures gradually became independent: from 2004, the Foundation used commercial distribution networks for UB sales. The AFLUB had to find solutions for its own administration.

The decision taken this year by the new board of directors of the AFLUB and ratified in an extraordinary general meeting concerning the transfer of the head office to the new secretary of the AFLUB in Marseille (see left column) completes the separation of the activities of the Foundation and the AFLUB. Although both remain united by the same objective, to disseminate the teachings of the UB, they take two different paths: translations/editions/sales for the first, social study organization for the second.

Thanks again to Georges and Marlène for holding the hand of the AFLUB during these early years.

Now autonomous, our association is now committed to the path of essential growth before one day reaching its full maturity. It has just equipped itself, at the 2007 extraordinary general meeting, with a board of directors of twelve people and a committee of around twenty regional intermediaries to support the president and his traditional executive office in the mission that you entrust to them. But let us not be mistaken: these two new, still embryonic entities must find their identities and their work rhythms so as not to remain empty and sterile shells. The AFLUB still only brings together around a hundred people scattered across the national territory, and can only live and grow through the active participation of all, each according to their skills and availability, in their region and/or within the national management teams.

The summer of 2007 marks a new beginning.

Let us hope that we will be able to give or maintain a fraternal soul to our association so as not to become a marginal society of intellectual connivance.

Best regards to all.
