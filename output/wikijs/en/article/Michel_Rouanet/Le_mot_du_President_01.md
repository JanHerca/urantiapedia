Very dear members of the French-speaking Association of Readers of the URANTIA Book, as I take up my new duties as president of the AFLUB, I would like to thank you for the trust you have placed in me. Indeed, on the occasion of the General Assembly held on Saturday, June 24, 2006, you invested me with the heavy and honorable responsibility of leading our fraternal association.

Rest assured that I will do my best, with my team and each of you, to carry out the mission with which you entrust me. Like all of you, I am a volunteer for this work for which I will have to free up time and energy through judicious arbitration in my family, social and professional life: I am therefore counting on your support for the life of our association, each according to their skills, possibilities, means and tastes. I will take charge, with my team, of giving it direction and coordinating its actions. The task is great and new artisans are always welcome.

I hope that our association will be a breeding ground, open to our world, of women and men from diverse backgrounds but recognizing each other as brothers and sisters in the same Father; a place of warm meetings and mutual listening; a circle of in-depth study and sharing of the teachings provided by the 5th Epochal Revelation; finally, a laboratory of personal and fraternal experience without which there can be no real recognition of the revealed teachings.

I will ensure that our action is also part of the dissemination and teaching missions that we give ourselves in partnership with other associations in other countries, under the aegis of the Urantia Association International.

Finally, I would like to pay tribute to my predecessors Séverin, François and Georges. On this tenth anniversary of the AFLUB, I thank them for the progress they have made over the past decade. Please know that I feel today that I am the custodian of their legacy, which I hope to one day be able to pass on to my successor by making it fruitful and adapted to the world that will be ours at that time.

Finally, a special thought for all the elders, still among us or continuing their path in other worlds, who have faithfully worked during all these decades, sometimes in the dark, so that this saving awareness of our cosmic citizenship may spread.

I therefore place my mandate and the life of our association “under the auspices of the Supreme Being”. By praying to our Creator and his Divine Minister to give us the wisdom and energy to advance together on the path of spiritual progress.

Best to you all, in connection with our Universal Father.

President of the A.F.L.L.U.
Michel R.
