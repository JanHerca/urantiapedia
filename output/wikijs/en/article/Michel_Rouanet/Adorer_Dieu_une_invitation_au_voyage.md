Why and how to worship God? It can sometimes seem difficult to answer, simply, the question of why and especially how to worship the Universal Father.

> _You become conscious of man as your creature brother because you are already conscious of God as your Creator Father. Fatherhood is the relationship out of which we reason ourselves into the recognition of brotherhood. And Fatherhood becomes, or may become, a universe reality to all moral creatures because the Father has himself bestowed personality upon all such beings and has encircuited them within the grasp of the universal personality circuit. We worship God, first, because *he is,* then, because *he is in us,* and last, because *we are in him.*_ ([[UB 16:9.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p9_14))

By apparently answering the question of why, this explanation seems to offer us a technique of worship, a how: that of a triple movement of the soul in relation to God.

Let us try some research, some interpretative work, some hermeneutics, a solitary walk on the path to meaning:

First of all, we worship God because he is the great I AM, archetypal personality of all personality, Father of eternal and infinite Love of all Being, Host of Paradise; Center of all things, great Architect of the universe, infinite Support; Outside of space-time, he is the perfect Creator of Time and Space, of universal Origins and Destinies. Source of Good, Beauty and Truth, of Love and Forgiveness which he dispenses eternally and infinitely on all beings.

Tautological and Absolute emanating personality.

The Being at the origin of my being, but the Being outside my being, I AM.

First impulse of my soul.

The greatest act of love that He has made to each of us is to offer us the inestimable gift of His presence, within ourselves. The Center of all being is indeed at the center of ourselves. We are no longer alone, we are accompanied for eternity by our divine alter ego who only aspires to become one with us. Perhaps this experience of fusion is partially approachable while we are at this very moment in a situation of adoration?

Wherever we are, whatever the place, room, office, subway, hill, church, mosque, pagoda, temple, the Earth or the Moon, on top of mountains or under the sea, we can commune directly with Him.

The one that so many men have sought, this Grail, this Philosopher's Stone, this Great esoteric Mystery, this distiller who transforms our mind into soul has always brought us back from so many pilgrimages, so many initiatory journeys, so many crusades, so many quests across mountains, continents and seas towards....ourselves: our divine Monitor, our Changer/Adjuster/Thought Controller.

The two of us who will become Me, one day soon.

The Being in my being, I am.

Second movement of the soul.

God needs men. Because God is Us, men and women, green blue red black white, electric magnetic, on the ground or in the air, Christians Muslims Taoists Shintoists Bahais colleagues philanthropists, scientists philosophers religious clerics, sweepers and business leaders, the positive and the negative, the Beings from here and elsewhere, the great cosmic communion of Saints, the universal Ummah, the great universal Church...

The Supreme Being, this cosmic Mother who grows from the greatness of each one, a Reality which emerges and which even surpasses the simple sum of our realities. We are in Her, totally part of the evolving Deity, with and thanks to us. This human and cosmic fraternity which connects us from the 4 corners of the great Universe, from the great East to the West, from the Zenith to the Nadir, from the center to the periphery and vice versa; which connects us since the dawn of time, until this day and for eternity to come.....this Kingdom of Heaven which is coming.

The Being from our beings, WE are I.

Third movement of the soul.

> _You become conscious of man as your creature brother because you are already conscious of God as your Creator Father. Fatherhood is the relationship out of which we reason ourselves into the recognition of brotherhood. And Fatherhood becomes, or may become, a universe reality to all moral creatures because the Father has himself bestowed personality upon all such beings and has encircuited them within the grasp of the universal personality circuit. We worship God, first, because *he is,* then, because *he is in us,* and last, because *we are in him.*_ ([[UB 16:9.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p9_14))

A simple path sentence taken from a multitude of other sentences constituting a corpus of 2097 pages. A small roadmap sentence.

A daily journey in three stages.

A paradoxical invitation to **journey outside of space and time and yet here and now**, through the technique of worship, in 3 times which are only one, in 3 simultaneous impulses of the soul to God, in 3 Man-God relationships which are only one.

The soul in adoration is like the leaf which lights up, warms itself and grows in the sun.

So? When do we start?

Michel R.
