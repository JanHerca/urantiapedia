Introduction by Antonio Moya

In order to explain and try to understand the Supreme Being, I think it is best to start by talking about the origins of Reality.

The Infinite I AM is the only being in the universe that exists by itself. All other beings in creation, whether Creators or creatures, are direct or indirect derivatives of the one uncreated being, the Infinite and Absolute I AM.

Reality is divided into three descending levels: existential, transcendental, and finite. The existential level is the level that corresponds to the Deities, the transcendental to the absonite beings, and the finite is the domain of the seven superuniverses where we mortal beings live.

The Infinite I AM works on **all** the levels of Reality, and depending on the function it performs on a given level, the L.d.U. it gives a different name to that concrete manifestation of the I AM. For example: when he acts as an absolute Personality he is the Eternal Son, when he acts as a potential of the future universes he is the Unqualified Absolute, when he acts on the finite level he is the Supreme Being.

For me, the Supreme Being is the Infinite I AM, but working on the experiential levels of spacetime. God is infinite. How could God learn anything, grow in wisdom, grow in ability? This is totally foreign to the nature of God. God is existential, he is beyond experience. But through the Supreme Being, God can know what it is to have an origin, what it is to grow in experience. The Supreme Being makes up for God's lack of experience by never having been finite.

The UB tells us: “In the Deity of the Supreme, the Father-I AM has achieved relatively complete liberation from the limitations inherent in the infinite state, eternal existence, and absolute nature...by achieving liberation from eternity, the Almighty becomes meets the barriers of time...”

“All of this must be in accordance with the Father's plan, which has based finite progress on effort, creature achievement on perseverance, and personality development on faith. By thus ordering the experiential evolution of the Supreme, the Father has made it possible for finite creatures to exist in the universes...” (<a id="a58_322"></a>[Paper 115-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p7))

When the Infinite I AM differentiated Reality, it did so by separating the Potential on one side and the Manifested on the other. The potential is yet unexpressed, and is contained in the three Absolutes of potentiality. The manifested is what is already expressed, and it is expressed in the universe in three ways: the absolute thing (Island of Paradise), the absolute personality (Eternal Son) and the absolute mind (Infinite Spirit). These three manifested Absolutes are the origins of all the reality we know.

The L.d.U. he says in this regard: “The entire project of universal creation and evolution, at all experiential levels, is apparently a matter of converting potentialities into manifestations; and this transmutation equally concerns the domains of spatial power, mental power and spiritual power”.

“The apparent method by which the possibilities of the cosmos are brought into actual existence varies from level to level; in the finite, it is about experiential evolution, and in the absonite, of experiential existence”.

“The final dynamic of the cosmos consists in continuously transferring reality from the potential state to the manifested state”. ([Doc 115](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#))

“The great struggle of this age of the universe takes place between the potential and the manifested - everything that has not been expressed up to now tries to manifest itself.” (<a id="a68_180"></a>[Paper 117-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p4))

I deduce that, when in the eternity of the past the Infinite I AM divided reality into Potential and Manifested, it did so because it already had “in mind” to create the finite level, where potentials would gradually become realities over time.

The Supreme Being is the Deity of space-time, a Deity that evolves as we ourselves evolve; he is the God of the seven superuniverses, just as Michael of Nebadon is the God of our local universe. The Supreme Being is the most that we, as finite beings, can comprehend of the Infinite I AM. The Supreme is a subabsolute manifestation of the Infinite Father-I AM.

The Almighty is God Supreme working in energy-matter. The Overmind is the Supreme Being working in the realms of the mind.

The Supreme Being is evolving. Will its evolution ever end? This question becomes more meaningful when we ask ourselves if our own evolution will ever end. Today we are children of the Supreme; we grow with it. But when we are finaliters of the seventh stage and go on to search for God the Ultimate, we could become children of the Ultimate. Our destiny is therefore not to remain at the finite level. God can't stop; if we don't have a final destination, neither does he. To understand how the Supreme works, the simile of the ants is useful: they function as a single animal, as a single mind.

Everything exists in the universe, only on different levels. At the absolute level there is the here and now, the real and the potential. At the transcendental level space and time are transcended. In trying to understand all this we find ourselves with the limitations of time and space. It is the transcendentals, not God the Absolute, who create the finite level. Human beings do not create ourselves, but are created by supermortal beings.

The Supreme Being is destined to reach the maximum of the finite level. We will reach this maximum when we reach Paradise, but that does not mean that we are going to stay in it forever.

The Supreme Being will be complete when all seven superuniverses are established in light and life. We will then have existential (Havona) and experiential (superuniverse) perfection in creation.

Paper 117, <a id="a86_11"></a>[UB 117:7.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p7_12), talks about the future of the Supreme Court. Similarly, we mortals will be busy throughout eternity. Eternity cannot be an eternal nap, contrary to what other religions claim.

We have an obligation to the Supreme, and it is to develop our potentials. We are unique and irreplaceable personalities. If we do not choose to survive, the Ultimate will experience a delay in its development (<a id="a88_211"></a>[UB 117:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p4_2)). When we do something against someone we go against the unit. What a personality can contribute is not lost; the values are held in the adjusters and in the Supreme, although the potential will remain potential if it is not developed.

It is inevitable to wonder what the inhabitants of outer space will be like, although we can imagine little about it. Of course it does not make sense to say that they will have more privileges than us, or vice versa. Nor do we know if they exist or not; It is clear that they do not exist in our space-time, in our “bubble”, but they certainly exist in their absonite “bubble”, where space and time are transcended.
