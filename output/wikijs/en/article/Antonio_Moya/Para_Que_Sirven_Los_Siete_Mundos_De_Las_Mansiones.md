The best of all possible worlds is described in _The Urantia Book_. It is a world where mutual love and respect are a reality, where the desire to serve selflessly motivates people's actions.

The age of light and life is the final evolutionary achievement in a world of time and space (<a id="a40_94"></a>[UB 55:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p0_1)), the apex of planetary evolution, the final planetary age, the achievement of evolutionary utopia (<a id="a40_236"></a>[UB 49:5.27](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p5_27)).

Jesus showed us the way to immediately reach spiritual brotherhood, which is the basis for one day reaching social brotherhood. Mutual understanding and brotherly love are transcendent civilizers and powerful factors in the worldwide realization of the brotherhood of men (<a id="a42_273"></a>[UB 52:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p6_2)).

We do not live in the best of all possible worlds. We do not live in a world established in the era of light and life, in which all men delight in being brotherly to one another. What then happens with the mortals who, during the thousands of years of planetary evolution, have NOT been lucky enough to be born in that highly desirable era of light and life, in that era of peace, love and fraternity?

[Paper 52](<a id="a46_11"></a>[UB 52:0.1-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p0_1)) tells us about the various planetary epochs through which mortals from worlds like ours pass, namely:

1. The man before the Planetary Prince.
2. The man after the Planetary Prince.
3. The postadamic man.
4. The man after the Magisterial Son.
5. The man after the Donor Son.
6. The man after the Instructor Son.
7. The Age of Light and Life.

We find ourselves, theoretically, in the time after the Donor Son. But we already know that Urantia does not walk at the normal pace of its sister spheres, due to the Caligastia rebellion and Adam's failure. We are therefore not at point number 5 of the aforementioned scale, but at point number 3 of the seven epochs of planetary development described in <a id="a56_356"></a>[UB 50:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p5_6), that is, we are in “_the era of material comfort_”, an era where “_luxury rivals necessity to occupy the center stage of human activities. Such an age is too often characterized by tyranny, intolerance, gluttony, and drunkenness.._” And not all nations find themselves in this era of abundance, just as not all men, within a given nation They have a high level of consciousness. As “the spiral of development” indicates, many different levels of consciousness (or development) coexist in our world today, from the lowest to the highest, all mixed and amalgamated in our societies.

Well, as I was going, what about all those of us who have not been lucky enough to be born in the best of all possible worlds?

The Creators had already foreseen this eventuality. And for those millions and millions of mortals who have been born and lived in the times before, or <ins>much before</ins>, the era of light and life, the Creators have provided a progressive education to bring them to that state. desirable... only that education is received in transitory spheres called “mansion worlds.”

Yes, the mansion worlds are “compensatory spheres,” worlds where mortals <ins>before</ins> the age of light and life <ins>“make up”</ins> for whatever they lack to reach that stage of development. In Paper  47 we can read:

> “_The sojourn on mansion world number one is designed to develop mortal survivors at least up to the status of the post-Adamic dispensation on the normal evolutionary worlds._” (<a id="a64_180"></a>[UB 47:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p3_9))

> “_The development on mansonia number two compares with the intellectual status of the post-Magisterial Son culture of the ideal evolutionary worlds._” (<a id="a66_154"></a>[UB 47:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p4_8))

> “_The culture of the third mansion world partakes of the nature of the <ins>postbestowal Son age</ins> of a normal inhabited planet._” (<a id="a68_138"></a>[UB 47:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p5_3))

> “_The intellectual and social culture of this fourth mansion world is comparable to the mental and social life of the <ins>post-Teacher Son age</ins> on the planets of normal evolution._” (<a id="a70_191"></a>[UB 47:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p6_4))

> “_The culture of this mansion world corresponds in general to that of the <ins>early era of light and life</ins> on the planets of normal evolutionary progress. And from this you can understand why it is so arranged that the highly cultured and progressive types of beings who sometimes inhabit these advanced evolutionary worlds are <ins>exempt from passing</ins> through one or more, or even all, of the mansion spheres._” (<a id="a72_428"></a>[UB 47:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p7_1))

> “_During the sojourn on world number six the mansion world students achieve a status which is comparable with the exalted development characterizing those evolutionary worlds which have normally progressed <ins>beyond the initial stage of light and life</ins>._” (<a id="a74_266"></a>[UB 47:8.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p8_7))

> “_<ins>Any discernible differences</ins> between those mortals hailing from the isolated and retarded worlds and those survivors from the more advanced and enlightened spheres are virtually <ins>obliterated</ins> during the sojourn on the seventh mansion world._” (<a id="a76_267"></a>[UB 47:9.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p9_1))

Compare these quotes with the various planetary epochs listed above and listed in Doc 52. Divine fairness and justice are on display with this program. The mansion worlds are intended to <ins><b>make up</b></ins> for not being born on an ideal world.

This is so true that, when the planets of a System become established in light and life, “_the mansion worlds <ins>gradually cease to function</ins> as transitional spheres of morontia formation._” (<a id="a80_199"></a>[UB 48:3.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p3_17)). And they dedicate them to something else.

The <a id="a82_4"></a>[UB 56:10.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_2) (Truth, Beauty and Goodness), tells us the following:

> “_Throughout this glorious age the chief pursuit of the ever-advancing mortals is the quest for a better understanding and a fuller realization of <ins>the comprehensible elements</ins> of Deity—<ins>truth, beauty, and goodness</ins>. This represents man’s effort to discern God in mind, matter, and spirit. And as the mortal pursues this quest, he finds himself increasingly absorbed in the experiential study of philosophy, cosmology, and divinity._”

Look at the relationship:

**Truth - Beauty - Goodness**
**Mind - Matter - Spirit**
**Philosophy - Cosmology Divinity**

> “_Even truth, beauty, and goodness—man’s intellectual approach to the universe of mind, matter, and spirit. . . ._” (<a id="a92_119"></a>[UB 56:10.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_15))

> “_. . . As mortal personality unifies the human experience with matter, mind, and spirit. . ._” (<a id="a94_99"></a>[UB 56:10.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_15))

> “_The worlds settled in light and life are so fully concerned with the comprehension of truth, beauty, and goodness because these quality values embrace the revelation of Deity to the realms of time and space._” (<a id="a96_215"></a>[UB 56:10.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_9))

> “_Truth is the basis of science and philosophy, . . . Beauty sponsors art, music, . . . . Goodness embraces the sense of ethics, morality, and religion. . ._” (<a id="a98_162"></a>[UB 56:10.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_10))

> “_To finite man truth, beauty, and goodness embrace the full revelation of divinity reality._” (<a id="a100_98"></a>[UB 56:10.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_20))

> “_The advanced mortals on a world in the seventh stage of light and life have learned that love is the greatest thing in the universe—and they know that God is love._” (<a id="a102_171"></a>[UB 56:10.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_20))

> “_Love is the desire to do good to others._” (<a id="a104_48"></a>[UB 56:10.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_21))

Well that is my wish, that these reflections can be useful to you for something.
