## November 22, 1951

In a document which purports to be a copy of this message of November 22, 1951 from the “personal regent of the acting Planetary Prince of Urantia” the following instructions are given:

1. For five hundred years, from February 11, 1953, the overall welfare and direction of the Urantia Book is placed in the hands of the Seraphim of Progress.

2. The immediate fostering of the Urantia revelation — from decade to decade — (at least for the next one hundred years) will be entrusted to the Seraphim of the Churches. I have instructed this group to create a special commission to carry on this work.

3. The human aspects of the Urantia Book will be placed in the hands of the trustees of the Urantia Foundation, subject to the advisory suggestion and veto powers of the Revelatory Commission of the United Midwayers of Urantia. When, as, and if, the Midway Commission fails to communicate with the Trustees of the Foundation for a period of three years, then shall such Trustees deem that the affairs of the Urantia Book are wholly and exclusively in their hands and under their jurisdiction.

4. For the time being, mediation between the overall and superhuman supervision of this Commission and the directly human functioning of the Trustees of the Urantia Foundation shall be vested in the Midwayer Commission, the successor of the original Urantia Revelatory Commission. This Commission shall continue to function as advisor to both the Seraphic Overseers and the Trustees of the Urantia Foundation, but their veto powers shall extend only to the decisions and acts of the human Trustees.

5. In the absence of Midwayer intervention after February 11, 1954, the Trustees of the Urantia Foundation shall proceed in accordance with their own judgment.

Editor's note: Many years ago I had this message read to me by Edith Cook and Emma Christensen at the Chicago office of Urantia Foundation. At that time they pointed out to me a note at the bottom of the document which said, “To be destroyed by fire no later than the death of the last contact commissioner.” The means by which this fragment of the original document has survived is unknown to me. Bud Kagan reports having been present when Bill Sadler burned many documents in the oil furnace in the basement of 533. Carolyn Kendall reports that Edith Cook and Marian Rowley destroyed the file of original messages per Christy's direction when Christy was sick and nearing her death.

An additional message which contains comments related to the above message was purportedly received August 21, 1952.

## August 21, 1952

In a document which purports to be a copy of a message received August 21, 1952 from the “personal regent of the acting Planetary Prince of Urantia” the following instructions are given:

This communication (August 21, 1952) represents my ruling up to this date respecting your Forum, the Seventy, the Urantia Book, the Urantia Foundation, and the proposed Urantia Brotherhood.

1. The Forum: Your Forum shall continue under the supervision of the Contact Commissioners as directed June 24, 1933.

2. The Urantia Brotherhood: The plan of organization as it exists on this date is hereby provisionally approved for the inauguration of the Brotherhood. The plan provides for its own subsequent amendation.

3. The Starting of the Brotherhood: The launching of the Brotherhood shall be left to the decisions of the Trustees of the Urantia Foundation. They shall act personally--unofficially--and no records of such action shall appear on the transactions of the Urantia Foundation. They shall assume all and full responsibility for the organization and inauguration of the Urantia Brotherhood.

4. The Urantia Book: By mandate of the Supreme Court of Urantia, unanimous decisions No. 81 pertaining to \[unclear word; looks like “mixed”\] planetary mandate, the full custody of the Urantia Book has been placed in my hands. I now make the following rulings:

	- a. I, and I alone, will direct the time of the publication of the Urantia Book.  
	- b. If I do not provide such instructions on or before January 1, 1955, then the Trustees of the Urantia Foundation should proceed with plans for publication in accordance with their own judgment. (I reserve the right to intervene at any time.)  
	- c. I approve of your plan to publish the Index of the Urantia Book in a separate volume.

5. The Seventy: This is a project which will terminate with the launching of the Brotherhood. I would continue the present supervision. If, for any reason, this supervision should be terminated, I direct the Trustees of the Urantia Foundation, acting unofficially, to appoint a new leader to act pending the inauguration of the Urantia Brotherhood.
