> ADAM AND EVE arrived on Urantia, from the year A.D. 1934, 37,848 years ago. It was in midseason when the Garden was in the height of bloom that they arrived. At high noon and unannounced, the two seraphic transports, accompanied by the Jerusem personnel intrusted with the transportation of the biologic uplifters to Urantia, settled slowly to the surface of the revolving planet in the vicinity of the temple of the Universal Father. All the work of rematerializing the bodies of Adam and Eve was carried on within the precincts of this newly created shrine. And from the time of their arrival ten days passed before they were re-created in dual human form for presentation as the world’s new rulers. They regained consciousness simultaneously. The Material Sons and Daughters always serve together. It is the essence of their service at all times and in all places never to be separated. They are designed to work in pairs; seldom do they function alone. ([UB 74:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p0_1))

The first time I read it while browsing the book on the internet (I hadn't yet decided whether to buy it) it had a huge impact on my belief system. It resonated very strongly within me because of the incredible coherence of the story.

Precisely the topic of Adam and Eve in the Bible was what distanced me the most from that supposedly sacred book. I could not conceive how people were able to ignore the multiple problems of the Bible regarding this topic.

Biologically, it is completely proven that a couple is not genetically viable as the beginning of a whole new species. In addition, of course, to the impossible paragraph in the Bible in which Cain flees from the Garden to the land of Nod.

Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel. Who the hell is Nod?

Anyway, when I read this paragraph from _The Urantia Book_, although I still didn't have the context, my heart skipped a beat and it was at that moment that I realized I was standing in front of a gem. It didn't take me long to buy it in physical format.
