## Prayer of this day

<p style="text-align:center;">
Thank you Lord for this day that is dawning,<br>
For this heart that wakes up near yours.<br>
Thank you for the peace that lives within me this morning,<br>
For this joy of starting this day<br>
By knowing how to recognize Your presence.<br>
I pray to you Lord for those<br>
Who don't have the chance to know You<br>
And who live in solitude.<br>
Fill them with Your blessings:<br>
Love, listening, presence and wisdom.<br>
</p>

## Poetry of the verb to be

<p style="text-align:center;">
You who seek, who doubt, who believe,<br>
add the words of your choice and make a diagram;<br>
here below the barrier of time holds you under its song,<br>
even when your steps no longer know which way they are going,<br>
the verb that lives in you (to be) leads you on a path of faith.<br>
This verb tells you to come to me;<br>
I stay in your house, you don't have to look any further,<br>
because it is from me that your conscience comes<br>
and the words you speak already exist in you;<br>
because I am this verb (to be) and that is enough for everything to be.<br>
When one day you can say (I am),<br>
it is that you will have become this verb in infinity<br>
who will seek his ultimate goal in the Absolute.<br>
</p>

## The island of feelings

Once upon a time, there was an island where all the different feelings lived:
Happiness, Sadness, Knowledge, as well as all the others, including Love.
One day the feelings were told that the island was going to sink.
So they all prepared their boats and set off.
Only Love remained. Love wanted to stay until the last moment.
When the island was about to sink, Love decided to call for help.
Wealth passed by Love in a luxurious boat.
Love said to him: _“Wealth, can you take me?” — “No, because there is a lot of silver and gold on my boat. I have no room for you.”_
Love then decided to ask Pride, who was also passing by in a magnificent ship: _“Pride, help me, please!” — “I can’t help you, Love. You’re all wet and you could damage my boat.”_
Sadness being nearby, Love asked her:
_“Sadness, let me come with you.”_
— _“Ooh... Love, I’m so sad that I need to be alone!”_

Happiness also passed by Love, but it was so
happy that he didn't even hear Love calling him!
Suddenly, a voice said: _“Come Love, I’ll take you with me.”_
It was an old man who had spoken. Love felt so grateful
and full of joy that he forgot to ask the old man his name.
When they arrived on dry land, the old man left.
Love realized how much he owed him and asked Knowledge: _“Who helped me?” — “It was Time”_ replied Knowledge.
_“Time?”_ wondered Love. _“But why did Time help me?”_
Knowledge smiled full of wisdom, and replied: _“It is because only Time is capable of understanding how important love is in Life.”_
