Recently, I discovered the fascinating history of the Beguine movement through the series “The Beguines”, an Atresmedia production that captivated me from the first episode. Before watching this series, I was completely unaware of the existence of these communities of women who, between the 13th and 16th centuries, challenged the social and religious norms of their time by living independently, dedicating themselves both to spiritual contemplation and to practical activities such as teaching, caring for the sick, and crafts.

The series, set in the 16th century, led me to investigate more about this movement, and that is how I came across the book _The Kiss of God_ by Prado Pérez from Madrid. This work delves into the life of the Beguines and explores their challenges, their achievements and the intense spirituality that characterized these women. The book is a window into a world of faith and resistance, and I highly recommend it to those who wish to learn more about this little-explored part of European history in general and Spanish history in particular.

What struck me most about the Beguines is how their search for an authentic spiritual life, free from the constraints of the time, resonates with some of the principles I have found in _The Urantia Book_. Although in very different contexts, they both share common points that are worth highlighting:

1. **Spiritual autonomy**: Like the Beguines, _The Urantia Book_ promotes a direct and personal relationship with God, free of institutional intermediaries. The Beguines sought to live their spirituality outside the strict control of the Church, and in _The Urantia Book_ the personal and intimate relationship with the Universal Father is emphasized.
2. **Selfless Service**: Beguines engaged in community service, caring for the sick, and educating the young, actions that reflect the ideal of loving, selfless service promoted in _The Urantia Book_. This book teaches that true divine love is manifested through service to others, a principle that Beguines embodied in their daily lives.
3. **Search for Truth**: Both the Beguines and the readers of _The Urantia Book_ share a deep search for truth and spiritual knowledge. The Beguines challenged established norms in their quest for a more authentic life, while _The Urantia Book_ invites its readers to independently seek truth and experience a living relationship with the cosmos and its Creator.
