ON AUGUST 12, 2006, Gaétan Charland and Gary Rasslings were in Belgium to inaugurate our Belgian Urantia association: the ABFU (Association Belge Francophone d'Urantia). I was appointed president of the association, François Dupont, secretary and Guillaume Kalonji, treasurer. We did not really function as three association leaders because François Dupont was already very ill, and it was I who carried the movement since then. My role consisted of relaunching membership applications each year and holding meetings at least once a year. I also took care of the UAI Journal that I sent to the members with the LINK each quarter. After several years, I became more involved in the movement, I started by organizing study groups at my home, then, as I was holding salons for my research, I set up a table to present the book, then I gave conferences at these salons on the Urantia Book.

Then, we organized study days, first outside, then at home. We also organized conferences with Georges and Marlène Michelson-Dupont and I gave some myself. I launched and led several study groups including one at my home for almost 8 years. We had prayer groups, festive meetings on August 21. My wife Isabelle and I participated in several conferences and symposiums, either in France, Chicago or Quebec. And finally, we set up, with Guy Perron from Quebec, a WE on Spiritual Love to help participants find their bearings in matters of spirituality (see below). In total, there are certainly several hundred people who have heard of The Urantia Book over the last 10 years, including well-known people like Jean-Marie Pelt, Anne Givaudan, Hubert Reeves or Frédéric Lenoir to whom I personally gave the book.

Some study groups have been created, few have lasted. I have come to wonder if this was the right method to make the truth of The Urantia Book known on this planet. I know that it is the mandate of the Revelators to create more than 1000 study groups, but it is clear that in our society of spiritual zapping, it is increasingly difficult to ask people to have constant follow-up to deepen their spirituality. Coming to attend a conference, okay. But participating every month, or even every 15 days, in a study group seems too restrictive.

I obviously do not regret at all all the investment that I have made during these 10 years, but I must recognize that the harvest is meager. Or else, I must consider this, a bit like Jesus during his tour of the Mediterranean, as a sowing that will bear fruit later, when others come after me.

This is why it seemed appropriate to me to pass the baton. I am obviously not leaving the Urantia book, I am more and more attached to it, and the WE that we hosted with Guy Perron reinforced my idea that we need more flexibility in our way of passing on the teachings of the lisre. This is what I know I will stick to for the next 10 years. According to the lisre, the adjuster changes his name at 60, perhaps he works differently as well. In any case, I want to work differently.

I would also like to take advantage of this space given to me to take stock of these 10 years and even 16 years of reading and deepening the teachings of The Urantia Book. I have often been asked: “But what difference does reading this book make to you?” For a long time, I didn't really know what to say because there was nothing conclusive, exceptional, or obvious. It is said in the book that, just as we do not decide on our bodily growth, we do not decide on our spiritual growth either. We can just give ourselves the means to ensure that this growth is as optimal as possible. Reading and deepening the book is certainly one of them. So I have given myself and continue to give myself the instruction to grow spiritually. That said, there are still certain changes that the book has brought me. The most important thing in my eyes is the certainty of basing oneself on a sure, first-hand teaching that one can count on. Before, I was in a certain spiritual zapping, taking a little here, a little there. Doing certain practices or meditations according to my experiences or readings. I believed in reincarnation, I had done my astrological theme several times, went to see some mediums so that they would give me messages from my dear departed, I was Catholic, then Orthodox. In short, I went to look for where it made me feel good and what reinforced my ideas.

With the book, no more procrastination. It's clear. It's clear, precise. It's written. It was of capital importance in my life. From the moment I accepted that this book told the Truth, there was no more questioning to have, nor doubt. My faith went from a childish faith, with a lot of religious stuff and mystical beliefs, to an adult, mature one, with a full awareness of being a son of God. I think that it was from that moment that I began to become a religious person. Religion entered my life. It became my life.

Then, how did this come to fruition? Through the fruits of the spirit. I believe that I became more patient, more loving, more in control of myself. I tried to go towards others, to help them, to put myself at the service, in the full awareness of serving other children of God. I deepened my knowledge of God, to love him more. I tried to transmit this love to others. Did I succeed? I don't know. The fact remains that I feel in this process and that, even now, I try to find more and more ways to get in touch with my adjuster. All this knowledge that is brought by the reading has given me security, an assurance in my beliefs and it is all this that allows me little by little to grow spiritually. I also found pearls of wisdom there, little phrases that are very concrete and very practical in daily life and I was able to question my old beliefs so that, as much in my knowledge as in my experiences, I can advance surely on my path, and thanks to my Adjuster, do more and more the will of God.
