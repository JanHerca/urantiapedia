Once, in a moderately large city, there lived a man gifted with many gifts including an imposing presence, a talent for oratory, and a charismatic personality tempered by a not insignificant touch of egotism. After giving his life to God at a rousing and inspiring renewal crusade, this man dedicated his many talents to the Almighty, and set about using them to raise the funds for a wonderfully spacious and sublimely decorated temple to be erected as close as possible to the very heart of his city where all might come to hear his oratory and to join in worship of the Almighty with resounding and inspiring songs of praise.

Such were the talents of this imposing man that his appointed task was quickly achieved. Very soon, crowds of visitors were flocking to this sparkling and spectacular temple to hear this self-nominated messenger from the Almighty and have their minds and souls uplifted to a peak of religious fervor. But for most of the visitors, the peak of their fervor was very temporary, quickly diminishing and bearing little or no fruit. However, the spectacle of the temple and the advertising of its services of worship were such that always there was a fresh stream of visitors, seeking to find they knew not what but nevertheless filling them with the high expectations that what they sought must be of tremendous spiritual value in order to match the beauties of the temple and the advertising hype of its operators.

At the other end of this same city there lived an unassuming and humble man, favored with a keen sense of observation and a talent for listening. Gradually this man grew a feeling of being indwelt by some great interior force which he called, "Him inside of me." As he intensified his relationship with "Him," he became convinced that his own ignominious self was, at some far distant future time, to become "One with Him." Day by day he wove new areas inside of himself which he felt were becoming part of "Him's" new home. Little by little and piece by piece his self became more and more at one with the "Him inside of me."

All this took place simultaneously with the continual hubbub that was going on at the great and glorious temple at the heart of the city. And almost unnoticed, but slowly and surely, the daily life of this simple, humble man filled with divine love and joyful and abundant service and seemed to envelop all who came in contact with him with the fragrance and flavor of divine joy that lingered with them and in them. And many there were who, through this contact. were led to listen to the small, powerful, silent voice that lingers inside themselves also. And the yield of the fruits of the spirit in this part of the city was indeed great.
