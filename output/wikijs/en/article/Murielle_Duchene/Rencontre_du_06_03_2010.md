**JESUS AND SOME ASPECTS OF HIS LIFE**

We discussed different themes from the life of Jesus, led by John. Each theme was presented succinctly by a person following the Urantia Book and was followed by a debate where everyone could express themselves freely by bringing their personal feelings and experience.

**Murielle** began the discussions by talking about how Jesus met people during his journey around the Mediterranean, how he approached them, how he learned from them, how he transmitted his teachings to them and revealed the best in each person with great patience, understanding, gentleness but also firmness.

**Agnès** showed us how Jesus chose his apostles, emphasizing that all the human character traits were reflected in the personalities of his apostles, then specifying the qualities and the dark points of each and what they liked about Jesus.

**Françoise** gave us a beautiful summary of Jesus and women. She quoted numerous excerpts from the Urantia Book, emphasizing his attitude of mercy and compassion as well as his great gentleness towards his mother Mary, his sisters Myriam, Martha and Ruth, towards Rebecca, Mary Magdalene and towards other women she met during her travels.

**Monique** proposed to us: Jesus the Healer. She demonstrated through concrete facts experienced by her that the transmission of the healing power of Jesus is still relevant today. Jesus, Michael of Nebadon, was our Creator, he knew his creatures very well in their entirety: body-mind-spirit. He was permanently connected with the Father and was animated by a creative force and an unlimited radiance and healing power. This is how healing could be spontaneous and miraculous.

Far from having had the time to go into more depth on each theme, the discussions were nevertheless very rich and very intense. Everyone's wish is to renew the experience of such a day.
