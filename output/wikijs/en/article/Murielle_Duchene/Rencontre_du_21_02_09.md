On Saturday, February 21, 2009, 21 people from different reading groups of the _Urantia Book_ met in **Liège** at the bookstore “Les Arcanes de la Connaissance”. The theme of the meeting was “The Thought Adjusters”.

After a presentation by Jean Annet, each person was able to express themselves and share their feelings about how each person experiences their daily relationship with their Adjuster.

Each testimony was very rich, very sincere and very profound. We were touched by the authenticity and spontaneity of 3 young women from Tournai, mothers who raise their children in the spirit of Urantia and specifically by connecting daily to their Adjuster.

Several men echoed these feminine testimonies. It was very interesting to hear each man's sensitivities.

**Raymond**, from the Liège group, read us some extracts from the Book concerning Jesus and his Adjuster.

**Robert**, also from the Liège group, read us a text (see below) that he wrote spontaneously to express his thanks and all his gratitude. First to the Universal Father who gave his benevolent blessing to the distribution of the Book, then to the Revelation Commission of the leaders of the Superuniverses, to the different authors of the booklets, to Jesus who revealed to us the unconditional Love of the Father, to the Contact Commission and the Forum for their tireless work, to the translators and reading groups and finally, to all those who from near or far have allowed the extension of the distribution of the Book.

We all had a wonderful day punctuated by a friendly meal.

We thank **Jean** and **Isabelle** Annet for this successful meeting and hope for other reunions in the same atmosphere which allows enriching exchanges with people from different reading groups.

Murielle Duchêne, a convinced Urantian!
