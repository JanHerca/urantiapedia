What is serenity
In our human condition?
What is truth
On the path, and who is holding us back?
What is Life
And its supreme meaning?

We all aspire to have our needs met;
We all seek to satisfy our desires:
The lack, the contrasts of near and far
Our questions are tension towards pleasure...

Who has not marveled at what is beautiful?
Who has not been moved by someone good?
Who has not sought the author, the lover?

When the veil of truth is lifted,
When the shadow is chased away by Your Light,
I gradually see what it is about,
When You answer my search, my prayer.
I must come to terms with two requirements:
Manage hardware with confidence
And bet on my eternal destiny:
Connected to the spiritual Source
And experience sharing and brotherly love.

My body is an ephemeral vehicle
Inhabited by a destined immortal Soul.
I build it through an exemplary choice
And the powers you have bestowed on me.
Pedagogy included from my conception;
Know me, Know you, Revelation
For an Immersion, an Expansion...

Time, space, living environment
In which wonders take place;
And it's never over:
Your love blooms, prospers...

What is peace? What is serenity?
Living the Truth daily:
I am infinitely loved.
