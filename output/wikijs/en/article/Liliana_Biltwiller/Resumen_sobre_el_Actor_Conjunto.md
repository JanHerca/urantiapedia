Way back in eternity, when the “first” infinite and absolute thought of the Universal Father finds in the Eternal Son a “word” so perfect and adequate for its “divine” expression, the supreme desire of both the “Thought God” and the “Word God” for a universal and infinite agency, for mutual expression and combined action, is manifested.

***God the Father***

***God the Son***

***God the Spirit***

The Third Person is known by numerous titles:

&nbsp; | &nbsp;
--- | ---
The Spirit<br>The Universal Spirit<br>The Supreme Guide<br>The Co-Creator<br>The Divine Executive | The Infinite Mind<br>The Paradise Mother Spirit<br>The Final Coordinator<br>The Absolute Intelligence, etc.

He shares in every way the **perfection, righteousness, and love of the Father**. He manifests an inclination toward the **merciful** attributes of the “Son,” thus becoming the “Minister” of the **mercy** of the Paradise Deities to the “grand universe.”

## Relationship of the Spirit with the Father and the Son

Just as the Eternal Son is the verbal expression of the Father's first thought, so the Conjoint Actor is the perfect execution of the First Concept or Creative Plan. The Universal Father delegates all possible to his Eternal Son, and likewise, the Son grants all possible authority and power to the Conjoint Actor. Together, as partners, they have planned and conceived all the universes that have emerged from Havona.

The Conjoint Actor, the Third Person of the Godhead, is possessed of all the attributes we associate with **personality**.

He is endowed with an absolute mind, he discovers all things, even the deepest. He is not only endowed with this great mind, but with **will**. His love is real, as are his sorrows. He intercedes for us by exercising a direct and personal influence on created beings and is real and visible to the highest intelligences of the universes, such as the Father and the Son, and even more, because he is the

Spirit whom all ascendants must reach before they can, through the Son, reach the Father.

## ORIGINS

If we go back to the Trinity, the Paradise Trinity, we see that when the Father gives infinite expression to his spirit self in the being of the Eternal Son, he simultaneously reveals the potential infinity of his nonpersonal self as Paradise. In this way, the Father projects Reality in two phases: the personal and the nonpersonal; the spiritual and the nonspiritual.

The tension between them gives rise to the Joint Actor, the central universe of material worlds and spiritual beings.

## THE DEITY AND THE DIVINITY

The Deity is the source of all that is divine.

Divinity is understood by us as Truth, Beauty and Goodness.

It is correlated in **personality** as Love, Mercy and Ministry.

It is revealed at impersonal levels such as Justice, Power and Sovereignty.

## PERSONALITY

It is never spontaneous, it is the gift of the Father, it is superimposed on energy and is associated only with living energy systems.

The Father is the secret of both the reality of **personality** and its bestowal and destiny.

The Son is the Absolute Personality, the secret of spiritual energy, and the Conjoint Actor is the spiritual-mental personality, the source of intelligence, reason, and the Universal Mind.

## PARADISE

It can indicate all forms of Reality:
- The Deity
- The Divinity
- Personality
- Energy: spiritual, mental or material

We all share it as a place of origin, function and destiny, as far as values, meanings and real existence are concerned.

The ***Island of Paradise*** is the absolute control of material gravity controlled by the First Source and Center, that is, God the Father. It is the absolute of models, from which the copies will emerge and be projected as material, spiritual, mental, or any combination of these energies.

Gravity is the sole control of matter-energy. Gravity cannot be modified or overridden except by the forces and energies promoted jointly by the Father and the Son and entrusted to the Conjoint Actor, with whom they are functionally associated.

The Conjoint Actor possesses a unique and astonishing power: **antigravity**. A power that is not observable in either the Father or the Son (the Father's self-limitation).

This attribute is revealed in the personal reactions of the Conjoint Actor to certain phases of universal relations and is transmissible to some of the highest personalities belonging to him.

Let us agree that the Joint Actor is not energy, nor the source of energy nor the destination of energy: it is the Manipulator, it is movement, change, modification, coordination, stabilization and balance.

The energies subject to the direct or indirect control of Paradise, by nature respond to the acts of the Conjoint Actor.

In order to penetrate the universe of universes, he uses countless creatures, such as:

- I _The Supreme Spirits_
	- The Seven Guiding Spirits (Paradise)
	- The Reflective Spirits (superuniverse)
	- The Creative Spirits (local universes)
- II _The Directors of Power_: creatures that act as agents of control and that operate in every organized space.
- III _The Personalities of the Infinite Spirit_
	- Higher personalities
	- Hosts of messengers from space
	- Ministering spirits of time, such as messengers, teachers, adjudicators, helpers, counselors, circuit supervisors of a physical, morontial, and spiritual nature.

Not all of them are personalities in the strict sense of the term.

The Father grants personality.

The Conjoint Actor bestows non-Father personality, doing so in his own name, in creative conjunction with the Eternal Son and in ways unknown to us.

There are numerous personality types not included in the Father's personality circuit, which the Conjoint Actor has conferred upon them, such as certain Power Directors and Creative Spirits. Both groups of personalities share and are endowed with minds that encompass memory, reason, judgment, creative imagination, association of ideas, decision, choice, etc.

With few exceptions, the orders revealed to us possess definite form and individuality; they are real beings. Most are visible to all orders of spiritual existence.

The spirit personalities of the vast family of the Conjoint Actor are forever dedicated to the service of the ministry of God's love and the Son's mercy to all intelligent creatures on the evolutionary worlds of time and space. These beings constitute the living ladder by which man may ascend from chaos to glory.
