_Testimony of Arnaud and Jérôme Pingwende Zoungrana_
October 2016; Ouagadougou; Burkina Faso

Thank you for the encouragement regarding our continual effort to appropriate the rich and sublime _Urantia Book_ which sheds new light on religion and thereby shapes our religiosity. The religious context in our country is marked by the coexistence of several religions (Catholicism, Protestantism, Islam and animism) and various sects, a coexistence not often and always peaceful in the individual register. Here and there, we record a form of religious intolerance between the faithful, even for those who seem close, which is akin to a paradox.

But considering Montesquieu's observation that “in terms of religion, those closest to us are the greatest enemies”, in Persian Letters, we understand why. The religious fanaticism that develops in this context would not allow for criticism, even in an educational approach, of religions already anchored in the minds of men. Any criticism would be blindly accused of questioning, or even apostasy or heresy, of the dogmatic truths conveyed until then.

In addition to this, the logistical context of the country unfortunately constitutes a handicap to online studies. Indeed, the Internet connection through which students could follow the teachings of the _Urantia Book_, is not accessible in terms of speed, cost and availability at all times and in all places. Only large cities have internet cafes.

This means that in order to properly follow the studies of the teachings of the _Urantia Book_, the student must have his own computer, a modem for connection to the Internet networks, and recharge this modem to the tune of 10,000 FCFA (around 15 euros) minimum per month and have a permanent power supply in
electricity, which is not easy, since the country's energy coverage is around 33%. These are some of the major obstacles that even interested students face.

This does not diminish the will of a few like us, eager to understand the truth, but it would nevertheless require the attraction of a high ideal to approach our countrymen. You understand, we hope, how interest and commitment to follow the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ is not only a question of will, but it is also a question of power in our context.

Notwithstanding, a certain social class would be interested in the rich teachings of the famous _Urantia Book_. But we still need to hear about it. This is why we believe that local awareness, that is to say interpersonal communication between work colleagues, friends, promoters or coreligionists, etc. could further contribute to introducing the book to a selected audience so that they become interested in it. For example, Arnaud told me about it and I became interested.

In turn, I spoke about it to other friends who would be interested. It is also possible to geographically constitute groups for sharing, reading and studying the Book, a possibility whose modalities must be studied. For example, if there was a pool of well-trained and advanced students who were able to read the entire book, they would constitute mentors to lead and supervise these clubs. In this, there would be more consistency and feasibility.

There you have it, we hope to have described the current conditions a little and given our opinions on the matter.

Yours sincerely, fraternally.

**BURKINA FASO: SOME STATISTICS**

| Population in 2016: | 19 million |
| Population in 2050: | 45 million |
| Population in 2100: | 80 million |
| Density 2016 | 71 inhabitants / km^2^ |

Official languages: French

Child/woman fertility rate: 2000: 5.5; 2016: 4.8; 2050: 3.0; 2100: 2.2.

Life expectancy: 2000: 49 years; 2016: 55 years; 2050: 68 years; 2100: 72 years

Infant mortality of children under 5 years old: 2016: 13.5%

Literacy rate: 70% in 2010.

To try to better understand the obstacles to the dissemination of the teachings of the _Urantia Book_ in the different countries that make up the subcontinent of sub-Saharan Africa, we asked Robert Mondange, a former member of the French Air Force who often stayed in Ivory Coast, to share with us his experience as an intervener in the context of humanitarian actions for the village of Assikoi, quite far from Abidjan. We invite you to learn more about this village by clicking on the following link:

http://www.assikoi.com/m/

We will see, as everywhere else in black Africa, as soon as one moves away from a large city like Abidjan, living conditions become much more difficult; education, drinking water, public health, transport and connection to electricity pose many problems. However, the extreme material deprivation of the population does not prevent it from having a rich and authentic spiritual life.

Many churches and sects are well established. They capture the faithful by dangling love, money, and good luck before them, then hold them prisoner by the fear of hell and the curse of evil spirits.

The dissemination of the teachings of The Urantia Book would be so liberating for all these hungry souls. The complexity of the book requires the training of African facilitators and the creation of study groups in which sharing becomes easier and fraternal is the solution.
