**<ins>Site Information</ins>**

What is a web server?

A Web server is the provision, for the whole world, of interactive information presented in the form of screen pages updated regularly. It is in a way a very improved but much more powerful Minitel (colors, sounds, images, etc.).

In the same way as the latter, the “Internet user” (the Web user) can simply consult the information but also send a message to people who have an electronic mailbox, discuss (discussion groups) with other visitors to the site via written messages recorded and stored from day to day (a message posted one day, responses the next day, and so on ad infinitum), register on a list to subscribe to a service, place an order and all this simply using their computer and a few clicks of the mouse.

Likewise, the site manager (that is to say us French speakers!) can at any time provide important information, request a service from the readers who read us, etc.

In practice, the information is organized into computer screen pages and you just have to click on links provided for this purpose (terms or groups of terms in blue and underlined) to move from one page to another, from one paragraph to another (to avoid scrolling the entire screen), or even from one site to another which may be located on opposite sides of the world.

The pages that we offer are physically stored on the hard drive of a computer of the foundation in Chicago. I can carry out an update at any time thanks to special software and an access code that was provided to me by the IT manager of the foundation. This solution was chosen for practical and financial reasons (the equipment and the technical environment being available in Chicago) and especially by the fraternal offer of the managers on site. But, the fact remains that it is we French speakers who manage this site and the information that it offers.

Who might be interested?

Even if the French territory is generally poorly equipped with this type of computer means of access to information, it remains that the American continent (and in general the English-speaking countries) is more advanced and many more Quebecers than French or even Europeans have access to the Internet. It is therefore partly towards this public that this server is initially aimed, but also towards all French-speaking readers who are expatriates or spread throughout the world and who have a connection to the network (Note, the African continent has virtually no connection, apart from Egypt).

Finally, we can say without much risk that this is taking a little head start on the future, because the generalization of this means of communication, in our countries, is in forced march. In a few years, the minitel will have become a very obsolete object.

For what use?

In the first part, the possibilities offered by this type of service were already mentioned. The content remains. Obviously, the entire _Urantia Book_ in French will be present with increasing ease of access to the booklets. Likewise, a lot of practical information is present or will be added gradually. We are also considering offering the Urantian Link visible and readable by a large number of readers (especially Quebecers).

Finally, at a time when the computer format is becoming widespread, all projects relating to books (dictionaries of concepts, database of available publications, etc.) can be easily integrated into the site.

But, above all or in any case this is what I hope, I expect from this service an increased exchange between readers. This will be possible thanks to the electronic “discussion groups” (to be set up soon) referred to above (question and answer messages) but also by the possibility of enriching the Urantian Link for example or any other publications of this type with articles from any French speaker wherever they are.

Its public opening
The French-language site is not finished but Georges and I plan to open it to the public at the end of July. Its address is: http://www.urantia.org//users/F/France/frn_indx.htm.
