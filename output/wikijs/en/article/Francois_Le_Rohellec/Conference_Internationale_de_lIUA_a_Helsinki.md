It is in Helsinki, Finland that the next international conference of the I.U.A. (International Urantia Association) will take place, the first to take place elsewhere than on American soil. This one is therefore organized by the Finnish Urantia Association which wishes to do everything possible so that each of the participants, whatever their nationality, can enjoy such a meeting bringing together so many different readers of The Urantia Book.

The overall theme of the conference is “**Facts, Meanings and Values**”.

But from this general theme, a large number of subsequent subjects will be studied within the framework of oral interventions, and within the study groups which will form on site.

The conference venue is the Unitas Congress Centre located close to Helsinki (approximately 15 km) and its Helsinki-Vantaa airport. In addition to conference rooms and meeting rooms, delegates will benefit from all the usual hotel facilities under the same roof. The cost of participation, not yet definitively fixed, will be approximately 1800 to 2000 FIM (As of 26 September: 1000 FIM equivalent to approximately 1121 FRF). Further details will be provided when the registration forms are sent.

The actual conference starts on Friday August 7 in the morning but it is possible, if not recommended, to arrive the day before (Thursday August 6) in order to be fresh and ready for the program the next morning.

The conference ends on Monday, August 10 around noon, but it is entirely possible to book an additional night to leave only on Tuesday, August 11 during the day if you have a flight only that day or if you wish to continue your stay by participating for example in the excursions organized for the destinations of St Petersburg (Russia) or Tallinn (Estonia) planned after the conference. The additional nights after the conference as well as the cost of these optional excursions are obviously not taken into account in the price indicated above.

In addition to oral presentations, various speeches and discussions in small study groups on the themes of the conference, the program also includes a certain number of additional points not appearing explicitly in the timetable, such as: activities for children, silk paintings (on Saturday), formal meeting of the presidents and vice-presidents of the national I.U.A. associations, perhaps also a meeting of the coordinating committee, etc.

Although the two main languages of the conference will be English and Finnish, a speech may be given in another language and study groups will be formed according to the needs of the participants: all languages are therefore welcome. Furthermore, although simultaneous translation will not be provided, each of the presentations will be available in full in paper version - translated in advance - in at least one of the two main languages of the meeting.

The conference organizers wanted to involve all international associations in the development of the various interventions.

Thus, the Francophone Association of Readers of the Urantia Book — A.F.L.L.U. must prepare a speech on the particular theme “Meanings and values of worship”. This intervention is scheduled for Sunday morning. In addition, the association is asked to ensure the leadership of the French language study group(s) which will undoubtedly be created...

French, Belgian or Swiss friends, if in your own way you wish to share your thoughts on the theme that has been assigned to us “Meanings and values of worship”, do not hesitate to send us your work to the Paris office. Given that the speech must be submitted in its final version at the end of March to the Finnish Urantia Association, elements arriving too late cannot be taken into account.

In order to allow the Finnish organizers to prepare the conference properly and possibly facilitate a group departure from European airports, we invite you to express your desire to take part in this conference by notifying the association office within a reasonable time.

Let us make the 1998 IUA International Conference an indelible experience.
