_“What is written has always been authentic”!_

Often, the writing becomes irrevocable, even without any dispute, engraved in stone as were the Tables of the Law at the time of Moses, the Torah of the Hebrews, the Bible or the Koran...! Indeed, humanity has never ceased to demand writings to frame its social growth and codify civil rights.

This is to say that we are fond of codes and, even if that is already a lot, we always ask for more! Thus, at a time when computers flood us with their continuous and infinite flow of codes, our greatest pride at the moment remains the decoding of the human genome... That makes a lot of numbers and letters!

So, writing reassures us! Proof of this is the map, the marker, the pictogram, the cabalistic sign... which will respond to our eternal quest to return to the Father's House...

So, with a piece of writing in our pocket and our faith as our “GPS”, we finally set off even if, from time to time, we took “back roads”... it is true that “the” path remains narrow and many human lanterns... very attractive!

We must recognize in passing that this anthology of converging spiritual paths leads us towards a unique destination and that, if there is a small escapade, it can only strengthen our enthusiasm to apply the teaching of UB.

In this present Link, we are fortunately accompanied by Olga Lopez who, as President, will present to us the Spanish Association of UB Readers and invite us to Malaga next April for the AUI meeting. Yolanda's fertile pen shares with us her love for sheep; Max, that for the oyster passing through a dissection, clean in order, of the Self, then Sadler measures Paradise for us, the poet Haldi picks a sprig of life and the researchers seek “the particle of God” ... With all these walkers of time we will be under the blessing of Sundari, the embrace of Piem and the infallible leadership of our honorable President!

Finally, following on from our fruitful meeting in Paris, Anne-Marie reminds us of the main points of our reflection on the subject of “Jesus-the-Man”! Other texts concerning this event will appear in a future edition...

And, since this writing is readable, happy reading to all!

Yours faithfully.

Guy
