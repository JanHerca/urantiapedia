Here is a somewhat special edition of the Urantian Link since there is no major theme but a literary melting pot intended to inspire and entertain you at the same time.

Indeed, with the reminder of the fundamental concepts of UB addressed to us by Sheila Keenelund and that of our divine filiation by Meredith Sprunger, there is the vibrant homage to François Dupont, the celebration of Life, the consenting Prayer...

Highly meditative themes which call for a more humorous compensation as imagined by our friend Jean-Claude with “the sex of Angels” or even the genetic humor dedicated to Adam and Eve, mythical characters sketched one last time in the intimate manner of Jean Effel.

May this illustrated wink not offend the sensibilities of certain overly purist readers!

Fortunately, Max comes back to us with his faithful Quiz to tickle our “spiritual” neurons!

And Jean du Nord gives us a little publicity for the perpetual calendar inspired by UB!

In short, you have every reason to enjoy this little periodic publication which invites you to remain fraternally associated and reminds you that the practical implementation will take place in Neylière!

Happy reading to all
Fraternally yours.

The Editor in Chief
Guy from Viron
