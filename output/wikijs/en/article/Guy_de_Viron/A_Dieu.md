Here is Link n69, by which I take leave of its edition.

With a nice surprise for the optimists, it is entirely devoted to the method that our friend Georges offers us to study the UB within our study groups. I think it was worth informing you about it and sharing with you a work that he has matured for years. Bravo and Thank you Georges (Marlène)!

His idea of transmuting a group of readers into a group of UB students is very commendable. Everyone can find an invitation to become more active in their quest for truth and focus more on the content of the UB. By trusting the methodology of the Revelators and all the spiritual influences that are committed to helping us raise our consciousness! Of course, this remains an example that can be refined, developed according to the specific needs of a sharing group!

Little extras, I can't resist reminding you that there are a number of initiatives throughout today's world to make it better... It's up to you to discover them! And love at first sight for this map of consciousness, found during a graphic exhibition...!

The illustrations remain purely fanciful!

Happy reading to all.

Fraternally yours.

The Editor in Chief

Guy from Viron
