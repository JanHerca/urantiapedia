If **Teilhard de Chardin** leaves us at the end of this edition, can we imagine what this great thinker would have revealed and experienced in the light of _The Urantia Book_...

The saga of the last Winter Olympics has just ended in a grandiose manner. Apart from any material controversy, there is room for reflection and recognition. A man stood up and invested himself body and soul to restore the image of humanity: Baron **Pierre de Coubertin!** It is gratifying to see that this spirit of universality now touches more than a fifth of the world's population and that it conveys Olympic values on a cosmic level, constantly evolving. Today, parity between men and women among the Olympic disciplines has practically been achieved. This is gratifying in more ways than one.

**Jean R.** offers us some scientific thoughts about UB while **Simon O.** continues to take us on his cosmic journey...

The illustrations are always inspired by the collection of Bernard Leblanc-Halmos \*. Their theme is intended to be like a scourge of our time: the **traffic jam**! A recurring theme that congests our travels but also formats our personality by the all-practical, the all-economical, the all-hygienic and sanitized; this formatting imprisons our personality little by little... Everyone knows it and everyone continues to gain experience every day!

So, let's get corkscrewing!

Happy reading to all. Fraternally yours.
