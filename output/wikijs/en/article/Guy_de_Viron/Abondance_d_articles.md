Oh surprise for the editor that I am!

Here's an avalanche of readers' texts for this current edition of the Link! It's very encouraging! With one downside, however, the pens let off steam so well that they generated texts that were a bit too long for the small format of our quarterly brochure.

So, for the sake of fairness, we had to resolve to intersperse the longest ones with this good and magical “to be continued”. Frustrating as much for the editorial staff as for the author, I admit. On the one hand, this guarantees a little suspense to our modest publication. With your indulgence!

To all those who sent us texts, a warm thank you!

So, for Ivan S, Guy B, Georges D, Karuna L, Simon O, Jean-Claude R, Dominique R!

So continue to translate your inspiration to fuel future editions and stimulate other readers!

As for the present illustrations, they are again inspired by Roy Mitchell's collection (“God... What is he like?”)

Happy reading to all.

Fraternally yours.

The Editor in Chief

Guy from Viron
