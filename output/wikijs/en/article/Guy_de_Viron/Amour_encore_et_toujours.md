Lots of love in this winter edition of the Link! Coincidence between the writing of Teilhard de Chardin, that of Meredith Sprunger or that of Ernest Holmes, all complementary...

A bit of freshness with the Lotus Temple in New Delhi which shows us to what extent man is capable of transcending many limits to get closer to human universality and the worship of the Father Creator!

Here is also the testimony of Jacques Bérès, great war surgeon and that of Jean-Paul Duc who wants to reassure us beyond physical death.

Continuation of the cosmic stroll in the company of Simon O. to enlighten us on the infinitely small and immerse us in dark matter...

The illustrations are inspired by the collection by Bernard Leblanc-Halmos: “Where to Find Time?”, Guide to the Use of One's Destiny, Éditions de l'Être/Image.

Happy reading to all. Fraternally yours.
