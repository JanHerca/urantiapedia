1\. Why this sudden desire to rehabilitate Paul? Quite simply by intuition or rather by cerebral itch! A visceral need to understand, recognize and esteem an extraordinary character, a monument of human personality, a spiritual beacon in the religious obscurantism of an era... With this nagging and slightly underhanded question: "Has Paul's supposed misogyny been a brake on the spiritual expression of women?

The answer can, obviously, only be negative given the density of his shadow, projected over two millennia... Certainly, by tracing his portrait here, I dare to affirm that Paul was predestined to accomplish HIS mission! His skills and his charisma would have been largely devalued by an ordinary life devoted to current affairs and a home... As for discoursing on feminine virtues, this was not his first priority nor that of his contemporaries. All his energy and his personality were devoted to evangelization! Today, I am ready to bet that Paul would begin all his epistles with a thunderous “Dear brothers and sisters in Christ...”!

So let's give Paul what is Paul's! Let's open the debate! And, I look forward to developing other aspects of the Paulian personality later.

2\. "But what has bitten you? WHAT is this Eternal Feminine? Thus burst forth the instinctive and innocent reaction of some to my proposal to launch this vast subject in the columns of the Link and my invitation to all readers to join me on this favorite theme!

Challenge, feeling, quest for the Grail, whatever, I'm going for it and sharing my enthusiasm with you here!

With one caveat however, since I cannot discuss with you the very impressive study by Moussa N'Diaye mentioned in the previous Link, feminine nature, which I proposed to comment on. Unfortunately, its author does not wish extracts to be published in any journal whatsoever because he reserves it for Senegalese women!

So, let's change course 180º and make way for some little thoughts to whet your appetite, starting with Shu Wen's story, which inspired me a lot. Of course, it is already difficult to get to know yourself, to still claim to discover the opposite human race! However, if our Creator wanted us this way, it is by design, therefore for good reason. So why deprive ourselves of lifting the veil of the “feminine mystery” a little in order to recognize our mutual differences, to appreciate them and to sublimate them? Aside from the needs of the reproduction of the human species and the part of sensuality associated with it, how can we “work together” in a harmonious and complementary way? Not in future ages but right now, in our Urantian incarnation! With the aim of judiciously advancing the spiritualization of our humanity, like the “birds of paradise” and the eyes of our companions, other subjects of my thoughts to follow in the following pages. A short interlude before developing this subject further.

Among the faithful and sensitive writers at the meeting: Agnès, Octavie and even Rachel. Lino tells us about the Philo corner, Lucas brings us a Mormont hymn, another Guy tells us about his “blue book” and Georges tells us about the year 1955.

Happy reading to all
Fraternally yours.
