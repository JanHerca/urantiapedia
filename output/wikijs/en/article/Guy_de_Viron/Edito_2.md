Here is Link n68, probably the penultimate one formatted by your servant! Indeed, some consider it necessary to make a change in substance and form to this Link, which is too personalized.

I would like to thank all the supporters who appreciated the look and tone of this current version which began almost 7 years ago! So now it's time for renewal and the project that should replace it.

It would be desirable for a team of multimedia enthusiasts to work on a new graphic charter and base it on the style of overseas publications such as the AUI newsletter or Tidings. Perhaps even reuse the same publication channel, or even digitally imagine dynamic pagination with links and references... To be implemented from the beginning of 2015.

In fact, I will still be providing next December's edition, mainly with communications from our friend Georges $1-D. who has developed an effective meeting technique for our UB study groups!

The illustrations remain purely fanciful!

Happy reading to all.

Fraternally yours.

The Editor in Chief

Guy from Viron
