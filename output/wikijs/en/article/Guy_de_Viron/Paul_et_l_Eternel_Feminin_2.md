Here is an edition as a conclusion for my two favorite themes: the Eternal Feminine and friend Paul! Not that these subjects are exhausted or that we have gone through them all, only that the reflection leans towards other spiritual insights...

Thanks to the portrait of Mary developed by our friend Yves Guillot-Goguet from the fascicles of The Urantia Book, I cannot resist transcribing this grandiose page of Urantian femininity that is the life of the mother of Jesus of Nazareth.

As an accompaniment, here is the more contemporary testimony of a personal friend, who agreed to relate her daily spiritual experience, that is to say in her life as a couple. (She does not yet read the UB).

On Paul's side, the continuation of the Hymn to Love.

For meditation, a little novelty, with an extract from the spiritual psychology of Meredith J. Sprunger pre-translated (but not yet finalized) by our late Chris Ragetly. A little edifying tour also on the side of the Life of the Masters of B. Spalding.

Robert summarizes the meeting in Châles for us.

In space, the dance of exoplanet discoveries and questions about the Higgs boson...

With my favorite, the funny and colorful comic strip of the Voyage des Pères! It's fresh, it's young, contemporary. Just enough to challenge us. As illustrations, a nod to the couple Adam and Eve according to the humorist cartoonist “Jean Effel”!

Happy reading to all
Fraternally yours.
