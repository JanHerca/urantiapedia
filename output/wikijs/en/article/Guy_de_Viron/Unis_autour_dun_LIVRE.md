A small link between us, the Link can only make us think about what unites us, what drives us and what we want to share.

Reflection therefore in the form of questions for an in-depth debate which could animate a future section of this same Link. I look forward to your opinions and your testimonies! Thank you in advance.

A Book for a Revelation! This may seem incredible, indefinable, even unclassifiable, since it is unique in our entire Nebadonian universe...

But what do we do with it?

For some, it is the new Bible, the standard of a planetary mission. For others, the lighthouse of Alexandria of the present millennium for any self-respecting spiritual sailor. For still others, it remains quite simply a precious spiritual pillow or the best... of chewigums! Should we distribute it, or even impose it? Discuss it with much argument and rhetoric within our study group?

Should we live it internally and let it show through homeopathically? Pray as a family so that the Spirit enlightens and motivates us? ...

As for Chris, his question is more direct: “Are we ambassadors of this fifth revelation?”

So, what place do we give to The Urantia Book in our daily lives? How can we make this priceless “talent” bear fruit or how can we transmit its insight in these troubled times... which could otherwise last a millennium, it seems (<a id="a51_230"></a>[UB 99:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p1_1))? However, we are only in the third generation of readers!

Seeing the hives-like reactions that certain messages give on the $A F F L U$ forum, we are still having to revise our ranges of patience and modesty... and hoping to focus the attention of younger and perhaps more efficient readers.

Fortunately, the affluent poets illuminate us with their art! Thanks to Georges, Jean, Octavie and the others!

Happy reading to all
Fraternally yours.

Guy
