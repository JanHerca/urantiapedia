<p style="text-align:center;">
It is a little troubled that I sign this present Editorial!<br>
<br>
For the first time, I am taking the risk of calling on your talents as intimate narrators to address two themes that are currently dear to me: on the one hand, the personality of Paul which, for me, has been wrongly criticized and, on the other hand, the eternal feminine. What unites these subjects?<br>
<br>
Their spiritual contribution to our Urantian humanity!<br>
<br>
The first, despite his apparent misogyny, founded Christianity.<br>
<br>
The second, despite centuries of obscurantism and machismo, remains an undeniable source of inspiration!<br>
<br>
Is this sufficient, fair, appropriate? What should we expect from it?<br>
<br>
Can we improve things? While this is hotly debated among our Quebec sisters, what are we doing at home?<br>
<br>
Purely as a joke, my little illustrations evoke my “Joint Actress”, my way of being attentive to the sweet company of all those who share my modest existence.<br>
<br>
It must be said that there is an abundance of literature in this area.<br>
<br>
You just have to read the prose of our friend Octavie or Agnès to understand that everything is in gestation, in the making.<br>
<br>
So, I take the risk of inviting you all to express your feelings and co-write the next link(s) in this direction!<br>
<br>
Happy reading to all<br>
<br>
Fraternally yours.<br>
<br>
Guy<br>
