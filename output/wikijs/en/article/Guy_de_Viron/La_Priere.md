Ah, to pray! And our soul to breathe, to oxygenate itself with this indispensable spirituality invigorating our long and confusing existence!

A vital function if there ever was one, it should be almost natural to us, like any good reflex mastered in the art of living.

Our divine Master tried to teach us...

This is what Chris reminds us of through his study of the prayers of Nebadon.

Personally, I could not resist bringing out another reflection on the “Our Father” proposed by a Parisian pastor during one of his sermons. I offer you a first extract because ... it remains a ... sermon! The second part will appear in the next Link. However, if a reader wants the entire text, just let me know by e-mail.

A little fun innovation, Max invites us to his “Urantian quiz” with questions and answers. Without taking itself seriously, this new animation of the Link is welcome and will, with your agreement, feed the next issues. Rest assured, no one will come to check your results and fine you with a Urantian tax, or even a Nebadonian tax if by chance your quota of correct answers is not reached. On the other hand, if you excel in all your answers (no less than 350 questions are planned), nothing prevents you from asking our friend Max a few more challenging ones!

The Spirit being universal, here is the mischievous testimony of an Iranian woman: Malek Jân Ne'mati. As such, there is not only the subject of nuclear energy as a concern in this corner of Urantia...

With Joël Goldsmidt, let us become transparent with love! And, Jean R reminds us of the Double Nature!

Happy reading to all, Kind regards,

Guy
