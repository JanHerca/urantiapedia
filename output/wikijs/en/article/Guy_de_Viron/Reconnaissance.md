“Ah! If you only knew!”

This could be Chris' exhortation accompanying us, in spirit, during our stay in Chalès! We are a little more reassured by his study on the World of Mansions! If the transition is likely to be gentle, our interest remains primarily the effort to put into practice here below the teachings of the Urantia Book.

And, rest assured, Chris' studies will still be at the Lien for some time to come. All our gratitude for this spiritual heritage...

“Ah! If you only knew!”... could also be the wise recommendation to no longer eat... frog legs! No more excuses! Here is the genome of this friendly amphibian deciphered! And its familiarity with the human species no longer needs to be demonstrated, let us be grateful and attentive to this magnificent ancestral creature! Between “conserved synteny” and “jumping” genes, a real treat... for the mind!

“Ah! If you only knew!”... the correct answers to the new maxien quiz!... Have fun or revise!

Challenged by this new religion that is Bahaism and the relevance of some of its teachings, I dare to transcribe here some elements of information concerning it. A century later, it is good to question this religious dynamism that continues to spread around the globe. Your opinions are awaited and could be the theme of a forum.

Feminine views on Jesus' attitude towards women by Françoise, the lightness of being, experienced by Octavie, the wink of the ABFU by Murielle and the report of Chalès by our devoted Anne-Marie!

Jean-Claude reacts to the notions of hermeticism and eugenics.

We are leaving the operation of the study group proposed by the AUI but while keeping certain useful coaching rules to simplify our lives...

Happy reading to all

With complete confidence.

Guy
