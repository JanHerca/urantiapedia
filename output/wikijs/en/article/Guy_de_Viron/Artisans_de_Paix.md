Summer season obliges, here is a simplified edition of the Link with the resumption of two texts by Chris Ragetly, especially at the request of our friend Lucas. The first addresses the theme of suicide while the second is more of a series of short reflections.

Next, the fourth part of Meredith Sprunger's text: Personal Temporal Realities: Our Material Body and Our Material Mind-Brain and Planetary Realities: The Total Ecological Environment.

As self-esteem is a current topic, here is the sequel to which it is good to link the Art of Blessing, a good habit to acquire!

Georges takes us in the footsteps of Jesus and draws us into the lyricism of the songs.

Three young idealists, citizens of the world, share their dreams of peace after a formative stay at “Initiatives and Change” in Caux sur Montreux (CH).

Max continues to gently make us sweat with his eleventh Quiz! A performance in itself!

Your illustrator on duty having taken time off, the “amorous” illustrations are a nod and a tribute to the talent of Jean-Claude Marol since they are taken from his repertoire “Jeu t'aime”, published by Jouvence!

Take advantage of this end of summer for its fruits and its scents without forgetting all the spiritual scents that are at our disposal!

Happy reading to all
Fraternally yours.
