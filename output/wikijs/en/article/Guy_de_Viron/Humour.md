Humor may not be an integral part of the fruits of the Spirit... Although! It nevertheless remains one of the principal joys of Existence... right up to the gates of Paradise.

Here below, it is the main antidote against overwork, existential tensions and especially against the exaltation of our ego.

If one of the functions of humor is to help us all take ourselves less seriously, it is to show us that we are eternal beginners. And, if our past is thickened with heavy shadows, the humorous look that we project on it will quickly illuminate it and lighten it of a good part of its futilities.

Less anxious, we are then able to minimize the worries of the present in favor of the certainties of the future. It is thus our health insurance at the same time as our liberator from emotional pressures!

Religion should have humor as a counterbalance. (P.1616 — §5) Since a sense of humor is not innate among the human populations of Urantia, it is necessary to cultivate it, even to teach it.

Humor should function as an automatic safety valve to prevent the build-up of excessive pressures due to the monotony of serious and continuous self-contemplation associated with the struggle for gradual development and nobly attainment.

Humor also acts to reduce the shock of the unexpected impact of facts and truth. Facts are rigid and inflexible: truth is pliable and ever-living. The mortal personality is never sure what is going to happen to it. Through humor it quickly grasps (sees what it is about and becomes perceptive) the unexpected nature of the situation, whether it be facts or truth.

Through this present Link, I do not claim to publish a masterpiece of true humor and superior quality. Just a little moment of spiritual relaxation with very light and non-aggressive texts.

I hope you enjoy it with a light heart!

Happy reading to all
Humorously yours.

Guy
