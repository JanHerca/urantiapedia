Here is Link No. 67 in its summer edition, that is to say sparkling and starry, all in lightness! Something to entertain you until the start of the school year!

Simon explains his other vision to us while Meredith Sprunger encourages us to act and be more determined; a little zest of serenity and dual philosophy, both Hindu and Buddhist; a pinch of dream with the synthesis of the Alchemist and a favorite with the reference of an “ace” of martial arts who relates very well her daily practice of her art of living and fighting...!

The illustrations are purely fanciful!

Happy reading to all.

Fraternally yours.

The Editor in Chief

Guy from Viron
