Impossible to live without water...!

A vital and regenerative element par excellence, both our fuel and our catalyst, it is so familiar to us that it often goes unnoticed!

However, we are rediscovering the inestimable value of this “blue gold” whether on earth, on the eve of the Copenhagen Summit, or on the moon to fuel our future extraterrestrial expeditions...

Where water flows, life flourishes! ...

On a spiritual level, UB offers us free access to a continuous source of Living Water provided that we circulate it intensively and regularly.

May we all live along the “thread” of the UB towards the sumptuous shores of fraternal service! May this fountain of Living Water replace our “Christmas tree” at least one day of these upcoming holidays!...

The report of the seahorse is edifying as to the power of the mind which not only can refuse a penalizing verdict but finds the resources necessary to reverse the evolution of the handicap and the strength to engage in dynamic altruistic service...

Among the other texts, Johanna summarizes the meeting at Notre-Dame de Lumières, Chris offers us the theme of uncertainty and security while Jean-Claude reveals to us the Consumer of Destiny and Georges offers us his sonnet “Apostles and Lion”.

In a reprise of Marvin Gawryn's Chemin des Cîmes, here is an extract concerning our emotions. The same goes for Joël Goldsmith, with this first synthesis of The Gift of Love.

Happy reading to all, Kind regards,

Guy
