The least we can say about this weekend which brought us together in Suresnes is that we were all “disappointed in a good way” and that our spiritual expectations were largely fulfilled! Indeed, the thirty or so readers that we were were literally energized and inspired by the Spirit of Truth throughout this fraternal sharing!

However, it was far from obvious that we would try to redraw the profile of the extraordinary personality that Jesus of Nazareth had, with our perspective as a child of “modern times” and without falling into the eternal debate between the Man-God and the God-Man. We did not even have to ask ourselves the question of whether we were talking about a brother, a father or a superman. No, the portrait of Jesus appeared to us in all his humility and simplicity.

In fact, already brought together by the UB, we were able to benefit from the support of three texts* written by Johanna, Dolfo and Chris. Reading them galvanized us and served as a common thread for the rest of our study, all in respect and admiration for the unique privilege of sharing the human adventure on the planet of the seventh effusion.

Fully accepting his Urantian heritage, our Creator Son resolutely developed, exploited and refined his physical, family, religious and cultural background until they were fully mastered. It was with complete confidence in this well-honed human potential, as well as in his Heavenly Father, that he agreed to complete the journey of his earthly incarnation.

Curious and keen observer, his passion for the human race gave him a cheerful and enthusiastic character, both affectionate and merciful. Leaving behind his divine attributes, he was very early recognized as an expert in human relations and was later able to speak with authority and wisdom about his mission: to reveal the Father to men of all backgrounds and all ages.

Once his human personality was unified, his spiritual development progressed until the day of baptism in the Jordan, where his divine nature was fully revealed.

It is therefore with unspeakable admiration that we reread and commented on the references in the title of the UB. For half of us, our reflection relied heavily on booklet 100, religion in human experience (p 1101).

Today, Jesus still challenges us to follow him and resolutely practice his teachings while reassuring us that the enterprise is not as perilous as it seems provided that we learn to do the will of our Father. His spirit accompanies us on the path of eternity and assures us of the eternal trust that he has placed in us.
