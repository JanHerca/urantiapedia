A great man, this Teilhard de Chardin! At once a Jesuit, researcher, theologian, paleontologist and philosopher! It is through an interesting reflection on love, tinged with spirituality, that he takes us and which will be expressed in several Links.

The generous verve of our friend Georges D. invites us to revisit the imaginary notebook of Jesus and the “Golden Legend” about Pilate.

Jean-Claude R. sends us his open letter while André Ch. is worried about the decline of our civilization.

Max faithfully cooks his thirteenth Quiz for us! Well done and good luck!

Finally, let us not forget to practice gratitude daily and to live in the light, so dear to Anatole France.

On the “advertising” side, here is my little recommendation: the guide to Spirituality. See the contact details of this quite extraordinary book which maps out works on spirituality in France, Belgium and Switzerland. A true reference for any seeker of truth since it is a mine of addresses and sites. It can also be consulted in a library. Notice to enlightened amateurs!

As for the present illustrations, they are inspired by Roy Mitchell with his collection “God... What is he like?”

Happy reading to all.

Fraternally yours.
