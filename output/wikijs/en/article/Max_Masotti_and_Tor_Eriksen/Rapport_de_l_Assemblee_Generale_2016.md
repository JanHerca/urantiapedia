## INTRODUCTION

This year, despite the low number of participants, and thanks to the modification of our statutes, we were able to hold a valid general assembly with 13 registered members and two proxies.

**Generalities**

For several years the number of members has been decreasing, due to lack of renewal and the remaining members manage as best they can to keep the association running. But if we look back over 20 years, this has often been the case.

**Agenda**

The operation does not pose any particular problems but our reception of consultants is rather poor. How can we create groups with so few members so far apart from each other?

**Event of the year 2015**

***International Conference in Quebec***

Visit of a good French team to QUEBEC for an international meeting based on the education of children. Very friendly and very well organized.

This was the opportunity for AFLUB to promise to participate in a book advertising event in UKRAINE where an association has existed since 2010. We produced, for them and according to their wishes, Urantian advertising objects (sign and bookmarks in RUSSIAN). This promise had been made by Stol Ivan.

***Franco-Italian Meeting in Verona***

Danielle LA SCALA organized a meeting with Italian readers. This initiative aimed to explain how to organize group meetings and to boost this awakening to URANTIA in ITALY.

***Trade fairs***

The “Well-being” fairs have made some individuals aware of the existence of the _Urantia Book_. But for the moment there are few repercussions.

## How AFLLU works

**Elections**

The request was made for a candidacy for a director position. As no candidacy was presented, the current directors were tacitly reappointed. No vote took place.

**AFLUB Books**

The AFLUB has recovered a stock of “The Urantia Book” and members can contact the association directly to obtain them. The association can also sell them directly to those who request them. (See financial report). There are also quite a few works such as “The Veil Rises” and “The Path to the Peaks”.

**Contributions**

It was requested to be able to pay the contributions using Paypal. It seems that this is possible, to be confirmed.

**Bank Account**

Today, only the treasurer has access to the bank account due to a problem with the transfer of ownership procedure which could not take place. An attempt to create an account that was easier to manage at the Banque Postale was a failure due to a lack of official document for the official address of our association.

So, even today, the problem remains, the president does not have access to the account.

**New Contacts**

Thirteen people contacted the AFLUB to be part of a readers' group, but the geographical distance of these people is an obstacle.

We need to be able to offer other solutions like the now renamed UBIS or the new Zoom video conferencing system. But we need to find people to initiate these initiatives.

**Regional Intermediaries**

Which brings us to talk about the regional intermediaries who seem to be deserting their posts a little. We could use some reinforcements.

On the other hand, just as the number of members decreases, the number of groups is only 6:

- 3 in the PACA region
- 2 in Paris
- 1 in Brittany

see also our secretary's report further on.

It was also decided to open our association to non-member supporters who wish to stay informed of the news of the association and the world by having access to our site and its various information and sections. They benefit from the sending of the newspaper “Le Lien” by email.

**Internet**

The website has not evolved much but is holding up well in the statistics. Thor made a request for part of the site to be virtualized for full management access, which was accepted (additional costs acceptable).

**Our magazine “The Link”**

Our magazine becomes accessible to everyone from our site. All the issues have been assembled into one which is still nearly 2000 pages of reading.

## REPORT FROM OUR SECRETARY

**Readership Report 2016**

Hello everyone,

I sincerely regret not being able to come to this national meeting whose themes are close to my heart, but my health does not allow me to do so at the moment and I hope to be able to participate in a future meeting, God willing. What happened this year?

The very positive point we owe to Madame Danielle La Scala who took the initiative and the trouble to organize a meeting, at the end of August, between Italian and French readers, in the town of Bussolengo near Verona and without forgetting our dear local Swiss, Mr. Guy De Viron who also participated in this meeting.

This type of event is happening again this year from October 6 to 9 on Lake Garda in Northern Italy. (Refer to the previous Link from June 2016 No. 74 to learn about the theme of the meeting, booking conditions and prices. For those who wish, it is still time to register.

What is less encouraging is that this year, we only had 34 members who paid their membership fee. I think this is due to the fact that we no longer send the membership fee document by mail, but by email, and some forget it in their emails.

The important change is that we decided, at the general meeting and as a cost-saving measure, to no longer have the Link printed at Jean Annet in Belgium but to distribute it to members by email, taking into account that for those who do not have an email address, it is the president who will send them photocopies of these links by post.

**Reader Donations**

In 2014, readers donated 5,930 euros and in 2015 donations amounted to 3,850 euros.

So, 2080 euros less, life is hard but we will make do.

**New Readers 2015**

In 2015, we were contacted by 13 new readers in various regions of France and especially in regions that never appeared before, such as Auvergne or Lorraine.

New contacts in Switzerland, Languedoc Roussillon, Midi Pyrénées, Central France and two contacts in Paris and two in the PACA region, one of whom joined our association as a member and is now part of our study group.

**Regional Study Groups and Intermediaries**

We currently have 6 groups left, divided as follows:

2 groups in Paris — 1 in Brittany (about which I know nothing) -3 in the PACA region: Avignon, Var and Marseille.

Not agreeing with the government on the division of regions that the latter has put in place, I am keeping my 22 beautiful regions of France with the aim of also making the task easier for our regional intermediaries who, following this new division, will find themselves in duplicate with immense regions to manage.

The next secretary is free to manage the new regions of France as he or she wishes.

Regarding our regional intermediaries, we have 9 IRs concerning the following regions:

Brittany with Henk and Claire Mylanus, Central France with Jean Duveau, Pays de la Loire with Séverin Desbuisson, Midi Pyrénées with Paul Hortal, Languedoc Roussillon with François Le Rohellec, Burgundy and Champagne Ardenne with Christine Baussain, Franche Comté with Xavier Grandvaux, Alsace with José Winum and the PACA region with Max Masotti.

Concerning Île de France, our regional intermediary, Robert Gallo, moved to Nice and to date no one has wanted to take up the torch to manage this region.

As for the Marseille group, it is still growing a little.

We regularly have between 11 and 14 participants and our meetings are held every first Saturday of the month, at our friend André Croisé's house in Septèmes les Vallons (Marseille).

A proposal was made to split the group into two but no one stepped forward to take over the leadership of a new group.

**Departure to the World of Houses**

We were informed on February 2, 2016, of the death of our friend Damien Damaris Roets Blomme who was a fervent reader of the _Urantia Book_.

We wish him a safe journey in the peace and love of the Lord and we hope that his new life will be better than the one he lived on Earth.

**Our SITE**

After information obtained from our friend Tor who is responsible for our site.

The main site: http://www.urantia.fr/

Attendance has remained stable since the site was created in 2009, around 60 significant visits per day.

A new site will be set up in June with the new 2016 translation. The site will be more modern and better adapted to Smartphones and tablets.

Google is now starting to penalize/downgrade sites that are not suitable for smartphones and tablets

The Forum: http://forum.urantia.fr/

Attendance has remained stable since the creation of the forum. There are currently around fifty participants. Most of them are well-known.

Right now we have about 2-3 posts per week.

Since the forum was created in 2010, participants have posted approximately 4,000 messages.

We also have two other sites:

http://membres.urantia.fr/ the old site of Philippe Rolland

And

http://livre.urantia.fr/ which includes the 2014 translation/revision

I'm not sure what we need to do to increase traffic to our sites and interest in The Urantia Book?

Perhaps the AFLUB needs new blood?
