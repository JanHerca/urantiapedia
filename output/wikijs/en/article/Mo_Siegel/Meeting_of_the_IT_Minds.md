_By Mo Siegel_

Upon conclusion of the October 2009 meeting of Urantia Foundation's Board of Trustees, another group of dedicated readers convened at 533 Diversey Parkway to attend an Information Technology (IT) Leadership Round Table. The meeting, lasting 24 hours, was attended by sixteen readers who actively shape the face of _The Urantia Book_ on the internet and within digital technology.

The IT specialists participating in the Round Table came together to share best practices, experiences, strategies, and new ideas for internet technologies to serve the community of potential and current readers of _The Urantia Book_. The group, including four trustees, spent their time discussing various strategic IT/internet alternatives that maximize reader benefits while minimizing redundancies, over expenditures, and conflicts. The simple object of the meeting was to efficiently and effectively maximize service to the Urantia Revelation in the digital age. Without exception, the diverse group worked in harmony, friendship, and dedication to a higher cause.
