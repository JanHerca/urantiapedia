_By Mo Siegel, president, Urantia Foundation, Colorado, United States_

One of Urantia Foundation's biggest challenges in the past few decades has been satisfying readers' desires to see improvements in the 1993 translation of _The Urantia Book_, _El libro de Urantia_. In 2021 a revision of this translation was published but it was met with additional concerns. After a two-year study to help determine the best path forward, Urantia Foundation developed the following plan to improve both the 1993 and 2021 texts.

On March 28, 2025, a press release and FAQs regarding this plan were sent to the Spanish-speaking community. The following day Urantia Foundation hosted a townhall meeting which included presentations on the plan and time for questions and answers. More than 60 Spanish-speaking readers attended this session. A copy of the information shared by Urantia Foundation follows.

Dear readers of _El libro de Urantia_,

Greetings, fellow believers! We write to you today with important news regarding the future of our cherished texts in Spanish. After extensive consultation with readers and translation experts across the Spanish-speaking world, we are implementing a comprehensive plan that honors our heritage and results in future improvements.

For decades, readers have sought improvements to the 1993 Spanish translation. In 2011, we assembled a team to undertake a profound revision intended to produce a high-quality, beautifully written text that Spanish speakers across Latin America and Spain would gladly embrace. After a decade of work, we published the revised text online in December 2021. To our surprise, the extent of the changes led a number of readers to view it as an entirely new translation. We quickly recognized many readers' deep, passionate connection with the 1993 edition and their concerns regarding the 2021 text. In response, we are implementing a two-pronged approach to refine the 1993 and 2021 texts. During this period, we will continue to publish the 2009 European translation as well.

We appreciate your thoughtful engagement—writing letters, participating in focus groups, and completing our survey. After considering diverse perspectives and concerns, we are taking steps to honor the deep spiritual and emotional bonds readers have with _El libro de Urantia_ while embracing the need to continually improve our translations.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

## The Path Forward

Urantia Foundation will maintain and enhance the 1993 and 2021 editions through a patient, systematic, and ongoing improvement process. Our plan involves continuing to sell the 1993 and 2009 versions. At the same time, we will make improvements to the 1993 and the 2021 texts under the leadership of Urantia Foundation and its appointed revision teams.

The initial revision for the 1993 text will primarily address grammatical errors, spelling, and punctuation while making minimal changes. Further improvements will be implemented through incremental revisions. The 2021 translation will be refined as well.

An online feedback system at [urantia.org/es](http://urantia.org/es) will be used to receive input from readers of the Spanish texts. Revised editions of both translations are expected to be ready within five years, more or less.

## Anticipated Outcome

The 1993 translation will continue to be printed during the improvement process. Upon completion of each incremental phase, the revised text will be printed. The 2021 text, once revised, assessed, and found ready for publication, will be printed. At that point, the 2009 translation will be placed in the online Library of Translations and Revisions.

## The Process

To ensure the highest quality outcomes, we are implementing the following steps:

- **Launching Foundationmanaged revision teams** dedicated to each edition
- **Revision team members will** strive for consistent terms across editions
- **An online feedback system** where readers can share insights and suggestions
- **Periodic virtual meetings** and workshops to discuss proposed updates and keep readers informed
- **A comprehensive documentation process** to track and communicate all suggested improvements

## Your Role in this Process

Your voice is essential in this journey. Over the coming months, we will provide multiple ways for you to engage:

- **An online feedback system** for submitting comments and suggestions
- **Virtual Q&A meetings** to explore key topics
- **Direct consultations** with readers and scholars

## Our Commitment to You

We recognize that change is not always easy and deeply respect readers' strong connection with their preferred editions. Knowing that there will be many Spanish translations of The Urantia Book over decades, we desire to provide readers with two excellent translations to choose from, or they can read both. This is not ideal but the practical way forward. Our goal is not to replace them but to refine and preserve these texts in ways that honor their language and cultures.

We believe that unity does not require uniformity. By maintaining and enhancing both editions, we ensure that these profound spiritual teachings will continue to inspire and transform lives throughout the Spanish-speaking world.

In the coming month, you will receive information on how to participate in this revision process. We invite you to join us in preserving and strengthening the editions of _El libro de Urantia_ for current and future generations.

Thank you for your dedication to this revelation, your commitment to spreading its teachings, and your service to the family of our loving Heavenly Father.
