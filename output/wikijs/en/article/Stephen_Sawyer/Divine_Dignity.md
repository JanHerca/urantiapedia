_by Stephen Sawyer_

When Jesus taught us that we were, by faith, children of the living God, he lifted us from the life of fear and superstition that totally engulfed us as mortals for untold centuries.

Given this status of divine dignity more than two thousand years ago there are still countless brothers and sisters who fall behind because they discard or misunderstand this profound eternal truth that we are, in fact, sons and daughters of God.

We have the power to choose our attitudes when confronted by evil. When we truly experience this saving truth we will stand silent before our false accusers, pray for those who abuse us, and forgive others even if they crucify us.

Jesus stood in majestic silence and dignity before Herod. When he remained so, even as he was mocked and beaten, the vast armies of Heaven looked on not only in horror but in awe.

When Jesus was crucified he said, “Father forgive them for they know not what they do.”

“Divine Dignity” is dedicated to all who have been falsely accused and betrayed.
