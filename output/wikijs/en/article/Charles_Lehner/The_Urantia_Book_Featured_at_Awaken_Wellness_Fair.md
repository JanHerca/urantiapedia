_By Charles Lehner, New York, United States_

_The Urantia Book_ tells us in Paper 145 that physical healing was considered incidental to Jesus’ revelatory mission: “The healing wonders which every now and then attended Jesus’ mission on earth were not a part of his plan of proclaiming the kingdom.” [UB 145:3.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p3_15) In fact, it tended to create the wrong kind of publicity. Nonetheless, his apostles found that the gospel had salutary effects. They discovered that “the good news of the kingdom was very comforting to the sick; that their message carried healing for the afflicted.” [UB 141:8.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p8_2) While we did not lay on hands or give a Reiki treatment, we did our best to present the fifth epochal revelation to the attendees of a recent green health fair.

The Awaken Wellness Fair, a New Age fair termed a “body mind spirit green expo” by the organizers, was the third of four such fairs in the New York metropolitan area to have a Urantia Book presence this year. It took place on November 24 in Tarrytown, Westchester County. The list of vendors and exhibitors included nutritionists, water experts, authors, jewelers, healers, and psychics.

We are grateful to Urantia Foundation for sponsoring this event for the Urantia Society of Greater New York. Our table was well placed and gave us good exposure to attendees. A hardcover book was on the table as a reference. We sold or gave away about 10 softcover books which had been donated for this purpose. We also encouraged people to access the free online text and audio.

We offered handouts and secondary works, including some kid-friendly materials from UrantiaLifeLessons.com. However, one young person picked up a copy of _The Urantia Book_ and exclaimed, “Wow, this has answers to all the questions I've been asking!”

We reconnected with a few vendors and attendees who had been at the NewLife Expo in Manhattan. One person came to the Awaken Wellness Fair to see us in particular! Through these continued contacts and quality interactions, we made friends and learned to better serve one another.

We showed up early and volunteered to help other exhibitors. Some vendors thanked us, and the organizer asked, “Is being helpful part of your philosophy?” The answer is yes! I encourage all Urantia Book readers to exemplify selfless service, as we share the Universal Father's love in the service of the human brotherhood.
