Additional time or extension of the probationary period.

By Jean Duveau

The maximum optimization of our potential in our initial life can end with the fusion with our Adjuster, naturally after having crossed the cosmic circles which are sometimes called:

- Mortal Progression Circles ([UB 49:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p6_8))
- Or psychic circles ([UB 108:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p2_9))
- Or circles of human accomplishment ([UB 110:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_6))
- Or circles of cosmic accomplishment ([UB 110:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p7_2))
- Or circles of premorontial outcomes ([UB 112:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p6_9))
- Or circle of human intellectuality and acquired spirituality” ([UB 113:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p1_8))

So this initial life is our probationary period of our pre-eternity.

In summary, according to my understanding or interpretation, our initial life is the probationary period which can allow fusion with our adjuster and Jesus demonstrated this in his short life less than 2000 years ago.

> “Ordinarily, when a mortal of the realm attains such high levels of personality perfection, there occur those preliminary phenomena of spiritual elevation which terminate in eventual fusion of the matured soul of the mortal with its associated divine Adjuster. And such a change was apparently due to take place in the personality experience of Jesus of Nazareth on that very day when he went down into the Jordan with his two brothers to be baptized by John. This ceremony was the final act of his purely human life on Urantia, and many superhuman observers expected to witness the fusion of the Adjuster with its indwelt mind, but they were all destined to suffer disappointment. Something new and even greater occurred. As John laid his hands upon Jesus to baptize him, the indwelling Adjuster took final leave of the perfected human soul of Joshua ben Joseph. And in a few moments this divine entity returned from Divinington as a Personalized Adjuster and chief of his kind throughout the entire local universe of Nebadon. Thus did Jesus observe his own former divine spirit descending on its return to him in personalized form. And he heard this same spirit of Paradise origin now speak, saying, “This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.” And John, with Jesus’ two brothers, also heard these words. John’s disciples, standing by the water’s edge, did not hear these words, neither did they see the apparition of the Personalized Adjuster. Only the eyes of Jesus beheld the Personalized Adjuster.” ([UB 136:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p2_3))


Unfortunately in our short lives we all need a little “extra help” to merge.

So for us, despite an initial life on average longer than that of Jesus, we need additional time.

This additional time is called “extension of the probationary period” which is granted to us under certain conditions of intentions or survival of the soul.

My study is in the chronological order of reading the UB booklets which led me to this interpretation.

In Paper 45, “a Melchizedek with a temporary assignment on Urantia” ([UB 45:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p7_9)) tells us that on

> “*Number 1. The Finaliter World.* This is the headquarters of the finaliter corps of the local system and is surrounded by the receiving worlds, the seven mansion worlds, dedicated so fully to the scheme of mortal ascension. The finaliter world is accessible to the inhabitants of all seven mansion worlds. Transport seraphim carry ascending personalities back and forth on these pilgrimages, which are designed to cultivate their faith in the ultimate destiny of transition mortals. Although the finaliters and their structures are not ordinarily perceptible to morontia vision, you will be more than thrilled, from time to time, when the energy transformers and the Morontia Power Supervisors enable you momentarily to glimpse these high spirit personalities who have actually completed the Paradise ascension, and who have returned to the very worlds where you are beginning this long journey, as the pledge of assurance that you may and can complete the stupendous undertaking. All mansion world sojourners go to the finaliter sphere at least once a year for these assemblies of finaliter visualization.” ([UB 45:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_2))

And that

> “The Melchizedeks are the directors of that large corps of instructors—partially spiritualized will creatures and others—who function so acceptably on Jerusem and its associated worlds but especially on the seven mansion worlds. These are the detention planets, where those mortals who fail to achieve fusion with their indwelling Adjusters during the life in the flesh are rehabilitated in transient form to receive further help and to enjoy extended opportunity for continuing their strivings for spiritual attainment, those very efforts which were prematurely interrupted by death. Or if, for any other reason of hereditary handicap, unfavorable environment, or conspiracy of circumstances, this soul attainment was not completed, no matter what the reason, all who are true of purpose and worthy in spirit find themselves, as themselves, present on the continuing planets, where they must learn to master the essentials of the eternal career, to possess themselves of traits which they could not, or did not, acquire during the lifetime in the flesh.” ([UB 45:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p7_1))

Then in booklet 110 “a Solitary Messenger from Orvonton” ([UB 110:7.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p7_11)) tells us that crossing the cosmic circles

> “Perhaps these psychic circles of mortal progression would be better denominated *cosmic levels—*actual meaning grasps and value realizations of progressive approach to the morontia consciousness of initial relationship of the evolutionary soul with the emerging Supreme Being. And it is this very relationship that makes it forever impossible fully to explain the significance of the cosmic circles to the material mind. These circle attainments are only relatively related to God-consciousness. A seventh or sixth circler can be almost as truly God-knowing—sonship conscious—as a second or first circler, but such lower circle beings are far less conscious of experiential relation to the Supreme Being, universe citizenship. The attainment of these cosmic circles will become a part of the ascenders’ experience on the mansion worlds if they fail of such achievement before natural death.” ([UB 110:6.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_16))

And in booklet 112 still “a Solitary Messenger of Orvonton” ([UB 112:7.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p7_20)) tells us that...

> “Though the cosmic circles of personality growth must eventually be attained, if, through no fault of your own, the accidents of time and the handicaps of material existence prevent your mastering these levels on your native planet, if your intentions and desires are of survival value, there are issued the decrees of probation extension. You will be afforded additional time in which to prove yourself.”
> 
> “If ever there is doubt as to the advisability of advancing a human identity to the mansion worlds, the universe governments invariably rule in the personal interests of that individual; they unhesitatingly advance such a soul to the status of a transitional being, while they continue their observations of the emerging morontia intent and spiritual purpose. Thus divine justice is certain of achievement, and divine mercy is accorded further opportunity for extending its ministry.” ([UB 112:5.6-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_6))

And that

> “On the evolutionary worlds, selfhood is material; it is a thing in the universe and as such is subject to the laws of material existence. It is a fact in time and is responsive to the vicissitudes thereof. *Survival decisions must here be formulated.* In the morontia state the self has become a new and more enduring universe reality, and its continuing growth is predicated on its increasing attunement to the mind and spirit circuits of the universes. *Survival decisions are now being confirmed.* When the self attains the spiritual level, it has become a secure value in the universe, and this new value is predicated upon the fact that *survival decisions have been made,* which fact has been witnessed by eternal fusion with the Thought Adjuster. And having achieved the status of a true universe value, the creature becomes liberated in potential for the seeking of the highest universe value—God.” ([UB 112:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p7_6))

My understanding of the chronological reading (interpretation) of these paragraphs is that:

**First** [UB 45:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_2), [UB 45:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p7_1), [UB 112:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_7).

I understand that if the fusion is not enacted “during life in the flesh” then additional help is granted to us conditionally “on the continuation planets” (the mansion worlds), in “a provisional form” as a “transitional mortal,” therefore with a “soul with the status of a transitional being.”

**Then secondly** [UB 110:6.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_16)

I understand that whatever cosmic circles remain to be traversed for fusion will be “part of the ascenders' experience on the mansion worlds” (the continuation planets).

**And thirdly** [UB 112:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_6), [UB 112:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_7), [UB 112:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p7_6)

So the entire earthly crossing period can be considered as a “probationary” period which can be extended with additional time which begins on the world of houses number 1 with a "transitional being status $\%$. Naturally an earthly probationary period can definitely end prematurely in the event of death of the soul.

During the Earth probationary period “survival decisions must be made” [UB 112:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p7_6)

But I am convinced that with divine justice, on a planet affected by rebellion, a planet devoid of an Adamic couple and their spiritual centers of education, that the “survival formulation” can also be formulated during (the beginning of) this additional time which is granted and which will be definitively enacted by the fusion.

So according to my interpretation, there are only two accessions to additional time (to the mansion worlds) therefore only two terrestrial escapes other than fusion, linked to the cosmic circles.

**So Firstly** for ascenders of the 7th, 6th, 5th and 4th cosmic circles, they will have a collective earthly escape and they are considered Mortals of the dispensational or collective order of survival. ([UB 49:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p6_4))

**And Secondly** for ascenders of the 3rd, 2nd and 1st cosmic circle, they will have an individual earthly escape and they will be considered as Mortals of the individual orders of ascension. ([UB 49:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p6_8))

This is my understanding of the extra time or extension of the probationary period, which is given to us as additional assistance to verbally choose survival (accept the eternity plan) in full consciousness in order to merge.

Obviously, all this said, a friend from the foundation school (UBIS) pointed out to me the limits of the revelation with the following paragraph:

> There are two difficulties that hamper my efforts to explain just what happens to *you* in death, the surviving *you* which is distinct from the departing Adjuster. One of these consists in the impossibility of conveying to your level of comprehension an adequate description of a transaction on the borderland of the physical and morontia realms. The other is brought about by the restrictions placed upon my commission as a revelator of truth by the celestial governing authorities of Urantia. There are many interesting details which might be presented, but I withhold them upon the advice of your immediate planetary supervisors. But within the limits of my permission I can say this much: ([UB 112:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_11))

But I find that they say enough especially in connection with repersonalization. ([UB 112:5.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_16)) to ([UB 112:5.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_20)) and the prerequisite for all possibilities for souls “at transitional being status” of the seventh (lowest) cosmic circle to observe them on their morontia intentions and their emerging spiritual purposes on, in my opinion, the world of mansions number one.

View from ([UB 47:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p3_1)) to ([UB 47:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p3_9))
