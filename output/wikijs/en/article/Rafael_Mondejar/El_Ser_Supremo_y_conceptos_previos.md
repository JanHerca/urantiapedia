## GREETING AND PRESENTATION

Good morning/Good afternoon.

Friends, I am happy and grateful to be able to share with you what I believe I understand about the Supreme Being. However, I want to warn you that I have more willpower than knowledge, and that is why I ask that whenever you think I am mistaken or misinterpret any concept, you forgive me and help me with your contributions. In this way, together we will succeed in furthering the understanding of this God, which, as of today, is still beyond our comprehension.

In any case, I also want to point out that neither this presentation nor any other should replace a personalized and thoughtful reading of the LU. This presentation is selective; that is, it does not include all the concepts discussed in the LU regarding the Supreme Being, but rather, it focuses heavily on those that I found most interesting. Regarding the language used, I have often followed the same expressions as the book, but I have also used my own words on many occasions. Furthermore, I have preferred to accompany it with a few simple slides to reinforce my words and consolidate the ideas.

## INTRODUCTION

When I began to learn about the existence of the Supreme Being, I had the idea that it was a somewhat complex reality, but when I delved a little deeper, that initial complexity grew in me until it reached the limits of enormous confusion, because what at first seemed to me to be a single deity, I understood that, although in effect it is or will be in the distant future, the truth is that in an almost endless present it seems to be about three different deities: the Supreme Being, the Supreme Almighty and Supreme God.

In fact, there are three documents titled that way in the LU. And although this distribution led me to believe that I would eventually find in each document everything related to each of these deities, finally understanding them, what I really found was that the assignment of such names to the different deities was a real mess, and my confusion only increased.

In short, I felt lost; but my deep faith in The Urantia Book, for all it had already given me, and my awareness that I am an avid seeker, led me to delve deeper and deeper, hoping to clear up so much wordplay.

And today, with my ideas, I believe, somewhat clearer, I am happy, as I said at the beginning, to be able to share with you, who are surely also inveterate seekers, what I believe I have understood about the complex reality that is the Supreme Being. I hope it helps!

## ESSENTIAL PREVIOUS CONCEPTS

One of the difficulties we may encounter in documents dealing with the Supreme Being is the multitude of concepts included, the meanings of which must be thoroughly understood beforehand, otherwise we will not understand much of what we read or hear.

And so that you can tell me yourselves whether this is the time to clarify the meanings of such concepts or to move on because you already know them, allow me to list them so that you can then tell me where we should continue.

The concepts I am referring to have been grouped into four blocks.

The first of them is made up of:
- The I Am
- The levels of reality of the Universe
- And the seven Absolutes

The second block consists of:
- The Trinity of Paradise
- The Triunities
- The Triodities
- The Post-Havona Trinities
- And the Trinity of Trinities

In the third block I have included:
- Sevenfold God
- The Sevenfold Controllers
- And various concepts of “Power”

And finally, in the fourth block would be:
- Paradise
- The Central Universe of Havona
- The Grand Universe
- And the Master Universe

Well, here are the four blocks, somewhat summarized, and the idea is for you to tell me whether we move on to a brief presentation of these concepts, or some of them, or whether, on the contrary, we go directly to the presentation of the Supreme Being.

## THE I AM

To try to understand The I Am, it is necessary for us to go back to a hypothetical initial moment, prior to any manifestation of reality, prior even to the first original thought, and therefore prior to the manifestation of the Universal Father as such a Father, because no son yet existed. That is, let us imagine a moment in which only the I Am existed. Just as we have it there! Only He shines, but He shines before no one, because nothing and no one exists outside of Him. He exists in Himself and is the only reality. Can you imagine that hypothetical moment?

Well, <ins>natural! How strange! That we can / that we can't</ins> because we are human beings and we inexorably feel time. However, the truth is that that moment never existed, since the reality of the I Am has no origin in time; it is eternal. Time is only linked to finite existences, and that is why we, as finite beings, need to understand events sequentially. And since we are now trying to understand the I Am, that is why we need to invent or imagine that first moment.

Furthermore, the help I can give you is very limited. I only have that screen to represent the I AM, as the only reality existing before all manifestation. That's why it's only on the screen. But on that same screen, I will also represent “the changes that occurred in Him” to give rise to REALITY. And I will only be able to do this in a very simple, very schematic way, so we will have to use our imagination to try to understand it.

Well, then <ins>in that hypothetical moment</ins> that we have imagined,

THE I AM:
- It is the ONLY existing REALITY,
- It exists in and of itself; because outside of It there is no place where it exists, nor any being that could give it life.
- It contains all the potentialities.
- It has not yet been expressed.
- It is, therefore, total and absolute infinity
- and is only conditioned by his own unique will.

For this reason, The I Am is the ONLY ABSOLUTE POTENTIAL REALITY from which everything, absolutely everything, will come. It is the Primordial Source of all manifestation. And, in order to manifest, <ins>The I AM set out to do two things</ins>:
- On the one hand, diversify your own reality
- And on the other hand, to attenuate it


## THE LEVELS OF REALITY OF THE UNIVERSE

Let's see what are <ins>THE LEVELS OF REALITY OF THE UNIVERSE</ins> in which THE I Am diversified and attenuated.

To do this, let us see <ins>first of all</ins> how The “I Am” diversifies its own reality:

The first thing it does is separate, isolate within itself, or within itself, everything that is going to be personal from what is going to be impersonal, or, what is the same: everything that is going to be deified from what is going to be non-deified. That is, it separates or isolates spiritual reality from material reality, dynamic reality from static reality.

And since it has separated or isolated these realities, which are no longer in contact with each other on their own, it needs another reality that has the capacity to associate, integrate, and activate them when necessary. This associative, integrative, or activating reality, which is the mind, can associate with both the spiritual personality and the energy-matter, and in fact, can unite the attributes of both.

Thus, we have that THE I AM has diversified its own reality into three very distinct realms, which I have placed vertically on the screen and in different colors for better differentiation. On the left, with a red background, I have placed the realm of the deified, **the** dynamic realm **of personality and spirit**; while on the right, with a gray background, I have placed the realm of the non-deified, **the** static realm **of the impersonal and matter**. And in the center, in fuchsia, I have placed that realm that we all know as the mind, capable of activating any of the above, and even of associating, integrating, and uniting them completely.

As I say, THE I AM has diversified its reality, but He (and this is important, let us not forget) is still there behind, intact (we can see it in the background), holding all of this together.

Now, to continue taking advantage of the single screen we have, I'm going to tighten up this information a bit, but let's not lose sight of these three vertical areas, with their background colors and the aforementioned meanings, which I'll maintain throughout the presentation.

Now I'll also remove the characteristics of each of those areas, but it's worth remembering them basically. Okay? Okay, so they're out.

A couple of questions before concluding this aspect of the diversification of reality: Why did THE I AM differentiate or diversify? TO MANIFEST ITSELF!! And what consequences did this diversification of reality bring? Well, taking into account that the only initial reality was THE ABSOLUTE I AM, the immediate consequence of its diversification into three realms was the emergence of The Seven Absolutes, but we'll look at that step by step a little later.

Before I finish, I will explain the complete development of the areas and levels of reality that THE I AM proposed to realize and realized in order to carry out its complete manifestation.

So let us see, <ins>secondly</ins>, how The “I Am” attenuates its own absolute or infinite reality:

With the differentiation of the I AM into the three realms we have already seen, we only have the level of absolute or infinite, existential, and perfect reality, that is, the level of the I AM, the level of the Seven Absolutes, which I have already mentioned and which we will see shortly. Up to that point, this is the only level of manifested, fully manifested reality. But there also exists in each realm of this level of the I AM, an absolute potential for reality, which will not manifest here, but only on lower, sub-absolute, or attenuated levels.

And in this way, the “I Am,” through this absolute potential, will generate a new level of reality (there we have it); a reality that is attenuated with respect to the previous one, that is, it is not absolute, but sub-absolute; it is not existential, but existential, and it is not perfect, but perfectible through experience. In the UL, we know this reality as Absonite Reality, and it can be both Potential and Manifested, in contrast to the previous one, where all reality is completely manifested from the beginning.

And finally, the “I Am” will generate a further level of reality (there it is), which is also attenuated with respect to the previous one, that is, it is more sub-absolute than the previous one, which is neither existential nor existential, but created, and which is even less perfect than the previous one, but equally perfectible through experience. We know this last reality as Finite Reality, and it can also be both Potential and Manifested.

In short, we find ourselves with three levels of reality with different degrees of perfection, where the creatures of the two lower levels can climb, through experience and various transformations, until reaching the higher level.

Well, these are the realms and levels that The “I Am” conceived to convert its potential absolute reality into manifested absolute reality.

## THE SEVEN ABSOLUTES

And now yes; now let's see what I mentioned before, that is, how the Seven Absolutes appeared from the diversification of the I AM.

To do this, we return to the screen where we already saw the three areas of the absolute potential reality that was THE I AM vertically differentiated: the spiritual or personal area (in red), the mental or associative area (in fuchsia) and the material or impersonal area (in grey).

And in the spiritual or personal realm, it is in this realm that the “I Am” will carry out its first manifestation, its “first” original thought.

That “first” original, personal, deified, spiritual, and dynamic thought is The Eternal Son, who is Absolute or Primordial in that entire realm. And with this, that Reality

Absolute Potential, which was THE I AM, has begun to transform into Absolute Manifested Reality. But there is something more, and that is that this “first” original thought that gives rise to the Eternal Son automatically transforms the “I Am” into The Universal Father, who is the First Source and Center of all things, and therefore Absolute and Primordial in all spheres (personal, impersonal, or associative), manifested or potential.

Simultaneously with this first original thought, the Isle of Paradise is eternalized, which is Absolute or Primordial in the entire impersonal, non-deified, material and static realm.

And then, the Universal Father and the Eternal Son, the only two personalities who exist at that hypothetical moment, devise their universal plan of action and, between them, eternalize the Infinite Spirit or Conjoint Actor, who will associate and combine personal reality with impersonal reality. This Infinite Spirit is Absolute or Primordial in all associative or integrative spheres.

And from that moment on, these three personalizations of the “I Am” (the Universal Father, the Eternal Son, and the Infinite Spirit) can act as absolute and independent personalities, but also as an undivided Deity, which we know as the Paradise Trinity, which we will see later.

All of this is part of the manifested absolute reality. But is that all there is to the absolute level, or is there more?

What remains of that initial “I Am,” of that absolute potential of reality I referred to earlier, saying that it would operate only in the subabsolute or attenuated levels of reality? Well, it remains practically intact. Look:

Within the realm of all that is personal, deified, spiritual, and dynamic, there remains the Deity Absolute, that is, all the potentials available within that realm.

In the realm of all that is impersonal, non-deified, material and static, there remains the Unqualified Absolute, that is, all potentials equally available in that realm.

And in the associative, integrative, and activating realm, there remains the Universal Absolute, that is, all the potentials also available in that realm. Well, in this way, the picture of that entire first level of Absolute, Existential, Perfect, and completely Manifested Reality, that is, without any kind of attenuation, which we had seen previously, is completed.

And in this same picture, we find the total diversification of the “I Am” into <ins>7 Absolutes</ins>: The two Deified Absolutes, which are <ins>The Eternal Son</ins> and <ins>The Deity Absolute</ins>, the first manifested and the second potential; the two Associative Absolutes, which are <ins>The Infinite Spirit or Conjoint Actor</ins>, and the <ins>Universal Absolute</ins>, the first manifested and the second potential; the two Undeified Absolutes, which are <ins>The Isle of Paradise</ins> and the <ins>Unqualified Absolute</ins>, the first manifested and the second potential; and at the head of them all is the Universal Father, who is <ins>Absolute in all spheres, manifested or potential</ins>, and is therefore the Source and Center of all things and personalities, and, naturally, of the 6 Absolutes already mentioned.

## THE TRINITY OF PARADISE

To refer to the Paradise Trinity, as well as the Triunities and Triodities, we'll start from the same previous screen where we can see the Seven Absolutes represented. Here we have it again.

The Paradise Trinity is the inevitable consequence of the joint action of the three manifested absolute personalities

- The Universal Father
- The Eternal Son
- And The Infinite Spirit

but acting in such an infinitely coordinated manner that, in fact, it is impossible to distinguish the personalized action of any of them, that is, they do not constitute an association of three independent persons, but rather an <ins>INDIVISIBLE DEITY WITH A SINGLE WILL</ins>. Here it is.

The Paradise Trinity is primordial and absolute in all spheres and levels, manifested or potential, since within it is inseparably integrated the Universal Father, who, as we have previously stated, is the Source and Center of all things and personalities.

## THE TRIUNITIES

Triunities are associations or groupings, arising from the interaction of the Seven Absolutes, with a functional purpose, that is, with the objective of dealing with the various activities necessary in the Cosmos.

In all Triunities, the Universal Father is always present, exercising immediate and personal control over these activities.

All the components of the different triunities act in coordination but with their own will.

Sometimes, two of the three personalities of the Deity constitute a single entity with a single will. In such associations, four, not three, absolutes constitute the triunity.

The total number of triunities is fifteen, although eight of them are not revealed in the LU.

The seven that are revealed to us are these:

_<ins>The First Triunity</ins>_ — the personal and intentional triunity.

1. The Universal Father
2. The Eternal Son
3. The Infinite Spirit.

That is, the same three personalities that form the Paradise Trinity, but here associated as three persons with independent wills each, and to perform, as I have said, some specific function.

_<ins>The Second Trinity</ins>_ — the triunity of power and archetype.

1. The Father-Son
2. Paradise Island
3. The Joint Actor.

_<ins>The Third Trinity</ins>_ — the triunity that evolves the spirit.
1. The Universal Father
2. The Spirit-Son
3. The Absolute of Deity.

_<ins>The Fourth Trinity</ins>_ — the triunity of energetic infinity.

1. The Father-Spirit
2. Paradise Island
3. The Unqualified Absolute.

_<ins>The Fifth Trinity</ins>_ — the triunity of reactive infinity.

1. The Universal Father
2. The Universal Absolute
3. The Unqualified Absolute.

_<ins>The Sixth Trinity</ins>_ — the triunity of Deity in cosmic association.
1. The Universal Father
2. The Absolute of Deity
3. The Universal Absolute.

_<ins>The Seventh Trinity</ins>_ — the triunity of infinite unity.

1. The Universal Father
2. The Ensemble Actor
3. The Universal Absolute.

## THE TRIODIIES

Triodities are also triune associations of a functional nature, but which do not contain the Universal Father in their constitution.

They are involved in the cosmic appearance of the Experiential Deities - The Supreme, The Ultimate and The Absolute - and are directly concerned with or contribute to their growth.

The Triodities that the LU reveals to us are:

_<ins>The Triodity of the Manifested</ins>_, which is the association of the _three Manifested Absolutes_:

1. The Eternal Son
2. Paradise Island
3. The Ensemble Actor

This Triodity coordinates all manifested reality, in all its spheres and levels. Its state of manifestation is unqualified (not subject to any kind of requirements or limits).

_<ins>The Triodity of Potential</ins>_, is the association of the three Absolutes of potentiality:

1. The Absolute of Deity.
2. The Universal Absolute.
3. The Unqualified Absolute.

This Triodity contains the infinite reservoirs of all latent or potential reality, equally in all its realms and levels. Its potential, therefore, is infinite.

## THE POST-HAVONA TRINITIES

The Post-Havona Trinities are not absolute or infinite like the Paradise Trinity, but rather experiential, since they contain Deities created or existentialized by the Trinity, who are formed on the finite and absonite levels through experiential actualization. For this reason, they are not perfect or complete at present.

The Post-Havona Trinities are the inevitable consequence of the creation of the two subabsolute and evolutionary levels (the finite and the absonite) on which Personality and Power manifest in the Master Universe.

There are, therefore, two Post-Havona Trinities:

The 1st. Experiential Trinity, or also called the Ultimate Trinity, which will be composed of
- The Supreme Being
- The Supreme Creator Personalities
- The Absonite Architects of the Master Universe

The 2nd Experiential Trinity, or also called the Absolute Trinity, which will be formed by
- The Supreme Being
- Last God
- The Unrevealed Consummator of the Destiny of the Universe


## THE TRINITY OF TRINITIES

The UB tells us that the Trinity of Trinities can be described in various ways, and chooses to present it in three levels that reflect increasing unification.

<ins>On a first level</ins>, the Trinity of Trinities is the grouping, association or meeting of the three trinities we have already seen:

1. The Paradise Trinity,
2. The Ultimate Trinity,
3. and the Absolute Trinity,

acting in perfect synchrony, and making possible an unlimited integration of reality, since it contains and deals with beginnings, intermediate states and destinies.

On a second level, the Trinity of Trinities is the grouping, association, or inevitable reunion of the three highest experiential deities, who are genetically associated with the three aforementioned trinities. These experiential deities are:

1. The Supreme, which is derived from the Paradise Trinity
2. The Last, which is derived from the Ultimate Trinity
3. The Absolute, which is derived from the Absolute Trinity

<ins>And on a third level</ins>, the Trinity of Trinities would be the Trinitarian reunion of these experiential deities, likely leading to the functional reunion of those aspects of infinity that were originally segmented by the original I AM and brought about the manifestation of reality and the appearance of the seven absolutes. This would mean that for personal beings, the unknowable I AM could finally be accessible experientially.

## SEVENFOLD GOD

<ins>The Sevenfold God is the set of the 7 Personalizations of the Deity that, in the Grand Universe, facilitate the creature's progressive approach to the Father.</ins> And it is essential to thoroughly study and master this concept, because the Supreme Being (which is the object of our study today) is so closely united to the Sevenfold God, that he is part of him, in his aspect of the Supreme God.

Here we can see those 7 customizations. Pay attention to this screen, because it's very important, and we'll refer to it again in two or three minutes.

The first three are the Paradise Deities: The Universal Father, The Eternal Son, and The Infinite Spirit, and they can act, as we have seen, independently, but also as one Deity, as the Paradise Trinity.

The last three are the <ins>7 Master Spirits</ins>, whose focal headquarters are on the Paradise Periphery, each focused on a superuniverse, while their personal presences are on the seven satellites of the Infinite Spirit; the <ins>Ancients of Days</ins>, who are located on the headquarters of the 7 superuniverses, with 3 Elders to each headquarters; and the <ins>Paradise Creator Sons</ins>, who are responsible for the creation, organization, and development of the local universes. These last three personalizations of God the Sevenfold are known generically as the Supreme Creators and Rulers, or Supreme Creator Personalities.

In the middle of these six personalizations is the Supreme God, who is the Spiritual personality of the Supreme Being.

Here we have the same customizations, but grouped in the way I just told you.

The Paradise Trinity is <ins>existentially endowed</ins>, that is, by its very nature, with the <ins>Spirit Personality</ins>, and it is with that Spirit Personality that the Paradise Trinity begins the creation of the Supreme Being, with the name we have just seen, God the Supreme. But experience is not part of the existential endowment of the Trinity. Therefore, in the Sevenfold God there appear those three personalizations that we have met on the previous screen under the generic name of Supreme Creators and Rulers, who will be the ones who, descending to the worlds of the finite level of the Grand Universe and with the collaboration of other equally descending associates, with the collaboration of the Sevenfold Controllers, whom we will see presently, and even of the ascending mortals, will <ins>experientially acquire</ins> the Power or Sovereignty in the worlds of time and space, which the Supreme Being will make his own through the <ins>personality with power</ins> known as Supreme God Almighty, whom we will see presently.

## THE SEVENFOLD CONTROLLERS

<ins>The Sevenfold Controllers are the set of 7 Manifestations of the Deity that, in the Grand Universe, regulate and control physical energy.</ins> And it is also essential to study them in depth, because the Supreme Being, in his aspect of Supreme Almighty God, is also part of them.

434 Here we can see the names of those seven manifestations. As you can see, there is <ins>a great parallel</ins> between the Sevenfold God personalizations we saw three screens earlier and these Sevenfold Controllers. And in reality, these

Sevenfold Controllers are an inseparable part of the Sevenfold Deity; they are, so to speak, the material counterpart of the Sevenfold Deity.

Look: <ins>something very important and that</ins>, therefore, <ins>must always be kept in mind</ins>, and that is why I repeat it ad nauseam in this presentation, is that Reality, at any of its levels, always diversifies or bifurcates into two very distinct spheres: that of the spirit and that of matter; or the personal and the impersonal; but there also always arises, as a reaction between the two, a third sphere, of an integrative nature, which connects and unifies the previous ones.

Well, this bifurcation between spirit and energy was realized in the Grand Universe through the Sevenfold Deity when the <ins>Seven Master Spirits together undertook their first act of collective creation</ins>, which gave rise to the <ins>Seven Supreme Power Directors</ins>. And at that same instant, the <ins>spirit circuits of the Master Spirits</ins> became distinct from, by contrast, the <ins>material circuits</ins> utilized by the Power Directors for supervision, <ins>and cosmic mind</ins> immediately appeared as a new factor coordinating matter and spirit.

Look at this screen: on the left, at points 1, 2, and 3, we see the first three personalizations of the Sevenfold Deity: the Universal Father, the Eternal Son, and the Infinite Spirit. The Eternal Son is here because He is the spiritual absolute, the absolute of personality. At that same height, but to the right, between the Sevenfold Controllers, we see that, alongside the Universal Father and the Infinite Spirit, which remain, is the Isle of Paradise, which is the absolute of energy-matter.

Again to the left, at points 5, 6, and 7, we see that the three personalizations of the Sevenfold Deity in the Grand Universe are: The 7 Master Spirits, The Ancients of Days, and the Paradise Creator Sons, all related to spirit and personality, while on the right the three Sevenfold Controllers in the Grand Universe are: The 7 Supreme Power Directors, the Supreme Power Centers, and the Master Physical Controllers, all related to energy-matter.

And finally, while on the left, in the midst of the six personalizations of the Sevenfold Deity we see God the Supreme, who is the endowment of the spirit personality of the Trinity, on the right we can see that in the midst of the six Sevenfold Controllers, there stands the Supreme Almighty, who is the experiential acquisition of Power.

OK?

Well, let's not lose sight of the differences and similarities that exist between the Sevenfold God and the Sevenfold Controllers, because both are key issues in understanding the Supreme Being.

## VARIOUS CONCEPTS OF “POWER”

The word “POWER” is used in the LU with three different meanings.

On the one hand, the word **<ins>power</ins>** — **<ins>or power of the universe</ins>** — refers to the electronic level of <ins>energy-matter</ins>. And more specifically, to those forms of energy that are sensitive to linear gravity, in contrast to those other energies that are sensitive only to Paradise gravity — which are called “emergent energies” — or even to energies that do not even respond to Paradise gravity — called “cosmic force”-.

And on the other hand, by the word **<ins>“power”</ins>** — **<ins>or sovereign power</ins>** —, — **<ins>or even experiential power</ins>** — (all of these are the same), reference is made to <ins>sovereignty</ins>, that is, to power attained, won, or acquired by personality through experience. The energy-matter I before mentioned seems to evolve in the depths of space, and there it is organized by the Sevenfold Controllers in collaboration with the Creator Sons. And the dominion of this <ins>energy-matter (or Power)</ins> by the Creator divinities slowly extends throughout the grand universe until it encompasses the establishment and evolutionary stabilization of the time-space creations, and thus will come the flowering of the <ins>experiential power (or sovereignty)</ins> of the Sevenfold God.

The LU also refers to the **<ins>existential power</ins>**, which is that unfathomable and eternal power that the Deities of Paradise have by their very nature, without needing to earn or acquire it in any way.

So, three different concepts or ideas of the word “Power,” and it would be good to be clear about what concept we are talking about when this word is used, a matter that is not always clear.

## PARADISE

Paradise, or the Isle of Paradise, is the most gigantic cosmic body in the entire Master Universe. It occupies the center of all creation and is the residence of the Universal Father, the Eternal Son, the Infinite Spirit, and their divine co-ordinates and associates. Paradise has existed since eternity; it is unaffected by time and is not located in space. This immense island is shaped like an oval biscuit and is the only stationary or immobile object in the entire universe of universes.

Here we see it from above, where we can appreciate its slightly oval shape. It is surrounded by the so-called still zone, which I have drawn in gray. Beyond it extend three concentric circuits, the first of which contains the 7 Sacred Spheres of the Father; the second contains the 7 Sacred Spheres of the Son; and the third contains the 7 Sacred Spheres of the Infinite Spirit.

Many more things could be said about Paradise, but they are not necessary for the purpose of understanding the Supreme Being.

## THE CENTRAL UNIVERSE OF HAVONA

To approach the Central Universe of Havona, I'll start from the previous image, which depicted Paradise and the three concentric circuits surrounding it with their 21 Sacred Spheres. Here it is, now reduced in size so it can be incorporated into the Central Universe of Havona. This is a Universe without beginning or end and of perfect creatures, formed by 7 concentric circuits, in which are found a total of one billion perfectly stabilized worlds of unimaginable beauty and splendid grandeur.

On the pilot world of the seventh circuit is the Spirit Personality of the Supreme Being, who is known as the Supreme Godhead.

## THE GREAT UNIVERSE

Just like I did before, to get closer to the Grand Universe, I'm going to start from the previous image, which also includes the Havona Universe we just saw. Here it is. And, in addition, I'm going to add a series of zones or belts that surround the Universe.

Central, balancing the forces of gravity and shielding it from view from the Superuniverses. There they are.

Well, beyond these five zones are the seven superuniverses of finite creation, each of which consists of one hundred thousand local universes and one trillion habitable worlds similar to our own. This finite creation is the domain of the Supreme Being, and together with the Central Universe, Paradise, and its twenty-one satellites, is called the Grand Universe.

## THE MASTER UNIVERSE

And finally, starting from the image of the Grand Universe and considerably reducing its size, we can represent the four gigantic circuits or levels of outer space, where, apparently, incredible movements of forces and energies are taking place in the process of materialization, perhaps with a view to the development of absonite reality. This entire set of organized and unorganized universes is called the Master Universe, whose immensity completely surpasses the scope of our imagination.

## THE SUPREME BEING

QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SUPREME BEING

In order to try to understand the Supreme Being as best as possible, I have started from a series of questions that, if we manage to answer, will surely give us a fairly accurate idea of that reality that in the LU is known as THE SUPREME BEING.

As you can see, I have prepared seven questions, but I have finally added one more, which will refer not to the Supreme Being, but to us in relation to Him. They are these:

1. Why does the Supreme Being exist? What is its cause? Its reason for being.
2. What is the Supreme Being like? What are HIS most notable characteristics?
3. What is the Supreme Being? What is HIS NATURE?
4. Where does it come from, how did it emerge, and when? What is ITS ORIGIN?
5. Why does the Supreme Being exist? What is HIS PURPOSE?
6. What does the Supreme Being do? What are HIS FUNCTIONS?
7. Who do you do them with? What are your relationships?
8. And finally, and very importantly for us, what role do we human beings play in the evolution of the Supreme Being?

Well, I'm now moving on to the first of these questions.

### 1. Why does the Supreme Being exist? What is its cause? ITS REASON FOR BEING

From what can be deduced from even a cursory reading of the texts that refer to the Supreme Being, he is something like the God of time and space, the God of all finite existence, the God of the Seven Superuniverses. Therefore, the cause of his existence must be sought before the existence of the physical universes, that is, we must go back to the Central Universe of Havona or even to Paradise itself, and thus to the Universal Father. (6\#)

Let's go one step further and go back to the beginning of everything, to the I AM itself before manifesting itself, that is, in a hypothetical zero era.

To do this, we should imagine a hypothetical initial moment that never actually existed, in order to establish a sequence that also didn't occur as we imagined it, but which, because it is consistent with our way of understanding events in time, would make the beginning and existence of reality more intelligible to us. Thus, let us imagine that THE I AM, before manifesting itself, would be the only existing reality, total and absolute infinity, with all potentialities at its disposal and with no other condition than its own will.

And that when the I AM desired to manifest, He diversified His own reality into three realms, (4\#) each of which contained absolute potentiality for manifestation, and the I AM began that manifestation by originating and delegating absolute responsibility on the personal or spiritual realm to the Eternal Son, the I AM thus becoming the Universal Father. In like manner, the Universal Father originated the Isle of Paradise, making it the absolute archetype of the entire Impersonal or material realm, and finally, between the Universal Father and the Eternal Son, they originated the Infinite Spirit or Conjoint Actor, who from that time forward was to have absolute responsibility for the entire associative or mind realm and the function of correlating the spiritual with the material. And at the same time, the Central Universe of Havona also came into being.

With this, an important step had been taken: there were now <ins>four manifested absolutes</ins>: The Universal Father, The Eternal Son, The Infinite Spirit, and the Isle of Paradise. The Central Universe was not absolute in any area.

However, within the Universal Father there still existed an absolute potential, that is, the capacity to give birth to any manifestation in any of the three realms into which The I AM had diversified. And this absolute capacity or potential is known as the Deity Absolute in the personal or spiritual realm; as the Unqualified Absolute in the impersonal or material realm; and as the Universal Absolute in the associative or mental realm. Thus, we can now consider the existence of seven absolutes.

But note that <ins>these seven Absolutes belong to the Original or Absolute Reality, to the Infinite</ins>, Existential, and Perfect level, to the level of the I Am or the Universal Father; and they belong to that level because, at the time, no other existed. And the Universal Father, who had already freed himself from the shackles of absolute infinity, manifesting in the seven Absolutes I have already indicated, decides to free himself also from the shackles or limitations that this absolute level entails (for example, not being able to experience growth, not being able to experience learning, not being able to know everything from the beginning, etc.).

And what does the Universal Father do after making that decision? Well, what he does is create an attenuated reality—or rather, two—that are neither infinite nor absolute nor existential, but rather sub-absolute, relative, and evolutionary or perfectible, where those obstacles or limitations of the absolute level do not exist, where one can experience, learn, and grow. These two attenuated realities are the absonite and the finite, but for now we'll focus only on the latter, the finite.

And at the head of this finite reality, he will place a Deity, who will be nothing more and nothing less than the very representation of the I AM or UNIVERSAL FATHER for all of this reality, but who will be of an evolutionary nature.

That Deity will be the SUPREME BEING, whose primacy in finite reality will ultimately be comparable to the primacy that the Universal Father has in absolute reality, that is, it will extend to the three spheres of finite reality (spiritual, mental and material).

Well, this triple decision of the Universal Father, of:

- free oneself from the constraints of the absolute level,
- to create two attenuated realities
- and to place an evolving Deity at the head of finite reality,

It is, apparently, the logical and immediate cause or reason for the existence of the Supreme Being. But there are probably other causes. Perhaps the cause is the Father's will to impose on himself, in his personalization as the Supreme Being, or God for time and space, the same experiential demands that he imposes on his finite creatures to achieve perfection, just as he indeed demands that his Creator Sons live creature lives to achieve Sovereignty of their Local Universes. Or perhaps the cause is much simpler and more altruistic, like the Father's infinite will to share his infinite love with an infinite number of creatures.


### 2. What is THE SUPREME BEING like? What are HIS most notable characteristics?

<ins>The Supreme Being</ins>, being, as He is, the representation of the Father in the universes of time and space, is also, like Himself, <ins>goodness, truth and beauty</ins>, which are the highest qualities that human beings can conceive for divinity, in their respective spheres of manifestation.

He is also a unifier, like all Deities. Thanks to his Supreme Mind, he unifies the creature with the Creator, that is, the finite with the infinite. And he also unifies personality with power, that is, spirit with energy-matter.

<ins>The Supreme Being is experiential</ins>; that is, He experiences for Himself, in contrast <ins>to the Paradise Deities, who are existential, who do not experience</ins>.

<ins>And it is also, at the same time, manifested and potential, like the finite reality in which it unfolds; characteristics that are deduced from the very fact of being experiential and therefore incomplete. The Paradise Deities, on the other hand, are perfect and, therefore, fully manifested.

<ins>The Supreme Being is both creature and creator</ins>, and the possibility of being both is received from the Paradise Sons Michael and Avonal, whose lives of bestowal are completely integrated into the experience of the Supreme Being.

The Supreme Being is ultimately the <ins>Supercontroller of all energy-matter related phenomena</ins> throughout the space-time of the Grand Universe.

### 3. What is THE SUPREME BEING? What is HIS NATURE?

I have said before that the Supreme Being

- He is <ins>the God of time and space</ins>, the God of the Superuniverses and, therefore, of all finite reality.
- That it is not existential, but experiential, a Deity of evolutionary growth through experience. Because it is experiential, it necessarily has the capacity for experience and growth, but to acquire these, it must submit to the limitations of time.
- And therefore, <ins>His nature, although Deity, is not absolute, like that of the Paradise Deities, but incomplete</ins>, being currently in the process of completion, in the process of actualization or evolution. Therefore, I have also said that the Supreme Being is both manifested and potential.

Well, now I also say that finite reality, which is born, as we know, by the will of the I Am or Universal Father, consists of two phases:

- <ins>The primary phase is of spiritual origin</ins> and of a perfect nature, like the Paradise personalities. The spirit (represented by the red arrow) leaves Paradise and through Havona reaches the superuniverses.
- <ins>The secondary phase is of material origin, evolutionary in nature, and is conditioned by time.</ins> <ins>Energy-matter</ins> (represented by the circular gray line) evolves in the depths of space within the Grand Universe, and there it is organized by the Master Physical Controllers, the Power Centers, and the Supreme Power Directors—that is, by the so-called Sevenfold Controllers in collaboration with the Creator Sons. This secondary phase only becomes correlated and integrated with the primary phase as a result of growth and achievement through the ministry of the Sevenfold God in the superuniverses. And from there, this energy-matter (represented by the fuchsia date), increasingly spiritualized by mind and personality action, ascends through Havona to Paradise. These two phases of finite reality have a direct bearing on the personalization, origin, and growth of the Supreme Being, as we shall presently see.

<ins>The Supreme Being</ins> is endowed with <ins>spiritual personality</ins>, <ins>who is the Supreme God</ins>, and with the capacity to acquire a powered personality through experience. But he is also endowed with a <ins>Supreme Mind</ins>, which is given to him by the Infinite Spirit and which functions to unite or synthesize the attributes of power and personality, thereby bringing into existence the <ins>power personality</ins>, <ins>who is the Supreme God Almighty</ins>.

Therefore, it is in the nature of the Supreme Being to grow or evolve through two personalities (Supreme God and Supreme Almighty God), but neither of them, by itself, is the Supreme Being.

The Supreme Being is and will be the synthesis of these two personalizations, which is produced thanks to the action of the Supreme Mind, which unifies them.

Therefore, the Supreme Being is and will be the sum total of all finite growth. In Him, eternal energy, divine spirit, and universal mind are unified, just as they were unified in the I AM Himself before He began His manifestation.

The Supreme Being thus becomes the ultimate revelation of Deity to the seven superuniverses and is the only path for man to approach the transcendental experience of association with the absonite mind, the eternal spirit, and the Paradise personality.

### 4. Where does THE SUPREME BEING come from, how does it emerge, and when? What is ITS ORIGIN?

The Supreme Being, as I have already said, evolves through two personalizations.

<ins>His spirit personality is derived</ins> from and directly bestowed by the Paradise Trinity. He is known as <ins>God the Supreme</ins> and, prior to the creation of the evolutionary universes, he resided and functioned on the spirit levels of Havona.

Supreme Godhead is the Spiritual Personality of the Supreme Being.

<ins>His empowered personality came into existence on the finite level</ins> by the synthesis of Experiential Power (or Sovereignty) and Universal Power achieved by the Supreme Creators and Rulers in collaboration with their associates (the Sevenfold Controllers) and with all finite creatures in the evolving universes. This empowered personality, known as <ins>Almighty God the Supreme</ins>, came into being after the creation of the superuniverses, the incorporation therein of the Sevenfold Deity creators and controllers, and the beginning of the first synthesis of their experiences; and it will thus continue to derive its increasing power until the completion of all finite experience with the final establishment of light and life throughout the Grand Universe.

Supreme God Almighty is the Empowered Personality of the Supreme Being.

To the growth of this personalization of God the Supreme Almighty, two movements contribute equally, proceeding from the two phases of finite reality, which I have already mentioned before and which, therefore, I will represent in the same way:

- The divergent movement of the Supreme Creator Personalities and all their divine associates descending from Paradise and Havona to the superuniverses, gaining experience and mastery over the evolutionary creations,
- and the <ins>convergent movement</ins> of the <ins>ascending mortals</ins> who are directed to Paradise to know and resemble the Universal Father, leaving behind their initial materiality and attaining, first, morontia and then the full spiritual life.

But, returning to the two personalizations I mentioned earlier, neither of them, as I said, constitutes, by itself, the Supreme Being.

That is to say, the Supreme Being is the <ins>synthesis or fusion</ins> of the <ins>Spiritual Personality</ins> bestowed by the Paradise Trinity, and the <ins>Power Personality</ins> acquired by the Supreme Creators and Rulers over the evolutionary creations.

This is the same as saying that it is the <ins>synthesis or fusion</ins> of <ins>Supreme God with Supreme Almighty God</ins>, thanks to the unifying action of the <ins>Supreme Mind</ins>.

This final synthesis or fusion of both personalizations will occur on the pilot world of the outer circuit of Havona when the development of the Grand Universe has reached its complete completion and will result in the culmination of the Supreme Being, that is, the complete Supreme Being, in contrast to the incomplete Supreme Being who existed at the beginning of the finite creations, when the experience was still pending.

Until that final fusion arrives, the Supreme Being will not be a complete reality, but will be completed or actualized in continuous and successive intermediate syntheses.

### 5. Why does the Supreme Being exist? What is HIS PURPOSE?

The purpose of the Supreme Being is not limited, as we shall soon see, to the Grand Universe and finite existences.

Your first goal is to complete your own reality. This completion would mean, in fact, that you have also achieved:

1. Identify the creature with the creator,
2. <ins>Uniting the finite with the infinite</ins> — <ins>the perpetual and indissoluble union of power (experiential and universal) with the spiritual personality</ins>
3. To incorporate into the Universal Father and the Paradise Deities the totality of the acquired finite experience that was not previously had,
4. And finally, achieve <ins>total and absolute Sovereignty over the Grand Universe</ins>.

<ins>The second objective of the Supreme Being</ins> is, in reality, the consequence of having achieved Sovereignty, because that will make him worthy of participating <ins>in the First Experiential Trinity</ins> [possible link to remember] or also called the Ultimate Trinity, which will be his immediate subsequent destiny, together with the Supreme Creator Personalities and the Absonite Architects of the Master Universe.

<ins>Your third goal</ins> will be to <ins>reach the absonite levels</ins> where the super creature state is achieved, $\mathbf{9 0 . 7 /}$ and <ins>contribute to the <em>inevitable</em> appearance of the Ultimate God</ins>,

<ins>The fourth objective of the Supreme Being</ins> will be to participate <ins>in the Second Experiential Trinity</ins> [possible link to remember] or also called the Absolute Trinity, where he will be in the company of God the Ultimate and the Unrevealed Consummator of the Destiny of the Universe.

 Finally, there could be <ins>a fifth objective of the Supreme Being</ins>, his <ins>participation in the perhaps possible Trinity of Trinities</ins>, but that is already a lot to venture even for the most expert philosophers of the universe.

### 6. What does the Supreme Being do and where does he do it? What are his functions?

**The Supreme Being**
- It exercises its <ins>primary functions</ins> in the Central Universe of Havona (the primary functions are linked with the primary or spiritual phase of finite reality, or also, with the Spirit Personality of the Supreme Being, who is God the Supreme).
- Its <ins>secondary functions</ins> are exercised in the Grand Universe (these functions are linked with the secondary or material phase of finite reality, or also with the Empowered Personality of the Supreme Being, who is Supreme Almighty God.
- The <ins>tertiary function</ins> will be exercised in the Master Universe, but for the moment it is latent, and only exists as an unknown potential.

That said, I am going to refer exclusively to the <ins>secondary functions of the Supreme Being</ins>, which are those that <ins>as the Supreme Almighty in the Grand Universe</ins> performs, which is where we live and for which reason we are, at least for the moment, more linked or involved in them.

And at this level, Supreme Almighty God

- It connects and unifies the creature with the Creator. The finite level of the Grand Universe is the first level of God's identification with creatures, through the experiential personalizations of the Sevenfold God (who are the Creators and Supreme Rulers).
- It coordinates and synthesizes all the universal activities of the creature and of these same Creators and Supreme Rulers.
- Acts as a super-controller of space-time physical power in the Grand Universe
- Unifies the Sevenfold Deity in its bifurcation of the space-time Sevenfold Controllers [possible link to remember].
- And he is personally experiencing and achieving the oneness of the Deity as the evolving and experiential God of the evolving creatures of time and space.


## 7. With whom does the Supreme Being perform his functions? What are his relationships?

The Supreme Being permeates and incorporates into His existence everything that happens in finite reality, and therefore establishes relationships not only with each and every creature belonging to that finite reality, but also with all those personalities or entities that perform some work in the Grand Universe but originate from Paradise or absonite reality. The number of these relationships, therefore, is truly countless.

But in an attempt to briefly explain these relationships, I've grouped them into the following six sections, with the intention of pointing out some of their details or characteristics. Well, the Supreme Being establishes relationships:

1. With the Paradise Trinity
2. With the Deities of Paradise
3. With the Triodities
4. With the Creators and Supreme Rulers of the Sevenfold God
5. With the Supreme Controllers of Power, of the Sevenfold Deity
6. And with the innumerable orders of creatures descended from the Infinite Spirit and the Creator Sons, among whom we find ourselves mortal creatures

**1. Let's look at his relationship with the Paradise Trinity**

The Supreme Being, <ins>as far as His Spirit Personality is concerned</ins> (Supreme Godhead) is derived from and directly dependent upon the Paradise Trinity.

And as regards his Experiential or Sovereign Power Personality (Supreme Almighty God), the Paradise Trinity, which is incomprehensible to the evolving creatures of time and space, gave way to the more nearly relatable and therefore more comprehensible experiential personalizations of God the Sevenfold, the Creator Sons and the Supreme Rulers, who, in contact with the potentials promoted by the Potential Triodity, provide growth for the Supreme Being.

**2. Now let's look at their relationships with the Paradise Deities**

These Deities act in many ways throughout the grand universe, through their various agents. Let's look at the most common ones:

1. ***The Universal Father*** acts through the <ins>Adjusters</ins>, who orient, attract, and unify creatures with Him. <ins>These Adjusters are to human beings what the Paradise Trinity is to the Supreme Being.</ins>
2. ***The Eternal Son*** acts through the revelations of his Paradise Sons, who **unify** or **fuse**:
	- the divine nature of the Creator
	- with the evolutionary nature of the creature.
	- The creature bestowals of these Paradise Sons (i.e., the Michaels and the Avonals) enable these divine Sons to enrich their personalities by acquiring the true nature of the creatures of the universe, and at the same time these Sons infallibly reveal to the same creatures the Paradise path to divinity.
3. ***The Infinite Spirit or Conjoint Actor*** acts through its mental circuits (the supreme mind, the cosmic mind, etc.), **unifying** the spirit of divinity with the archetype of energy. The finite domains of energy and spirit **are held together** by the following mental circuits:
	- <ins>That of the Creative Spirit</ins>, in each local universe
	- <ins>That of the Reflective Spirits</ins>, in each superuniverse
	- <ins>That of the Master Spirits</ins>, in the Great Universe.
	- <ins>And the Supreme Mind, which</ins> **<ins>unifies</ins>**
	- the Spiritual Personality of Godhead the Supreme
	- with the experientially empowered Personality of Almighty Godhead the Supreme.

That is to say, the mind is always the vital link that **connects** matter and spirit.

And in all these relationships that occur in finite universes, the Conjoint Actor is the ever-present source of the mental ministry that makes these activities possible.

**3. We now turn to Relations with the Triodities**

<ins>The Triodity of the Manifested</ins> acts directly upon finite creation, and therefore upon the Supreme Being, in the following manner:

- <ins>the gravity of Paradise</ins> holds the basic units of material existence,
- <ins>the spiritual gravity of the Eternal Son</ins> acts directly on the fundamental values of spiritual existence,
- <ins>and the mental gravity of the Conjoint Actor</ins> unerringly grasps all the vital meanings of intellectual existence.

But the Supreme Being is also related to the Triodity of Potential, since finite reality is precisely one of the exclusive fields of action of the Deity, Unqualified, and Universal Absolutes, which offer inexhaustible potential for growth. (The other exclusive field of action of these Absolutes is that of absonite reality.)

**4. We will now examine the relationships of the Supreme Being to the experiential personalizations of the Sevenfold Deity and their associates.**

The final culmination of the <ins>Supreme Being</ins> depends on the progressive unification of <ins>the different factors that intervene in its development in the Grand Universe</ins>, which are:

1. The creators
2. Intelligences
3. The energies of the universes
4. The creatures

More specifically, the following intervene in the development of the Supreme Being and, therefore, are related to it:

The 7 Master Spirits, who fully represent the Infinite Spirit in the Grand Universe, in all matters pertaining to energy, mind, and spirit. They are also the origins and those responsible for the ministry of the Cosmic Mind in the Grand Universe.

<ins>The 49 Reflective Spirits</ins> of the 7 Superuniverses, who deal with the phenomenon of Reflectivity.

<ins>Majesty</ins>, who is the head of Reflectivity and who focuses the cosmic presence of the Supreme Mind.

<ins>The Ancients of Days</ins>, who serve as focal points for the evolution of Trinitarian sovereignty in time and space, and who from their place see, know, and coordinate the two movements of the growth of the Supreme Being.

<ins>The Creative Spirits</ins>, who are the direct representation of the Infinite Spirit in the local universes, and who, in association with the Creator Sons, undertake the adventure of creating, organizing, and directing a local universe, approaching in perfection the limits of Supremacy.

<ins>The Creator Sons or Michaels</ins>, who in their bestowals upon the various orders of their creation, acquire the nature and cosmic viewpoint of their local universe children, to whom they reveal, in their own bestowal lives, the personality of the Universal Father.

<ins>And finally, the Magistral or Avonal Sons</ins>, who, in their various missions (judicial, magisterial and donor), acquire a nature that expresses the
divinity of paradise in union with the highest spiritual values of human material nature.

**5. Relationships with the Power Controllers of the Sevenfold Deity**

The Supreme Being, in his secondary role as Supreme Almighty God, <ins>evolves as the supercontroller of the physical power</ins> of the grand universe. This physical power potential is centered in the Sevenfold Controllers:

- <ins>The Seven Supreme Directors of Power</ins>, who are those who organize, control and regulate the physical energies of the Grand Universe.
- <ins>The Centers of Power</ins>, which are the fixed locations through which the Supreme Directors of Power operate.
- <ins>And the Master Physical Controllers</ins>, who are the mobile presences, through which the Supreme Directors of Power also function.


**6. His relations with mortal creatures**

And finally, concerning the relations of the Supreme Being to the innumerable orders of creatures descending from the Infinite Spirit and the Creator Sons, among whom we mortal creatures are included, I will refer exclusively to the relation of the Supreme Being to human beings, to us, but I will do so from our position, from our perspective, thus answering the last question posed.

### 8. WHAT ROLE DO WE PLAY IN ALL THIS FINITE EVOLUTION?

We, as mortal creatures, play an essential and irreplaceable role in the finite evolution of the Supreme Being, for several reasons:

Because in our desire to find the Father, to do His will and to become like Him, we ascend to Paradise, bringing to the Supreme Almighty a cosmic experience of an ascending character, which is indispensable to Him, because it is complementary to that brought to Him by the personalities who descend from Paradise to the Grand Universe.

I stated earlier that the evolutionary growth of the Supreme Almighty is equally contributed to by the divergent movement of Paradise personalities descending into the Grand Universe and the convergent movement of evolving mortal creatures ascending to Paradise.

And if both movements contribute equally, then human beings, as the evolutionary creatures that we are, have a direct, personal, and irreplaceable responsibility for the ultimate realization of the Supreme Being. No one can do for us what we ourselves do not do.

No human being can, by passivity or rejection of God or the eternal career, prevent the Supreme Being from finally culminating His sovereignty and achieving the synthesis of spiritual personality with experiential power, but such passivity or rejection will impede the human being's own personal evolution and will inevitably <ins>delay the final culmination of the Supreme Being</ins>, a delay that will affect the entire finite universe.

Therefore, human beings, conscious of the role we play in our own personal evolution and in all finite evolution, must develop a cosmic morality, a sensitivity of our duty to the entire Universe and to the Supreme Being, thanks to whose living potential of energy, mind, and spirit, we are here.

And, consequently, we must make our personal effort to understand the reality the Father has created for us, and to actively participate in it by loving and serving our fellow men. That personal experience of understanding, love, and service, which the morontia soul will provide us, which will lead to fusion with our Adjuster and the survival of our personality, is what each of us can and must offer to the Supreme Being.

Thank you very much for your patience
