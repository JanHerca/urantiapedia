**7 CULTURAL WORLDS OF TRANSITION**

(Jerusem satellites. 10 times larger than Urantia. _Pink spheres in the image._)

- Finaliters World
- Morontia World
- Angeles World
- Superangels World
- Sons World
- Spirit World
- Father World

**7 MANSION (OR MANSION) WORLDS**

(Satellites of the M. Finalitarios. Same size as Urantia. _Green spheres in the image._)

- Mansonia Number One
- Mansonia Number Two
- Mansonia Number Three
- Mansonia Number Four
- Mansonia Number Five
- Mansonia Number Six
- Mansonia Number Seven

### Concept

The first morontia worlds to which the surviving mortals are transferred, after physical death, to continue our journey towards Paradise. Physical death is a technique to escape from material life in the flesh.

### Mansion World Leaders

- the Melchizedeks and the Morontia Supervisors
- A governor in each world, answerable to Jerusem


### Personalities

- The Conciliators of Uversa, who maintain a headquarters on each world
- The Technical Advisors, who meet in a place next to that headquarters
- The directors of the reversal and the celestial craftsmen, who maintain a collective headquarters in each of these worlds
- The Morontia Companions
- The Educators of the mansion worlds - The Spirongas, who are present from world number two onwards
- The spornagia that are present in all worlds
- Spirit Fused Survivors
- Adjuster-Fused Ascending Mortals

### Life on these worlds (in general)

- Our memory remains intact
- We will be aware of all valuable experiences
- Eat, drink and rest
- To advance from one world to the next, we sleep for seraphic transport and wake up with a new morontia body. The Adjuster does not abandon us and the personality remains intact.
- In each of the worlds we pass through, we are allowed to visit the transition world that corresponds to the same number, as well as the sector related to them on Jerusem
- We will have ample opportunities to compensate for the deficiencies suffered in aspects
	- social
	- intellectuals
	- emotional
	- spiritual
	- and, especially, in the aspect of **paternity**


## 1. The World of Finaliters

### Concept

Headquarters world of the finalitary corps stationed in Satania.

## 22. Personalities

- One hundred million finaliters,
- It can also house
	- all kinds of spiritual beings
	- transition mortals
	- student visitors
- Spornagia are hospitable hosts to all visitors they can recognize


### Life in this world

- Her beauty is extraordinary
- His spiritual abode, the Temple of the Finaliters, is not perceptible to the material sight nor to the initial morontia sight without the help of the Energy Transformers.
- We won't see the finaliters either until we reach spiritual vision.
- The most important activity is related to the Probationary Nursery


## 2. The Probationary Nursery

### Concept

It is the School in which those children who have died in the evolutionary worlds of space before having decided on the divine project of survival are received, reassembled and instructed.

### “Geographic” situation

It is situated in the finalitary world.

### Responsible

- It is supervised by a thousand pairs of Material Sons and Daughters
- Maintained by the Educators of the Mansion Worlds

### Life in Probationary Nursery

- Children are repersonalized in the exact state at the time of their death, except for their reproductive potential
- They have all kinds of opportunities to choose the heavenly path
- The Adjusters reach the children as in the worlds of time
- Children are visited and, in some cases, cared for by their parents
- When they make their final choice they are moved to the first mansion world
- These children, without the evolutionary experience of the worlds, can achieve the permanent citizenship of Paradise, but they do not become finaliters.

## 3. The first Mansion World

### Personalities

- The Morontia Companions, who are the personal guides assigned to us and who have their Temple in the center of the seven main circles of the administration of this world. Among others are:
	- Those who are assigned as groupmates
	- Interpreters and Translators
	- Building Guardians
	- Excursion Supervisors
- The spornagia

### The Temple of New Life WHERE DO WE ARRIVE?

- It is the huge temple where personalities are assembled
- In it they gather, to raise the dead:
	- the seraphic guardians of fate
	- the Thought Adjusters
	- the archangels of the resurrection
	- the Life Carriers
- We resume life exactly where we left it at death.
- When we wake up we are transferred to the Melchizedek sector, where we are assigned a permanent residence and we are granted 10 days of personal freedom.


### Life in this world

- We can explore the surroundings
- Consult records of people and visit loved ones
- Know the program that awaits us
- Renew our intellectual education and our spiritual development through the Schools of Thought, Feeling and Action.
- Comply with the requirements demanded by the Urantia Parental Commission
- Parents who have children in the Probationary Nursery receive all kinds of opportunities to collaborate with the morontia guardians of said children in relation to their instruction and formation.
- We will be able to correct the biological deficiencies, those of our experience and the defects of our character
- We will work to master the meaning of the morontia mota
- Before passing to the next world, we must reach, at least, the level of the post-Adamic dispensation of the normal evolutionary worlds.

## 4. The second World of mansions

In this world, the sea of glass makes its appearance

### Life in this world

- In this sphere we settle more fully.
- The groupings of morontia life begin to take shape.
- Work groups and social organizations begin to function.
- Communities reach their normal proportions. (?)
- We will create new social orders
- We will eliminate intellectual conflicts and mental disharmony
- We will increase the effort to master the meaning of the morontia mota
- We will complete the experience of life in the flesh
- Before passing to the next world, we will reach, at least, the intellectual level of the culture after the Magisterial Son in the ideal evolutionary worlds.

## 5. The Third World of Mansions

It is the seat of the Educators of the mansion worlds, though they are active on the seven mansion spheres, and on the higher morontia worlds.

### Life in this world

- We will begin a more positive educational work with the purpose of increasing the understanding of the correlation between the morontia mota and the logic of mortals, the coordination of the morontia mota with human philosophy.
- We will understand well the true metaphysics, the cosmic meanings and the universal interrelationships.
- We really started the progressive morontia culture
- We will achieve great personal and social achievements
- Before moving on to the next world, we will at least reach the level of the time after the donation of a Son on a normal inhabited planet.

## 6. The fourth World of Mansions

### Life in this world

- We experience great approach to the various orders of Children of God during the visits to Jerusem.
- We will discover our place in group work and in the class activities of morontia life.
- We will feel greater appreciation for the transmissions and for other phases of the culture and progress of the local universe.
- Initiation into the demands and charms of the true social life of morontia creatures.
- We will participate in social activities that are not based on personal aggrandizement or selfish conquest. — We are introduced to a new social order based on the sympathetic sympathy of mutual appreciation, the selfless love of serving each other, and the overriding motivation of carrying out a common and supreme destiny — the paradise goal of worshipful and divine perfection.
- We will achieve mastery of the language of the local universe
- We become conscious of knowing God, of revealing God, of seeking God and of finding God.
- The intellectual and social culture of this fourth mansion world can be compared with the mental and social life of the post-Teacher Son age on planets of normal evolution. The spiritual level is much more advanced than that of that mortal dispensation.

## 7. The fifth Mansion World

### Life in this world

- Huge step forward in the life of a morontia progressor.
- True anticipation of life on Jerusem.
- We begin to understand the high destiny of loyal evolutionary worlds
- We perfected the language of Uversa
- We become familiar with the various groups of divine affiliation.
- We begin to learn things about the constellation study worlds.
- There is a true birth of a cosmic consciousness, a universal mentality, an expansion of horizons.
- We begin to glimpse that a prodigious destiny awaits us and to manifest a true enthusiasm for the ascension to Havona.
- Study becomes voluntary, selfless service natural, and adoration spontaneous.
- The culture of this mansion world corresponds in general to that of the initial era of light and life on the planets whose evolutionary progress is normal.

## 8. The Sixth Mansion World

### Life in this world

- The assistant System Sovereign frequently visits this world
- We learn more about the high spirits of the superuniverse
- We will also receive our first lessons related to the future spiritual career
- We will begin the instruction in the administration of the universe
- The perfect fusion between our human mind and the divine Adjuster takes place, the union of the evolutionary immortal soul with the eternal and divine Adjuster, we are given a new name and we are granted forty days of spiritual retirement from all routine activities so that Let's commune with ourselves, choose one of the optional routes to go to Havona, and choose among the existing differential techniques to reach Paradise.
- The organization of society in this mansonia is of a high order.
- The shadow of the mortal nature diminishes more and more
- During the stay in this world, we will reach a state comparable to the high development that characterizes those evolutionary worlds that have progressed normally beyond the initial stage of light and life.

## 9. The seventh World of mansions

### Life in this world

- We will receive the teaching of many educators, and all will cooperate in the task of preparing us to reside on Jerusem.
- We will be purified of all the remains of an unfortunate heredity, of an unhealthy environment and of non-spiritual planetary tendencies.
- We will find the temple of the Father, but we will not see the Father.
- Here we begin a new, more spiritual adoration of the invisible Father,
- Now we begin the formation of classes to reside in Jerusem. We have gone from world to world as individuals, but now we prepare to leave as a group for Jerusem, although within certain limits, we may choose to remain on the seventh mansion world in order to await the arrival of a straggling member of your group. of terrestrial or Mansonian work.
- There will be meetings in the sea of glass to witness our departure to Jerusem with the category of residents.

## 10. Citizenship of Jerusem

- Welcome committee on Jerusem for our reception.
- We will be able to carry the “harp of God”, a morontia device that compensates for the inability to directly adapt the immature morontia sensory mechanism to the reception of space communications.
- No more literal resurrections are experienced.
- The morontia form granted to us upon leaving the mansion world race will be with us to the end of our local universe experience.
- There will be changes, but we will keep this same form until we are transported to the spiritual formation worlds of the superuniverse. - The mortal personality that began in the evolutionary worlds placed in a tabernacle of flesh - inhabited by a Monitor of Mystery and invested with the Spirit of Truth - does not fully mobilize, realize and unify until the day that as citizens of Jerusem we receive permission to go to Edentia and we are proclaimed as true members of the Nebadon morontia corps as Paradise ascenders.

---

We wonder what happens to mortals who are not resurrected on the third day, and if all Urantians resurrect after those three days. There could be two possibilities: those who reach the third circle are the ones who are resurrected on the third day, while those who don't must wait for a planetary dispensation. Let us remember that the last one occurred when Miguel de Nebadon completed his seventh donation.

We also wonder about what sleeps in the first mansion world. It is supposed to be the soul, a soul that, when we wake up in the resurrection rooms, receives a support: the morontia body. It is estimated that there are about 700,000 repersonalization rooms. Would they be enough to reassemble all those who awaken after a planetary dispensation? On the other hand, we are not told in the Book how long a repersonalization lasts.

Attempts have been made to establish a parallelism with a special case of resurrection, such as the repersonalization of the members of the Planetary Prince's entourage. This process lasted about ten days, but we do not know if it is an adequate reference to calculate the time of a repersonalization in the resurrection rooms, since in the first case the destination body was not morontia but material.

We have another very interesting reference to the resurrection in the morontia appearances of Jesus. Let us remember that the physical controllers had more and more difficulties to make the body of Jesus visible as the days progressed, since the distance between the material body and the different morontia bodies was increasing more and more. These morontia bodies were becoming more and more subtle.

There are differences of interpretation regarding the mansion world in which we begin our morontia stage: do we always pass through the first one, even for a brief period of time, until we reach the world that would correspond to us according to our spiritual state? It doesn't seem like that, at least not when it comes to mortals in general. In the document that deals with the worlds in light and life, it is said that many of the human beings who inhabit these worlds do not even pass through the mansion worlds, but from their planet they go directly to Jerusem.

In <a id="a291_3"></a>[UB 47:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p3_5) there are some very interesting observations about planetary dispensations, and in <a id="a291_128"></a>[UB 49:5.32](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p5_32) we have references about terrestrial escape techniques. Another question that was raised was this: if in the fourth mansion world one must already master the language of the local universe, and considering that there are human beings who can go directly to this fourth world, how can they learn the language? in such a short time, if the revelators also tell us that the technique for learning the language is quite similar to that used on Urantia? It is true that already in the worlds in light and life it is possible to learn the language of the local universe. We must also highlight the case of mortals who merge with their Adjuster already in the material world, which means they go to the most advanced mansion worlds (<a id="a291_898"></a>[UB 49:6.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p6_19)). These mortals do not necessarily have to come from a world in light and life, but in general it happens in the most spiritually advanced worlds.
