**THE RACE UPWARDS**

**According to THE URANTIA BOOK, interpreted by Rafael Mondéjar**

Medellín, September 25, 2016

## THE UPWARD RACE

**1**

> _The ascendant career is the most important factor in any study of the mortals of time and space_ ([UB 40:5.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p5_18))

## CONDITION AND WORLDS

**2**

**The ascending career** is that long path of material, intellectual, and spiritual progress which we can travel, if we so desire, <ins>from our initial condition as mortal human beings</ins> on our world of origin, the planet Earth (Urantia), <ins>until we achieve the condition of perfected and eternal spirits on Paradise, and even beyond that achievement.

**On Urantia** we go through a short, intense test during the initial life of our material existence.

**Later**, on the Mansion Worlds (MMA) and other worlds in our System, our Constellation, and our Local Universe (LU), we will pass through the morontia phases of ascension.

**Later still**, on the formative worlds of our Minor Sector, our Major Sector, and our Superuniverse (SU), we shall pass through the true spiritual stages of progression and prepare for the transit to the Central Universe of Havona.

**On the seven circuits of Havona**, our achievements will be intellectual, spiritual, and experiential. And there is a specific task to be accomplished on each of the billion worlds distributed across the aforementioned circuits.

**Finally**, from the inner circuit of Havona, we will continue to the very center of the Universe to reside on Paradise and be admitted into the Corps of the Finality.

**With this we will complete** the revealed upward race, since, apparently, as Finalists an immense destiny awaits us, yet to be revealed.

**What we just saw** is <ins>a very quick overview</ins>, but let's go slower, getting to know those worlds I just mentioned, the different stages of our ascending career and the progress we will make in each of them.

## STAGES

**3**

**On this long road**, we will go through <ins>seven very different stages of progress</ins>:

- **We will start** with the <ins>_Planetary Mortals Stage_</ins>, which is our current stage, our first stage (we can see it at the bottom of the screen).
- **After our death** we will move on to the <ins>_Sleeping Survivors Stage_</ins>, in which there is no progress.
- **When they wake us up**, we will continue with the <ins>_MMA Student Stage_</ins>.
- **We will continue** with the <ins>_Morontial Progressors_</ins>.
- **From there we will move** to the <ins>_Superuniverse Ward Stage_</ins>.
- **Then** to that of <ins>_Pilgrims in Havona_</ins>.
- **And finally**, we will reach the Citizen Stage in Paradise, and there we will be able to attain the Finality Corps

Well, now we start with

## THE STAGE OF PLANETARY MORTALS

**4**

**This is the initial stage** of our upward journey, the one we are currently living and experiencing. I want to cover it in detail because, to understand everything that awaits us next, it is essential to become fully aware that we have already begun the long journey toward eternal life, and to remember some basic concepts of this first stage, because they constitute the foundation of our entire future.

**5**

**Contents**

**In this first stage** we will delve into the following content:

1. Our constituent elements
2. Other aid we receive
3. The 7 psychic circles of human progress
4. Achievements we will reach in each circle
5. Death and types of death
6. What happens after physical death?

**6**

### Our constituent elements

**Our constituent elements (1)**

Well, let's start by examining our constituent elements.

**In this first stage** we begin our life as evolutionary beings of animal origin but with ascending potential and, for our development and growth as such beings, we have <ins>the 5 elements that we see on the screen</ins>:

1. The body
2. The mind
3. Personality
4. The spirit
5. The soul

**7**

**Our constituent elements (2)**

**The body** is our living but mortal electrochemical mechanism, of animal nature and origin, provided with brain, nervous, and other structures that allow the superposition and manifestation of the other four elements mentioned above. The physical body is provided to us by our material parents, who are also of animal nature and origin.

**8**

**Our constituent elements (3)**

**The mind** is the <ins>intelligence associated with emotional life</ins> and with an energetic-material and mortal system (the brain), through which it functions: it thinks, perceives, feels and remembers; the mind includes the totality of conscious and unconscious experience and can be elevated to the level of the spirit through Worship and Wisdom.

**It is granted to us** by the Mother Spirit of the UL, through seven Helping Spirits of the Mind (7EAM):

- **Five of them** are common to animals and humans: Intuition, Understanding, Courage, Knowledge and Advice.
- **The other two** are proper to man: Worship and Wisdom.

**This human mind** is self-aware (identity) because, when under the influence of the 7EAM, it only needs the brain to function, to which it is already associated.

**9**

**Our constituent elements (4)**

**Personality** is the only unchanging reality in our ever-changing experience, unifying the other associated elements of human beings (body and mind, which we have already seen, and spirit and soul, which we will see shortly).

**Personality** is a gift that the Father gives us and that, <ins>in its maximum manifestation</ins>, includes the following qualities:

- <ins>Identity or self-awareness</ins> (which lies, as we have already seen, in the mind of the human creature)
- <ins>Free will or free will</ins>
- <ins>Possibility of rebellion</ins>
- <ins>Feeling of brotherhood with other similar personalities</ins>

<ins>NOTE: THE FOLLOWING IS NOT ESSENTIAL NOW, BUT IT IS GOOD TO KNOW</ins>

**All the qualities** I just mentioned are immediately understandable, except perhaps free will. This is involved in:

- <ins>The moral decision</ins>, which requires wisdom
- <ins>Spiritual choice</ins>, which requires discernment of the truth
- <ins>Selfless love</ins>, and consequently service to the fraternity
- <ins>Intentional cooperation</ins>, which requires loyalty to the group
- <ins>Cosmic insight</ins> or grasping of universal meanings
- <ins>The consecration of the personality to do the will of the Father</ins>
- <ins>Worship</ins> or sincere recognition of divine values and love for God

**10**

**Our constituent elements (5)**

**The spirit** is a <ins>prepersonal, divine, and immortal fragment</ins> that the Universal Father also grants us to reside in our mind, and from there guide us morally and make the necessary adjustments to promote our spiritual advancement. This divine spirit is destined to merge with us, with our personality, if we so desire and work for it. In the UB, it is called the <ins>Thought Adjuster or Mystery Monitor</ins>.

**11**

**Our constituent elements (6)**

**The soul** is an experiential acquisition, born of the spiritualization of the mind through contact with the Adjuster, as human beings choose to do the will of the Father.

**And when we do this**, the inner spirit becomes the father, and the mind the mother of this emerging reality, which is the Soul, which is potentially destined to survive physical death.

**In this way**, human beings transcend the temporal limitations of our body and mind, identifying with the soul, which ensures our continuity and our voluntary ascension to Paradise.

**The substance of the soul** is neither material nor spiritual, but morontial, which is an intermediate state between the two.

**Well, these we have seen** are the <ins>5 elements</ins> that make up our being in this first stage of our long career.

Let's see now

**12**

### Other aid we received

**Other aid we received (49.6.1)**

1. **In addition to the elements** already mentioned, <ins>we all enjoy</ins> the service of the Guardian Angels and other orders of messengers of the Infinite Spirit.
2. **We are all freed** from the chains of the flesh through natural death, except those who fuse with the Adjuster during physical life.
3. **We all go to the Morontial Worlds (MMO)** of spiritual evolution and mental progress, except those in which spiritual (or soul) death occurs.
4. **Furthermore, since Pentecost**, the teaching and guidance of a <ins>threefold spiritual endowment</ins> has been universalized for <ins>all human beings on Urantia</ins>:
  1. The Thought Adjuster, which we have already mentioned, and which proceeds from the Father.
  2. The Spirit of Truth, which proceeds from the Eternal Son, received through Michael of Nebadon, Son of God and creator of the UL, who incarnated on our planet as Jesus of Nazareth.
  3. The Holy Spirit, who proceeds from the Infinite Spirit, received through the Divine Minister, companion of Michael of Nebadon in the creation of UL.
8. **And as we progress** on the scale of intelligence and spiritual perception, we will receive new, higher spiritual influences.

**13**

### The 7 Psychic Circles of Human Progress

**The 7 Psychic Circles of Human Progress (1)**

With the 5 elements that we have already seen that we possess (body, mind, personality, spirit and soul) <ins>and with the other aids that we receive</ins>, we Planetary Mortals have <ins>the opportunity and the responsibility</ins> to achieve in our life certain <ins>individual achievements of progress</ins>, that is to say <ins>of material, intellectual and spiritual development</ins>.

**And this individual progress** of human beings is achieved and measured by the conquest and successive passage of the so-called <ins>seven psychic circles</ins> or also <ins>cosmic circles</ins>.

1\. **Therefore** we can say that the seven psychic circles consist of <ins>7 levels of human progression</ins>, which begin at the step next to the purely animal (that would be the entry into the 7th Circle) and which lead us finally to discover that we are citizens of the universe and that we are part of the cosmic experience of the Supreme Being.

2\. **Mastery of these circles** is related to the growth of the soul. This growth can be quantitative or qualitative.

**A quantitative growth** of our soul occurs as we understand the meanings – who I am, where I come from, what I am doing here, where I am going next, what is the meaning of this life, why evil exists, what is beyond death, what is the purpose of this universe, etc. – <ins>of the finite reality in which we are immersed</ins> (remember that reality has 3 levels: the material, the intellectual and the spiritual).

**But the qualitative growth** of our soul is linked to our Faith and our Acts; because, on the one hand, it depends _totally_ on **our faith** grasping the truth that man is a son of God – and when that happens, that truth becomes experience – but, on the other hand, **our acts** our works, the realization of God's will – are essential to reach the awareness that we are an integral part of the cosmic reality of the Supreme Being.

**14**

**The 7 Psychic Circles of Human Progress (2)**

3\. **It is very important to keep in mind** that progress through the 7 psychic circles has to do with the <ins>balanced growth of the entire human personality</ins>, which includes:
  - The corporal or material aspects
  - The achievements of the mind
  - The growth of the soul, and
  - Attunement to the Adjuster
4\. **A disproportionate growth** of some parts over others always carries with it <ins>two alternative dangers</ins>: that of falling into the inability to perceive the Adjuster's directives or that of fanatically interpreting those directives.

**15**

**The Seven Psychic Circles of Human Progress (3)**

5\. **We must also know** that passing through these 7 circles <ins>does not equal fusion with the Adjuster</ins>, although it reveals that the previous stages for fusion with him have been reached.
6\. **The Adjuster** collaborates with us, <ins>from within us</ins>, so that we may reach the 7 circles, and he himself also progresses in them toward his own autonomous functioning in the realm of finite reality.
7\. **On the other hand**, the Seraphim, who are mind stimulators, continually attempt to provoke us to decisions that will lead us to overcome the circles. They do this not from within, as do the Adjusters, but from without, working through our social, ethical, and moral environment.
8\. **Finally, say** that the soul reflects the actions and motivations of the mind,
  - **and that when the mind** chooses truth, beauty and goodness, it is traveling through the 7 circles, under the guidance of the 7 EAM, unified and directed by the Spirit of Wisdom.
  - **And after the completion** of the 7 circles, <ins>the gift of the morontia mind is superimposed</ins> upon the mind that is under the influence of these adjutant spirits, thus initiating the morontia career.

**16**

### Achievements we will reach in the 7 circles

**Achievements we will reach in the 7 circles**

**The first thing to say** is that it is difficult to precisely define the achievements that can be reached at each of these 7 levels of human progression, as they vary for each individual according to their capacity for balanced growth. Therefore, the Revelators have not established any precise delimitation that would indicate which circle we are in at any given time. But what truly matters is not which circle we are in, but rather where we are moving toward. However, the following can be said in general terms:

1. **That we begin** by entering the 7th circle, the outermost one, and that from there, our intellectual decisions, our moral choices, our spiritual development, our faith and our actions, determine our progress towards each of the following circles until we reach the 1st.
2. **That there is no direct relationship between the conquest** of the cosmic circles and the spiritual religious experience, but that this conquest increases our potential for success and human achievements.
3. **That cosmic evolution** through these circles is reflected in three ways:
  - In progressive attunement with the Adjuster
  - In the evolution, also progressive, of the morontial soul
  - And in the ever-increasing degree of reality of human personality

**Finally, let me say that <ins>if we do not achieve the conquest of these 7 Cosmic Circles before physical death</ins>, it will be part of our experience in the MMA, unless the impossibility of reaching these worlds is due to our fault or our intentions and desires do not have a survival value.

**17**

**Achievements we will reach. Circle 7º (1)**

**We enter the 7th circle** when we develop two capacities:

1. The proper functioning of the human personality,
2. And the ability to achieve spiritual individuality.

**18**

**Achievements we will reach. Circle 7º (2)**

**Our personality** functions properly when we can exercise:

- personal choice
- the individual decision
- and moral responsibility

19. PLANETARY MORTALS STAGE

**Achievements we will reach. Circle 7º (3)**

**And the capacity** to achieve spiritual individuality, indicates:

- that in our mind the 7EAM are functioning under the direction of the spirit of wisdom,
- that our mind has already received the Thought Adjuster
- who has also received the Spirit of Truth
- And that we have been included in the circuits of influence of the Holy Spirit

**20**

**Achievements we will reach. Circle 7º (4)**

**But do we all** develop these abilities? Evidently not.

**People with a normal mind** reach the 7th circle and, from there, climb all the others until they reach the 1st.

**People with a subnormal mind** (including in this category exclusively those who are unable to exercise normal willpower, as we have just seen: that is, they have no capacity for choice or ordinary decisions, they cannot be held morally responsible, they have no capacity for spiritual individuality and personal understanding of God) **do not reach this 7th circle** and, consequently, do not experience the balanced growth in all the aspects of personality mentioned above. Nevertheless, these people with a subnormal mind have assigned to them a Company of Seraphim and a Battalion of Cherubim, charged with serving them and seeing that justice and mercy are shown to them in the struggles for life on our planet. Therefore, it is obvious that they also deserve all our understanding, our love and our service. (Do these creatures have personalities? I think they can, like any other human being, and I think they can be awakened after death in MMOs, like children who die without an Adjuster awaken. But this is a question that is not explicitly resolved in the LU.)

1. **Entering the 7th circle** makes us true potential citizens of the UL.
2. **And from that moment** <ins>we belong to a group of 1,000 mortals</ins> in similar conditions of progress, and we are <ins>under the care and custody of 1 Pair of Seraphim and 1 Company of Helper Cherubim</ins>.

**21**

**Achievements we will reach. Circles 6-4**

**From our passage** through circles 6 to 4, we are only informed of the following:

1. **That the 7EAM** exert an increasing and unified action to free the mind from its dependence on the physical mechanisms of material life, in order to introduce it increasingly into the morontial levels of experience.
2. **That when we reach the 6th circle**, we belong to a group of 500 mortals in similar conditions of progress, and that we are under the care and custody of <ins>1 Pair of Seraphim with 1 Company of Cherubim</ins>.
3. **That when we reach the 5th circle**, <ins>we belong to a group of about 100 people, and that 1 Pair of Seraphim with 1 Group of Cherubim take care of us</ins>.
4. **That when we reach the 4th circle**, <ins>we are gathered into groups of 10, and that 1 Pair of Seraphim, assisted by 1 Company of Cherubim, takes charge of us again</ins>.

**22**

**Achievements we will achieve. Circle 3**

**From our entrance and passage** through the 3rd Circle, we are told:

1. **That since we reach this 3rd circle**, <ins>1 Pair of Seraphic Guardians</ins> dedicate themselves totally and exclusively to us, after which an evident improvement is observed in all phases of cosmic progression and spiritual development.
2. **That our Adjuster strives**:
  - By morontializing our mind (that is, by making our mind more and more like the morontial mind)
  - For conquering the remaining circles, and
  - By reaching the final stage of the human-divine association before natural death occurs and this exceptional association (between the Adjuster and the Seraphic Guardian) is dissolved.
3. **That the influence of the 7EAM** progressively decreases from this 3rd circle to the 1st.

**We are not told anything specific about the 2nd circle.**

**23**

**Achievements we will reach. Circle 1**

**And from the 1st Circle** we are told that when we reach it:

1. **The Adjuster** can now speak directly and immediately with us, thereby achieving the maximum possible development and closeness between the Adjuster and our mind during the human experience.
2. **That we have reached** mortal maturity and that the 7EAM end their exclusive influence on our mind.
3. **That, consequently,** the mind becomes more and more like the intelligence of the morontia state,
4. **And also** that in this First Circle, we feel more intensely citizens of the universe and an integral part of the Supreme Being.

**24**

### Death and types of death

**Death and types of death (1)**

**Let's consider death** from three different visions or perspectives

1. From a purely material perspective
2. From a philosophical vision with survival values, and
3. From the point of view of the survival of the personality

**25**

**Death and types of death (2)**

1. **Human beings** normally understand death as the physical cessation of vital energies; and, indeed, that is what death is from a purely material point of view. When the human body no longer responds to any stimulus, the person is understood to be physically dead. And for those who consider death only from a material point of view, this is the only death there is.
2. **However,** from a philosophical perspective with values of permanence, death is only <ins>the beginning of a permanent career of exciting adventures</ins> and endless wonders, the beginning of a perpetual life of anticipation and an eternal voyage of discovery.
3. **But in the realm of reality** that we already know, that is, <ins>as regards not merely the physical body, but the survival of the personality, there are in fact three types of death</ins>:
  - Spiritual death (or death of the soul)
  - Intellectual death (or death of the mind)
  - Physical death (of body and mind)

**26**

**Death and types of death (3)**

<ins>**Spiritual (or soul) death**</ins> occurs when the following circumstances occur successively:

1. **That the human being** definitively rejects survival
2. **Let both his Adjuster** and his Seraphim come to the conclusion that this rejection is real, and jointly issue a report declaring the total insolvency or spiritual bankruptcy of that mortal.
3. **Let that report** of the Adjuster and the Seraphim be recorded on Uversa, the capital of Orvonton.
4. **Let the Censors** and their Reflective associates verify the certainty of these conclusions.
5. **Let the Rulers** of Orvonton order the immediate release of the Adjuster.

**Spiritual death** is absolutely final, and although the physical life of that individual may continue by the mere material impulse of cosmic energies, he is already cosmically dead and will never again be resurrected. His Adjuster departs for Divinington, but his personal or collective Seraphim will continue to fulfill his duties toward that individual who has been abandoned by his Adjuster.

**27**

**Death and types of death (4)**

**<ins>Intellectual (or mental) death</ins> occurs:**

**When the mental circuits** of human volitional action, utilized by the Spirit of Worship and the Spirit of Wisdom, are broken beyond repair. This can occur through intellectual aberrations or through the partial destruction of the cerebral mechanism.

**In these cases:**
- **The Adjuster is immediately released** and departs for Divinington, and in the records of the Universe that mortal is considered to have met his death, even though the mechanism of the physical body continues to function.
- **The body minus the volitional mind** is no longer human,
- **But the soul of that individual** can survive according to the previous choice of his will.

**28**

**Death and types of death (5)**

**<ins>Physical death</ins> (i.e., of the body and mind)** occurs:

**When the brain structures** of a human being, which are necessary for mental endowment, cease to function and the measurable energies of the brain stop their vital rhythmic pulsations.

**This entails** the deterioration of the mind and puts an end to mortal consciousness, which cannot reappear until a cosmic situation has been prepared that allows that same human personality to once again exercise its activity in relation to living energy.

**29**

### What happens after physical death?

**What happens after physical death? (1)**

**After the death** of the physical body and the material mind, <ins>the other three elements</ins> that constitute our being, but which were not material, still survive. These elements will be indispensable for the subsequent resurrection in the MMO, but at the moment of the individual's death, they are disaggregated and separated. They are:
- The Thought Adjuster
- The Morontia Soul
- The immortal Personality

**30**

**What happens after physical death? (2)**

**The Thought Adjuster**, which the Father gave us

- **cannot retain for now** the subject's personality (because it is not his, because he has not merged with him),
- **but it remains with the** **insidentity** of the same, which was in the mind;
- **and after the death of said subject**, <ins>he goes to Divinington</ins>,
- **But before departing** he makes a duplicate copy of the memory of the mind in which he resided, containing those events of human life which had morontia and spiritual values and significance. And he takes one of these copies with him so that at the time of repersonalization when this Adjuster returns, he may reestablish the memory of the original individual, and thus the latter will have full consciousness of his continuity and expanded personality. These spiritualized creature memory and identity factors* forever become a part of the Adjuster.

<ins>Do not explain, if it is not necessary, but it is essential to know</ins>:

(*) In the LU it says “<ins>personality</ins> of the creature” but be careful, this personality cannot be referred to the one that the individual receives as a gift from the Father, since that gift is not yet part of the Adjuster, therefore the concept of personality in that phrase, cannot have but the value of <ins>material personality or identity</ins>.

**31**

**What happens after physical death? (3)**

**The morontia soul**, as it is above the influence of the 7EAM

- **does not retain consciousness** of itself without the Adjuster,
- **so he temporarily loses** his identity.
- **However, it retains** certain phases of its former associated mind, such as the creature's mental matrix and the passive potentials of its identity, and therefore,
- **has a continuous character** that <ins>becomes an active memory when stimulated by the returning Adjuster</ins>.
- **This morontial soul** remains under the custody of a pair of Guardian Seraphim of Destiny until its subsequent repersonalization.
- **During that time**, <ins>the soul never manifests an active identity</ins>, because it does not have one,
- **and it also does not establish** <ins>any type of communication with other personalities</ins>.

**32**

**What happens after physical death? (4)**

**The immortal Personality**, who was also bestowed upon us by the Father,

- **It is unknown where he goes**. His exact whereabouts during the period between death and survival are unknown to the revealers.
- **but we are assured** that both the record of the constitution of personality and each of its identifiable factors are effectively safeguarded by the archangels, in their worlds of special activities.

**And, besides** these three disaggregated elements (Spirit, Soul and Personality), **the history of human life**, as it was lived in the flesh, is preserved in the UL, together with certain living records.

**33**

**What happens after physical death? (5)**

**After this situation of death** of the physical body and the material mind, and the disintegration of the non-material elements, we Planetary Mortals, **we pass to the stage of Sleeping Survivors**.

## SLEEPING SURVIVORS STAGE

**34**

**We have already seen that after the death** of the physical body and the material mind, the soul, separated from the Adjuster, cannot manifest identity or establish any kind of communication with beings living on Earth. We could say, therefore, that the material self of the deceased person **is in absolute darkness**.

**In this state**, these souls are completely and absolutely unconscious during the sleep of death. There can be no manifestation of personality, nor can there be any ability to communicate with other personalities until after survival has been achieved. However, those who go to MMA are also not allowed to send messages back to their loved ones.

**In all universes** <ins>there is a policy of prohibiting this type of communication</ins> during the current dispensation. Therefore, to support or affirm that any type of communication can exist between the recently dead (those of our dispensation) and the living finds no support in the UB, except for what happened with Jesus of Nazareth, whose appearances occurred while he remained in the MMA.

**For sleeping mortals**, the passage of time is of no consequence; they are completely unconscious and unaware of the length of their rest. When their personalities reassemble at the end of an age, those who have slept for thousands of years react in the same way as those who slept only a few days. <ins>All survivors go through the ascension regime exactly the same regardless of the length of their death-sleep.</ins>

**35**

**Contents**

**In this second stage** we will delve into the following content:

1. Our time spent in this stage
2. Orders of ascension for survival
3. Requirements for an individual Order of Ascension
4. Worlds where resurrection takes place
5. Summary table
6. How the resurrection is carried out
7. Mortals who do not awaken, who do not resurrect

**36**

### Our time spent at this stage

**Our time spent at this stage**

**Our length of time** in this stage will depend on the achievements each of us has made during the Planetary Mortal stage, and also on the survival values our souls hold. The greater our progress, the less time we spend asleep. In other words, this length of time will depend greatly on the different state of progress we find ourselves in at the time of our death.

**Well, let's see** what are the <ins>situations of different progress in which Planetary Mortals can find themselves</ins>, at the moment of death:

1. **Those human beings who**, at the time of their death, have not reached the 7th circle. These are normally children who have not yet received the Adjuster. For survival purposes, these children are dependent on their parents; therefore, they will remain in the stage of dormant survivors until one of them is repersonalized, a variable amount of time. From my point of view, it is also possible that those with a subnormal mind may be included in this situation.
2. **Those human beings who**, at the time of their death, <ins>have already received the Adjuster</ins> and have therefore attained the 7th Circle, and even some more advanced circles, <ins>but</ins> who <ins>have not yet chosen eternal life</ins>. They are generally <ins>children between the ages of 6 and 14 or 16</ins>. These children, for the purposes of survival, are also dependent upon their parents, and therefore they will likewise remain in the stage of dormant survivors for a variable time, until one of their parents is repersonalized.
3. **Those adult human beings** who, at the time of their death, find themselves between the 7th and 4th circles. These mortals generally come **from less advanced evolutionary worlds** and remain as dormant survivors for a variable period of time, which may end at any time, or when a millennial ascension order occurs, or at the end of an era, depending not only on the circle they have reached (between the 7th and 4th), but also on various circumstances (practical reasons, sentimental associations, etc.).
4. **Those human beings** who, at the time of their death, are at least in the 3rd Circle and are assisted by a personal Seraphim. (49.6.8; 112.4.12) In this 4th group, <ins>some of these sleeping survivors</ins> come from <ins>less advanced evolutionary worlds</ins>, and among them, <ins>three groups</ins> can be distinguished, according to their different stages of progress:
  1. Less advanced mortals
  2. Intermediate forward flips
  3. More advanced mortals
5. **Other human beings** are also found in the 3rd Circle or higher and are likewise assisted by a personal Seraphic Guardian of Destiny, but they come from intermediate evolutionary worlds. Among them, too, three groups can be distinguished according to their different stages of progress:
  1. Lesser-developed mortals
  2. Mortals of intermediate perfection
  3. More sophisticated mortals
  **All these human beings** are <ins>repersonalized on the third day, although in different worlds</ins> and through different orders of ascension, as we will see shortly.
6. **Finally, there are those human beings**, generally originating from advanced evolutionary worlds, who fuse with their Adjuster in their own physical lives without passing through the gates of death. In all probability, they have attained the first circle, although this fact alone does not imply fusion with the Adjuster in life. These human beings are immediately awakened at the headquarters of the UL.

**37**

### Ascension Orders for Survival

**Ascension Orders for Survival (1)**

**The ascension orders** for survival serve to summon the sleeping survivors, so that they may awaken and rejoin life and progress. <ins>They are dictated and promulgated in the UL itself</ins> (in our case, in the UL of Nebadon).

**These that appear** on the screen are the different orders of ascension for survival:
1. Collective OA
2. Individual OA
3. OA That depend on a trial period
4. Modified Secondary OA
5. Modified Primary OA

**The first are called collective**, because they are dictated for the awakening of a more or less numerous group of sleeping survivors, <ins>while the second</ins> are dictated to awaken a single individual, and that is why they are called <ins>individual ascension orders</ins>.

**These individual ascension orders** are issued very quickly (all of them on the third day after death), while the collective ascension orders are widely spaced out, and the larger the group to be awakened, the longer it takes for the ascension order to be issued.

Whether we are awakened sooner or later and included in one or another of the orders of ascension depends, as we saw in the previous slide, on the state of different progress we are in at the time of our death, and also on the survival values we have achieved. The greater our achievements and the higher our survival values, the sooner we are awakened.

**38**

**Ascension Orders for Survival (2)**

1. **Collective ascension orders** are issued for resurrections on different dates, and there are three types:
   1. Planetary dispensation orders (for resurrections at the end of an age)
   2. Millennial ascension orders (for resurrections every thousand years)
   3. Special ascension orders (for resurrections on undetermined dates)

**Generally**, all mortals who awaken by any of these orders are repersonalized in the 1st MMA.

**39**

**Orders of promotion for survival (3)**

2\. **Individual ascension orders** are issued, as I have said before, for resurrections that take place on the third day after death and, generally, for mortals from **less advanced evolutionary worlds**. These mortals have, as we have seen, attained at least the Third Circle, have a Personal Seraphic Guardian, and are at different stages of progress. Three groups can be distinguished, as I explained above:
   1. The less advanced, which are repersonalized in the 1st MMA
   2. Those of intermediate advancement, who are repersonalized in an intermediate world of mansions
   3. The most advanced, which are repersonalized in the 7th MMA

**40**

**Orders of promotion for survival (4)**

3\. **Probationary Ascension Orders**. These orders primarily affect children and young people who are dependent on their parents for survival and are therefore issued on the date their parents' Ascension Orders are issued. These Ascension Orders are of two types:
   1. For children who die before receiving the Adjuster
   2. For children and young people with an Adjuster, who die before choosing survival

**These children are repersonalized** in the finalist worlds of the System, the Constellation, or the UL, depending on where their parents are repersonalized.

**41**

**Orders of Ascension for Survival (5)**

4\. **Modified Secondary Ascension Orders**. These are also issued for resurrections taking place on the third day after death, and for mortals generally <ins>coming from intermediate evolutionary worlds</ins>, who have also attained, as we have seen, at least the 3rd Circle, who likewise have a Personal Seraphim, and who are in different stages of progress. Three groups of mortals are also distinguished:
   1. The least advanced, which are repersonalized at the local system headquarters
   2. Those of intermediate perfection, which are repersonalized in the educational worlds of the constellation
   3. The most perfected ones, which are repersonalized at the headquarters of the constellation)

5\. **Modified Primary Ascension Orders**. These are issued to awaken those mortals, generally <ins>from advanced evolutionary worlds</ins>, who fuse with their Adjuster and who do not die. They appear at UL headquarters.

**42**

### Requirements for an Individual Ascension Order

**Requirements for an Individual Ascension Order**

**For an individual Order of Ascension to be promulgated** for a specific human being, it seems necessary that at least the following requirements be met:

1. That at the time of his death he has reached the 3rd circle or a higher level and, therefore,
2. That a personal Guardian Seraph of destiny has been assigned to him;
3. That the summary of his survival character presented by the Adjuster be unconditionally certified by the said Guardian Seraphim, and that both the Seraphim and the Adjuster be in essential agreement in every detail of their reports and recommendations concerning the life of that human being.
4. That the Universal Censors and their Reflective Associates on Uversa confirm these reports and recommendations, without ambiguity or reservation.
5. That the Ancients of Days dictate and transmit, through the communication circuits that go to Salvington, that this human being advances in position
6. That the Courts of the Sovereign of Nebadon decree the immediate passage of that human being to the resurrection halls of the MMA.

**43**

### Worlds where resurrection takes place

**Worlds where resurrection takes place (1)**

**The situation which makes possible** repersonalization or resurrection of personality <ins>takes place in the resurrection halls of the morontia receiving planets of a UL</ins>.

**In the UL of Nebadon these resurrection halls are found:**

- **On the Finality Worlds** <ins>of the System, the Constellation, and the Headquarters of the UL</ins>, where mortals of the probationary orders of ascension are reassembled (non-Adjuster or Adjuster children), depending upon where the first of their parents is reassembled.
- **In all MMA of each System**, where it is reassembled:
  - To the mortals of the orders of ascension of planetary, millennial and special dispensation
  - To the mortals of the three groups of the orders of individual ascension
- **At Local Systems Headquarters** (Jerusem is the Satania System Headquarters), where mortals of the less perfected group of modified secondary ascension orders are reassembled.
- **On the first receiving sphere of Edentia**, (our Constellation) where the mortals of the intermediate perfection group of the modified secondary ascension orders are reassembled.
- **At the Headquarters of the Constellations** (Edentia is the Headquarters of our Norlatiadek Constellation) where the mortals of the most perfected group of the modified secondary ascension orders are reassembled.
- **At the Local Universe Headquarters** (Salvington), where Adjuster-fused human beings receive their endowment.

**44**

**Worlds where resurrection takes place (2)**

<ins>SPECIFIC LOCATION OF OUR RECUSTOMIZATION</ins>

**As far as we Urantia human beings are concerned**, after our death, we will generally awaken in the first of the MMAs of the Satania System.

**There is the enormous Temple of New Life**, where a large part of the personalities of the inhabited worlds of our System are reassembled.

<ins>Let's briefly describe the Temple of New Life.</ins>

**From the immense Central Courtyard** of the Temple of the New Life extend 7 radial wings (those that appear in different colors), where the resurrection halls of the mortal races are located.

**Each of these wings** is destined for one of the 7 races of time, and contains one hundred thousand personal resurrection chambers.

**These wings terminate in circular chambers**, which are used to awaken at least a million individuals of the mixed races of the normal post-Adamic worlds.

### How the resurrection is performed

**How the resurrection is carried out (1)**

**As we have already seen, in the gigantic structure** of the Temple of New Life, is where the **Sleeping Survivors** are awakened.

And to do so, they gather:
1. Thought Adjusters
2. The Seraphic Guardians of Destiny
3. The Morontia Power Supervisors
4. The Archangels of the Resurrection
5. The Life Carriers, who also work with these celestial beings to resurrect the dead.

**They come together for the purpose of reassembling** the constituent parts of our personality, that is, to repersonalize us.

**And in these assembly chambers of life**, the Morontia Power Supervisors provide us with a vital body, morontia in nature (which is a synthesis of the material and the spiritual), which enables us to regain consciousness by the reunion of the constituent parts of our personality.

**48**

**How resurrection is performed (2)**

**And to gather the constituent parts** of our Personality it is necessary:
1. **The fabrication of a suitable form**, that is, a morontia energy body. As we have just stated, this body is fabricated by the Morontia Power Supervisors. And although we cannot form a clear idea of the morontia body or form we are to have, because it is beyond our comprehension,
2. **The endowment of a morontial mind** and a cosmic mind,
3. **The return of our Adjuster**, who is the eternal preserver of our identity; this Adjuster represents the absolute assurance that we will be the same human being we once were, and not someone else, who will occupy the morontia form created for the awakening of our personality. And this Adjuster will once again assume the role of our Paradise guide.
4. **May the seraphic guardian** who guards the survival values of our sleeping immortal soul, assisted by the Life Carriers and the Archangels of the Resurrection, confer such a morontia soul upon its awaiting body and mind form and commit it to eternal association with the Adjuster.
5. **And all of the above makes it possible for our personality to appear**, take possession of the other constituent parts of our being (which again are body, mind, soul and spirit) and unify them, producing what we know as repersonalization or resurrection, and which therefore entails the reassembly of memory, spiritual insight and consciousness or functional identity.

**When we wake up** like this in the MMA of our Local System, we will already find ourselves in the third stage of our upward career, in the Student Stage in the MMA.

**But before we go to that stage**, let's see what happens with

**49**

**How the resurrection is carried out (3)**

**<ins>The morontia form</ins>**

**Yes we can say:**

- **That this morontia form** will not be unique, but that we will receive successive morontia forms as we evolve in the two immediately following stages as MMA Students and as Morontia Progressors. This form will not be fully developed at first either.
- **That, our morontial form** will not be of a material type, like our current body, but it will be completely real.
- **That it will reflect, better than the physical form**, our inner nature, and that this better reflection will be progressive in the successive morontial and spiritual forms that we have.
- **And it will have the same purpose** as our present body, that is, through that morontia form that they are going to manufacture and deliver to us, the morontia mind and soul, as well as the Adjuster and the Personality that unifies them all, will be able to manifest.

**50**

**How the resurrection is carried out (4)**

**So, we will have** two types of mind:

- **The morontial mind**, which is the gift of the Mother Spirit of the UL in union with the Creator Son.
- **And the cosmic mind**, which is the gift of the Master Spirit of the SU of Orvonton, modified or adapted by the Divine Minister (who is the creative source of the intellect in the UL) so that it can be used in our UL.

**The Morontial Mind**

- **It will empower us** to experience expanding consciousness during our ascending career in the UL.
- **This mind evolves** through direct contact with the cosmic mind,
- **and will reveal** a growing associative capacity with it throughout the 570 levels of morontial life, through which we are going to pass.


**51**

### Mortals who do not wake up, who do not resurrect

**Mortals who do not wake up, who do not resurrect (1)**

**Up to now, we have only spoken** of the dormant survivors who awaken. And for that, we have referred to the different levels of progress achieved by planetary mortals, to the orders of ascension for the survival of these mortals, to the worlds where they are resurrected, to the reassembly of the constituent elements of their personality, and more specifically, to their new form and their new mind, as novel elements of this stage.

**But what about the mortals who do not wake up, who do not resurrect?** Who are they and why don't they do it?

**Well, they are those mortals who** in their material life:
1. They fully identify with sin,
2. They become truly wicked, and finally,
3. They end up destroying themselves in the spiritual sense;

**But this destruction** is not due to any divine punishment, but rather a consequence.

The fact is that sin and iniquity have no place, cannot exist in the spiritual worlds, because they are incompatible with progressive spiritual life; therefore, as mortals progress in the ascending career, first through the material worlds, then through the morontia worlds, and finally through the spiritual worlds, sin and iniquity must be left behind, they must disappear from their lives, and if these mortals have fully identified themselves with sin and iniquity, they too will be unable to gain access to those worlds. That is why they fall asleep, that is why they are not called by any of the orders of ascension for survival, and consequently, they are never reassembled in the manner we have seen, and that is why they are not resurrected.

**However**, its destruction is not immediate.

**52**

**Mortals who do not wake up, who do not resurrect (2)**

**Before that happens**, in UL itself, <ins>a long process of divine justice and mercy is set in motion</ins>, because although justice demands the judgment of all the faults incurred by mortals, mercy also requires that every erroneous step those mortals take be judged fairly, in accordance with the nature of each creature and with God's purpose.

**And in this process they intervene**:
- <ins>Seraphic Advisors and Guides of Justice</ins>, who assume the defense of mortals and prepare the necessary reports,
- And <ins>Universal Censors, Perfectors of Wisdom, and Divine Counselors</ins>, who jointly render judgment. Recall that the Universal Censors possess one of the two transcripts of the Adjuster's memory of the deceased human's survival character and spiritual qualities.

**But only the three Ancients of Days** who direct the Urantia Space have the joint authority to decree the cessation of existence of sleeping mortals with willpower. This cessation of existence is normally decreed at the time of the dispensational judgment, which, on a planet like Urantia, occurs at the end of a planetary dispensation.

**53**

**Mortals who do not wake up, who do not resurrect (3)**

**When this happens**, the mortal identified with sin instantly becomes as if he had never existed.

**And then**:
- <ins>the energetic factors of your identity</ins> dissipate into the cosmic potentials from which they had arisen,
- <ins>the spiritual values of his human experience</ins> continue forever to form an integral part of the experiential endowment of his former Adjuster,
- and <ins>the experiential values of his personality</ins> become a part of the evolutionary experience of the Supreme Being.

**This situation is** eternally irreversible for the human being, who has died definitively.

**54**

**But those who were resurrected...**

... began their **<ins>Student stage in the MMA.</ins>**

## STUDENT STAGE IN THE MMA

**55**

**56**

**Contents**

**In this third stage we will delve deeper** into the following aspects:

1. Description and inhabitants of the MMA.
2. New awakening and resumption of life
3. Achievements we will reach in the System's MMOs
  1. In the World of the Finalists. The Probationary Daycare
  2. In the 7 MMA, one on one
  3. In Jerusem, the headquarters of our Local System


**57**

### Description and inhabitants of the MMA

**Description and inhabitants of the MMA (1)**

**Before I refer** to our activity and achievements in MMA, it is worth describing:
- what MMA is like,
- how many there are and where they are,
- who inhabit and govern them
- and, above all, what these worlds are for.

**58**

**Description and inhabitants of the MMA (2)**

**Let's start by indicating what those MMA are like.** And the first thing we will say is:

**They are not evolutionary worlds**, but rather built for a specific purpose, according to plans and specifications; that is, they are part of the so-called architectural worlds.

**Which are neither properly material** like Urantia, nor properly spiritual like Paradise or the Havona Worlds, but of an intermediate nature, of a “morontial” nature.

**That said**, we are practically told nothing more regarding the physical characteristics of these MMA.

**59**

**Description and inhabitants of the MMA (3)**

**How many are there and where are the MMAs?**

**Well, as we already know, there are 7 MMAs**, and they revolve like satellites around Transition World No. 1, also called the World of Finalists.

**But on this screen, we're looking at them from a very close distance.** Let's look at them from a broader, more global perspective, so we can better understand where they stand.

**60**

**Description and inhabitants of the MMA (4)**

**Well, this World of the Finalists** and its 7 secondary spheres of the MMA, (which we now see further away in the upper right part of the screen), along with another 6 Worlds of Transition, whose names also

**We can now see** that each of their respective 7 secondary spheres (all 56) revolve around Jerusem, which is the Headquarters World or Capital of the Satania System. All 57 of these are the MMOs of the Satania System. Remember this carefully, because we'll be referring to them again soon.

**61**

**Description and inhabitants of the MMA (5)**

**And here we can see** the entire complex of our Local System of Satania, including, of course, <ins>our evolutionary world “Urantia”</ins>, which, as we already know, is part of that complex.

**Any questions** about how many MMAs there are and where they are located?

**62**

**Description and inhabitants of the MMA (6)**

**Well, let's continue** now referring to those who inhabit and govern the MMA, since, to a greater or lesser extent, we will come into contact with them.

**The MMA are inhabited by a large number** of personalities and other creatures of a material, morontial and spiritual nature, among which we can mention, at least, those that appear on the screen:
- Uversa Conciliators and Technical Advisors
- Directors of Reversion and Celestial Artisans
- Morontial Fellows and MMA Educators
- Ministers of Transition, Espirogas and Espornagias
- Spirit-fused Mortals and Adjuster-fused Mortals

**63**

**Description and inhabitants of the MMA (7)**

**And regarding those** who govern the MMAs, we can say that those in charge are the Melchizedek Sons and the Morontia Power Supervisors, and that, in addition, there is a governor in each MMA, although nothing specific is indicated to us about him.

**64**

**Description and inhabitants of the MMA (8)**

**And finally**, say that MMA

**They serve so that we surviving <ins>adult</ins> mortals**, coming from evolutionary worlds like ours, can continue our learning and gradual ascent, thus preparing ourselves to reach other morontia worlds of even greater progress, such as those of the Local Universe of Nebadon, the spiritual worlds of the Superuniverse of Orvonton, the perfect worlds of Havona, and Paradise itself.

**65**

### New awakening and resumption of life

**New awakening and resumption of life (1)**

**Well, now we can say** that in these MMA, <ins>we will resume our life at exactly the same evolutionary point</ins> where we left it when death comes.

**However, Urantians**, coming from a sphere that has suffered the consequences of the Planetary Prince's rebellion and the failure of Adam and Eve, <ins>will notice a considerable change</ins>, not only because of the fact of possessing <ins>a different body</ins>.

**We are going to be much changed**, but our Thought Adjuster and our Destiny Guardian Seraphim will seamlessly connect our former Urantia life with our new morontia life, thus saving us much of the difficulty we would otherwise have in relating our new morontia consciousness to the restored memory of our former identity. In fact, <ins>at the beginning</ins> of our morontia life, much of our former life, the UB tells us, <ins>“will seem like a vague, nebulous dream”</ins>.

**Our awakening in an MMA** will be an <ins>unforgettable experience</ins> for us because we will see our <ins>angelic companions</ins> for the first time, and we will be truly aware of the presence of the <ins>Adjuster</ins>, who for so long resided in our minds.

**But the Adjuster will only remember for us**<ins>those experiences which are essential</ins> to our universe career, so that <ins>a large part of our past life and its memories, which have no spiritual significance or morontia value, will perish</ins> with the material brain,

**However, personality and relationships between personalities** <ins>have cosmic value and will survive</ins>.

**Therefore, in the MMA** we will <ins>recognize and be recognized</ins> by those with whom we have established ties on Urantia.

**66**

**New awakening and resumption of life (2)**

**During the early stages** of our life in MMA, when the personality is not yet fully expressed, <ins>the will</ins> is largely governed by:
- <ins>the character patterns inherited from our human life (therefore, it is very important that we improve our character in our current life)</ins>
- <ins>and by the newly appeared action of the morontia mote</ins>

**Although we have a morontia body**, we will continue to eat, drink, and rest throughout the seven MMA. We will take morontia-type food, a realm of living energy unknown in the material worlds. The morontia body fully utilizes both food and water, but there are no residual wastes.

**To do all this in the best way**, when we arrive at the MMA we will receive our first <ins>lessons on techniques for taking advantage of rest</ins> and absorbing <ins>energy, which will be taught by the Rest Teachers, who belong to the seventh division of the Energy Manipulators</ins>.

**From each of the MMAs we pass through**, <ins>we will be able to visit the Transition World corresponding to the same MMA number</ins>, as well as the Jerusem sector related to that Transition World, and we will also be able to visit and observe any of the seven worlds (of associated collective activities) that surround the respective Transition World.

**67**

**New awakening and resumption of life (3)**

**Throughout our ascension** through the UL MMOs, and also through the spirit worlds of the Superuniverse, we will be accompanied by a couple of seraphim who will not only associate with us and assist us in acquiring morontia and spirit status, but will also advance themselves through the study they are already beginning in the <ins>schools of outreach for evolving seraphim</ins> that exist in the MMAs. And it will also be our task in the MMOs to assist the seraphim in the immediate work that follows.

**To advance from one mansion world to another**, <ins>we will sleep for seraphic transport, but the Adjuster does not leave us during these transitional dreams between the MMAs, and our personality and memory will also remain intact</ins>.

**The Transporting Seraphim** (who are of the group of Administrator Seraphim) will <ins>deliver us to the Systems Coordinators</ins> on the more advanced world, and they will <ins>skillfully effect the necessary changes in our form</ins> to adapt it to the new situation. It will take about 7 days of official time to accomplish these changes in the morontia form.

**We will wake up in the resurrection halls** <ins>of the next world, with the new body undeveloped</ins>, much like when we first arrived in a mansion world.

**Well, everything we have said so far** about our awakening in the MMA and what remains to be said regarding our achievements in each of these worlds is valid, as I said at the beginning, <ins>for the surviving adult mortals</ins>, because <ins>mortals who die as children</ins> do not awaken in any of these worlds, but in the World of the Finalists, in order to continue their development in the <ins>Probationary Nursery</ins> located there, until they can make their decisions whether or not to continue with their survival, in which case, they will pass, already as adults, to the world that corresponds to them.

**Well, up to this point we have seen** the generalities of our awakening and the resumption of life in MMA, and now it is time for us to see, in summary, what achievements we will reach in the MMOs of the System.

**68**

### Achievements in the World of Finalists

**Achievements in the World of Finalists (1)**

**And to do this we are going to start** with the World of the Finalists, which, as we have already seen, is the 1st Transition World of the 7 that revolve around Jerusem, and which is surrounded by the 7 MMA.

**Now, let's move on to the details** of the characteristics and achievements that are reached in the World of Finalists:

**This is a sphere** of exquisite physical beauty and extraordinary morontial beautification.

**At the center of their activities** is the great spiritual dwelling, the Temple of the Finalists.

**It's there. Does anyone see it?** Well, it can't be seen because it's not visible to our material vision. In reality, the World of the Finaliters is so named because it is the **Headquarters of the Finaliter Corps** of our System. <ins>This Corps is made up</ins> of one hundred million Finaliters (100,000 Companies of 1,000 glorified beings each).

**The World of Finalists** <ins>is accessible</ins> to the inhabitants of the 7 MMA.

**This World is also** <ins>the guarantee of our ascension</ins>, because <ins>the Transporting Seraphim of the Local System (those of the group of Administrator Seraphim) take us to the World of the Finaliters to guarantee us the certainty that we will be able to complete our ascension</ins> to Paradise and return as Finaliters, in the same way that those who reside in that world have already arrived and returned.

**Neither the Finaliters nor their buildings are perceptible** to our morontial vision

**However**, <ins>the Energy Transformers and the Morontia Power Supervisors</ins> make them momentarily visible to us on the occasion of the assemblies they hold annually.

**69**

**Achievements in the World of Finalists (2)**

**In the World of the Finalists** is the <ins>System Probationary Daycare</ins>.

**In addition to the Finalists**, the following also reside in this sphere:
- <ins>Children</ins> who in their evolutionary worlds die before receiving the Adjuster or before deciding the path of eternal life, who are repersonalized in this world
- <ins>The managers and educators</ins> of the Probationary Nursery
- <ins>The Spornagia</ins>, who are hospitable hosts to all visitors they can recognize

**And they can temporarily house:**

- All kinds of spiritual beings
- Transition mortals
- Student visitors

**70**

#### The Probationary Nursery

**Achievements in the World of Finalists (3)**

**The Probationary Nursery (1)**

**As we have just seen, the Probationary Nursery** is located in this World of the Finalists, and is the <ins>group of children's receiving schools of the Satania System</ins>

**These extensive educational facilities**, to which half the planet is dedicated, are maintained by the Educators of the MMA, who are Cherubim abandoned by the Seraphim and later embraced by the Mother Spirit of the UL. _(The Seraphim abandon the Cherubim when they have to go outside Nebadon on some special mission and also when the planetary mortals, whom they jointly care for, reach the MMO._)

**The probationary nursery is supervised** by the Melchizedeks and one thousand pairs of volunteer <ins>Material Sons and Daughters</ins> from Jerusem. They are also directly assisted by almost an equal number of <ins>volunteer Midsonite parent groups</ins>, who stop at the nursery to perform this service on their way from the Midsonite world of Satania to their unrevealed destiny on the special worlds reserved for them among the finaliter spheres of Salvington. (_The Midsonites are children of the Melchizedeks who have been modified to act as Life Carriers and who are paired with Material Daughters._)

**The function of this Nursery** is to rear and instruct the children of ascending mortals, <ins>including those who have died on the evolutionary worlds of space before having acquired their status as individuals in the universe records. These children are always personalized in the exact physical state</ins> (what does this mean by exact physical state? Is their form not morontial?) <ins>they had at the time of death, except as regards their reproductive potential.</ins>

**In the Nursery, the children are grouped** according to whether or not they possess an Adjuster, since the Adjusters come to reside in these material children (this “material children” seems to be in line with the above statement of “exact physical state”) just as on the time worlds.

**Children who die without an Adjuster** are repersonalized on the Finaliter World at the time of one of their parents' arrival at the MMA. These children are cared for in families of five, from the age of one year or less until approximately five years, the age at which the Adjuster arrives.

**<ins>Children and youth who have their Adjusters</ins>**, <ins>but who before death had not made their choice for eternal life</ins>, are also repersonalized on the Finaliter World upon the arrival of one of their parents in the MMA. These children and youth are likewise reared in families of five, and their ages range from six to fourteen years.

**Both groups of children** may be visited by their parents up to four times a year. And the parents are given every opportunity to collaborate with the morontia guardians of these children in their instruction and training. The UB says that observing these parents embracing their material offspring is one of the most beautiful scenes of the entire ascending career.

**And in the next slide**—look closely—we'll be able to witness one of those tender scenes of the reunion of parents with their children, which takes place at the doors of the nursery. As you can see, the emotion is tremendous. Here we have them.

**71**

**Achievements in the World of Finalists (4)**

**The Probationary Nursery (2)**

**72**

**Achievements in the World of Finalists (5)**

**The Probationary Nursery (3)**

**<ins>The seraphim</ins>** **look after these young ones** in the Probationary Nursery in exactly the same way as they do for mortals on the evolutionary planets, and the Spornagias attend to their physical needs (here also he speaks of “physical needs”). And these children grow up thus in the World of the Finaliters until such time as they make their final choice, for which they have every opportunity.

**The seraphic service for both groups of children** is similar, in general, to that of the more advanced parent. <ins>Those children who</ins>, after receiving the Adjuster and further advancing, attain the 3rd circle, are granted personal guardians, regardless of the level attained by their parents.

**At any time after the age of sixteen**, if they have made their final election, they are transferred to the 1st MMA, where many of them arrive in time to join their parents on their ascension to Havona and Paradise. Some children make their election before this age, but very few children under the age of sixteen are found in the MMA.

**After passing through Havona and reaching the Deities,** these saved souls of mortal origin <ins>compose the permanent ascending citizenry of Paradise.</ins> These children, who have been deprived of the valuable and essential evolutionary experience on the worlds of mortal birth, are not enrolled in the Corps of the Finality.

**When material life has run its course** (“material life” is also consistent with the above statement) in the Probationary Nursery (and when will that be? At what age or under what circumstances?), if they have not chosen the ascendant life, or <ins>if they have definitely decided against the Havona adventure</ins>, death automatically terminates their probationary career. These cases require no judgment; there is no resurrection for this second death. They simply become as if they had never existed.

**On the Finality Worlds of the Constellation and UL Headquarters** similar Probationary Nurseries also exist for children without an Adjuster, or with one if they have not yet made their decision for eternal life, whose mortal parents are called by the modified primary and secondary orders of ascension.

### Achievements in the First Mansion World

**Achievements in the First Mansion World (1)**

**In the 1st MMA we will be reassembled** with most of the sleeping survivors from Urantia.

**This reassembly will take place** in the resurrection halls of the enormous Temple of New Life.

**As a curious fact, let us remember that in the center of the immense courtyard** of the resurrection halls of the 1st MMA, after Jesus passed through that world, <ins>a memorial monument to Michael</ins> was erected, which makes the revelators suspect that the Master's resurrection on Urantia was promoted in some way from that world.

**From the resurrection halls** we will be transferred to the Melchizedek sector, where we will be assigned a permanent residence.

**We'll then have ten days of personal freedom** and will be able to explore the surroundings and familiarize ourselves with the program that awaits us. We'll also be able to check the registration records and visit loved ones and other friends who have gone before us.

**At the end of this period**, we will begin work on this third stage of our journey to Paradise. And our first study will be the Language of Satania.

**We will be assigned Morontia Companions**, who will be our loving hosts and loyal personal guides, making our lives rewarding and enjoyable throughout the UL MMOs. Among them will be:
- Those assigned as group mates (1 for every thousand mortals in the 1st MMA)
- Interpreters and Translators
- The Guardians of the Buildings
- The Excursion Supervisors

**74**

**Achievements in the First Mansion World (2)**

**We will resume our intellectual education** and our spiritual development through the Schools of Thought, Feeling, and Action.

**We can correct:**
- Biological deficiencies,
- Those of our experience
- Those of our character,
- And as for the deficiencies or defects related to sexual life, family association, and parental function, these will be corrected or plans will be made for their future correction within the families of the Material Sons in Jerusem.

**We will also work to gradually understand the meaning of the morontia mote.**

**75**

**Achievements in the First Mansion World (3)**

**We must comply with the requirement** <ins>demanded by the Urantia Parental Commission</ins> that no ascending mortal may avoid <ins>the experience of childrearing</ins>. It must be said that <ins>this requirement is not capricious</ins> because in the Universe, <ins>the experience of being a parent</ins> and, therefore, the relationship between parent and child is essential to an understanding of the essential concept of the Universal Father and of His love for His children. Therefore, being a parent, or acting as such, is a requirement in the experiential training of all ascending beings, whether human, midwayer, or seraphim; and none of them can ascend to Paradise, attain the Father, and be enrolled in the Corps of the Finality without first having passed through this experience.

**Ascending midwayers and evolutionary seraphim** <ins>do not reproduce, but they do acquire parenting experience</ins> by assisting the Material Sons and Daughters (Adams and Eves) of Jerusem in rearing and training their offspring. We mortal survivors will do the same if we were unable to experience parenthood on our own evolutionary world, unless we can compensate for such deficiencies in the Probationary Nursery (45.6.6) by acting as parents to our own children, if they are there, or to other children. To perform this work, we must petition the Melchizedeks and interrupt our ascent in the MMA and temporarily transfer to the Finaliter World. This service, if performed, may later be recognized on Jerusem, although we must supplement it in the families of the Material Sons and Daughters.

**To assess the experience of parenthood**, there are <ins>parental commissions</ins> on the First Mansion World from the various inhabited planets of the System. Specifically, <ins>the Urantia Parental Commission is made up of 12 pairs of parents, rotating every 10 years</ins>, who have gone through the experience of raising three or more children to the age of puberty. They are tasked with examining our parental experience and deciding whether we meet the requirements of that commission or whether we should continue training, as already indicated.

**We will have permission** <ins>to travel to Transition World No. 1</ins> (M. of the Finalists) (this, even if we do not have children there or the need to reinforce our parental experience) <ins>and we will also be able to visit the corresponding sector of Jerusem</ins>.

**Finally, in this 1st MMA** we must reach, at least, <ins>the level of the post-Adamic dispensation</ins> of the normal evolutionary worlds.

**76**

### Achievements in the Second Mansion World

**Achievements in the Second Mansion World (1)**

**From this world onwards**, everyone has a sea of glass (place of reception of transmissions, and landings)

**In this sphere we settle more fully,**

**And they start working:**

- The groupings of morontial life
- The working groups
- Social organizations and
- Communities, which reach their normal proportions. (?)

**We will create new social orders** and new government regulations.

**77**

**Achievements in the Second Mansion World (2)**

**We will eliminate intellectual conflicts** and mental disharmony

**We will increase our efforts** to master the meaning of the morontia mote

**We will complete the experience of life in the flesh**

**We will be able to travel to Transition World No. 2** (Morontia World) and the corresponding Jerusem sector.

**In this 2nd MMA we will reach**, at least, the intellectual level of the culture after the <ins>Master Son</ins> in the ideal evolutionary worlds.

**78**

### Achievements in the Third World of Mansions

**Achievements in the Third World of Mansions**

It is the **headquarters of the MMA Educators**, although they carry out their activity in the seven spheres of the mansions, and in the higher MMOs.

**We will begin more positive educational work** for the purpose of increasing understanding of the correlation between the morontia mote and mortal logic, the coordination of the morontia mote with human philosophy.

**We will have a good understanding of true metaphysics**, and we will begin to understand cosmic meanings and universal interrelations.

**We really begin the progressive morontial culture**

**We will achieve great personal and social achievements**

**From here we can go to MTr nº 3** (M. de los Ángeles).

**In this 3rd MMA we will reach** at least the level of the era after the bestowal of a Creator Son on a normal inhabited planet.

**79**

### Achievements in the Fourth Mansion World

**Achievements in the Fourth Mansion World (1)**

**In this fourth world, we will discover** our usefulness in group work and in the classroom activities of the morontia life. And we will be introduced to the demands and delights of social life.

**We will participate in activities** that will not be based on personal aggrandizement or selfish conquest.**

**We will seek a new social order** where sympathy, mutual appreciation, selfless love, and the shared motivation to achieve goals of worshipful and divine perfection prevail.

**We will achieve mastery of the UL language.**

**80**

**Achievements in the 4th Mansion World (2)**

**We will have a greater appreciation for broadcasts** and for other phases of culture and progress.

**We will become conscious of seeking God, finding Him, knowing Him, and revealing Him.**

**We will be able to visit Transition World No. 4**, which is the M. of the Brilliant Evening Stars Superangels and thanks to them we will experience a great closeness to the various orders of Sons of God during the visits to Jerusem.

The intellectual and social culture **of this 4th MMA** can be compared to the mental and social life of **the time after** the **<ins>Instructor Son</ins>** on planets that have a normal evolution.

**81**

### Achievements in the Fifth World of Mansions

**Achievements in the Fifth Mansion World (1)**

**In this world we will take** a huge step forward.

**It will be a real preview** of life in Jerusalem.

**We will begin to understand** the high destiny of the loyal evolutionary worlds

**We will be instructed** on the study worlds of the constellation and our preparation for our subsequent stay there will begin.

**We will perfect the language of Uversa**

**We will feel within ourselves** the true birth of a cosmic consciousness, a universal mentality, and an expansion of horizons.

**82**

**Achievements in the 5th Mansion World (2)**

**We will begin to glimpse** that a prodigious destiny awaits us in Paradise and to manifest genuine enthusiasm for the ascension to Havona.

**The study becomes voluntary**

**selfless or natural service**

**and spontaneous worship**

**We will visit Transition World No. 5** (M. of the Sons) and meet the various groups of divine affiliation in person.

**The culture of this 5th MMA** corresponds in general to the initial stage of the era of light and life on planets whose evolutionary progress is normal.

**83**

### Achievements in the Sixth Mansion World

**Achievements in the Sixth Mansion World**

**The Sovereign Assistant of the System** frequently visits this world

**The organization of society** in this world is of a high order

**We will continue preparing** for our stay in the constellation

**We will begin instruction** in universe administration and receive the first lessons covering all the affairs of an entire universe.

Our perfect fusion with the divine Adjuster takes place, that is, the union of the immortal evolving soul with the eternal divine Adjuster, a simple ceremony is performed, we are given a new name, and we are granted forty days of spiritual retirement from all routine activities in which to commune with ourselves, select one of the optional routes to Havona, and choose among the differential techniques available for attaining Paradise.

**The shadow of our mortal nature** diminishes more and more, and we will become more and more charming, as we move away from our animal origin.

**We will visit Transition World No. 6** (M. of Spirit) and there we will receive our first lessons relating to the future spirit career and learn more about the high spirits of the Superuniverse, although we cannot see many of them.

**We will reach a state** comparable to the high level of development that characterizes those evolutionary worlds that have normally progressed beyond the initial stage of light and life.

**84**

### Achievements in the Seventh Mansion World

**Achievements in the Seventh Mansion World**

**In this seventh MMA we will begin** the formation of classes to reside in Jerusalem, and for this we will receive the teaching of many educators, who will prepare us to leave, not as individuals, as we have done hundreds of times before, but as a group.

**We will get better prepared** for our stay in the Constellation

**We will be purified of all unfortunate inheritance**, of any unhealthy environment and of planetary material tendencies, eliminating any differences that come from a backward or advanced world.

**We will visit Transition World No. 7** (M. of the Father), and there we will begin a new, more spiritual worship of the invisible Father. On this Transition World, we will find the Temple of the Father, but we will not see the Father. We will also be permitted to visit the prison worlds of Satania surrounding this planet, where Lucifer and most of the personalities who followed him in his rebellion against Michael are currently confined.

**Within certain limits**, we can choose to stay in the 7th MMA in order to wait for someone who is behind to join us.

**Before we depart the 7th MMA** for Jerusem, <ins>with the status of residents or citizens</ins> of that world, we will be granted <ins>a new morontia form</ins> which, with minor changes, will accompany us for the remainder of our UL careers, until we emerge as first-phase spirits <ins>before</ins> our transport to the spirit-formation worlds of the Superuniverse. Therefore, we will no longer experience literal resurrections during our UL sojourn.

**To witness our departure** to Jerusalem as residents or citizens, <ins>there will be gatherings at the Sea of Glass</ins>.

**85**

### Achievements in Jerusem, the System's headquarters

**Achievements in Jerusem, the System's headquarters (1)**

**Upon our arrival**, virtually all of Jerusem will gather to welcome us.

**We will be able to carry the “harp of God,”** a morontia instrument that makes up for the maladaptation of our immature morontia sensory mechanism to the reception of space communications.

**We will enjoy a period of satisfaction** for the achievements made during the eight previous life experiences –Urantia and the 7 MMA-

**The final touches are being put** on our preparation for residing in the Constellation.

**We will speak 3 languages perfectly** (that of Satania, that of the UL and that of the SU).

**The Interpreters of Cosmic Citizenship** (Administrator Seraphim) will guide us and stimulate our appreciation for responsibility in the tasks of governing a universe.

**86**

**Achievements in Jerusem, the System's headquarters (2)**

**During our rest periods**, we will learn much by conversing with the Reserve Corps of the Administrator Seraphim, who are well-traveled and highly experienced.

We will share thoughts and establish very fraternal contacts with the Material Sons and Daughters, and we will observe and study their lifestyles and conduct. They will be our sponsors and mentors throughout our stay on Jerusem.

**We will be able to participate** in the representative government of Jerusem.

Our mortal personality, which began on the evolutionary worlds enshrined in a tabernacle of flesh—indwelt by an Adjuster and endued with the Spirit of Truth—is fully mobilized, realized, and unified on the day when, as citizens of Jerusem, we receive permission to go to Edentia and are proclaimed true members of the Morontia Corps of Nebadon and Paradise Ascenders.

**And what happens from now on** is that <ins>we enter the ...Fourth Stage of our Ascending Race</ins>

## MORONTIAL PROGRESSOR STAGE

**87**

**Throughout the three previous stages**, with our passage through Urantia, through the 7 MMA, through the transition spheres surrounding Jerusem and through the System capital itself, we will have acquired important baggage and perhaps even fused with our Adjuster, but we still have a long journey of progress through the morontia worlds of our Local Universe.

**Therefore, during this 4th stage** of our ascending career, we are classified as Morontia Progressors.

**88**

**Contents / Substages**

**During this 4th stage** we are going to get to know numerous worlds and experience important changes in our lives, so in the study of it, we are going to first make a brief reference to those worlds and those changes, and then, we are going to accommodate the contents of that study to our passage through the Constellation and the Local Universe, structuring it in 4 sub-stages.

**These will be the contents:**
1. Worlds we are going to know
2. Changes we are going to experience
3. Substages in the Norlatiadek Constellation:
4. One, in its formative worlds
5. And another in Edentia, the capital
6. Substages in the Local Universe of Nebadon:
7. One, in its formative worlds
8. And another in Salvington, the capital

**89**

### Worlds we are going to know

**Worlds we are going to know (1)**

**In the whole of this stage** as morontia Progressors, <ins>we are going to go through 1,262 architectural worlds</ins>:

**771 actually belong to the Norlatiadek Constellation:**
- 1 World, Edentia, which is the capital or headquarters of the Constellation,
- 70 primary worlds or satellites orbiting Edentia, and
- 700 secondary worlds or satellites that revolve around the 70 primary ones

**491 belong properly to the Local Universe of Nebadon**
- 1 World, Salvington, which is the capital or headquarters of the Local Universe, 7
- 70 primary worlds or satellites revolving around Salvington, and
- 420 secondary worlds or satellites, which revolve around the 70 primary ones

**And on all these worlds we will serve** in many capacities in association with our educators, and in company with our more advanced brethren. Throughout this morontia experience we will be the wards of the local universe.

Let's take a look at the distribution of these worlds in space.

**90**

**Worlds we are going to know (2)**

**The Norlatiadek Constellation** is made up of 100 Local Systems, among which I have highlighted, as you can see, number 24, which is the Satania System, where our evolutionary world Urantia is located.

**It is also made up** of a conglomeration of architectural worlds that constitute the capital city of Edentia and its formative worlds. We can see the latter better in the next slide.

**91**

**Worlds we are going to know (3)**

**Here we have it.**

**Edentia, the capital of Norlatiadek**, is surrounded by **70 satellites or primary worlds** that revolve around it, and each of these primary worlds is in turn surrounded by 10 satellites or secondary worlds that revolve around each of the primary worlds. In total, there are 700 secondary worlds, which together with the 70 primary worlds and the capital Edentia, add up to 771 architectural worlds in this Norlatiadek Constellation. All of these worlds are also educational or training worlds.

**92**

**Worlds we are going to know (4)**

**The Local Universe of Nebadon** is made up of 100 Constellations, among which I have highlighted number 70, which is the Constellation of Norlatiadek, of which the Satania System is a part, which, as we have already seen, is where our evolutionary world Urantia is located.

**It is also made up** of a conglomeration of architectural worlds that constitute the capital city of Salvington and its formative worlds. We can see the latter better in the next slide.

**93**

**Worlds we are going to know (5)**

**Herein.**

**Salvington, the capital of Nebadon**, is surrounded by <ins>10 groups of 7 primary worlds each</ins> that revolve in a circuit around Salvington, and <ins>each of these 70 primary worlds is in turn surrounded by 6 satellites or secondary worlds</ins> that revolve around each of the primary worlds. In total there are 420 secondary worlds, which together with the 70 primary worlds and the capital Salvington, add up to 491 architectural worlds in this UL of Nebadon. All these worlds are also educational or formative worlds.

**On this slide we can also see** the names of the celestial personalities who govern and administer each of the 10 groups of primary worlds.

**Likewise, we can appreciate** the place occupied by the first Sphere of the Melchizedek group of worlds, which is the pilot or receiving world, where we ascending mortals will arrive when we access the UL of Nebadon.

**94**

### Changes we are going to experience

**Changes we are going to experience**

**And we are going to experience 562 morontial changes** or adjustments:

**71 changes in the Norlatiadek Constellation:**
- One, in each primary world
- And another in Edentia, the capital

**491 changes in the UL** of Nebadon:
- One, in each world, whether primary or secondary
- And another in Salvington, the capital

**Note! We are talking about changes, not new lives** in a radical sense, where one has no awareness of one's previous life. <ins>We only have one conscious life: the one we receive here, along with our personality and identity</ins>. What changes is the state of that life and the circumstances in which it unfolds. In this stage of Morontia Progressors, not even our body or mind changes; they simply adjust them. And we do not lose consciousness either. Therefore, <ins>we are always the same personality and retain the memory of everything that was essential throughout our life</ins>.

**95**

Formative Worlds of the Constellation

**Formative Worlds of the Constellation (1)**

**We now begin the first sub-stage**: our journey through the formative worlds of the Constellation.

**And let's see, first**, <ins>some generalities</ins>, for example:

1. **That the time we shall spend** on the formative worlds of the Constellation, culminating in our sojourn on Edentia, will represent a period of true celestial happiness and the most tranquil of our ascending career until we attain Finaliter status.
2. **That we will be tuned** (that is, they will adjust us, they will make the necessary changes) each time we pass from one main cultural world to another, but we will retain the same morontial body,
3. **That our personality** <ins>will not suffer any period of unconsciousness</ins>.
4. **That on the formative worlds of the constellation**, we will have to make our evolving morontial personality truly sociable. Making ourselves truly sociable is the primary objective we must achieve in the Constellation.

**And to achieve this,**

<ins>IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO READ WHAT FOLLOWS</ins>, that's why I'm skipping it, <ins>but it's good to keep it in mind in case anyone has a question</ins>:

In [UB 43:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p8_6) (which is where I extracted what I indicate in section 4 of this slide) it says “_<ins>On the mansion worlds we had unified the evolving human personality</ins>; on the system capital we subjected our selves to the disciplines of collective activities and co-ordinated enterprises; but now, on the formative worlds of the constellation, we must make our evolving morontia personality truly sociable_.”

The underlining in the previous paragraph seems to contradict what is stated in the underlining in the following paragraph [UB 47:10.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p10_6) but this is not true, as I explain below.

[UB 47:10.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p10_6) _<ins>The mortal personality</ins> that began on the evolutionary worlds enclosed in a tabernacle of flesh—indwelt by a Mystery Monitor and endued with the Spirit of Truth—does not become fully mobilized, realized, and <ins>unified until that day when this Jerusemite is cleared for Edentia</ins>_ and proclaimed a true member of the morontia corps of Nebadon—an immortal survivor in association with his Adjuster, a Paradise ascendant, a personality of morontia standing, and a true son of the Most Highs.

**This contradiction is only apparent**, since <ins>the first of the cited paragraphs only refers to the unification of personality</ins>, while the second paragraph refers not only to unification, which could have been achieved earlier (on the mansion worlds), but <ins>to a broader set of actions, which also include the mobilization and realization of personality</ins>, and it is the entire set that is only achieved on Jerusem, before going to Edentia.

**96**

**Formative Worlds of the Constellation (2)**

**Progressive coexistence and learning schemes will be established throughout the 70 primary formative worlds of the Constellation.

**The Coexistence Scheme** will be as follows:
1. **In the first 7 worlds**, 1 ascending mortal will coexist with 10 univitatias
2. In the next 7 worlds, 2 ascending mortals will coexist with 10 univitatias
3. In the next 7 worlds, 3 ascending mortals will coexist with 10 univitatias
4. ...
5. And so on, until in the last 7 worlds, 10 mortals will live with 10 univitatias.
6. **But, in addition, these groups** will always associate and coordinate with other groups of 100 and 1,000 personalities.

**And with this scheme** of progressive coexistence,

**97**

**Formative Worlds of the Constellation (3)**

**We must obtain these achievements** in the training worlds:
1. **Living happily and working effectively**, both with 10 univitatias and with 10 other mortal beings, also different from us.
2. **To cooperate cheerfully, voluntarily**, cordially and effectively in close association with groups of 100 and 1,000 univitatias and 100 and 1,000 ascending mortals, adapting ourselves simultaneously to both.
3. **Achieve intellectual harmony and practical adjustment** with the two groups mentioned.
4. **Perfect intimate coexistence** with these similar and different beings, achieving a truly sociable personality and life, and experiencing less and less irritability and resentment.
5. **Promote the progressive coordination of the race** of ascension to Paradise.
6. **Increase our spiritual insight** by improving our ability to grasp eternal goals and meanings.

**98**

**Formative Worlds of the Constellation (4)**

**To conclude this first sub-stage**, I would like to highlight two key aspects of this training:
1. **In the intellectual, social and spiritual aspects**, the technique of associating people not only adds, but <ins>multiplies the potential for achievement</ins>.
2. **In our social relationships** with the univitatia of the Constellation, we will learn improved ethics that will impact our relationships with our fellow students who progress with us on the upward career ladder.

**99**

### Edentia, the capital of the Constellation

**Edentia, the capital of the Constellation**

**We now arrive at the second sub-stage**, which is our passage through Edentia, the headquarters of the Constellation.

1. In Edentia we will attend, for the first time, the **“assemblies of Paradise”**, and we will hear the story of his long career described by the Faithful of Days.
2. Our stay on Edentia and its spheres will be devoted primarily to **mastering collective ethics**, <ins>which is the secret of pleasant and beneficial social relations</ins> between the various orders of intelligent personalities.
3. We will also serve on Edentia in various capacities, primarily in connection with the Constellation's **program** which deals with collective, racial, national, and planetary well-being.
4. Throughout our stay on Edentia and its worlds, we will be “like angels”; we will constantly progress, but we will maintain a general and typical morontial state.
5. **Our entire Constellation experience** has as its primary objective <ins>the education of ascendants in adaptation to pre-spiritual social life. And it is analogous to the prefinaliter spiritual experience we shall have in Havona and to the pre-Absonite training we shall have on Paradise</ins>.
6. **Finally, on the day we are ready** to leave Edentia for a career on the spheres of Salvington, we will pause and look back on one of the most beautiful and refreshing times of all our formative periods on this side of Paradise.

**100**

Formative Worlds of the Local Universe

**Formative Worlds of the Local Universe (1)**

**When we complete the formation in the Constellation**, we will enter the formative worlds of the Local Universe, which is already the third substage of the four we proposed to analyze.
1. **And we will enter these formative worlds** by landing on the Melchizedek sphere, which is the pilot world of the circuit of spheres surrounding Salvington. This sphere is also the native world of the Melchizedek Sons and the common meeting point for all beings concerned with the education and spiritualization of ascending mortals of time and space.
2. **In this sphere we shall be** initiated into the regimen of disciplines and spiritual progression of the Salvington educational system.
3. **A large part of this educational training** is directed by patient and wise seraphim, aided by mortals who have reached relatively higher levels of universal attainment.
4. **But a highly specialized group of Melchizedeks**, in association with Trinity Teacher Sons, are the ones who supervise our progressive morontia career.
5. **In reality, the entire educational system of UL** is sponsored by the Melchizedek Sons and is practical, progressive, and experiential; it embraces instruction in material, intellectual, morontia, and spiritual matters.

**101**

**Formative Worlds of the Local Universe (2)**

6. **In this Melchizedek sphere are**, among others:
  1. **The schools of universal administration and wisdom**
  2. **Schools dedicated to a single line of research** (energy, matter, organization, communication, archives, ethics...)
  3. **The Melchizedek Faculty of Spiritual Endowment**, exclusive throughout the UL, where all orders of Sons of God cooperate with the Melchizedeks and the seraphic educators in the educational training of the <ins>Evangels of Destiny</ins> (**).
  4. **The Faculty of Higher Ethics**, presided over by Father Melchizedek, where the highest training course in universal administration is taught.
7. **While we reside on this Melchizedek sphere and on the other primary spheres**, we will also be trained on their respective six surrounding satellites of specialized education. And this same method will be applied during our sojourn on the seventy primary spheres of the Salvington circuit.

It is not essential to read the following, but it is good to know.

(**) The Evangelists of Destiny are those who go forth to proclaim spiritual freedom and divine sonship even to the distant worlds of the universe. This particular faculty of Melchizedek University is an exclusive institution of the universe; student visitors from other realms are not admitted here.

**102**

**Formative Worlds of the Local Universe (3)**

8. **As far as we are concerned**, the 6 tributary satellites of the Melchizedek sphere, or Pilot World, are engaged in the following <ins>special phases of study</ins>:
  - **Satellite No. 1 is concerned** with reviewing our <ins>early planetary life</ins>. We will conduct this review together with mortals from Urantia.
  - **No. 2 deals** with a similar review of the <ins>experiences lived in the MMA</ins>.
  - **The revisions of satellite no. 3** are related to our stay in Jerusem, and in its 7 Transition Worlds.
  - **The 4th satellite** of the Melchizedek sphere is concerned with reviewing <ins>our experiences on the seventy primary worlds of the constellation and their associated spheres</ins>.
  - **On the 5th satellite**, <ins>our stay on the constellation's host world</ins> is reviewed.
  - **And on satellite no. 6**, an attempt is made to <ins>correlate these five epochs and thus achieve a coordination of experience, in preparation for entering the Melchizedek primary schools of universal training</ins>.

**103**

**Formative Worlds of the Local Universe (4)**

9. **In the previous 3 slides** we have referred primarily to the Melchizedek Sphere and its 6 satellites, but we must also mention the remaining six primary spheres of the group ruled by the Melchizedeks, which are dedicated to the following:
  - **The 2nd: to physical life and living energies**
  - **The 3rd: to the morontial life**
  - **The 4th: to the initial spiritual life**
  - **The 5th: to the intermediate spiritual life**
  - **The 6th: to the advanced spiritual life**
  - **The 7th: to coordinated and supreme self-realization**

**104**

**Formative Worlds of the Local Universe (5)**

10. **Of our passage through the second group** of 7 primary spheres and their 42 secondary ones, which are governed by the Vorondadek Sons, we are only told:
  - **That each sphere** and its corresponding 6 satellites, deal with a special phase of Vorondadeks activities.
  - **That in these worlds** we will reach the pinnacle of our education on UL legislation.
  - **That under the tutelage of the oldest Vorondadeks**, we will participate in the promulgation of the general legislation of the universe, aimed at the coordination of the legislation of the different constellations
  - **That the progressive education** we will receive in the Vorondadeks schools, in terms of legislation, is unsurpassed even on Uversa.
  - **And finally we are told** that in this group of worlds we will begin new activities, but incomprehensible to us due to the lack of references with which any analogy can be established.

**105**

**Formative Worlds of the Local Universe (6)**

11. **In the group of 49 Lanonandek spheres**:
  - **There are the administrative schools** of the UL, which are supervised by Lanonandek Sons who have long experience as sovereigns of the systems and as advisors to the constellations.
  - **These ancient sovereigns** of the systems <ins>will be our administrative instructors</ins> and they will also be instructors of the angelic hosts.
  - **When we were in Jerusalem** we were able to observe the work of the administrators, but now, on these Lanonandek spheres, <ins>we will be able to participate in the coordination of the administrative declarations</ins> of the 10,000 local systems of Nebadon.

**106**

**Formative Worlds of the Local Universe (7)**

12. **Of the remaining seven groups** of Salvington architectural worlds, we are not told what we will learn. However, I want to highlight a few things about these worlds:
  - **From the group of worlds of the Life Carriers** we are told the name of each of the 7 main spheres and something about the role that is performed in them and in their satellites, so it is assumed that our training in those worlds has something to do with those activities, but nothing is specified.
  - **Of the group of 49 Finality spheres** we are told that they are the meeting point for personalities from the superuniverses and the Central Universe who may be on missions in Nebadon, but no other details of our apprenticeship are given. We are even told that these worlds will be the ones where we will encounter the greatest limitations on our free movement.
  - **Of the spheres ruled** by the <ins>Brilliant Evening Stars</ins>, we are told that the satellites of the first three primary worlds are consecrated to the schools of the Teaching Sons and the Evening Stars, while the satellites of the next three primary worlds are consecrated to the training of ascending mortals, but we are not told what training we shall receive there.
  - **Nor do we find out what training** we shall receive <ins>on the Archangel Worlds</ins>, though we are told that these are dedicated to furthering our upward career and to the task of our survival, and in this connection indicating that the Archangel Worlds are occupied by the immense corps of personality recorders who preserve our personality records and the guarantees of our identity during the period between physical death and repersonalization, and who keep in order the history of each of us from the time of our birth until we leave Salvington.
  - **And concerning our passage** <ins>through the worlds of the Spirit-Fused Mortals</ins>, we are only told that there we shall enjoy many pleasant and beneficial stays, as guests of the residents of those worlds.

**Well, that's all the information** revealed to us about our journey through the formative worlds of the UL. But to complete the Morontia Progressors stage, we still have to pass through Salvington.

**107**

### Salvington, the capital of Nebadon

**Salvington, the capital of Nebadon**

**Well, we're already on Salvington**, but we're also given virtually nothing about the learning we'll receive there. I'll just highlight the following:
1. **That the entire universe is one vast school**. <ins>On Salvington are located the schools of the Melchizedeks, the colleges of the Universe Sons, the seraphic universities, and the schools of the Teacher Sons and the Union of Days</ins>. And this is so because every possible provision is made to train the various personalities of the universe for higher service and better activity.
2. **We are told that before we leave** the UL of Nebadon we will be given the opportunity to serve for a more or less long period <ins>as members of the Corps of Celestial Supervisors of Nebadon</ins>.
3. **We are told that we may participate** <ins>in the secular training program directed by the Teacher Sons</ins>, which extends from the planetary courses to the Higher College of Wisdom, located on Salvington, and that those who complete these adventures in wisdom and truth will be granted recognition for their efforts and achievements.
4. **During our stay in the UL**, <ins>we will be satisfied in all our longings or true intellectual, artistic and social ambitions</ins> that may have characterized our material or morontial planes of existence.
5. **And just before we leave the headquarters of the UL** for the receiving worlds of the minor sectors of the Superuniverse, we will acquire a true spirit identity. Mind, personality, and character remain unchanged with this advancement; only form undergoes modification. But the spirit form is as real as the morontia body, and is just as perceptible.
6. **Obviously, on Salvington** are <ins>the personal presences of Michael and the Divine Minister</ins>, and it is to be assumed that, in some way, we will come into contact with them. In fact, before leaving UL, <ins>we will receive spiritual confirmation from the Creator Son and the Mother Spirit</ins>. And from this moment on, our status will be forever established, for we will pass to the stage of Wards of the Superuniverse, and no soul who has reached the Superuniverse has ever been lost.

## SUPERUNIVERSE PUPIL STAGE

**108**

We are now going to address the study of our time as Wards of the Superuniverse, but before doing so, I wish to emphasize here something that I find very gratifying and beautiful; and that is that Orvonton, the seventh Superuniverse to which our Local Universe of Nebadon and, therefore, we belong, is characterized principally by its extraordinary and generous bestowal of mercy upon the mortals of time. It is celebrated for the manner in which justice tempered by mercy prevails, and where a power conditioned by patience dominates, while abundant sacrifices of time are made to assure the stabilization of eternity. Orvonton is a universal demonstration of the love and mercy of the Universal Father.

**Let's get started**

**109**

### Worlds / Substages

**Worlds / Substages**

**This fifth stage**, called the Pupils of the Superuniverse, includes our passage and progress through 570 architectural worlds of spiritual development:
- 8 that belong to the Minor Sector of Ensa
- 71 that are part of the Greater Spandon Sector, and
- 491 who are from the Superuniverse of Orvonton

**We will also pass** through the remaining 9 Major Sectors of the Superuniverse of Orvonton, but since they do not indicate the organizational structure of their architectural worlds, I have not included that number of worlds in this slide. Had these Major Sectors had a world structure similar to that of Splandon, we would pass through 639 (71 worlds x 9 Major Sectors = 639) more worlds.

**110**

**Worlds / Substages (2)**

**Therefore**, we are going to study this stage in three sub-stages:
1. that of the Minor Sector
2. the Major Sector
3. and that of the Superuniverse

**111**

**Our passage through the Minor Sector**

**We begin the first sub-stage** of our journey as Wards of the Superuniverse, with our passage through the <ins>Minor Sector</ins>

1. **As you may recall**, before leaving Salvington, we received spiritual confirmation from Michael of Nebadon and the Divine Minister. We will then be transferred to the pilot world of the Minor Sector of Ensa, where we will enter as first-phase or first-degree spirits.

**Let's see a schematic representation of Ensa's Minor Sector.**

**112**

### Our passage through the Minor Sector

**Our passage through the Minor Sector**

1. **The Minor Sector of Ensa** is made up of 100 Local Universes, among which I have highlighted number 84, which is our Local Universe, that of Nebadon, which includes the Norlatiadek Constellation and the Satania System, which is where our evolutionary world Urantia is located.
2. **At the center of this Minor Sector** lies its headquarters or capital, called Umenor the Third, around which seven architectural formative worlds revolve. We can see this last point better in the next slide.

**113**

**Our passage through the Minor Sector**

**Here we have it**

1. **Umenor the Third**, the capital of Ensa, is surrounded by seven training or educational worlds that revolve around it. One of these worlds will be the pilot world where we will land, but we are not told which one. There are eight architectural worlds in this Minor Sector of Ensa.
2. **The government of the Minor Sector**, which is headquartered in the capital, is presided over by three Recents of Days, Supreme Personalities of the Trinity, whom we will have the opportunity to meet; and its administration is primarily concerned with:
  1. of the control, unification and physical stabilization of the Sector; and also
  2. to coordinate the administration of the approximately 100 local universes that comprise it.
3. **Umenor the Third is also** the great meeting point **of the 7 orders of Master Physical Controllers**, who reside in the 7 spheres of instruction surrounding the capital.
4. **These spheres are dedicated** to the higher physical studies of ascending life and are the centers where physical and administrative knowledge related to the Master Universe is taught.
5. **And in them we will continue** our studies and experiences, related to the activities of:
  1. Of the Supreme Power Centers of the superuniverses and
  2. Of the seven orders of Master Physical Controllers.

**114**

**Our passage through the Minor Sector**

1. **Well, now** we're continuing on the same slide we started on. And to complete it, we'll add the most essential part of what we've already said:
2. **That the seven educational spheres** surrounding the capital Umenor the Third, are the seats of the Master Physical Controllers,
3. **That these spheres are dedicated** to the higher physical studies of ascending life.
4. *And that in them we will learn* physical and administrative knowledge related to the Master Universe.

**Apart from this, no other information** is provided regarding our time, learning, or experience in the Ensa Minor Sector.

**So we're off** to the training worlds of the Major Sector.

**115**

### Our time in the Greater Sector

**Our time in the Greater Sector**

**We will continue the second substage** as Pupils of the Superuniverse, but now <ins>with our passage through the Major Sector</ins>.

1. We will be taken to the pilot world of the Greater Splandon Sector, but already accredited as second-stage or second-grade spirits. We are not told which pilot world we will be arriving at.
2. Let's look at a schematic representation of Splandon's Major Sector.

**116**

**Our time in the Greater Sector**

1. **The Major Sector of Splandon** is made up of 100 Minor Sectors, among which I have highlighted number 3, which is our Minor Sector of Ensa (which we have just passed through), of which the Local Universe of Nebadon is a part (as we have already seen), which is to which our world Urantia belongs.
2. **In the center of this Major Sector** is its headquarters or capital, which is called Umayor la Quinta, around which 70 architectural formative worlds revolve.
3. **We can see this last bit better in the next slide.

**117**

**Our time in the Greater Sector**

**Here we have it**

1. **Umayor the Fifth**, the capital of Splandon, is surrounded by 70 worlds of advanced intellectual training, which revolve around it. There are 71 architectural worlds in this Major Sector of Splandon.
2. **The government of this _Sector_** is headquartered in the capital and presided over by **three Perfections of Days**, who are Supreme Personalities of the Trinity, whom we will soon have occasion to meet. And we will not only meet these three Perfections of Days of our Major Sector of Splandon, because although we will only be registered in this Sector, <ins>we will have to pass, as we have already said, through each of the ten major sectors of our Superuniverse. Thus, we will meet the thirty Perfections of Days of Orvonton before reaching its capital, Uversa.</ins>
3. **The work of this government** is mainly related to the intellectual state of this Major Sector.
4. **The seventy satellites** of Umayor la Quinta are dedicated to our higher education and intellectual development of a superuniversal type.
5. **On Umayor the Fifth** sages from all over Orvonton gather, working tirelessly to prepare us ascending mortals for our subsequent progress to Havona and Paradise. The greater part of this training is accomplished on the seventy training worlds of the Major Sector.
6. **Finally, let me say** that the Perfections of the Days of our Major Sector will personally administer a collective oath to the ascending graduates of the schools of said Sector.

**118**

**Our time in the Greater Sector**

1. **Now we continue with the same slide** already started in this second sub-stage. And to complete it, I've once again added the most essential part of what I've already said:
2. **That the 70 satellites surrounding** the capital Umayor la Quinta are dedicated to our higher education and intellectual development.
3. **That sages from all Orvonton** assemble on Umayor the Fifth to prepare the program of ascending mortals for their progress to Havona and Paradise.
4. **That the Perfections of the Days** of our Greater Sector will, in person, collectively swear in the ascending graduates of the schools of the Greater Sector.

**And regarding our passage through the Major Sector**, we are no longer given any further information.

**So now we go** directly to the formative worlds of the Superuniverse.

**119**

### Our Journey Through the Superuniverse

**Our passage through the Superuniverse**

**We will finally reach the third and final substage** as Pupils of the Superuniverse of Orvonton, and we will land on the pilot world of the training worlds surrounding Uversa, the capital or headquarters.
1. We will arrive here as third-stage or third-degree spirits. And in this case, too, we are not told which pilot world we will land on.
2. Let us now look at a possible schematic representation of the Superuniverse of Orvonton.

**120**

**Our passage through the Superuniverse**

1. **The Superuniverse of Orvonton** is made up of 10 major sectors, among which we can distinguish or highlight number 5, which is our Major Sector of Splandon, of which the Minor Sector of Ensa and the Local Universe of Nebadon, where Urantia is located, are part.
2. **The Superuniverse of Orvonton** is also comprised of a conglomeration of architectural worlds that constitute the capital Uversa and its formative worlds. The latter can be best appreciated in the following slide.

**121**

**Our passage through the Superuniverse**

**Here we have it**

1. **Uversa, the capital of Orvonton**, is the spiritual and administrative headquarters for nearly a billion inhabited or habitable worlds. Its glory, grandeur, and perfection surpass all the wonders of the space-time creations.
2. **It is directly surrounded** by 7 groups of spheres, which constitute the 7 higher universities of advanced spiritual teaching for ascending mortals.
3. **Each of these 7 universities or groups of spheres is made up of 70 specialized worlds**, containing thousands upon thousands of institutions and organizations dedicated to universal education and spiritual culture, where pilgrims of time like ourselves will be re-educated and re-examined for our long journey to Havona.
4. **The total number of formative worlds is 490**, which together with the capital Uversa, make a total of 491 architectural worlds in this Superuniverse of Orvonton.
5. **The Superuniverse of Orvonton**, headquartered on Uversa, is jointly governed by three Ancients of Days, Supreme Personalities of the Trinity, whom we will have occasion to meet upon our arrival at the capital. **We will probably also meet** the high personalities who, with the Ancients of Days, serve on the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial bodies of the Superuniverse, but we are not informed that these personalities are directly involved in our educational training.
6. We will also meet an astonishing group of beings called abandontarians, permanent citizens of Uversa, with characteristics similar to the Univitatia of the Constellation in terms of “artistic ability, social adaptability and coordinating ingenuity”, and who administer the routine affairs of Uversa, under the direct supervision of the <ins>Corps of Son-Fused Mortals</ins>, located on that world.
7. **The educational regime of the Superuniverse** is not the same for all ascending mortals. We will receive the same general education, but there will be groups and classes that take special or specific training courses. We will also be prepared to face the challenge of entering the universities of the 7 circuits of Havona. As you may have noticed, we are not clearly told who **our instructors** will be throughout our journey throughout the Superuniverse of Orvonton, although logic leads me to believe that our learning is especially entrusted to the Tertiary Seconaphim, as they are the most closely associated with us, and, to a lesser extent, to the Primary and Secondary Seconaphim, who are occasionally appointed to serve as our instructors.
8. **Finally, before we depart the Superuniverse** for Havona, we will receive a thorough course in Superuniverse administration, similar to that which we received in Local Universe administration during our morontia experience. This is because before we depart for Havona, we must possess **mastery of Local and Superuniverse administration**, although this will not be our exclusive occupation. It seems that this training is wise and necessary in view of our possible future destiny as members of the Corps of the Finality.

**122**

**Our passage through the Superuniverse**

1. **We're once again continuing with the slide** we started for this third and final substage. And to complete it, we're adding the most essential part:
2. **That Uversa is surrounded** by 7 higher universities, each consisting of 70 worlds of advanced spiritual teaching for ascending mortals.
3. *That the educational system* contains general teaching and special or specific teaching.
4. **That our instructors** will be the Tertiary Seconaphim in particular. But we will also be instructed by the Havona Servitals (who belong to the 1st Division of the Space Messenger Hosts).
5. **That before proceeding to Havona** we will have attained mastery in the administration of the Local Universe and the Superuniverse and will have prepared ourselves to enter the universities of the 7 Havona Circuits.

**And with this we will complete the stage** of Superuniverse Wards and will be ready to begin the...

## HAVONA PILGRIMS STAGE

**123**

**When we have completed** the maximum spiritual development that we can attain in the Superuniverse, we ascending mortals will be prepared for the long flight to Havona.

**124**

**Contents**

**The study of this stage** will be divided into three blocks:

1. First, let us examine some generalities concerning the circuits and worlds of Havona.
2. Secondly, we are going to learn some generalities related to our passage through Havona.
3. And finally, we will learn about our steps and achievements in each of the seven circuits of Havona.

**Let's get started.**

**125**

### Generalities regarding the circuits and worlds of Havona

**Generalities regarding the circuits and worlds of Havona**

1. **On this 6th Stage**, the Havona Pilgrim Stage, we are going to pass through the billion educational worlds of the Central Universe, which are arranged along 7 concentric circuits. Here they can be seen represented in those 7 circles of different colors. On the first circuit, that is, the innermost (the orange one), there are more than 35 million worlds; on the second circuit (the red one) there are more than 70 million worlds; on the third (the blue one) there are more than 105 million worlds. Maintaining this same increase of more than 35 million worlds on each of the remaining circuits up to the outermost or seventh, where there are more than 245 million worlds, we would obtain the approximate sum of the billion worlds indicated above. These 7 Havona circuits directly surround the three Paradise satellite circuits. The outermost of these three circuits is that of the 7 sacred spheres of the Infinite Spirit. Next inward is that of the 7 sacred spheres of the Eternal Son, and the innermost of all is that of the 7 sacred spheres of the Father. Collectively, they are called the 21 Sacred Spheres of Paradise. And at the center of all these circuits is Paradise.
2. **<ins>We now return to the 7 circuits of Havona</ins>**, <ins>to say that each circuit is permeated by one of the Seven Circuit Spirits</ins>, who are the joint impersonal creation and representation of the Infinite Spirit and the Seven Master Spirits, the latter acting collectively. The Circuit Spirits coordinate the conduct of celestial affairs on their respective circuits.
3. **On these Havona planetary circuits** their worlds succeed one another in an <ins>orderly linear procession</ins>. **The entire central universe** and the three circuits of sacred spheres revolve clockwise around the stationary Paradise on a single plane composed of ten concentric units which, physically, form a single system; they are separated only by their functional and administrative differences.
4. **The planetary construction** of the Havona spheres is entirely different from that of the evolutionary worlds and systems of space. It is inappropriate to use such enormous spheres as inhabited worlds anywhere else in the Grand Universe. These Havona worlds have a threefold energy organization, called “triata,” in contrast to the twofold energy organization of the superuniverses, which is called “gravita.” Now, this “triata” physical organization, coupled with the balancing effect of the immense dark gravitational bodies surrounding Havona, makes it possible to perfectly equalize the physical forces and exquisitely balance the diverse attractive forces of this extraordinary creation.
5. **The force of antigravity** is also used to organize the material functions and spiritual activities of these enormous worlds. Note! This last point seems to contradict what is stated in 9.3.3, which states that antigravity “_only works in relation to material gravity._”
6. **The architecture, lighting, and heating,** as well as the biological and artistic beautification of the Havona spheres, completely surpass the greatest efforts of human imagination. Each of these planets is an original, <ins>unique</ins>, and exclusive <ins>creation</ins>; each planet is a peerless, magnificent, and perfect work of planetary existence in the physical, intellectual, and spiritual aspects. Each of these billion perfect worlds has been developed and beautified according to the plans of the Eternal of Days, who directs and administers each of these worlds. And this is the reason why no two worlds are alike.
7. **In the Central Universe** <ins>there is no need for government</ins>. Havona is so exquisitely perfect that it needs no government. <ins>Nor are there regularly constituted courts</ins>, <ins>nor legislative assemblies</ins>;
8. <ins>Havona requires only</ins> one administrative direction, which is vested in the <ins>Eternals of Days</ins>, one of whom resides on each sphere. The Eternals of Days are supreme Trinity personalities; they are not creators, but they are perfect administrators. They teach with supreme ability and direct their planetary children with a wisdom so perfect as to border on absoluteness.
9. **Havona is the home** of the <ins>model personality</ins> for all mortal types, and it is also the home of all superhuman personalities associated with mortals who are not natives of the time creations.
10. **These worlds provide the stimulus** for all human impulses to reach out toward the attainment of true spiritual values on the highest conceivable levels of reality. <ins>Havona is the preparatory educational goal of all ascending mortals, and our objective will be to become truly perfected spirits.</ins>

**126**

### Overview of our time in Havona

**Generalities of our passage through Havona (1)**

1. **The journey from Uversa** to the first receiving sphere of Havona is always made alone.
2. **Therefore, before leaving Uversa** our guardian seraphim will bid us farewell, and <ins>most of them, though not all</ins>, will proceed to Seraphington, which is the destination of the angels of the grand universe, to begin there a long and intensive training, with the hope of later joining us in Paradise.
3. **After bidding farewell** to our guardian seraphim, the Transport Personalities of the Order of Primary Seconaphim, operating from the headquarters of the seven superuniverses, will conduct us beyond the dark gravity bodies to the outer circuit of Havona.
4. **And we will arrive at the pilot world** of that outer circuit, which is the seventh.
5. **Our arrival in Havona** will be broadcast to Salvington—the headquarters of our UL—and communicated to our guardian seraphim, wherever they may be.

**127**

**Generalities of our passage through Havona (2)**

6. **During our stay in Havona**, we will be permitted to <ins>freely visit</ins> the circuit worlds to which we are assigned. We will also be able to return to the planets of the Havona circuits we have traversed. All this will be possible without having to be transported by supernaphim. We time pilgrims will be able to equip ourselves to traverse “conquered” space, but we will have to depend on established techniques for crossing “unconquered” space; a pilgrim cannot leave Havona or advance beyond his assigned circuit without the aid of a Supernaphim Transporter.
7. **When we are in Havona**, we will spend most of our “vacation” in Ascendington, where we will be engaged in thousands of activities beyond our imagination.
8. **In each of the 7 circuits** or circles of Havona, a <ins>precise achievement</ins> will be required of us.
9. **And finally, in the first circle**, before leaving for Paradise, we will become <ins>perfected spirits</ins>.

THERE IS AN ANALOGY BETWEEN THESE 7 CIRCLES OF PROGRESS IN HAVONA AND THE 7 CIRCLES OF HUMAN PROGRESS, which can be easily observed by comparing them.

10. **As we advance from circuit to circuit** in Havona, we will not only have to cope with <ins>unimaginable changes</ins>, but our wonder will grow ever greater as we progress from planet to planet within each circuit. Each of these billion study worlds is a veritable university of surprises, and on them we will experience continual wonder, unending admiration. Monotony is not part of the Havona career.

**128**

**Generalities of our passage through Havona (3)**

11. **During our long sojourn** on the billion culture worlds of the Central Universe, we shall develop an <ins>eternal friendship</ins> with the Havona Natives (who are the direct creations of the Paradise Trinity). And from this profound friendship, both groups shall derive <ins>profound mutual benefit</ins>, for we mortals shall amply compensate for the spiritual impoverishment of our earlier stages of human progression, and the Havona Natives shall acquire with us an experience which far outweighs the handicap of having always lived a life of divine perfection.
12. **Our instructors will be Secondary Supernaphim**, citizens of Paradise, originating from the Master Spirit presiding over the Superuniverse of Orvonton, but ministering on the seven circuits of Havona. On each circuit, an order of Secondary Supernaphim instructs, as we shall presently see. We will <ins>also be instructed by volunteers from the Corps of Mortal Finaliters</ins>, who accompany the Secondary Supernaphim in their ministry in Havona (according to an agreement in force since the completion of the first group of finaliters).
13. **From our arrival in Havona**, we will no longer receive instruction in classes or groups, but our education will be personal, individual, and will be, from beginning to end, of a threefold nature: intellectual, spiritual, and experiential.
14. **Circle after circle**, during the inward journey through Havona, worship will be a growing passion.
15. **The desire for adventure and the stimulus of curiosity** will not disappear from us until we have traversed the last circuit of Havona and visited the last of its worlds. But then a new stimulus will appear within us, the onward urge of eternity.

**129**

### Our passage through the seventh circuit

**Our passage through the seventh circuit (1)**

**Well, let's see** what our first steps will be after arriving in Havona.

1. **The first act of our Havona career** after landing on the seventh circuit pilot world will be to acknowledge and thank our Second-Range Transporter for a long and safe journey.
2. **Then we will be welcomed by a Graduate Guide** (who belongs to the 7th Division of the Higher Personalities of the Infinite Spirit), who will accompany us throughout our entire career on the Havona circuits, and will introduce us to our instructors.
3. **Next, we will register** our arrival and prepare our message of thanksgiving and worship, which will be sent to Michael of Nebadon. This concludes the formalities of arrival in Havona.
4. **And then we will be granted** a long period of leisure to observe freely.
5. **This will provide us** with the opportunity to visit our friends, colleagues and associates from our long ascension experience.
6. **We can also consult** the transmissions to find out who the companions are who have departed for Havona since we left Uversa. This last point suggests that the journey to Havona is very long.

**130**

**Our passage through the seventh circuit (2)**

7. **When we land on the first pilot world** of Havona, we will arrive with only one kind of perfection – _<ins>the perfection of purpose (to go onward)</ins>_. That perfection of purpose, our desire to attain the Father, and the firmness of our faith are what secured our entry into the Central Universe of Havona.
8. **And from there**, with the teaching that the first Order of Secondary Supernaphim (who are the **Helpers of the Pilgrims**) will provide us,
9. *ins We must begin the work* of developing the perfection of understanding and the technique of comprehension, which are so indispensable
10. **To achieve the goal** of <ins>perfecting our personality</ins>.

**131**

**Our passage through the seventh circuit (3)**

11. **The Pilgrims' Helpers** direct their work for ascending mortals in three main divisions:
  1. **The Supreme Understanding of the Paradise Trinity**
  2. **The spiritual understanding of the Father-Son partnership**
  3. **The intellectual recognition of the Infinite Spirit.**

**Each of these phases** of teaching is divided and subdivided into numerous classifications.

**This is the primary or elemental course** we must confront in Havona. A course that is quantitative, qualitative, and experiential; and also intellectual, spiritual, and supreme.

**132**

**Our passage through the seventh circuit (4)**

12. **As soon as our secondary supernaphim associate** deems us fit to pass into the next circle, we shall be taken before the twelve Adjutants of the Seventh Spirit of the Circuits (Each Havona Circuit Spirit has twelve Adjutants, who, collectively, are called the Twelfth Adjutants of the Havona Circuits.)
13. **Here we will be asked** to pass the tests of this seventh circle, which will be determined according to the superuniverse of our origin and the system where we were born.
14. **The divine conquest of this circle** will take place on the pilot world, and consists of <ins>the spiritual recognition and understanding of the Master Spirit of our Superuniverse</ins>.

**When the work of the outer circle of Havona is completed** and the course offered has been passed, the Pilgrim Helpers will take us to the pilot world of the next circle and entrust us to the care of the Supremacy Guides. The Pilgrim Helpers will remain for a time to help make the transfer both pleasant and beneficial.

**136**

### Our passage through the sixth circuit

**Our passage through the sixth circuit (1)**

1. **When we are transferred to the sixth circle of Havona** we arrive as <ins>4th phase or 4th degree spirits,</ins> we are called _<ins>“spiritual graduates”</ins>_, and we are placed under the direct supervision of the <ins>Guides of Supremacy</ins>.
2. On this circle we will achieve a better understanding of God the Supreme. During our long ascension career through the evolutionary universes, we will have experienced the growing awareness of an almighty supercontrol of the space-time creations. Here on this Havona circuit, although we may not perceive the personal presence of God the Supreme residing in this Central Universe, we will nevertheless experience transformative growth, which entails:
  1. A new integration of your consciousness,
  2. A greater understanding of your purpose, and
  3. A greater sensitivity to their divinity.

**It seems as if God the Supreme** lovingly bestows upon us, to the very limits of our experiential capacities, those increases in intellectual understanding, spiritual insight, and personality extension which we shall so need to penetrate to the level of the eternal and existential Deities of Paradise.

**134**

**Our passage through the sixth circuit (2)**

3. **When the Guides of Supremacy** deem us ripe for advancement to the 5th Circle, they will bring us before the Commission of Seventy, a mixed group (not mentioned elsewhere in the UB) that acts as examiners on the pilot world of circuit number six. This Commission will evaluate our understanding of the Supreme Being and the Trinity of Supremacy. (The Trinity of Supremacy is the function of the Paradise Trinity in relation to finite reality.)
4. **When the result of this evaluation** is satisfactory, we will receive confirmation that we can be transferred to the fifth circuit of Havona.

**135**

### Our passage through the fifth circuit

**Our passage through the fifth circuit (1)**

1. **In this fifth circle** we will be _<ins>“candidates for the adventure of the Deity”</ins>_ and thus we will be called.
2. **The Trinity Guides** will be our instructors in this circle. These Secondary Supernaphim are most faithful and effective; each of us will receive the exclusive attention of one of them (who will be our associate), and will enjoy his undivided affection. We would never find the Infinite Spirit were it not for the aid of these guides and the host of other spirit beings who will undertake to instruct us in the nature and technique of the adventure of approaching Deity.
3. **All of them will provide us** with an advanced teaching on the divine Trinity,
4. **as preparation so that we may** <ins>recognize the personality of the Infinite Spirit, which is the goal of this circle</ins>.
5. **But this won't be easy**. Here we will understand the meaning of true study and the genuine mental and spiritual effort we must make to achieve this lofty goal.

**136**

**Our passage through the fifth circuit (2)**

6. **But the Infinite Spirit is not found** in this fifth circle of Havona, and therefore a transportation trio (consisting of our Trinity Guide, a Graduate Guide, and his ever-present Servital associate) will temporarily transport us to Paradise and render us all possible assistance in finding, knowing, and understanding the Infinite Spirit sufficient to recognize his personality, which, as we have just seen, is the objective to be accomplished on this fifth circle.
7. **On this journey we will also have the opportunity** to discern the geographical or localized presence of the <ins>spiritual luminosity of the Trinity</ins>, even though we cannot yet understand the spiritual presence of the Father and the Son.
8. **After completing the training of this fifth circuit**, the Trinity Guides will take us to the pilot world and present us before one of the many commissions that function to examine and declare fit candidates for the Deity adventure. <ins>These commissions are composed of three members</ins>: a fellow Finaliter, one of the Directors of Conduct (who belong to the order of Primary Supernaphim), and a Solitary Messenger from space or a Trinitized Son of Paradise.
9. **If we successfully complete** the search for the Infinite Spirit and our passage through all the worlds of this circle, which will be the most common, the Trinity Guides will transfer us to the fourth circle of Havona.

**137**

**Our passage through the fifth circuit (3)**

10. **Some candidates**, very few, do not attain the Infinite Spirit and suffer a delay because of this apparent failure in the Deity venture. In reality, everything seems to indicate that there is some good and sufficient reason for these apparent failures; and that they are simply unavoidable delays.
11. **Those who pass through this situation** of apparent failure are placed under the jurisdiction of the Paradise Assignment Chiefs of the Primary Supernaphim order and are forwarded directly to the second circle of Havona (they are “promoted,” bypassing the fourth and third circles), where they will long receive the aid and comfort of the Counselors and Advisors, the Secondary Supernaphim serving on that second circle.
12. **And after that long time they will be returned**, for a period of not less than a thousand years, to the work of the realms of space, not, however, to the superuniverse of their origin, but to that which is most favorable for their preparation to overcome their previous failure. In this return to the worlds of space they are never alone, but are accompanied by either their Guardian Seraphim or a Paradise Companion. One who never accompanies them is their mortal associate if they have been successful on the Deity career, for such an accomplice is not permitted. This mortal associate may await them on Paradise until the companion returns to Havona and succeeds in his Deity encounter.
13. **After this, they return to Havona**, to the same circle in which they supposedly failed, and, in the company of the same instructors and guides who previously attended them, they resume their work of preparation to once again face the Deity adventure. And this second adventure always culminates in success.

**138**

### Our passage through the fourth circuit

**Our passage through the fourth circuit (1)**

1. **In the fourth circle** of Havona we will have as instructors the Discoverers of the Son, who also belong to the order of Secondary Supernaphim.
2. **And with them we will acquire** the necessary preparation to understand the Eternal Son and His relationship to the Trinity. That is the goal of this fourth circuit. These Discoverers of the Son will teach us, first, to spiritually understand the Eternal Son, then to recognize His personality, and finally to differentiate the personality of the Son from that of the Infinite Spirit.
3. **For this purpose, we will also be temporarily transported** to Paradise, where we will be able to have a comprehensive contact with these Deities.
4. **In this fourth circle there are seven worlds** in which the reserve corps of the Paradise Michaels maintain special schools of service, offering their ministry to both ascending and descending pilgrims. Therefore, on these worlds, we will meet and fellowship with pilgrims descending from Paradise to make contact with the experiential reality of the time-space worlds. This encounter will be highly beneficial to both us and them.

**139**

**Our passage through the fourth circuit (2)**

1. **In this circle and in the inner ones**, examinations are no longer held. Possible failures are not judged or considered defeats; neither the candidates nor their guides are criticized, and a failure in learning is neither a problem nor a disgrace.
2. **When we reach the Eternal Son**, which will be most common, and pass through all the worlds of this fourth circle, we will be transferred to the third circle of Havona to continue our upward progression.
3. **However, even in this fourth circle** of Havona, some, very few, of the candidates will not attain the Eternal Son and will suffer the delay of that apparent failure in the adventure of Deity, following the same procedure as those who did not attain the Infinite Spirit, as already explained when studying our passage through the fifth circle.

**140**

### Our passage through the third circuit

**Our passage through the third circuit (1)**

1. **In the third circle** of Havona we will have as instructors <ins>the Father's Guides</ins>, who are the oldest, most qualified, and most experienced Secondary Supernaphim.
2. **They maintain on the worlds of this circuit** <ins>their schools of wisdom and their technical faculties</ins>, where all beings living in the central universe serve as educators. Nothing is overlooked that might be of use to a creature of time in this transcendent adventure of achieving eternity.
3. **In due time, from the pilot world** of this third circle, the transport trio will also lead us to Paradise to <ins>reach and understand the Father, which is the goal of this circuit</ins>.
4. **When a mortal, material creature** like ourselves attains this goal, he has truly and for all eternity become a perfected spirit son of God. And this glorious fact is a grand event, demonstrating the impracticability of the Father's plan of ascension and the justice and righteousness of the command, “Be ye perfect as I am perfect,” which He addressed to the lowly creatures of the evolutionary worlds. Therefore, this glorious fact will be widely broadcast through the Havona broadcasts.

**141**

**Our passage through the third circuit (2)**

5. **After reaching and understanding the Father** we will be classified as 5th phase or 5th degree spirits.
6. **After passing through all the worlds** of this third circle, we will be transported to the pilot world of the second circle of Havona to continue our progress.
7. **And in the same way, those few who do not reach the Universal Father**, must also follow the same procedure explained previously.

**142**

### Our passage through the second circuit

**Our passage through the second circuit (1)**

1. **In the second circle** of Havona our instructors will be the Counselors and Advisors, who also belong to the order of the Secondary Supernaphim.
2. **In this circle we will receive helpful encouragement and counsel from these instructors to prepare us for the new and higher responsibilities we will have in Paradise.
3. **They will also prepare us** to embark on the period of rest that awaits us in the first circle of Havona. In any case, our stay in this second circle will be profitable and enjoyable. But many pilgrims will look back at their very long struggle with longing and the desire to somehow return to the worlds of time and begin all over again.

**143**

**Our passage through the second circuit (2)**

4. **When our experience** in the worlds of this second circle is concluded, the Graduate Guides will issue the order that will allow us to enter the final circle. And these guides will personally conduct us to the first circle.
5. **But before we see what happens in the first circle**, <ins>REMEMBER</ins> that:
  - **Those ascendants who in the previous circles failed in their first effort to find and recognize the Paradise Deities also arrive at the 2nd circle**, although immediately and directly.
  - **Such ascendants are placed** under the jurisdiction of the Chiefs of the Paradise Assignment, and sent directly to this second circle, where after receiving for a long time the help and comfort of the Counselors and the Advisers,
  - **They will be examined** by the Councils of Perfection, which meet on the pilot world of this circle.

**144**

**Our passage through the second circuit (3)**

- **They will receive the certificate of having passed the Havona test**, under the same conditions as if they had succeeded in the Deity adventure. In reality, the spirit of these candidates was entirely acceptable; and their failure was inherent in some phase of their approach technique or some part of their experiential background.
- **After receiving this certificate**, they are brought before the Chiefs of Assignment and, as previously seen, are returned to the work of the realms of space, but to a superuniverse different from that of their origin, for a period of not less than a thousand years; and they depart with rejoicing, with joy, and as loving ministers of the highest type to the children of time and temporal disappointments.
- **After that time, the ascendants who experienced** that apparent failure will return not to this second Havona circuit but to the one on which they apparently failed, and will again continue the Deity adventure, which will most certainly end successfully.

**145**

### Our passage through the first circuit

**Our passage through the first circuit (1)**

1. **In the first or innermost circle** of Havona our instructors will be <ins>the Complements of the Rest</ins>, which is the last of the orders of the Secondary Supernaphim.
2. **A large portion of our time** on the first circle of Havona will be devoted to continuing the study of the impending problems related to Paradise residence.
3. **A wide and diverse multitude of beings** reside permanently or temporarily in this circle. And the Complements of Rest take advantage of this varied mix of personalities to further our education, especially regarding the problems of adjustment to the numerous groups of beings we will soon encounter in Paradise.
4. **In this circle we will fellowship** with the descending pilgrims and with the Creature-Trinitized Sons who reside here. And our instructors are very interested in fostering these fraternal associations.

**146**

**Our passage through the first circuit (2)**

5. **Towards the end of our stay in the first circle**, we will meet for the first time the <ins>Instigators of Rest</ins>, who belong to the primary order of the Supernaphim of Paradise,
6. **who will come out to welcome us** and to complete our preparation for the transitional dream of the final resurrection.
7. **We perfected pilgrims will begin this rest** by falling asleep on the pilot world of the first circle of Havona, and awakening on the shores of Paradise.

**147**

**Our passage through the first circuit (3)**

8. **Our instructor for this first circle,** the <ins>Complement of Rest</ins>, will travel with us, as Havona's guarantee that our transition is complete and that we are only awaiting the finishing touches of perfection.
9. **Only when we arrive in Paradise**, accompanied by this Secondary Supernaphim and under the sleep induced by the Instigator of Rest on the first circuit of Havona, will we have the status of residents, and will we be considered <ins>sons of eternity</ins>; until then, we will be only visitors or guests.

**AND NOW WE'LL ONLY HAVE TO FACE IT...**

## CITIZENS OF PARADISE STAGE

**148**

**When we attain Paradise**, our capacity for identifying with true spiritual values will have so expanded that we will have achieved perfect possession of the light of life. Such a perfected spiritual personality as we will then possess will become so completely, divinely, and spiritually one with goodness, beauty, and truth that there will be no possibility of its casting any negative shadow of potential evil when it stands before the infinite Sovereigns of Paradise. In all of us, goodness will have become divinely complete and will approach the purity and perfection of the Supreme.

**149**

**Contents**

**The study of this stage** will also be divided into <ins>three blocks</ins>:
1. **First of all, let us examine** some generalities about Paradise and the three satellite circuits that surround it, in order to know, as always, where we are located.
2. **Secondly, we will learn** about our first steps in Paradise and the achievements we will attain throughout the 7 pre-final sub-stages, in which the 7 groups of Primary Supernaphim of Paradise will be our instructors.
3. **And finally, we will learn** something about our possible activities as members of the Mortal Finalist Corps.

**OK?**

**Let's get started**

**153**

### Generalities about Paradise and its satellites

**Generalities about Paradise and its satellites**

Paradise is the eternal center of all creation and the personal residence of the Universal Father, the Eternal Son, and the Infinite Spirit, which, naturally, they share with a multitude of personal creatures. Paradise is also the largest organized cosmic body in the entire Master Universe, and the only one that remains motionless. Its physical beauty, intellectual attainments, infinite bestowal of divine personality, and the spiritual glory and splendor of Paradise are impossible for us mortals to comprehend at our present age.

**The Universal Father has concentrated** the absolute potential of all cosmic reality in Paradise. **Paradise has the flat shape of a cookie**—not round or circular, but ellipsoid. We see this better in the next slide.

**151**

**Generalities about Paradise and its satellites**

Here we have it

**And in this graphic representation** of Paradise we are going to indicate

**its orientation and measurements.**

**the North-South direction**, which we see represented there by that horizontal segment, and

**the East-West direction**, which we can also see in that vertical segment.

**With these segments, I also represent** the length and width of Paradise. And in them, we're going to indicate not the measurements, because we don't know those, but the relationships that exist between those measurements.

**For example**, if the width of Paradise is measured (i.e., the distance EO)

We call it “x”, the length of Paradise (which would be the distance NS)

would be “x + x / 6$”, and the height of Paradise (which would be the distance OO') that we represent with this other small vertical segment, would be “x / 10”.

**152**

**Generalities about Paradise and its satellites**

**In this slide and the next** we will distinguish the parts or fields of activity of Paradise. **Here we can see**, looking from above but at a slight angle, the Upper Paradise, which is the field of personal activities.

**We also see the Peripheral Paradise**, where activities take place that are neither strictly personal nor impersonal.

**153**

**Generalities about Paradise and its satellites**

And here, now looking from below, also at a slight angle, we can again see the Peripheral Paradise and the Lower Paradise. In the latter, impersonal activities take place.

**154**

**Generalities about Paradise and its satellites**

Returning to the Upper Paradise, we distinguish on its surface three large zones of activity:

- **In the center is the Presence of the Deity**, that is, of the Universal Father, the Eternal Son, and the Infinite Spirit.
- **Surrounding this first zone** is the Most Holy Sphere, which is reserved for the functions of worship, trinitization, and higher spiritual attainment.
- **And finally, in the outermost region**, is the Holy Area, which is divided into 7 concentric zones:
  - **The innermost zone** (the blue one, which surrounds the Most Holy Sphere) is the one occupied by the Citizens of Paradise and Natives of Havona.
  - **The next area** (the one colored green) is the residential area of the natives of the 7 superuniverses, and it is partially subdivided into 7 sectors, each dedicated to the welfare and advancement of the personalities of a superuniverse. Each of these sectors is subdivided into residential units, which are grouped into ever-larger units such as divisions, congregations, assemblies, etc., and so on up to the supreme units. The number of residential units is truly astronomical, namely 7^7^ x 10^27^, and each of these residential units is adequate to house one billion (10^9^) individual and glorified work groups.
  - **We are not given any information about the remaining areas of the Holy Area** (i.e., from the 3rd to the 7th).

**155**

**Generalities about Paradise and its satellites**

- **The surface of Peripheral Paradise** is partially occupied by the landing and departure fields of the various groups of spiritual personalities.
- **Also found on this peripheral surface** are the <ins>central seats of power of the 7 Master Spirits</ins> (their personal seats of power and authority are in the 7 Spheres of the Spirit).
- **And also found on Peripheral Paradise** are the <ins>enormous areas of historical and prophetic exhibitions</ins> assigned to the Creator Sons, and dedicated to the local universes of time and space.

**156**

**Generalities about Paradise and its satellites**

**Finally, on the surface of the Nether Paradise** there exists no personality, no spiritual intelligence. Here all the circuits of physical energy and cosmic force of the Master Universe originate.

**In the Lower Paradise** the following activity zones are found:

- **In the central part**, just below where the Paradise Trinity is located in Upper Paradise, here is the <ins>Unknown and Unrevealed Zone</ins> of Infinity.
- **Surrounding this Unknown Zone**, there is an Unnamed Area.
- **And surrounding the area of the Nameless Area**, there are three concentric circuits: the Inner Zone, the Intermediate Zone, and the Outer Zone.

**The Inner Zone** is the focal point of the energy-force activities of Paradise itself.

**Regarding the Intermediate Zone**, it is not certain what its spatial functions are.

**The Outer Zone** can perhaps be identified with the functions of the Unqualified Absolute.

**157**

**Generalities about Paradise and its satellites**

**Closely linked to Paradise** <ins>are the 21 Sacred Worlds of Paradise</ins> which, to some extent, we are also going to get to know, and which, as we already mentioned when referring to our passage through Havona, are located in three concentric circuits of seven worlds each, the closest to Paradise being that of the Father's Worlds, followed by the circuit of the Son's Worlds, and finally, that of the Spirit Worlds.

**On the screen we now see** <ins>the names of the 7 Father Worlds. Of all of them, ASCENDINGTON will be the most important world for us</ins>, and the only one we will be able to inspect openly and without reservation; in fact, while we are in Havona, to address ourselves as guests to Paradise, it will be our receiving sphere, our meeting and vacation place, and our true Paradise home until we attain Paradise status.

**But even when we become Finaliters**, and as such have our domicile in Paradise, Ascendington will remain our home address at all times, even when we are serving in outer space. For all eternity, we will consider Ascendington the home of our sentimental memories and our recollections of the past.

**At Ascendington, the secret of the evolution of an immortal soul in the mind of a mortal, material creature, until its eternal fusion with the divine Adjuster occurs, will be fully revealed and understood.</ins>

**On Ascendington we will fraternize** <ins>with beings who have their origin in the Trinity and reside in Paradise</ins>, but who go to this sacred sphere to fraternize with the ascendants.

**In addition to our unreserved access to Ascendington**, we will also <ins>achieve some sort of status on each of the Father's worlds</ins> except Divinington. After our passage through the Paradise regime and after our admission into the Corps of the Finality, we will <ins>be authorized to go to Sonarington</ins>, since we are sons of God, but the sector of the secrets of the incarnation of the divine Sons will never be open to our inspection. These secrets will never be revealed to the Ascending Sons of God.

**We will obtain a similar permission** <ins>to land on the other four secret spheres of the Father</ins> (Spiritington, Vicegerington, Solitarington and Seraphington), although we will not be able to visit all of their sectors, and especially the sector of the secrets that each of these worlds contains. Divinington will be the only sphere of the Father on which we will never be able to land, since there will never be a need to do so.

**158**

### Our first steps in Paradise.

**Our first steps in Paradise.**

**Let us remember that from the innermost circle of Havona** we had set out accompanied by our associate instructor <ins>the Complement of Rest</ins> (a Secondary Supernaphim), who would be the one to guarantee our successful passage through Havona, and that we would make the journey under the sleep induced by an Instigator of Rest (a Primary Supernaphim of Paradise), who had come to Havona to welcome us and prepare us for the sleep of transition to the final resurrection. Both Supernaphim will be as essential to this transcendent metamorphosis as the Seraphim were to our survival after our first death.
1. **When we arrive in Paradise** and are repersonalized, we will recognize the <ins>Instigator of Rest</ins> who caused us to sleep in Havona before leaving and who now, in Paradise, welcomes us again.
2. **If we arrive in Paradise without any companions** from the ascending career and without the Guardian Seraphim of Destiny, we will be permanently assigned a Paradise Companion for the sole purpose of welcoming us and ensuring that we feel accompanied throughout our pre-finalization stage. Even if we arrive with someone, these Paradise Companions will also welcome us, but in that case, they will only temporarily guide us to the place prepared for our reception.
3. **After these welcomes and now with residential status**, we will be granted a period of freedom.
4. **And after this period**, we will begin our associations with <ins>the seven groups of Primary Supernaphim who will instruct us in Paradise during our pre-finality stage</ins>.

**The Paradise Companions** belong to the seventh division of the Space Messenger Hosts and are a composite group recruited from among the Seraphim, Seconaphim, Supernaphim, and Omniaphim. In the final days of our sojourn in Havona, they are selected from a waiting list by the Mother Spirit, the Reflective Spirits, or Majeston, depending on their provenance, and they examine our origin and ascension record in order to be understanding and fascinating companions. The Paradise Companions assigned to us will be of our superuniverse type, that is, of Orvonton or Seventh Master Spirit origin, and naturally, they will never assign us to an Omniaphim, as these are not affiliated with ascending mortals.

**159**

### Achievements in the 1st Pre-finalist Sub-stage: The break

**Achievements in the 1st Pre-Final Sub-Stage: The Break**

1. **Our instructors will be the Break Instigators.**
2. **The essential element for enjoying Paradise is divine rest.** And the Instigators of Rest will be the instructors who will prepare us for our first contact with eternity. In reality, they already began their work with us on the innermost circuit of Havona to prepare us to face the metamorphic sleep by which we must pass from a time-space situation to the timeless and spaceless abodes of Paradise.
3. **Divine rest is associated with the technique** of spiritual energy absorption and allows one to store sufficient reserves of spiritual power to fully enjoy the activities of Paradise. We had already begun learning this technique in the Mansion Worlds, under the instruction of the Professors of Rest (who belong to the 7th subdivision of the Energy Manipulators, which, in turn, are part of the 5th division of the Celestial Artisans).
4. **Now in Paradise**, we will reach the culmination of this technique under the teaching of the Instigators of the Rest, who will be the first order of Primary Supernaphim to instruct us in Paradise.

**Nothing further is indicated to us** about our relationship with these Primary Supernaphim.

**168**

### Achievements in the 2nd Pre-Final Sub-Stage. Fraternization.

**Achievements in the 2nd Pre-Final Sub-Stage. Fraternization.**

1. **The Chiefs of Assignment** are the second group of Primary Supernaphim who will be dedicated to instructing us while we reside on Paradise, prior to being admitted into the Corps of the Finality.
2. **They will be with us** in <ins>our time of study, instruction, and service, to help us fellowship</ins>
   - with more than 3,000 Citizens of Paradise orders,
   - with Transcendental groups
   - and with others not revealed, because all of them play an essential role in our educational experiences,
3. **When our periods of leisure arrive** we will find it very comforting to fraternize with the Reserve Corps of these Primary Supernaphim, for they will remind us of the Seraphim, to whom we were united for so long.

**Furthermore, these Chiefs of Assignment** will carry out various activities in relation to us in the event of our failure in the Deity venture, for, in that event, they will place us under their jurisdiction, just as we have already seen in the study of our passage through Havona or as we shall see when we are dedicated on Paradise itself to the ecstasy of worship.

**And one more detail that is indicated is** that the group of Chiefs of the Assignment is designated from time to time, by the Original Supernaphim of Paradise to preside over the organization of the three orders of Supernaphim (primary, secondary and tertiary).

**161**

### Achievements in the 3rd Pre-Final Sub-Stage. Ethics.

**Achievements in the 3rd Pre-Final Sub-Stage. Ethics.**

1. **The Interpreters of Ethics** are the third group of Primary Supernaphim who will dedicate themselves to instructing us.
2. **Does this sound familiar to us about ethics?** In reality, from our evolutionary world on Urantia until our departure from Havona, we will have continued to advance in ethics, because the higher we rise in the scale of life, the more attention we must pay to universal ethics.
3. **Let's briefly review our progress** in ethics throughout the career ladder:
  1. **On Urantia** we all receive the Adjutant Spirits of Mind, among whom is the Spirit of Counsel, which is that gift from the Divine Minister that impels us to cooperate with our species. Many of us learn, already on our home world, the basic concept of ethics, which consists of each individual recognizing and respecting the inherent rights of others. And from there, we begin our progress by establishing social, work, friendship, and even romantic relationships with those most like-minded of us.
  2. **On the Mansion Worlds**, with the morontia mote as our new philosophical basis, we participate in morontia life associations, work groups, social organizations, and even communities, and in this way we achieve great personal and social accomplishments that will enable us to enjoy more fully the charms of social life and that will lead us to seek a new social order, dominated by sympathy, mutual appreciation, unselfish love, and a shared motivation to reach broad goals of perfection.
  3. **In the capital of the system** we subject our selves to the discipline of collective activities and coordinated enterprises, appreciating responsibility for the tasks of government and even participating in the representative government of Jerusem.
  4. **In the constellation, ethics are given a prominent value**: our goal is to make our personalities truly sociable, and we discover that in intellectual, social, and spiritual aspects, <ins>the technique of associating people multiplies the potential of our achievements</ins>. In our relationships with the Univitatia, we learn improved ethics, and in Edentia, we master collective ethics and recognize that this is the secret of pleasant and beneficial relationships between intelligent personalities.
  5. **In the Local Universe** we studied at the Higher Faculty of Ethics, where we probably made important advances in this subject.
  6. **On the worlds of the Superuniverse** we are not told of any new achievements in the field of ethics, which does not mean that there are none.
  7. **And on the worlds of Havona** we shall establish fraternal relationships and associations with thousands upon thousands of groups of creatures resident therein and with as many others descending from Paradise, making in each case the necessary adjustments in our understanding of ethics.
4. **Now, in Paradise,** we will not need to be taught ethics, but we will need to have what we have learned throughout our ascending career properly interpreted. And this will be the work of our instructors, the Ethics Interpreters, who will help us adjust to the numerous groups of majestic beings until we are officially admitted into the Corps of Mortal Finaliters.

**162**

### Achievements in the 4th Pre-Final Sub-Stage. Conduct.

**Achievements in the 4th Pre-Final Sub-Stage. Conduct.**

1. **The Directors of Conduct** are the fourth group of Primary Supernaphim who will instruct us in Paradise.
2. **In Paradise, all conduct is natural and free**. But there is a proper and perfect way of doing things, and this is essential for progressing to the spiritual heights of spontaneous worship. Therefore, once we have been instructed in the ethics of Paradise, it will be helpful for us to receive the advice of these instructors, who are the ones who teach the ways of perfect conduct to the exalted beings who reside in Paradise.
3. **They will be chiefly concerned** with instructing us in an almost endless series of new situations and unknown uses, and with guiding our steps so that we may be perfectly at ease and able to avoid the confusion and uncertainty which would otherwise be inevitable. For, notwithstanding the long preparation we shall have received in the preceding stages for residing there, Paradise will still be extraordinarily strange and new to all of us who finally attain the status of residents.

**163**

### Achievements in the 5th Pre-Final Sub-Stage. Knowledge.

**Achievements in the 5th Pre-Final Sub-Stage. Knowledge.**

1. **In the 5th Prefinalist Substage**, <ins>our instructors will be the Custodians of Knowledge</ins>, Primary Supernaphim who inherently possess universal knowledge; they themselves have organized and classified them into 7 large groups with almost a million subdivisions per group.
2. **They are the living, perfect, and replete depositories of the truth of eternity and space-time. They are the final, living summaries and custodians of the immense chain of recording angels, which extends from the Seraphim of the UL to the Tertiary Supernaphim of Havona.
3. **They are living, self-updating libraries** that can be consulted at will by every resident of Paradise. For this reason, through these instructors, we can obtain supreme knowledge. But this knowledge is also abundantly distributed to all beings on any Havona circuit and, indirectly, is utilized by the Courts of the Ancients of Days in the superuniverses. However, it is not available to the local universes except indirectly and by reflectivity.
4. **These Supernaphim conduct informal courses of instruction for the residents of Paradise, but their primary function is to serve as a reference and a check.

**164**

### Achievements in the 6th Pre-Final Sub-Stage. Philosophy.

**Achievements in the 6th Pre-Final Sub-Stage. Philosophy.**

1. **LU tells us** that <ins>no matter how high we climb or how much we advance, we will always have a thousand mysteries ahead of us that we will try to solve using philosophy</ins>.
2. **Our instructors** in this 6th Substage will be <ins>the Masters of Philosophy</ins>.
3. **They conduct thorough courses** in the 70 functional divisions of wisdom. And in these courses they discourse upon the plans and purposes of Infinity, and upon the unsolved problems of eternity and the workings of the absolutes. And although <ins>philosophy can never be as firm in its conclusions as the facts of knowledge and the truths of experience</ins>, we shall greatly enjoy hearing our instructors on these matters.
4. **And in this we will be aided by these Masters of Philosophy**, who teach by every possible method of instruction, including <ins>the superior Havona graphic technique and certain Paradise methods of communicating information</ins>. All of these techniques are beyond our present capacity for comprehension, and as an example, they tell us that <ins>one hour of Paradise instruction would be equivalent to ten thousand years of Urantia memorization methods</ins>.
5. **These intellectual activities** of Paradise are not transmitted to the superuniverses except in a personal manner by those who heard them.

**165**

### Achievements in the 7th Pre-Final Sub-Stage. Worship

**Achievements in the 7th Pre-Final Sub-Stage. Worship (1)**

1. **In this seventh and final pre-finalist sub-stage**, we have as instructors <ins>the Worship Leaders</ins>.
2. **Worship** is the highest privilege of all created intelligences and also their first duty. Worship is the conscious and joyful act of recognizing and accepting the truth of the Creators' intimate and personal relationships with their creatures. It is the supreme joy of existence in Paradise.
3. **The quality of worship** is determined by the creature's capacity to deepen its knowledge of the infinite character of the Paradise Deities, therefore, as such a creature deepens in that knowledge, the act of worship becomes ever more comprehensive, until it finally reaches the most exquisite glory and pleasure known to created beings.
4. **So exquisite is this pleasure** that worship constitutes the primary and dominant passion of all beings who ascend to Paradise; it is the spontaneous and collective rapture of those who have learned enough of God to enter His presence. Circle after circle in Havona, worship was a growing passion, as we have stated before, but on Paradise it is so overwhelming that it becomes necessary to direct and control its expression.

**166**

**Achievements in the 7th Pre-Final Sub-Stage. Worship (2)**

5. **To this end, our instructors** <ins>have the task of teaching us worship</ins> in such a way that it enables us to achieve the satisfaction of expressing ourselves and, at the same time, be able to pay attention to the essential activities of Paradise. Without the improvement in <ins>the technique of worship that they teach us</ins>, we would need hundreds of years to fully and satisfactorily express our emotions of intelligent appreciation and gratitude. The Leaders of Worship open up unknown avenues of expression so that we can achieve, in less time, the goal of supreme pleasure and the most sublime expression of ourselves.
6. **This is such a rewarding work for our instructors** that all Primary Supernaphim long to be Leaders of Worship; and all ascending beings would like to remain forever in that attitude of supreme worship and spiritual praise. To prevent this, because there are other things to do in Paradise, the Assignment Chiefs are responsible for periodically breaking up these meetings.
7. **So great are our raptures of adoration that, since the time of Grandfanda, the Supernaphim have never been able to fully accommodate the Spirit of Adoration in Paradise. This is because personalities of their own perfection (such as the Supernaphim) cannot fully appreciate the astonishing reactions of spiritual emotion in beings like ourselves, who have made our way upward slowly and laboriously from the spiritual darkness of the lower worlds of time and space. When we finally attain and comprehend the presence of the Paradise Powers, there comes within us a gigantic explosion of the emotions accumulated over the centuries, a spectacle which astonishes the Supernaphim and evokes in the Paradise Deities the supreme joy of divine satisfaction.

**167**

**Achievements in the 7th Pre-Final Sub-Stage. Worship (3)**

8. **Sometimes all of Paradise is submerged in a prevailing tide** of spiritual and worshipful expression. And often the Leaders of Worship are unable to control these phenomena until the _“threefold light of Deity”_ indicates that the divine heart of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is completely satisfied with the sincere worship of the Paradise residents and the ascending creatures of time.
9. **After achieving the supreme satisfaction of the fullness of worship:**
  - The course with the Worship Leaders will be over,
  - **We will be qualified for admission** into <ins>the Corps of Finality</ins>.
  - **We will take the oath of allegiance** to the Paradise Trinity,
  - **We will be considered spirits of the 6th phase**, we will be called Paradise Graduates,
  - **And we will be enrolled in the Corps of Mortal Finalists.**

**168**

### Possible activity in the Finalist Substage

**Possible activity in the Finalist Substage (1)**

1. **This sub-stage begins with the oath of allegiance** to the Paradise Trinity, by which we commit ourselves, for all eternity, to be <ins>members of the Corps of Mortal Finaliters and to assume the functions assigned to us</ins>.
2. **This oath is made before** the most senior Master Absonite Architect, who oversees the 7 Finality Corps that comprise the Paradise Corps of the Finality. (This same Architect is also the chief of the Paradise Transcendentals, and presides over the Absonite Architects of the Master Universe and acts as coordinator of Paradise and its 21 sacred spheres.)
3. **And from that oath of ours**, we will be Spirits of the 6th Phase and we will belong to the Corps of the Mortal Finalists.
4. **Only those beings who have fused with the Adjuster or who possess it innately can be permanent members** of this Corps.

**173**

**Possible activity in the Finalist Substage (2)**

**The Mortal Finaliter Corps** is, as can be seen on this screen, the first of the seven finaliter corps that make up the Paradise Finality Corps.

**<ins>The Paradise Corps of the Finality is made up of:</ins>**
1. The Corps of Mortal Finalists (I have highlighted it in red to distinguish it because we will belong to this Corps, in principle, if we become finalists)
2. The Corps of the Paradise Finalists
3. The Body of the Trinitized Finaliters
4. The Corps of the Conjoint Trinitized Finaliters
5. The Havonian Finaliter Corps
6. The Corps of Transcendental Finaliters
7. The Corps of the Unrevealed Children of Destiny

**All these Bodies are supervised and coordinated**, as we have already seen, <ins>by the oldest Master Architect</ins>.

**But each of these corps** has <ins>a presiding chief</ins>, and the seven chiefs constitute the <ins>Supreme Council of Destiny in Paradise</ins>; Matter and Energy, Physics and LU during the present universe age, Grandfanda is the chief of this supreme council which assigns the universal missions to the members of the finaliter corps.

**The fact that these seven bodies** are being assembled or formed indicates the mobilization of potentials, personalities, minds, spirits, absonites, and experiential realities, probably transcending even the future functions of the Supreme Being in the Master Universe.

**It also probably indicates** <ins>the present activity of the Ultimate Trinity</ins> (eventually consisting of the Supreme Being, the Supreme Creator Personalities, and the Absonite Architects of the Master Universe), <ins>engaged in marshaling</ins> the forces of the finite and the absonite in preparation for inconceivable developments in the universes of outer space.

**Nothing like this mobilization** <ins>has taken place since the Paradise Trinity</ins>, in the times near eternity, <ins>similarly mobilized the existing Paradise and Havona personalities</ins> and appointed them as administrators and rulers of the seven superuniverses of time and space then in project.

**The seven finaliter corps represent the divine response** of the Grand Universe to the future needs of undeveloped potentials in the outer universes where future eternal activities will take place.

**170**

**Possible activity in the Finalist Substage (3)**

**The Final Mortal Corps** <ins>is made up of several groups of personalities</ins>, not just us. This Corps includes:
1. **Havona Natives**: They must have received the Adjuster and take the same oath we do. They are also received into other Finality Corps (such as the Conjoint Trinitized Finaliters and the Transcendental Finaliters), in addition to their own Corps (the Havonian Finaliters).
2. **Gravity Messengers**: These are modified and customized Adjusters, which only work with the Mortal Finaliter Corps.
3. **Glorified Mortals**: (which would be us)
4. **Adopted Seraphim**: These are our guardian angels who receive the Adjuster, fuse with it, agree to unite forever with us, and take the oath of allegiance to the Trinity. They may also be part of other nonmortal Finality Corps.
5. **Glorified Material Sons**: <ins>are those Material Sons (Adams and Eves) who, for various reasons</ins> (who did not receive a planetary mission, or who received one and arrived with their planet to the state of light and life, or who simply failed in their planetary mission) <ins>begin the evolutionary journey of universal ascension</ins>, fuse with their Adjuster and arrive at Paradise and the Corps of Mortal Finaliters.
6. **Glorified Midwayers**: These are permanent citizens of the evolutionary worlds, but when these worlds attain the state of light and life, they are released from that state of permanence and begin their ascension to Paradise, following in the footsteps of the ascending mortals, and finally enroll in one of the Finality Corps.
7. **Group still unknown**: theoretically vacant, although in practice it is provisionally occupied, as we will see shortly.

**178**

**Possible activity in the Finalist Substage (4)**

**The Final Mortal Corps is organized** for service in Companies. Each Company has 1,000 members, with the following distribution:

**Havona Natives**, <ins>1 member</ins>

**Gravity Messengers**, <ins>1 member</ins>

**Between Glorified Mortals and Adopted Seraphim**, between both groups, <ins>990 members</ins>

**Between Glorified Material Sons and Glorified Intermediate Creatures**, between both groups, <ins>7 members</ins>

**And from the still-unknown group**, <ins>1 member</ins>. This position is held temporarily and for specific missions by a Solitary Messenger, Supernaphim, Second-Range One, Paradise Citizen, or some trinitized being. This member does not take the Finalist Oath and returns to their previous status upon completion of their mission.

**Okay, so now we know where we are**, which Finality Paradise Corps we belong to, and who our fellow finalists are going to be.

But, **how does the Corps of Mortal Finaliters actually work, what will our work be as such Finaliters and where will we do it?**

**179**

**Possible activity in the Finalist Substage (5)**

**Let's go with the first of those questions**: <ins>How does the Final Mortal Corps actually work?</ins>

1. **Although the future organization of this extraordinary group is unknown, the Corps of Mortal Finaliters is currently organized according to the associative experience they acquired during their ascendant career.</ins>
2. **Currently, the Mortal Finalists** <ins>are a completely autonomous body</ins>, no one directs or controls them directly.
3. **They elect their own bosses and directors.**
4. **No outside influence** can put pressure on your policy.
5. **Its members only take an oath of loyalty** to the Paradise Trinity, and are, in truth, tested and sincere souls of time and space, absolutely loyal and impervious to evil and protected against sin.

**173**

**Possible activity in the Finalist Substage (6)**

**And now, the second question**: <ins>What will our work be as such Finalists and where will we do it?</ins>

1. **We Finalists will be assigned, in general and in principle**, to observation and cooperation services in any part of the extensive creation of the Master Universe.
2. **Indeed, members of this Corps at present** exercise their ministry in the universes of space and administer the worlds established in light and life.
3. **During the present universe epoch**, we finaliters will return to serve successively in the different superuniverses, on the missions assigned to us, but never in our own until we have served in the other six.
4. **In this way we will be able to acquire the sevenfold concept of the Supreme Being**, that is, to know Him better, to know Him integrally, since His reality will encompass the experiences of the seven superuniverses.
5. **We will have our own headquarters** on Paradise, in the superuniverses, in the local universes, and in all divisional capitals, for the purpose of rendering service wherever needed. In fact, one or more companies of mortal finaliters are constantly on duty on Urantia. (0.31.11)
6. **A part of our experience as finaliters on Paradise** will consist of the effort to understand the nature and function of more than a thousand groups of Transcendentals, eventuated beings with absonite attributes. In our association with these superpersonalities, we ascending finaliters will be counseled by numerous orders of Transcendental ministers who are charged with introducing us to our new Paradise brethren. The entire order of Transcendentals resides in the west of Paradise in a vast area which they occupy exclusively.
7. **Finally, some Finaliters**, who meet certain requirements, can trinitize, which is one of the ways to bring new beings into existence. We'll discuss this later.

**174**

**Possible activity in the Finalist Substage (7)**

**<ins>Special destiny of some Deadly Finalists (1)</ins>**

**In the previous slide** we saw something about the work and activities we'll normally perform when we're finalists. But it's also worth mentioning that some mortal finalists will have special assignments, not previously discussed.

**Specifically, there are some mortal finaliters** who, because they have excelled notably throughout their ascending career in one of the three specific matters that we are about to point out, <ins>are going to receive the embrace of the Paradise Trinity</ins>, that is to say, they <ins>are going to be transformed in their nature to become Trinitized Sons of God</ins>, they are going to disappear as mortal finaliters although they will continue to be conscious of their entire ascending career, they are going to take specific training courses on the headquarters planets of the Havona circuits under the direction of the Eternals of Days, and they are going to be dedicated to also specific work or activities, in the service of the Ancients of Days in the seven superuniverses.

**I'm referring to those mortal finalists** who stood out for one of these reasons:
1. His personal loyalty during a rebellion
2. Its administrative, executive and government capacity
3. Your capacity and your spiritual concept of worship

**These mortal finalists, as I say, receive the embrace of the Trinity,** (they are trinitized)

**And when mortal finaliters become Trinitized Sons**, such finaliters have attained their destiny, at least for the present universe age. They may not yet be seventh-phase spirits, which are attained after knowing the Supreme Being , but the Trinity embrace endows them with all that a finaliter will someday attain as a seventh-phase spirit. <ins>These Trinitized Sons</ins> are, at least for the time being, <ins>finished creatures</ins>, in contrast to the finaliters, who are at present unfinished creatures.

**175**

**Possible activity in the Finalist Substage (8)**

**Special destiny of some Deadly Finalists (2)**

**And they become Trinitized Sons of God**, of a different Order, according to the characteristic in which they stood out.
1. **Those who stood out for their loyalty** in a rebellion or in a “politically” difficult situation, are transformed into Trinitized Sons of God, of the Order of Mighty Messengers.
2. **Those who stood out for their administrative and governmental capacity are transformed into Trinitized Sons of God, of the Order of those Elevated in Authority.
3. **And those who stood out for their capacity and spiritual concept of worship**, are transformed into Trinitized Sons of God, of the Order of <ins>Those Who Have Neither Name nor Number</ins>.

**The Mighty Messengers** were mortal finaliters <ins>embraced by the Trinity in groups of 700,000</ins>, of whom 100,000 are assigned at any one time to each SU, where they are associated with the Ancients of Days in functions throughout all superuniverse phases and on all sectors, UL, and even evolutionary worlds of that SU. <ins>Their primary duty is as official observers</ins> for the Ancients of Days and as advisers to the directing authorities on the spheres upon which they reside. They are maintained in constant connection with SU headquarters through the reflectivity service. Nearly <ins>one billion Mighty Messengers</ins> are stationed on Uversa.

**The Ones in Authority** were mortal finalists <ins>embraced by the Trinity in groups of 70,000</ins>, of whom probably 10,000 are assigned at any one time to each SU, where they <ins>act as the ever-present and effective executives</ins> of the Ancients of Days. They serve on every sphere, on every inhabited world, and in every phase of activity. Over ten billion (10,000,000,000) Ones in Authority are stationed in Orvonton.

**Those Without Name or Number** were mortal finaliters <ins>embraced by the Trinity in groups of 7,000</ins>, of whom probably 1,000 are assigned at any one time to each SU, where they serve, in association, <ins>as supreme jurors of the SU's Ancients of Days</ins>. <ins>The exercise of justice is the highest function of any government</ins>; therefore, those on Uversa and its annexed tribunals who are entrusted with the rendering of verdicts are of the highest types of evolved minds and are especially qualified to judge. Over one hundred million (100,000,000) of Those Without Name or Number are stationed on Orvonton.

**The selection of mortal finalist candidates** to receive the Trinity embrace and become part of any of these three orders of Trinitized Sons of God is done in Paradise automatically and inherently (with no arbitrariness possible in any sense), so that personal experience, spiritual values and the specific requirements mentioned are what determine who will be chosen to become part of these three trinitized orders, who receive the common name of <ins>Trinitized Sons of Attainment</ins>.

**179**

**Possible activity in the Finalist Substage (9)**

**<ins>Special destiny of some non-Finalist Mortals (1)</ins>**

**But**, as we know, **not all mortals who reach Paradise** achieve the status of Finalists.

**Let us remember that** <ins>there are mortals who do not fuse with the Adjuster</ins>, but with an individualized fragment of the Mother Spirit of the UL, and that although the majority of them remain forever in the service of the UL, since, as a class, they are not destined to reach Paradise, (but to become integrated into the Corps of Perfection of the UL), <ins>nevertheless, some do reach the Central Island</ins>.

**And something similar happens** with mortals who fuse with an individualized gift of the Spirit of the Creator Son. Most of these remain forever in the service of the Son, although <ins>some also ascend to Paradise</ins>.

**But neither of them become Finalists** since they did not fuse with the Adjuster, <ins>which is an indispensable requirement</ins> to form part of said Body.

**However, some of these Spirit-fused or Son-fused mortals** <ins>also receive the embrace of the Trinity</ins> and are transformed into Trinitized Sons of God of the Order of <ins>Trinitized Ambassadors</ins>. And as such Trinitized Sons of God, they are also finished creatures, even though they were not previously finaliters.

**Trinitized Ambassadors** are non-finalist mortals <ins>embraced by the Trinity in groups of 7,000</ins>, of whom probably 1,000 are assigned at any one time to each SU, where they are associated with the Ancients of Days, who <ins>send them out as their Trinitized Ambassadors</ins> to serve in the SUs, where they <ins>perform special and important services at the Minor Sector Headquarters</ins>, among a variety of other functions, for they are the master minds of their respective groups and are qualified to assist the SU rulers in understanding and administering the interests of the worlds from which these mortals hail. Nearly 500 million of these Trinitized Ambassadors are registered on Uversa.

The selection of these nonfinalist mortal candidates for the Trinity embrace of the Order of Trinitized Ambassadors is conducted on Paradise in accordance with the reports of their Havona instructors. This Order of Trinitized Ambassadors, together with the Order of Trinitized Custodians (which consists of Seraphim and Midwayers who have attained the Mortal Finaliter Corps), are commonly designated the Trinitized Sons of Election.

**180**

**Possible activity in the Finalist Substage (10)**

**Other extraordinary possibilities for the Finalists**

**As we have just seen, under certain circumstances** <ins>of personal brilliance</ins>, some mortals who were Adjuster-fused and Finaliters, and some mortals who were not Adjuster-fused and could not belong to that Corps, were embraced or Trinitized by the Paradise Trinity and were consequently transformed in nature from Ascending Mortals to Trinitized Sons of God.

**Trinitization is a special form** of giving birth to a new being or of transforming the nature of an existing one. This act, in its twofold nature, is exclusive to the Deities. But in the aspect of giving birth to a new being, it may also be performed by Paradise Havona personalities and certain members of each Finality Corps.

**The adventure of trinitization** can be attempted:
1. By Two Deadly Finalists
2. By two Citizens of Paradise-Havona
3. By a Finaliter (Mortal or other) and by a Citizen of Paradise-Havona

**As you can see,** in two of these possible adventures we, the Mortal Finalists, will be able to participate.

**178**

**Possible activity in the Finalist Substage (11)**

**Well, let's see now** <ins>how and what happens</ins> (possibilities, results and consequences) <ins>in the Trinitization, carried out by two Mortal Finaliters:</ins>

1. **Finalists may only participate** <ins>in the trinitization adventure once</ins>. Paradise Deities have no limit on the number of times they can participate.
2. **Two Finalists**, during one of their vacation periods, <ins>may appear before the Architects of the Master Universe</ins>, demonstrate that they have independently selected an identical and original concept to be trinitized, and request the necessary time and seclusion to devote themselves to developing their proposal. The Architects, in their sole discretion, may authorize the extension of these finalists' vacation period for a period of time and their retirement to the trinitization sector of Paradise to study the matter in peace and finalize their proposal.
3. **If at the end of that retreat they communicate** <ins>their willingness, individually and jointly</ins>, to undertake the effort to spiritualize, idealize and actualize a selected and original concept that has not been trinitized up to that point, Master Spirit number 7 issues the orders authorizing that extraordinary undertaking.
4. **But they are not always successful**; many times they fail without any error being discovered. These unsuccessful candidates for trinitization are admitted into a special group of finalists who have made the supreme effort and endured supreme disappointment.
5. **If the trinitization** accomplished by these two Mortal Finaliters <ins>is successful, the result is an ascendant-Trinitized Son</ins>. This Son <ins>embody[s] a reality of the Supreme Almighty</ins> acquired by the trinitizing parents on their Paradise ascension career, and he is endowed with personality by the Universal Father.
6. **In the two trinitizing parents**, an almost divine experience occurs, consisting of a biunification of certain spiritual phases of their personalities, and in a certain sense <ins>they become spiritually one</ins> in their universal tasks and on the ultimate functional level. Nevertheless, they are still considered two personalities, and are aware of one another, can communicate with one another, and can perform functions that neither of them could have previously performed.

**179**

**Possible activity in the Finalist Substage (12)**

**Now let's see** <ins>how and what happens</ins> (possibilities, results and consequences) <ins>in the Trinitization, carried out by a Finaliter and a Citizen of Paradise-Havona:</ins>

1. **Regarding these trinitizations**, which can also only be performed once, <ins>the preliminary steps are not indicated</ins>. (I imagine they won't be very different from when two finalists attempt it.)
2. **What is stated is** that those who have the authority to approve the trinitizing union between Finaliters and Citizens of Paradise-Havona are the Seven Master Spirits, although it is not clear whether this authority is to be expressed jointly or whether each of them can do so individually. I am inclined to favor the former.
3. **These trinitizations always succeed.**
4. **The result of a trinitization** <ins>carried out by a Finalitor and a Citizen of Paradise-Havona is a Trinitized Son of Destiny</ins>. This Son personifies a reality of Supreme-Ultimate Deity unattainable by experience, transcending the limits of the creative activity of the present universe age and therefore belonging to a future age, and therefore this Trinitized Son of Destiny becomes a pupil of the Absonite Architects of the Master Universe.
5. **After the trinitizing episode,** these two parents also experience a biunification of certain spirit phases of their personalities, and from that time on they no longer work with the Finaliters or with the inhabitants of Paradise-Havona, but are integrated into a special corps composed of similar beings. Just as in the case of the two Finaliter parents, these parents are also still regarded as two personalities, and they are conscious of one another, can communicate with one another, and can perform functions which neither could have previously performed.

**Well, we have already seen that as Finaliters we will perform various functions**, some of them very special. However, beyond what has already been stated, it does not appear that, for now, there is any specific or established occupation for the Corps of Mortal Finaliters. However, <ins>the mobilization of this Corps on Paradise suggests that its future destiny must lie in the universes currently being organized in outer space</ins>. At least this is the conjecture on Uversa. Nevertheless, if there were no future destiny for the Corps of Mortal Finaliters, their present station would already be adequate and glorious and would fully justify the universal plan of evolutionary ascension. But future epochs of the evolution of the outer space spheres will further amplify and better illuminate the wisdom and goodness of the Deities in the execution of their divine plan for human survival and mortal ascension.

**A Divine Counselor and a personality without Name or Number say:** “_Evolutionary mortals are born on the planets of space, pass through the morontia worlds, ascend the spirit universes, traverse the Havona spheres, find God, attain Paradise, and are mustered into the primary Corps of the Finality, therein to await the next assignment of universe service. There are six other assembling finality corps, but Grandfanda, the first mortal ascender, presides as Paradise chief of all orders of finaliters. And as we view this sublime spectacle, we all exclaim: What a glorious destiny for the animal-origin children of time, the material sons of space!_” ([UB 31:10.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p10_20))
