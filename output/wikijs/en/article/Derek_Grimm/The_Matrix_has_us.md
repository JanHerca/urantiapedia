In my [last article](http://perthubsg.com/2015/08/aliens-and-the-urantia-book-some-thoughts-more-questions/), I complained that Hollywood's depiction of aliens has ruined many sci-fi movies. However, there are great science fiction movies. The two that immediately come to mind are [Avatar](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499549/) and [Matrix](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/). I encourage all students of _The Urantia Book_ to watch these movies with the “Urantia glasses” on.

Avatar has great parallels with _The Urantia Book_. My favorite is the description of the protagonist, Jake, when he wakes up in his avatar body. I often like to compare his experience to what I think it must be like to wake up in the resurrection rooms of the mansion worlds.

With as many similarities as there are to _Avatar_, _Matrix_ could have written it an in-between if we consider its message. Because? Because, put very simply, we live in a matrix.

## What is Matrix?

“_Let me tell you why you are here. You are here because you know something. You can't explain what you know, but you feel it. All your life you have felt that something strange is happening in the world. You don't know what it is, but it's like a thorn lodged in your mind that drives you crazy. That feeling is what has brought you to me._”

These words are spoken by Morpheus in the film, but if _The Urantia Book_ could speak, I'm pretty sure this is what it would tell us.

Everyone who has made it to _The Urantia Book_ has been faced with a familiar choice: take the red pill and remain in blissful ignorance, or take the “blue” pill and find out how far down the rabbit hole (yes, I have traded the color of the pills because _The Urantia Book_ is blue).

So we take the blue pill (_The Urantia Book_) and find out that the rabbit hole is deeper than we ever imagined. We find out that we have been deceived; that the life we live on this planet has been deliberately and maliciously distorted to serve one purpose: to protect us from universal truth in order to perpetuate the implementation of the Lucifer Manifesto in Urantia human society.

200,000 years ago, Lucifer rebelled against God's government. Thirty-seven of his subordinate planetary rulers betrayed their planets to his cause. Ours was one of them. Our apostate rulers immediately sought to remake human society based on the ideas promoted in the Luciferian doctrine. They superimposed their distorted and manipulated truth matrix on the evolution of human society. His first matrix failed miserably. The second has been running for hundreds of thousands of years.

## Matrix owns us

«_Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out the window or when you turn on the television. You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been placed before your eyes so that you do not see the truth._" (Morpheus)

The Matrix is designed to divert our attention from what really matters. For example: we spend our entire lives focused on the singular pursuit of money. Because? Because our society is based on money. It's needed for everything from the basics and essentials to the ridiculously extravagant luxuries of life. Money moves the world. It's the reason corporations and the people behind them are out to poison and destroy the Earth; money and debt are the only reason so many people take up a tedious, life-sucking job that causes them to flock to it day after day, from 9 to 5, to devote their precious waking hours to a job that dulls your mind and soul. It's vicarious trauma that pushes people to drink or worse.

Did Caligastia Invent Commerce? Did you invent money? I can't argue about trade, but I can argue that he may have invented money. Sumerian stories tell us that the Annunaki (the rebel staff, in this case) enslaved large numbers of people to work in gold mines. This practice was so widespread that after a long time it was determined that the only reason the Annunaki came to Earth was their love for gold and the need to obtain it. It became a bargaining chip. This love of gold was not lost on “us.” We embraced this insatiable hunger for gold and have based trade and the monetary system on it ever since.

</figure>

I'm not going to delve further into this, but it's a fascinating idea that has much more evidence than I'm sharing here. I feel very strongly that making an otherwise useless metal in the eyes of our ancestors so valuable could have been done very easily and deliberately with a very long-term goal in mind. Tens of thousands of years later, we find ourselves enslaved by the monetary system and by the accumulation of money; even just to survive. “Paying the bills” takes up most of our time. Because it is necessary for our survival, it creates conflict, competition, and occupies our minds, often to the exclusion of everything else. And those who find time to reflect on other things? Sports, movies, celebrities, and television all help to ensure that our minds are always occupied with the trivial, never with the truly important.

Our society is designed in such a way that it takes a lot of effort to focus on what really matters. The pressure to fit in is enormous! Those who refuse to succumb to that pressure are marginalized, ostracized, ridiculed. Like it or not, believe it or not, we are firmly entrenched in the Matrix.

## The descent into the rabbit hole

I do not believe that we will ever know the true extent of the Urantia Luciferian matrix until we are on the mansion worlds. Due to our planet's isolation, Caligastia and his rogue crew have had ample opportunity to reorganize and shape human society whenever they want, based entirely on their vision of the philosophy behind the Lucifer Manifesto. Other than the emergency bestowal of Melchizedek and Michael's bestowal as Jesus, these policies and philosophies have had approximately 200,000 years to become the basis of human civilization. The authors of the Urantia Papers, frustratingly (but undoubtedly wise), never openly and exactly stated in what ways and to what extent our planet has deviated from the norm, but they do give us enough information to do something about. work and find out more. They have also provided a fascinating document entitled “Government of a Neighboring Planet” which, while not described as an ideal or universal norm, does provide encouragement and guidance.

Michael's bestowal finely allowed the light of universal truth to pass through the Matrix and finally shine. The holes are slowly getting bigger. More and more people are starting to wake up. Future generations will be able to turn to _The Urantia Book_ like a can of gasoline thrown into Michael's flame. They will back off and exclaim, “Now it's a fire!”

However, that day is in the future where none of us will be here. We will have long since moved to the mansion worlds and beyond. But while we and countless others who have gone before us will have the luxury of freedom from the Matrix upon death, Urantia human society will remain tightly held in the grip of this relentless Matrix until enough people awaken in their lifetimes. deadly, take notice and, most importantly, take action.

How do we wake up and make others wake up? How do we take action? I think the first step is to know. Like G.I. Joe used to tell us every Saturday morning, [“Knowing is half the battle”](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gi-joe-psas) (have I shown my age?) Regardless of the source, knowledge IS at least the first step to win the battle. _The Urantia Book_ sheds a lot of light on this. If we want to begin to understand how far down the rabbit hole we have gone, we not only need to know what Lucifer declared in his manifesto, but we also need to find out how those ideas have permeated and shaped our society.

## The Lucifer Manifesto

Lucifer's rebellion was based on the following points:

1. The reality of the Universal Father. Lucifer maintained that the Universal Father did not really exist, that he was a myth invented by the Paradise Sons that allowed them to maintain the government of the universes in his name.
2. The government of the universe of the creator son, Michael. Lucifer held that the systems must be autonomous and protested against Michael's right to assume sovereignty of Nebadon in the name of a hypothetical Paradise Father, while requiring all people to acknowledge allegiance to that invisible Father.
3. The attack on the universal training plan for ascending mortals. Lucifer maintained that too much time and energy was devoted to the plan of the meticulously trained ascending mortals. He advocated that ascending mortals should enjoy the freedom of individual self-determination.

Lucifer maintained that the Father was a myth created by the Paradise Sons to enable them to maintain their rule of the universes in the Father's name. He also denied that personality was a gift from the Universal Father. This is the fundamental basis for all your disputes.

This dispute manifests itself in our society as the main source of atheism. He denied the existence of the Universal Father and proclaimed all that logically follows from this denial:

- There was no original creator.
- We know from our study of _The Urantia Book_ that the Father is the ultimate controller, so if there is no controller, physical gravity and space-energy must be inherent in the universe.
- If the Father does not exist, then neither does the Son or the Infinite Spirit exist. Therefore, spiritual energy and mind must also be inherent in the universe.

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV42/03.jpg">
</figure>

What he did was reduce the original creative personality Father to a machine. Lucifer created the idea of a mechanistic universe. These ideas are not an invention of modern science. They are based on the first and most basic Lucifer feud, proclaimed in our system capital and here on Earth over 200,000 years ago.

(_It should be noted, however, that much of the atheism of modern society also has its origin in the negative reaction of Western society to centuries of theocratic and institutionalized control that the Church imposed in all aspects of life, including in areas that did not concern him.The reaction is, of course, the scientific revolution and its ultimate mission is twofold: on the one hand, to discover the physical laws of the universe and learn how to apply them wisely, and on the other hand, to finally liberate religion of the baggage of doctrines, dogmas and crystallized institutions that it has accumulated over the centuries. We could say that the karma of science is destined to revise the dogma of religion_).

Satan, Lucifer's attendant, proclaimed that worship could be in accord with universal forces (physical, intellectual, and spiritual), but that fidelity could only be acknowledged to the actual and actual ruler, Lucifer, the “friend of men and of angels.” » and the “God of Freedom”. Freedom of religion and worship was allowed, as they declared that all religions are equal, but Lucifer required everyone's fidelity to his personal authority.

In our modern societies, these are hard-won freedoms! And even so, there is freedom of worship and religion, although the fidelity is towards the State. The state is separate from religion, and for good reason! The ramifications are not going to sit well with many people, and will require some serious evaluation of these ideas, as they raise some obvious questions:

- Are all religions the same?
- Is there no separation between Church and State? Then we might as well go back to the Middle Ages!
- Shouldn't we be free to worship however we want?
- To whom should we be faithful, if not to the State?

Let's consider all these questions.

## Are all religions the same?

«_There is a peculiarly modern idea that truth is completely relative and exists only in the experience of the individual, and that somehow everyone's 'truth' must be equally valid. Just like printing your own money, it devalues the value of truth until it is worthless. This is relativism. Wanting everything to be equally true is meaningless._" [1GOD.com](http://www.1god.com/).

If we look at organized religions objectively (not just the major ones), it's hard to escape the conclusion that no, they're not the same. I do not want to say that each of them does not contain at least some universal truth and that many do not benefit man by bringing him closer to God, but we can also compare them considering to what extent they represent an obstacle and greatly delay man's discovery of God. and cultivating a personal relationship with him. Obstacles of this nature are exemplified by the continued involvement of institutionalized religions in power and politics, their focus on ceremony and ritual, and their continued invasive presence in areas of society that have nothing to do with discovering and cultivating a personal relationship with the Father. Some religions present more obstacles than others, and some present a clearer path to find the Father. That is where science has played its most important role in relation to religion, for it has broken down some of those obstacles. Other obstacles must wait until there is a more enlightened and outraged people before they can be dealt with.

## Separation of Church and State

In most people's minds, the separation of church and state is the only thing standing in the way of a return to a theocratic reminiscence of the European Middle Ages. One only has to look at the entrenchment that fundamentalist and extremist sects have within some of the major religions in many countries and societies even today to see the devastating influence these theocracies have. The separation of Church and State is a hard and recently won victory against the totalitarianism of institutionalized religions and for the time being, to the extent that religion's lust for power can be removed, not just political power, but power over the heart and the minds of his followers, the separation of Church and State is a very good thing.

On a normal evolutionary planet, however, civilization is a co-creative process between the Government of God and the inhabitants of the planet. A normal world has a visible planetary administration residing in it and usually established by the time its inhabitants exhibit will. This stewardship persists throughout the planet's history to guide and minister to it. Because this planetary administration is a literal physical manifestation of God's Government, the ideal planetary government is indeed theocratic, but in a way that we can barely fathom when we think of this word. Here we can see a great example that shows us that we are indeed on a tangent and is even more revealing in showing us how far we have to go. The idea of a benevolent theocracy working with civilization to build ever greater heights while simultaneously fostering technology, economics, science, education, and spirituality sounds utopian and even alien. However it may sound, once the isolation of our planet is lifted and the form of visible planetary administration reinstated, whatever it may be, will be the goal of every progressive citizen of the planet.

## So, shouldn't we be free to worship however we want?

It's a very difficult question, isn't it? No wonder Lucifer has caught so many people! This questions the issue of truth and free will.

Before we continue, let's define some terms:

**Truth:** the way things really are. All truth is relative except the Universal Father, who is absolute truth and absolute reality.

**Worship:** As mortals, we can only worship the highest truth that we can comprehend. This should also work as an imperative: if we can visualize or conceptualize something greater than someone or something we are now worshiping, we are, quite frankly, underestimating ourselves and the Father.

**Free will:** the Father has given us free will to choose whether or not to participate in his plan. Finally, with all the decisions we make, every time we exercise free will, consciously or unconsciously, we are choosing the Father or not.

So we are expected to exercise our free will to choose to worship the highest concept of truth/reality that we can comprehend (what, to Urantians, is the Universal Father) and as we strive to know Him better personally, as we understand its creation intellectually, this concept will gradually expand and evolve in our mind. In this way, true religion cannot be codified, true religion is always changing and evolving. This is the source of the errors of institutionalized religions. Religion needs to flow, ACT, _become something_. When it is stagnant and crystallizes, it is no longer alive. It becomes a philosophy.

The Father will not coerce any being to adore or love him. Free will will reign supreme in the entirety of the Father's creation. However, Lucifer distorted people's understanding of creation, the Father, and their place in it. It was Lucifer who denied the existence of the Father in order to position himself as God. He reduced the Father to a machine. If people really needed to worship something, Satan provided guidance - people could worship those physical, intellectual, and spiritual universal forces. In short: people could adore nature.

Of course, people must be free to exercise their free will and worship in the way they choose; however, if worship is based on man's larger concept of universal truth or reality, he deserves to have the best possible information about the nature of the universe before making his choice. And Lucifer has maliciously distorted this information and warped it to serve his own purposes.

We often hear critics describing our modern global society as technologically advanced yet spiritually backward. Spiritual progress on this planet has been irreparably damaged. We live in a world where the primitive religion of fear - fear of nature and fear of the spirit world (ghosts, etc.) - still coexists with more advanced concepts of a loving, personal and universal Creator. Lucifer's universe, without a personal creator/controller, the idea of a mechanical universe devoid of intelligent control or organization, is the foundation on which the Matrix is built.

As it stands now, ever since Lucifer infected our society with these ideas, we have been isolated and have had to get by as best we can. The world is awash in an ocean of “isms” and “logies.” It wasn't until Melchizedek and later Michael himself that we were given serious guidance. Since Michael's bestowal, we have benefited from the worldwide arrival and bestowal of Thought Adjusters and the Spirit of Truth to guide us into a personal understanding of and relationship with the Father. Unfortunately, our full escape from the Matrix will have to wait until we get to the mansion worlds for it to be individually corrected.

Having sheared the Father of personality, Lucifer did not care who we “worshipped” as long as he had the loyalty and fidelity of the whole world.

## Where should our fidelity rest, if not in the State?

Another difficult question, but one that can be answered more easily. Ask yourselves if our political leaders really deserve our unquestioning loyalty. Look what many governments do with that fidelity. They exploit or even go to war with other countries to advance the interests of those in power.

There are a growing number of people in the world today with multiple nationalities - millions of travelers who have lived in more than one country. Having lived in other countries and getting to know the people who live there, these people are beginning to realize that almost everyone on the planet shares the same basic hopes and dreams for themselves and their families. These globally minded people are beginning to feel a different fidelity; not towards a nation, but towards a global family of which they are a part. Just as allegiance has evolved from tribe to state to monarchy to nation, and as more people shift their allegiance to the global family, one day we will move even further to ally again with God.

This is not wishful thinking or being utopian. It is our future, separated from us only by time and effort... _much_ time and _much_ effort.

We have heard that Lucifer attacked the right of the Paradise Sons to rule in the name of the Universal Father. He argued that local systems should be autonomous. He spitefully attacked the right of the Ancients of Days to interfere in the affairs of the systems. He denounced them as tyrants and usurpers. He urged his followers to believe that if men and angels had the courage to stand firm and assert their rights, the Ancients of Days would have no choice but to give in to their demands. He held that majorities rule and the idea that the mind is infallible.

## Self-government / self-government

Lucifer wanted autonomy. He wanted her so he could rule in his own right, in his own way, without supervision. In other words: he wanted unqualified sovereignty over his domains. This requires addressing self-determination and personal freedom, which we'll get to shortly, but first let's look at an example of autonomy from God's Government.

The government here has certainly been limited to our quarantined planet. Self-determination has been the only path. Since the rebellion and subsequent isolation, we have had little choice but to go it alone without any prompting from the planetary administration, and our civilization is the result. In terms of what not to do, we can keep our heads up to the rest of the universe and uphold the standards. Seriously though, the Urantia Papers clearly state that we are not to be blamed for the mistakes of our heavenly leaders. Self-determination without wisdom and experience is the same as a small child playing with matches. Self-governance is a responsibility that must be earned.

## Majority rule

Once again, we tackle a troublesome topic. What's wrong with majority rule? It is the basis of representative democracy! The problem is that, in practice, majorities rarely rule, if ever, and they are not always right. I'm sure everyone reading this could give at least one example of majorities not always being right. Here's an idea to consider.

For us, at this stage of social evolution, representative democracy based on the idea of majority rule is a noble ideal. But let's stop to consider that, even in fair democratic elections, the so-called majority actually rules only one day out of every 3 or 4 years, depending on the country. Yes, the majority choose the members who will sit in the government during the next legislature, but who chooses the candidates who will occupy those positions? A candidate must normally have the backing of a political party, and money is needed to win an election. Most successful candidates have the backing of wealthy financiers.

So is the majority always right? Think for a moment that, back in the Middle Ages, the vast majority of Western civilization believed that the world was flat, or that the universe revolved around the Earth, or, more recently, that '80s hairstyles were cool.

<figure id="Figure_1" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV42/05.jpg">
</figure>

In the case of Lucifer, he used the false promise of majority rule to rally his ranks against Michael and the Ancients of Days. He hoped that if they faced overwhelming opposition, the Ancients of Days would give in to their demands.

All this leads in the end to deal with freedom and free will. Just as national governments and corporations across the globe spread buzzwords like freedom to justify exploiting other people, we need to look behind these words to find out what they really say. We are told that of all the perplexing problems that have arisen from the Lucifer rebellion, none has caused more difficulties than the inability of immature evolutionary mortals to distinguish between true and false freedom. Here is a quote: “_True freedom is the search of the centuries and the reward of evolutionary progress. False freedom is (...) Unbridled personal will and disorderly expression of self are equivalent to total selfishness, the height of impiety. Freedom, without an associated and increasing conquest of the self, is a product of the selfish human imagination (...) True freedom is associated with authentic self-esteem; false freedom is the consort of self-admiration (...) Self-control leads to altruistic service; self-admiration tends to exploit others._” <a id="a187_1045"></a>[UB 54:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p1_2), <a id="a187_1088"></a>[UB 54:1.5-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p1_5)

Lucifer's third charge was directed at the self-determination of ascending mortals. Now we see that true freedom has to be earned.

So, armed with this definition of true and false freedom, do we still think that unfettered freedom is a noble goal? As a global family, we are still too immature to exercise any kind of unregulated freedom; we lack self-control on a personal and national level. This is one of the strongest arguments that exist for a single planetary government, which can regulate the unimpeded freedom of both nations and companies.

## The mind is infallible

Lucifer also held that the mind is infallible. It stands to reason that if the Paradise Trinity did not exist and instead its attributes were natural phenomena inherent in the universe, the highest force should be the mind.

Lucifer accused the Ancients of Days and the Paradise Children of distorting the truth to allow his rule. He encouraged all who listened to him to wake up and realize that the mind is supreme, and to use their mind to free themselves from the yoke of this oppression and choose their own destiny.

It was a very tricky idea and appealing to many who heard it. It is tricky because the mind is very powerful. It is the ground on which everything takes place; our decisions, our intentions, and it is also the ground in which we ultimately make contact with the divine. By encouraging people to free themselves from the oppression of God's Government, he was effectively trying to break the individual's connection to the divine.

The mind is not infallible. It is the tool we all use to get closer to or further away from the divine. Attacking and clouding the perception of people's minds has allowed the Luciferian Matrix to resist the ages and dispensational attempts at planetary rehabilitation.

## Summary

A blindfold has been put on us. We live in a world where the truth is deliberately distorted through a well-organized and entrenched attack, not only on our society and our collective values, but also on our minds and the very way we perceive the world around us.

I have brought up a lot of different things in this article and hopefully it makes some sense. I have tried to follow a line of argument, and while some of the implications are a bit alarming, I have been very careful to ensure that what I have discussed here sounds logically sound and is closely connected to the description of the Urantia Book from the Lucifer manifesto.

We have seen how the Universal Father is the ultimate expression of truth and reality in his creation, and through previous discussion of truth, worship, and free will, we see that based on the truth that the Father is reality, we are given free will to choose whether or not to be part of that reality. Lucifer distorted and confused the reality and truth of the Father solely to further his own ambition. He betrayed the trust not only of his superiors, but also the trust that billions of ascendant creatures in his system placed in him to reveal the highest truths of the universe. The scope of what he did to the evolving worlds, where mortals take their first steps in the Father's magnificent creation, is beyond compare.

Here is a quick summary of the basic themes of the Lucifer Manifesto, as they have been echoed in Urantia society:

- There is no God; there is no personal creator, and therefore physical and spiritual gravity are natural phenomena and inherent in the universes.
- All individuals, regardless of their social and intellectual maturity, should have the freedom to pursue their own vision of happiness, without interference from the State or from society as a whole.
- The rights of the individual (self-affirmation and personal freedom) are valued at the cost of cooperation and self-control.
- The majority is always right (the basis of representative government).
- All religions have the same status. Freedom of worship is protected, but fidelity and loyalty to the nation-state (country) is reserved.

I hope it becomes clear that there truly is a Matrix and that it is not too different from the one depicted in the movie. Lucifer's ideas permeate our society, not just our religious viewpoint, and not in the way that religion typically views such things as satanic influence. It is also in political views and even in our most basic ideals related to civilization and the values we stand for.

In this analogy, we Urantians are among those who are awakening, and the more awake we are, the more exposed we are to the Luciferian Matrix. Perhaps this is why we have so much trouble getting people to take the blue pill and read _The Urantia Book_. Most people are either fast asleep and not looking, or simply not ready to be woken. «_You have to understand that most of these people are not prepared to be disconnected. Many of them are so used to and desperately dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it._"(Morpheus)

The “blue pill” allows us for almost the first time to learn the context and content of Lucifer's manifesto, and allows us to begin the work of comparing his doctrine with what we are told about how the rest of the universe works. It's not an easy job. It requires intellectual, emotional, and spiritual effort, and it requires courage.

Let me end by sharing something I have come to understand about bravery. _The opposite of bravery is not cowardice, but conformism_. It takes a lot of courage to choose the blue pill when we're in the face of friends, family and society, and we're marginalized as eccentric and even crazy.

> **Neo:** “_I can't go back, right?_”
> 
> **Morpheus:** “_No, but if you could, would you really want to go back?_”
