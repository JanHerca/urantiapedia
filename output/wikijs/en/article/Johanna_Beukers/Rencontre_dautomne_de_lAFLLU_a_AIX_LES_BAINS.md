Tasting the air, a little rain as well as typical Savoyard dishes brought us convivially into a new sphere unknown until now for the biannual meeting of the AFLUB which was held from November 8 to 11, 2007.

Since Jacques Hellet, whom we thank very much for his approach, had offered to take charge of finding a nice place for Armeau this fall to allow the AFLUB to bring its foals together once again, here we are established for 3 nights and 3 days at the Hôtel Dauphinois.

The owners who opened the hotel especially for us, demonstrated great efficiency, a considerable effort in variety and richness of meals, as well as uncompromising assistance to improve the situation of the meeting rooms. Because that was a bit of a black spot of the meeting: not enough space.

The total number of participants being 34, some arrived on Friday November 9 and others left already on Saturday 10/11.

It doesn't matter because the goal was to advance and enrich our potential and our know-how as much as possible to learn to better perceive the role to play together with our Adjuster. An important subject because each reader of the _Urantia Book_ is undoubtedly under the influence of fascination for this Mystery Monitor who is so dear and so close to us.

Several sub-topics were covered, starting with those prepared by Chris Ragetly on Friday morning, notably the relationship between the Adjuster and the individual.

Then came Jean Royer's turn in the afternoon with the subjects: The Adjuster; Personality; and reincarnation.

We continued to explore the subject in depth in the UB. The second part of the afternoon took place under the direction of Georges Michelson-Dupont.

It was an extremely informative day with deep and rich discussions.

On Friday evening, President Michel Rouanet arrived. He invited the Regional Managers present to meet after the meal to take stock. Thus we finally had the great pleasure of welcoming 3 Swiss readers.

The President insisted and encouraged the Swiss team to set up an executive office in the near future which would nevertheless remain under the leadership of the AFLUB.

Saturday morning, after 3 minutes of silence requested before each meeting, Michel Rouanet briefly presented by computer means (due to the lack of an overhead projector) the results for the AFLUB elapsed and achieved during the last year. The AFLUB and its reader members are slowly but surely growing in number. Which is very comforting to learn.

Most of Saturday morning was then devoted to forming two workshops, each comprising 15 participants with a moderator and a rapporteur to further explore the vast subject of the Adjuster.

At the beginning of the afternoon, part of the group wanted to visit the Haute Combe Abbey. About ten others stayed on site to continue the debate on the “creature-God” relationship, or “doing the will of the Father”.

After the evening meal a meeting took place for those who are part of the Board of Directors.

On Sunday morning, conclusions were provided by the two workshop rapporteurs to close this very informative and enriching stay from every point of view.

As far as I am concerned, I have learned various things that seemed essential to me along the difficult path that allows me to grow with the precious help of my Thought Controller. In particular, I have heard the word love pronounced very often. A magic word that will however often remain without any meaning because it is used in all sorts of ways.

Piercing this deep meaning belongs, it is obvious, to our Thought Controller. It is up to us to connect to this wavelength in all humility to integrate this magnificent challenge into our daily life: to love fraternally, but above all, to love paternally, as the Father loves us, unconditionally and in all sincerity.
