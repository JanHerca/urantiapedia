By doing 650 km twice in three days which were largely rewarded by our joy of finding our brothers and sisters, we met, 8 women and twenty men, for around forty hours to explore a very interesting and still current theme: “the biological and cultural heritage of the human species” linked to the texts of the _Urantia Book_.

A welcoming place from every point of view, Max and I, like many others, really appreciated this meeting for many reasons:

A recent president like a fish in water in his capacity as speaker and moderator; five speakers with a text on the chosen theme as diverse as it is fascinating; the presence of Belgian readers long missed at the call, but found with all the more pleasure.

Then a sincere interest on the part of each participant as well as a palpable presence of the Spirit of Truth and a large number of guardian angels.

Referring to one of the many debates this weekend, I would like to make a brief aside on the subject of eugenics.

The Monday morning after our return from Armeau, what a coincidence, I came across the program “On en parle” on the LCI channel, where the Téléthon was openly criticized for its eugenics.

The attack came from the bioethics commission of the diocese of Var.

The controversy concerned “stem” cells, genetic recycling, as well as “eugenic excesses”.

During the weekend preceding this broadcast, a poll was organized on the following question: “Is the embryo a person?”

66% of viewers voted “yes” and 34% “no”.

The Veil law, which allows a pregnant woman to decide not to give birth to a baby suffering from an incurable disease, therefore offers future parents the possibility of making a choice, which is totally rejected by the Catholic Church.

According to surveys, today's parents want to have more and more beautiful and perfect babies. Genetic manipulation has now become a social phenomenon.

Which pushes Catholics to demonstrate against the Telethon.

Max and I attended a meeting in Armeau for the first time, and we returned to Marseille saturated with new knowledge, feelings of joy and satisfaction.

In sending our best wishes to the AFLUB and its members for a more than prosperous new year, we say: “see you soon in May at Lumières in Vaucluse”.

Fraternally
