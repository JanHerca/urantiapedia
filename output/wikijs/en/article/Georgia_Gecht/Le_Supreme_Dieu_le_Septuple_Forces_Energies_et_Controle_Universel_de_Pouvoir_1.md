Here are the first 70:

> The mastery of the cosmic circles is related to the quantitative growth of the morontia soul, the comprehension of supreme meanings. But the qualitative status of this immortal soul is *wholly* dependent on the grasp of living faith upon the Paradise-potential fact-value that mortal man is a son of the eternal God. Therefore does a seventh circler go on to the mansion worlds to attain further quantitative realization of cosmic growth just as does a second or even a first circler. ([UB 110:6.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_18))

Questions and Answers

1. **The Supreme is first and foremost a spiritual person. What is his source?**
	Ans. “_The Trinity of Paradise._” [[UB 115:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p4_2)]
2. **Secondly, the Supreme is a Deity of growth. From where is this growth derived?**
	Ans. “Of the two triodities—actual and potential.” [[UB 115:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p4_2)]
3. **Name the members of these two triodities—also known as triunities without the Father.** [[UB 104:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p5_2) and [UB 104:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p5_7)].
	Ans. “_The triodity of actuality consists of the Eternal Son, the Isle of Paradise, and the Conjoint Actor. The triodity of potentiality consists of the Deity Absolute, the Universal Absolute, and the Unqualified Absolute._”
4. **With what are the triodities primordially and directly concerned in the cosmos?**
	Ans. “_The cosmic appearance of experiential Deities._” [[UB 104:5.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p5_12)]
5. **Where is the Supreme God?**
	Ans. “_In Havona. God the Supreme is the personal spirit reflection of the Triune Deity of Paradise._” [[UB 0:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p7_7)] Note that the word “Deity” is used in the singular to name the Trinity.
6. **Where does finite reality find its immediate expression as perfect personalities and perfect creation?**
	Ans. “_In Havona_ [[UB 106:0.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/106#p0_18)]. _There has been no growth of Havona. It has always existed_ [[UB 116:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p0_3)] ”_...each planet is an incomparable, superb and perfect production._" [[UB 14:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p5_6)]
7. **How does the secondary phase—the evolutionary phase of finite reality—become cosmically integrated or reach a level equal to that of a primary perfection?**
	Ans. “_By their growth and accomplishments...but this destiny is subject to a delay in time—a constitutive quality of the superuniverse which is not innate in the central creation._” [[UB 106:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/106#p1_1)]
8. **What is the advantage of this “time delay” obstacle to creation?**
	Ans. “_...allows creatures to participate in evolutionary growth. This therefore makes it possible for them to enter into association with the Creator, to evolve themselves._” [[UB 106:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/106#p1_2)]
9. **From whom does the Supreme God get his personality and spiritual attributes?**
	Reply of the Trinity of Paradise.
10. **How does it become actualized, and where does it get its power from?**
	Ans. “_...he actualizes himself in the Creator Sons, the Ancients of Days and the Master Spirits, from whom he derives his Almighty power over the superuniverses of time and space...The Supreme Almighty developing on the value level of non-personal activities and the spirit person of God the Supreme are one reality-the Supreme Being._” [[UB 0:8.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p8_10)]
11. **How does this (Deity) relationship proceed to an outward expansion into the cosmic horizontal levels?**
	Ans. “_In God the Sevenfold._” [[UB 0:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p7_7)]
12. **What is the nature or composition of God the Sevenfold? Will he ever expand?**
	Ans. “_It consists of seven different associations of divine meanings and values on seven ascending levels_” [[UB 56:10.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_19)]. Its function... “_dates from the organization of the seven superuniverses and will probably extend it with the future evolution of the creations of outer space._” [[UB 0:8.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p8_12)]
13. **What is the origin of these levels of meanings and values?**
	Ans. “_...the Father is indeed the eternal and universal source of all values and meanings of that which is spiritual, volitional, intentional and personal._” [[UB 6:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p0_3)]
14. **What are the three primary elements of universal reality?**
	Ans. “_Things, meanings and values._” [[UB 196:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_2)]
15. **What happens when absolute truth is related to facts in the experience of the finite creature?**
	Ans. The externalization of a new value emerges from the Supreme. “_...when truth becomes linked to facts, then space and time both condition its meanings and correlate its values. These realities of truth coupled with facts become concepts and are, accordingly, relegated to the realm of relative cosmic realities_.” [[UB 118:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p3_3)]
16. **Of what realities is “God the Sevenfold” a functional integration of universal realities?**
	Ans. To compensate for the finiteness of creature status and to overcome their limitations of concept, the Universal Father has established for evolutionary creatures a sevenfold approach to Deity.
	1-The Creator Sons of Paradise.
	2-The Ancients of Days.
	3-The Seven Master Spirits.
	4-The Supreme Being.
	5-God the Spirit.
	6-God the Son.
	7-God the Father.
17. **What is the Supreme Almighty and where can he be found?**
	“_The Almighty Supreme is a living and evolving Deity of power and personality. His present domain, the grand universe, is also a growing realm of power and personality. The destiny of the Almighty Supreme is perfection, but his present experience embraces the elements of growth and incomplete status._” [[UB 116:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p0_4)]
18. **In which sphere does the Supreme Almighty operate?**
	Ans. “_The Almighty Supreme is evolving as the supercontroller of the physical power of the grand universe. In the present universe age this physical power potential appears to be centered in the Seven Supreme Power Directors who function through the fixed locations of the power centers and through the moving presences of the physical controllers._” [1274.1] And “_The grand universe is generally called the association of the seven evolving superuniverses and the central and divine universe. These are the creations now organized and inhabited. They are all part of the master universe, which also embraces the uninhabited but mobilizing universes of outer space._” [1.6]
19. **Where, in this universal age, does this potential for physical power appear to be centered?**
	Ans. In the seven Supreme Directors of Power. [[UB 116:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p5_11)]
20. **Where are the Power Directors, -- where are they?**
	Ans. “_The Seven Supreme Power Directors are stationed on peripheral Paradise, where their slowly moving presence indicates the location of the force centers of the Master Spirits. These power directors function individually in regulating energy-power in the superuniverses, but collectively in the administration of the central creation. They function from Paradise, but maintain themselves as effective power centers in all divisions of the grand universe._” [[UB 29:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p1_3)] “_and by the moving presences of the Physical Controllers_” [[UB 116:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p5_11)]
21. **Are the Controllers and Power Directors concerned with God the Sevenfold?**
	Ans. “_The seven groups of Controllers of the Grand Universe are functionally inseparable from God the Sevenfold and constitute the physical control level of this Deity association._” [[UB 116:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p5_9)]
22. **Name the Sevenfold Controllers of the Grand Universe:**
	1. The Master Physical Controllers
	2. The Supreme Centers of Power
	3. The Supreme Directors of Power
	4. The Almighty Supreme
	5. The God of Action, the Infinite Spirit
	6. Paradise Island
	7. The Source of Paradise — The Universal Father. [[UB 116:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p5_1)]
	Reading [[UB 116:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p5_1)]: “_...you should now recognize that the Sevenfold embraces the controllers as well as the creators of the grand universe._” And in [[UB 104:4.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p4_15)] “_...however difficult it may be to comprehend, it is nonetheless true that the archetypal power and the loving personality are one and the same universal reality; the Isle of Paradise and the Eternal Son are co-ordinate, but antipodal, revelations of the unfathomable nature of the Universal Father-Force._”
23. **What is the maximum revelation of Deity to the seven superuniverses in the present age?**
	Ans. “_The Supreme Being is the maximum revelation of Deity..._” [[UB 116:2.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p2_12)] “_...God the Supreme becomes the highest finite manifestation of the total will of God._” [[UB 117:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p0_1)] (Note that the names “God the Supreme,” “Supreme Being,” and “Almighty Supreme” are used interchangeably in the grand universe.)
24. **Where is the almighty evolutionary power of the creator children of the Paradise Deities?**
	Ans. “_In the Supreme Being_” [[UB 116:2.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p2_12)].
25. **Where are the personality realities of God the Supreme emanating from the Paradise Deities with the power prerogatives of the Almighty Supreme coming from the Creator deities of the grand unified universe?**
	Ans. “_On the Havona Outer Circuit Pilot World_” [[UB 56:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p6_2)].
26. **Our concepts of the Supreme must allow for the differential recognition of a spiritual person, an evolutionary power, and a power-personality synthesis. Explain what these mean.**
	Ans. “_The unification of evolutionary power with personality and the domination of the former by the latter._” [[UB 106:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/106#p2_2)]
27. **The evolution of nonspiritual (physical) forces and energies of the power of the Supreme Almighty emanating from the Supreme Creators externalized by a new Deity presence. With whom did these power-potentials coordinate in Havona?**
	Ans. “_The spiritual person of the Supreme._” [[UB 56:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p6_2)]
28. **By what factor was this coordination made possible?**
	Ans. “_These reality potentials were coordinated by the Supreme Mind_”[[UB 56:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p6_2)].
29. **After the unification of spiritual potentials and power potentials (residing in the infinite mind of the Infinite Spirit) on the pilot world of the outer circuit of Havona, where are these unified potentials transferred?**
	Ans. “_In the active mind of the Supreme Being_” [[UB 56:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p6_2)]
30. **In what direction does finite Deity seek unification or correlation in the universe—inner or outer?**
	Ans. “_Finite Deity always seeks a double correlation, inner towards Paradise and its Deities, and outer towards infinity and the Absolutes._” [[UB 115:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p6_6)]
31. **How did God the Supreme function in Havona before the creation of the seven superuniverses?**
	Ans: “_It only worked on spiritual levels._” [[UB 56:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p6_2)]
32. **Describe some of the ways in which the growth of the Supreme can be paralleled with the growth of the mortal soul**
	Ans.: Just as mortals rely upon solar energy for the maintenance of life, so the grand universe depends upon the inexhaustible energies emanating from Nether Paradise for the maintenance of the material activities and the cosmic movements of space. Mind has been given to men to enable them to become conscious of their own identity and personality; and a mind—even a Supreme Mind—has been bestowed upon the totality of the finite that the spirit of the emerging personality of the cosmos may ever strive for the domination of energy-matter. Mortal man is responsive to the guidance of spirit, even as the grand universe is responsive to the vast grasp of the spirit gravity of the Eternal Son, to the universal supermaterial cohesion of the eternal spirit values of all creations contained in the finite cosmos of time and space. Human beings are capable of forever identifying themselves with the total and indestructible reality of the universe — through fusion with the indwelling Thought Adjuster. Likewise, the Supreme is perpetually dependent upon the absolute stability of Original Deity, the Paradise Trinity. Man’s aspiration to Paradise perfection, his striving to attain God, creates in the living cosmos a tension of genuine divinity which can be resolved only through the evolution of an immortal soul. This is what happens in the experience of the individual human creature, but when all creatures and Creators of the grand universe strive for God and divine perfection, there is established a profound cosmic tension which finds its resolution only in the sublime synthesis of almighty power with the spirit person of the evolving God of all creatures, the Supreme Being....Man grows consciously from the material to the spiritual by the force, power, and persistence of his own decisions; he grows also as his Thought Adjuster develops new techniques for descending from the spiritual to the morontia levels of the soul; and as soon as the soul comes into existence, it begins to grow in and of itself. This somewhat resembles the mode of expansion of the Supreme Being. His sovereignty grows in and through the acts and accomplishments of the Supreme Creator Personalities; it is the evolution of the majesty of his power as ruler of the grand universe. His nature as Deity is also dependent upon the pre-existent unity of the Paradise Trinity. But there is still another aspect to the evolution of God the Supreme: not only does he evolve through the Creators and derive from the Trinity, but he also evolves through himself and derives from himself._» [[UB 116:7.2-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p7_2)]
	See also the Apocalypse: 21 — 22 “I saw no temple there; for the Lord God Almighty is its temple, and the Lamb.” Job: 37 — 23: “We cannot reach Him, the Almighty: He is great in power and in justice, and he does not bend perfect justice.” See also at [[UB 112:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_13)] “The joint child”, in [[UB 116:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p6_5)] “the child of the Supreme” and in [[UB 196:3.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_16)] “Child of all absolute values”.
33. **The Supreme Almighty functions in three capacities: one in the Central Universe (Havona), another in the Grand Universe, and thirdly in the Master Universe. What is the nature of these functions?**
	Ans.: 1) “_In the Central Universe he functions as a spirit personality._ 2) _In the Grand Universe he functions as God the Absolute_. 3) _In the Master Universe he functions as an unknown mental potential._” [[UB 116:0.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p0_5)]
34. **The Supreme Being, our non-absolute experiential God of space-time, is gaining power as the Almighty Ruler of the supercreations (in the outer spaces). Some of his evolving power comes from the perfected and ascending beings of space-time. From what other sources or transactions does he derive this great power?**
	Ans.: “_By the mysterious mobilization of the six other Corps of finaliters._” [[UB 31:10.17-18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p10_17)]
35. **Name the other six Finaliter Corps, and indicate who leads them.**
	1. _The Corps of Paradise Finaliters._
	2. _The Body of Trinitized Finaliters._
	3. _The Body of Jointly Trinitized Finaliters._
	4. _The Corps of Havona Finaliters._
	5. _The Corps of Transcendental Finaliters._
	6. _The Body of the Unrevealed Sons of Destiny._
	Note that the Dean of the Master Architects is responsible for the supervision of the seven bodies of the Finality. The group of leaders of each of these bodies constitutes the “Supreme Council of Destiny.” [[UB 31:10.1-9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p10_1)]
36. **Will outer space beings contribute to the evolutionary growth of the Supreme Being?**
	Ans.: No. The outer space levels will not participate in the finite growth of the ascending existence of universal life. This is a tremendous experiential handicap—the deprivation of participation in the evolution of the Almighty Supreme. [[UB 31:10.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p10_21)]
37. **A.) What is the basis of all existence?**
	Ans.: Energy.
	**B) What is the foundation of the universe?**
	Ans. The Material. [[UB 42:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p0_1)]
38. **What is the monument that demonstrates and proves the existence and presence of the Universal Absolute?**
	Ans: Force and energy is the proof. [[UB 42:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p0_1)] (Note that in this paragraph the reference to the Universal Absolute probably refers to all the Absolute potentials of infinity.)
39. **By what personal will and by what mandates is universal energy manipulated?**
	Ans.: By the Universal Father. [[UB 42:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p0_2)]
40. **How and by whom is this power modified?**
	Ans.: By the Eternal Son. also, by the Father and the Son acting together and executed by the Conjoint Actor. (The Infinite Spirit). [[UB 42:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p0_2)]
41. **In The Urantia Book, what word designates A), the phenomena of movement, action and potential energy levels? B), the stages of energies preceding gravity? C), the stages following gravity?**
	Ans: A), “_Energy_” refers to motion, action, and potential levels. B), “_force_” refers to the pregravity stage—“emergent energy,” C), “_power_” refers to the postgravity stage—“physical energy.”
42. **Which of the Seven Absolutes is present throughout all space and by what name is it designated as such?**
	Ans.: “_The Unqualified Absolute_”: the potentials of infinity. The uncontested presence in free space of the Unqualified Absolute is called “_Space Power_”. [[UB 42:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_3)]
43. **Where does the Universal Father center his spatial potentials?**
	Ans.: “_On the lower face of Paradise...the fulcrum zone of the Unqualified Absolute...the center of the paradisiacal cycle of cosmic reality._” [[UB 42:2.3-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_3)]
44. **How, at the beginning of its evolution, is space power transformed from existential potential (space power) into emergent-powerful energy?**
	Ans.: “_By the presence...of the Primary Externalization Force Organizing Masters._” [[UB 42:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_8)]
45. **Where are the headquarters of the Externalized Primary Force Organizers and where do they operate? Why are they different from most other beings?**
	Ans: “_They reside on Paradise Island, but operate throughout the Master Universe, especially in the realms of unorganized space. They are neither creatures nor creators, and withstand temperatures...that would be intolerable even to Physical Controllers._” [[UB 29:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p5_1) and [UB 29:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p5_7)]
46. **How many divisions are the Master Force Organizers organized into?**
	Ans: There are two divisions, 1) “_Primary Externalized Force Organizing Masters_ and 2), _Associate Transcendental Force Organizing Masters._” [[UB 29:5.2-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p5_2)]
47. **What is the function of the first division?**
	Ans.: “_The Primary Master Force Organizers are the manipulators of the primordial or fundamental space forces of the Unqualified Absolute; they are creators of nebulae. They are the living instigators of the energy cyclones of space and the primary organizers and orientators of these gigantic manifestations. These force organizers transmute the primordial force (pre-energy not susceptible to the direct gravity of Paradise) into potent or primary energy, which causes it to pass from the exclusive grasp of the Unqualified Absolute to the gravitational grasp of the Isle of Paradise. After this, the associated force organizers succeed them and continue the process of transmutation of energy from the primary stage to the secondary stage of energy-gravity...but only to the grasp of the Father._” [[UB 29:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p5_5)]
48. **While space power is a prereality, the domain of the Unqualified Absolute, and responds only to the personal grasp of the Father, how is this process of transmutation made possible by the Master Force Organizers?**
	Ans.: By their passive presence which causes sufficient resistance to transform the vacant and reactive static space power into active primordial force, in response to the resistance offered by the mere presence of the Primary Force Organizing Masters. It is the primary differential function which sets in motion an active space field on which they begin their initial and active operations. To use a layman's expression this hitherto “unused” force is a coagulated mass. [[UB 42:2.7-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_7); [UB 42:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_10) and [UB 105:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/105#p3_8)]
49. **This primordial force goes through two distinct phases of transmutation before appearing as a universe power. Name them both.**
	Ans: “_powerful energy_” and “_gravitational energy_”. [[UB 42:2.10-12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_10), 2, 3]
50. **Briefly describe what the primary phase of emergent energy is.**
	Ans.: “_It is the powerful energy of orientation, of mass movements, of high tension and violent reaction — gigantic energy systems — set in motion by the activities of the primary force organizers. This primary energy or powerful energy is not in the first instance clearly responsive to the gravitational pull of Paradise, although its aggregate mass and direction in space are probably responsive to the collective group of absolute influences operating from lower Paradise. When the energy emerges at the level of initial responsiveness to the circular grip of absolute Paradise gravity, the primary force organizers give way to the action of their secondary associates._” [[UB 42:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_11)]
51. **Briefly describe what gravitational energy is.**
	Ans. “_The next appearing energy which is sensitive to gravity contains the potential of universe power and becomes the active ancestor of all universe matter. This secondary or gravitational energy is the product of the energy elaborations resulting from the pressure-presence and tension-tendencies established by the Associated Transcendental Force Organizing Masters. In response to the work of these force manipulators, space energy rapidly passes from the potent to the gravitational stage and thus becomes directly sensitive to the circular (absolute) grip of Paradise gravity. It reveals at the same time a certain potential of sensitivity to the pull of linear gravity inherent in the material masses which promptly appear with the electronic and post-electronic stages of energy and matter. When gravity sensitivity arises, the Associated Master Force Organizers can withdraw from the energy cyclones of space, provided that the Universe Power Directors can be assigned to this field of action... We are quite uncertain about the exact causes of the early stages of force evolution, but we recognize the intelligent activity of the Ultimate in both levels of manifestation of emerging energy._ » [[UB 42:2.12-13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_12)]
52. **What other intelligent action is present in these two levels of emerging energy manifestation?**
	Ans.: “_We recognize the intelligent activity of the Ultimate in both levels of manifestation of emergent energy_” [[UB 42:2.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_14)] (power and gravity energies).
53. **What are these two manifestations called on Uversa?**
	Ans: They are called “ULTIMATA”. [[UB 42:2.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_14)]
54. **When space force was changed into space energy and then into gravitationally controlled energy, what was the result?**
	Ans. This constitutes the “_Power of Universe_” [[UB 42:2.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_15)]
55. **Do the Force Organizers decide when and how to transmute space power into energy for the building of creation?**
	Ans.: No. “_These two powerful orders of primordial space force manipulators work exclusively under the supervision of the Architects of the Master Universe._” [[UB 29:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p5_6)] and [351.9]
56. **When a Creator Son has completed his plans for the creation of a local universe and has selected the site where he desires to build his universe; after the Master Architects have submitted a few sites to be chosen for these gigantic manifestations of power, they are ready to serve the Creator Son. Who is delegated to manipulate the power of such creation?**
	Ans. The Power Directors. The Associated Master Force Organizers give way to the various orders of Power Directors operating in the superuniverse of cosmic jurisdiction. This work is accomplished by the energy directors, centers, and controllers in the Grand Universe. [[UB 42:2.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_15)] and [[UB 29:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p5_6)]
57. **In the absence of such plans, what happens to these gigantic aggregates?**
	Ans. “_...in the absence of such plans, the Associated Force Organizers continue indefinitely to deal with these material creations, as they do now in outer space._” [[UB 29:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p5_6)]
58. **Where is the headquarters of the Seven Supreme Power Directors?**
	Ans.: “_The Seven Supreme Directors of Power are stationed on the Peripheral Paradise, where their presence moves slowly indicating the location where the centers of power of the Master Spirits reside._” [[UB 29:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p1_3)]
59. **Do the Seven Supreme Power Directors function individually or collectively as regulators of the physical energy of the Grand Universe?**
	Ans. “_...These power directors function individually in regulating power-energy in the superuniverses, but collectively in the administration of the central creation._” [[UB 29:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p1_3)]
60. **By whom were these Grand Universe energy regulators created?**
	Ans.: Collectively, “_by the Seven Master Spirits._” [[UB 29:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p1_1)]
61. **Can Power Directors alternate between themselves and work with Master Minds from other universes?**
	Ans.: No. “Each of the Master Spirits is thus in eternal union with one of their collective descendants. The same director always remains associated with the same Spirit, and their active cooperation is manifested by an association of a unique kind between physical energies and spiritual energies, between a semi-physical being and a spiritual personality._” [[UB 29:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p1_2)]
62. **After the Master Spirits personalized the Seven Supreme Power Directors, what important event took place between them and their parents, the Master Spirits?**
	Ans: “_...and then collaborated with their parents to create more than ten billion associates._” [[UB 29:0.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p0_10)]
63. **What is the incentive that gave rise to this study of the power-system of the cosmos?**
	Ans.: “...the power directors and their associates have been the least understood on Urantia.” “...you have received but little information concerning the controllers and regulators of the physical realm.” “With your knowledge of material creatures, you have, at least by contrast, a conception of spiritual beings...” [319:1 and 11] “And, difficult as it may be to comprehend, it is nevertheless true that archetypal power and loving personality are one and the same universal reality; the Isle of Paradise and the Eternal Son are co-ordinate but antipodal revelations of the unfathomable nature of the Universal Father-Force._” [[UB 104:4.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p4_15)]
64. **Name the four major divisions of living beings having to do with the intelligent regulation of energy throughout the Grand Universe, and identify them.**
	Ans. On page 319.
	1. The Seven Supreme Power Directors. They operate from Paradise, but function as Power Centers in all divisions of the Grand Universe. They have created over ten billion associates. [[UB 29:0.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p0_5) and [UB 29:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p1_3)]
	2. The Supreme Centers of Power. There are seven main groups. Those operating on Havona to those operating in the universes, constellations and systems. [[UB 29:2.2-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p2_2)]
	3. The Master Physical Controllers. These beings exist in seven different orders of the Grand Universe. [[UB 29:4.5-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_5) and [UB 29:4.18-21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_18) ]
	4. The Morontia Power Supervisors. These beings are classified into seven groups. The Morontia Supervisors are not classified as supercontrollers. They work with spiritual and physical energies through the Mother Spirits of the local universes and the Michaels, they are very interesting, very close to mortals, but they govern themselves. They are not to be confused with the Supreme Power Centers, who are the associates of the Supreme Power Directors who work only with physical power and are stationed on the worlds of the Infinite Spirit.
	Note: Refer to question No. 22, and clarify in your mind where these three divisions lie with the sevenfold controllers of the Grand Universe.
65. **Concerning the Supreme Centers of Power: A.) Who are these centers? B.) What types of beings are they? C.) Where are they located?**
	Ans.:
	A.) They are the associates of the Power Directors as well as the mobile assistants and subordinates of the Master Physical Controllers.
	B.) “_...the Supreme Power Directors are beings of great freedom of will and action....They are all endowed with Third Source personality...These directing centers of the universe power system are endowed with exquisite intelligence. They are the intellect of the grand universe power system and the secret of the mind-control technique of the entire immense network of vast functions exercised by the Master Physical Controllers and the Morontia Power Supervisors._” [[UB 29:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p2_9)] See question 62 for their origin.
	C.) **Their group or order name corresponds to their position.**
66. Name the seven groups of Power Centers and describe their activities.
	1. The Supreme Center Supervisors. “These Seven co-ordinates and associates of the Supreme Power Directors are the regulators of the master energy circuits of the grand universe. Each center supervisor has his headquarters on one of the special worlds of the Seven Supreme Executives and works in close association with these co-ordinators of general universe affairs.” [[UB 29:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p2_10)], read page 198:\# 1.
	2. The Havona Centers. “_A million of these have ever functioned in the central creation, each center having charge of supervising a thousand Havona worlds...Perfection in the regulation of energy is the ultimate goal of all power centers and physical controllers of space._” [[UB 29:2.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p2_12)]
	3. The Centers of the Superuniverses. There are 1,000 Centers on the capital of each superuniverse. Three primary energy streams, each subdivided into ten segregations, enter these Power Centers. A total of thirty physical space energies constitute the electronic organization of universe power. [voir [UB 29:2.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p2_13)]
	4. The Local Universe Centers. “_One hundred power centers of the fourth order are stationed on the headquarters world of each local universe. They function to lower and still further modify the seven circuits of power emanating from their superuniverse headquarters, so as to make them applicable to the services of the constellations and systems...They are of great assistance to the Creator Sons._” [[UB 29:2.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p2_16)]
	5. The Constellation Centers. “_Ten of these living centers of power are stationed in each constellation and operate as projectors of energy to the hundred local tributary systems._” [[UB 29:2.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p2_17)]
	6. The Systems Centers. “_A Supreme Center of Power is permanently assigned to each local system. These system centers send the circuits of power to the inhabited worlds of time and space. They coordinate the activities of subordinate physical controllers..._” [[UB 29:2.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p2_18)]
	7. Unclassified Centers. “_These are the centers which operate in special local situations, but outside the inhabited planets. The individual worlds are entrusted to the care of the Master Physical Controllers..._” [[UB 29:2.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p2_19)]
67. **Will we mortals have the opportunity to come into direct contact with the Supreme Power Directors or Power Centers?**
	Ans: No. We will have nothing to do with them. [[UB 29:0.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p0_11)]
68. **With regard to the Power Centers and their subordinates, the Physical Controllers:**
	1. **Are they subject to training?**
	Ans.: No. They are all born perfect, and perfection in action is inherent in them.
	2. **Are they resting or can they play games?**
	Ans.: They “_never indulge in games;... and are always on duty... These beings can never abandon, even for a fraction of a second, their direct supervision of the energy circuits of time and space._” [[UB 29:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p3_4)]
	3. **Is there any evolution in their ranks?**
	Ans.: _There is no evolution in their ranks,... and they always serve in their original assignment... this is true for the seven divisions of both orders._ [[UB 29:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p3_4)]
	4. **Are they free from any fear of arrest or interference by any court?**
	Ans.: “_The Supreme Directors of Power and all their associates, assistants and subordinates are forever free from any fear of arrest or interference by any space tribunal._” [[UB 29:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p3_2)]
	5. **What is their relationship with gravity?**
	Ans: “_Their relationship with gravity is entirely negative._” [[UB 29:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p3_6)]
69. **Apart from Havona, do these Centers operate on evolutionary planets or suns?**
	Ans.: No. “_The Supreme Centers of Power operate only on specially constructed (architectural) spheres or other space bodies otherwise suitably constituted. The architectural worlds are so constructed that the living centers of power can act as selective switches to direct, modify, and focus the energies of space as they pour upon these spheres._” [[UB 29:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p3_9)]
70. **Are the Universe Power Directors concerned with the stupendous force activities now taking place outside the present boundaries of the seven superuniverses?**
	Ans.: No. “_The Universe Power Directors have absolutely nothing to do with the stupendous force activities now taking place outside the present boundaries of the seven superuniverses._” [[UB 29:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p3_10)]
