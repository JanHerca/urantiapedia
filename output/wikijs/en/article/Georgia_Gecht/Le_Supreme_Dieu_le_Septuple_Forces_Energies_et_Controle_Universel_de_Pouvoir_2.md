Following Link 19, here are the 30 remaining questions:

71. **Concerning the Master Physical Controllers: who created them? Name the seven orders.**
	Ans.: They come directly from the Supreme Centers of Power, but created with or by various other orders.
	The seven orders are:
	1.. The Deputy Power Directors.
	2.. Machine Controllers.
	3.. Energy Transformers.
	4.. Energy Transmitters.
	5.. The Primary Associates.
	6.. Secondary Dissociators.
	7.. The Frandalanks and the Chronoldeks. <a id="a48_42"></a>[[UB 29:4.4-11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_4)]
72. **Give a brief description of the most important functions of each of these orders of Master Physical Controllers.**
	Ans.:
	1. The Deputy Power Directors: “These wonderfully efficient beings are charged with the assignment and dispatch of the Master Physical Controllers of all orders according to the ever-changing needs of the ever-changing energy status of the realms. The vast reserves of physical controllers are maintained on the headquarters worlds of the minor sectors, and from these points of concentration they are periodically dispatched by the deputy power directors to the universe, constellation, and system headquarters and to the individual planets. . . . Three million deputy power directors are assigned to each of the minor sectors of Orvonton, making our superuniverse quota of three billion of these beings endowed with an astonishing variety of talents. . . . These directors serve alternate periods of administrative duty in the minor sectors and periods of inspection duty in the realms of space.” <a id="a51_900"></a>[[UB 29:4.15-17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_15)]
	2. The Machinary Controllers. “_Billions upon trillions of them are commissioned in Ensa, your minor sector._” They are highly intelligent beings, “_They possess the living gift of antigravity to a degree exceeding that of all other beings.... Ten of these controllers are presently stationed on Urantia, where one of their principal planetary activities is to facilitate the departure of seraphic transports. In this function the ten machinary controllers all act in unison, while a coupled series of a thousand energy transmitters provide the initial life force for the seraphic departure._” <a id="a52_595"></a>[[UB 29:4.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_19)]
	3. The Energy Transformers. “These transformers are powerful and efficient living switches.... The number of these beings in a superuniverse is incredible. There are nearly a million of them in the Satania system alone, and the usual quota is one hundred per inhabited world.... The energy transformers are the joint creation of the Seven Supreme Power Directors and the Seven Central Supervisors.... Except when an assistant power director is present on an inhabited world, the transformers are in command. They are the planetary inspectors of all outgoing seraphic transports.... They are also adept in their efforts to isolate the planets from the powerful energy currents which pass between gigantic planetary or stellar neighbors. Their energy-transmuting attributes make them especially useful in the important task of maintaining the universal energy balance or equilibrium of power. At times they appear to be consuming or accumulating energy. To others, they appear to exude or release energy. Energy transformers are the joint creation of the Seven Supreme Power Directors and the Seven Central Supervisors._ » <a id="a53_1122"></a>[[UB 29:4.22-28](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_24)]
	4. Energy Transmitters. “_They are wonderful distributors of energy...When energy is to be diverted to another circuit, transmitters are deployed in a line along the desired path of energy, and by virtue of their extraordinary attributes of energy attraction, they can actually induce an increased flow of energy in the desired direction...They can make a distant scene ”visible“ as well as a distant sound ”audible“...Transmitters as well as energy transformers are indispensable to the maintenance of mortal existence on worlds whose atmospheres are depleted, and they form an integral part of the technique of life on planets inhabited by non-breathers._” <a id="a54_660"></a>[[UB 29:4.27-32](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_27)]
	5. The Primary Associators. “_In a manner similar to a plant storing sunlight, these living organisms store energy during periods of excess manifestation...they operate as living catalysts...During periods of deficit manifestation, they have the power to release these stored energies...The Associators always operate in accordance with universal law, wielding and manipulating atoms, electrons, and ultimatons as you manipulate adjustable printing type to make the same alphabetic symbols tell profoundly different stories._” <a id="a55_528"></a>[[UB 29:4.32-33](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_32)]
	6. The Secondary Dissociators. “_Compared to the primary associators, these beings endowed with immense antigravitational faculties are the workers whose functions are inverse... They are truly the alchemists of space_” <a id="a56_221"></a>[[UB 29:4.35](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_35)]
	7. The Frandalanks. “_These beings are the joint creation of the three orders of energy controllers: the primary and secondary force organizers and the power directors...The frandalanks are created in thirty divisions, one for each fundamental form of universal force... These living barometers are concerned solely with automatically and unerringly recording the status of all forms of force-energy. They are to the physical universe what the vast reflectivity mechanism is to the mental universe. The frandalanks who record time in addition to the quantitative and qualitative presence of energy are called chronoldeks._” <a id="a57_625"></a>[[UB 29:4.36-37](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_36)]
73. **What is the Frandalanks' relationship to the timeline?**
	Ans. “_The frandalanks that record time in addition to the quantitative and qualitative presence of energy are called chronoldeks._” <a id="a59_134"></a>[[UB 29:4.37](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_37)] They are always in service of the higher orders of the controllers. They can be compared to computers, but they are living entities.
74. **How many primary energy streams are there going into the thousand Power Centers at the superuniverse headquarters?**
	Ans.: Exactly three primary energies are brought into the centers. Each of these three streams has three forms of energy. “Three streams of primary energy, each of which is subdivided into ten segregations, enter these power centers...The power charge of a superuniverse consists of three phases of energy, each of which is subdivided into ten._” <a id="a61_348"></a>[[UB 29:2.12-14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p2_12)]
75. **Who directs these three phases of primary energies to the thousand superuniverse headquarters centers for transformation for local use?**
	Ans.: “_The energy which then appears, and which is sensitive to gravity, contains the potential of universe power and becomes the active ancestor of all matter in the universe. This secondary or gravitational energy is the product of the energy elaborations resulting from the pressure-presence and tension-tendencies established by the Associated Transcendental Force Organizing Masters._” <a id="a63_393"></a>[[UB 42:2.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_12)]
76. **How many specialized and well-directed but imperfectly controlled circuits of power are there issuing from this unified seat of action at the superuniverse headquarters of these Centers?**
	Ans. Exactly seven. “Three primary energy currents, each of which is subdivided into ten segregations, enter these power centers” <a id="a65_131"></a>[[UB 29:2.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p2_13)]. (See also question 66, under number 3)
77. **To what extent do the Seven Power Directors of Paradise govern the Physical Master Controllers?**
	Ans.: “They are governed directly from Paradise by the Seven Supreme Power Directors down to the headquarters of the superuniverses... These high commissioners are empowered to interpret the observations and recordings of the master frandalanks, those living instruments which indicate the power pressure and energy charge of an entire superuniverse._” <a id="a67_354"></a>[[UB 29:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_2)]
78. **Who then directs and distributes these mobile assistants to the Centers?**
	Ans: The Balance Council. “_From this level onwards, they are directed and distributed by the Balance Council_” <a id="a69_113"></a>[[UB 29:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_2)]
79. **Who is part of the Balance Council and what is their origin?**
	Ans.: it is “_composed of high commissioners of power detached from the personnel of the Master Organizers of Force Associated by the Seven Master Spirits._” <a id="a71_159"></a>[[UB 29:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_2)]
80. **What are the skills or powerful power of these associates of the Force Organizers (the Balance Council) that make their presence required rather than that of the Associate Power Directors?**
	“_These high commissioners are authorized to interpret the observations and recordings of the master frandalanks, those living instruments which indicate the power pressure and energy charge of an entire superuniverse._” <a id="a73_222"></a>[[UB 29:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_2)]
81. Who are the Morontia Supervisors? (See question 64, number 4),
	Ans.: They are the energy regulators who supervise activities combining the spiritual and the physical—the semimaterial energies. “These unique beings are exclusively concerned with the supervision of those activities which represent a viable combination of spiritual and physical or semimaterial energies. They are exclusively devoted to the ministry of morontia progress. . . . They are the channels of morontia power which sustain and energize the morontia phases of the transition worlds.” “The Morontia Power Supervisors are able to effect a union of material and spiritual energies and thus organize a morontia form of materialization responsive to the superimposition of a controlling spirit.” <a id="a75_702"></a>[[UB 48:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_1) and <a id="a75_749"></a>[UB 48:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p1_5)]
82. **Will we mortals have contact with the Morontia Power Supervisors?**
	Ans.: “_As for the morontia power supervisors, you will work with them in complete freedom when you reach the mansion worlds._” <a id="a77_129"></a>[[UB 29:0.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p0_11)]
83. **Does their ministry extend to us during the transition experience?**
	No. “They devote themselves exclusively to the ministry of morontia progress, not so much as they minister to mortals during the transition experience, but rather because they make possible a transitional environment for progressing morontia creatures.” <a id="a79_255"></a>[[UB 48:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_1)]
84. **So how do we work with them?**
	“...these same patient and skillful Morontia Power Supervisors will successively provide you with 570 morontia bodies, each of which constitutes a phase of your progressive transformation.” <a id="a81_191"></a>[[UB 48:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p1_5)]
85. **A). When do these changes happen?**
	Ans.: “_From the time you leave the material worlds until you are established as a first-stage spirit on Salvington, you undergo exactly 570 separate ascension morontia changes, of which 8 take place in-system, 71 in the constellation, and 491 during the sojourn on the Salvington spheres._” <a id="a83_293"></a>[[UB 48:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p1_5)]
	**B). Will we realize the reactions caused by these changes?**
	Ans.: Yes “_These progressive changes result in new reactions to the morontia environment, such as changes in dietary needs and many other personal uses._” <a id="a85_157"></a>[[UB 48:2.23](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_23)]
86. Who created and directs the Morontia Supervisors?
	Ans.: “_The Morontia Power Supervisors are the offspring of the local universe Mother Spirit._” <a id="a87_97"></a>[[UB 48:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_2)], and “_They are exclusively directed by the joint activity of the Universe Son and the Universe Spirit, but otherwise govern themselves with complete autonomy._” <a id="a87_303"></a>[[UB 48:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_11)]
87. Morontia Power Supervisors are created in groups of one thousand. Name them as they are classified, their numbers, and briefly summarize their activities as described in 542: \#2:
	1. The Circuit Regulators. These are created in groups of 400. “These are the unique beings who coordinate physical and spiritual energy and regulate its flow in the selected channels of the morontia spheres, and these circuits are exclusively planetary, limited to a single world. The morontia circuits are distinct from both the physical and the spiritual circuits of the transition worlds to which they are added. And it takes millions of these regulators even to activate just one mansion world system such as that of Satania. . . . As a dynamo generates electricity apparently from the atmosphere, so these living morontia dynamos appear to transform the ubiquitous energies of space into materials which the morontia supervisors introduce into the bodies and life activities of ascending mortals.” [543.7,8]
	2. The System Coordinators. “_Ascending mortals progress gradually from physical to spiritual as they advance from one morontia world to another, hence the necessity of providing them with an ascending scale of morontia spheres and an ascending scale of morontia forms.... The system coordinators skillfully effect the necessary changes in creature form. To effect these initial modifications of morontia forms requires approximately seven days of standard time._” <a id="a90_466"></a>[[UB 48:2.16-18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_16)] (The Orvonton standard day is nearly equivalent to thirty Urantia days, <a id="a90_587"></a>[UB 15:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p7_2)). This entire procedure is equivalent to 120 Urantia days. It is, of course, a very slow procedure so that we do not experience a shock, nor do we have to be asleep while the vibratory rate is greatly increased.
	3. The Planetary Custodians. “_Each morontia world, from the mansion spheres to the universe headquarters, is entrusted—as far as morontia affairs are concerned—to the care of seventy guardians. They constitute the local planetary council having supreme morontia authority. This council grants to all ascending creatures who land on its sphere materials for their morontia form._” <a id="a91_382"></a>[[UB 48:2.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_18)]
	4. The Conjugate Controllers. “One of these highly mechanical beings is always stationed at the center of each administrative unit on a morontia world. A Conjugate Controller is sensitive to physical, spiritual, and morontia energies. He functions symbiotically with them and is always associated with two systems coordinators, four circuit regulators, a planetary conservator, a linkage stabilizer, and either an associate recorder or a selective sorter.” <a id="a92_458"></a>[[UB 48:2.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_19)]
	5. The Bond Stabilizers. “They are the regulators of the morontia energies in association with the physical and spiritual forces of the realm. They make possible the conversion of morontia energy into morontia materials. The entire morontia organization of existence depends upon the stabilizers. They slow down the rotation of the energies to the point where they can become physical.” [544.3]
	6. The Selective Matchers. “It is the task of the selective matchers to keep you in progressive synchronism with the morontia life.... There is a functional progression which gradually extends from the material to the spiritual. Your adaptation to this basically uniform creation, but marked by stages of advancement and spiritualization, is effected by this selective attunement.... You may submit yourself repeatedly to the tests of these examiners. As soon as you demonstrate the appropriate spiritual progress, they will gladly attest that you are qualified for advancement. These progressive changes result in new reactions to the morontia environment, such as changes in dietary requirements and many other personal uses.... The selective matchers also render great service in grouping morontia personalities for study, teaching, and other projects. They naturally indicate those beings who will work best in temporary association.” <a id="a94_940"></a>[[UB 48:2.21-24](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_21)]
	7. The Associate Archivists. “_The morontia world has its own archivists who serve in association with the spirit archivists in the supervision and preservation of the records and other data indigenous to the morontia creations. The morontia records are available to all orders of personality... and by the time you leave the morontia regime you will have seen all orders of spirits except a few higher types such as the Solitary Messengers._” <a id="a95_445"></a>[[UB 48:2.25-27](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p2_25)]
88. **Concerning the control of energy. Three basic phases of energy (currents) are carried to the superuniverse headquarters, each separated into ten divisions. Over how many of these thirty energies can the Centers and Master Physical Controllers exercise perfect control?**
	Ans.: “_The power centers and controllers exercise perfect control over only seven of the ten forms of energy contained in each of the basic universe currents.... Ten of these controllers are presently stationed on Urantia, where one of their principal planetary activities is to facilitate the departure of the seraphic transports. In this function the ten mechanical controllers all act in unison, while a coupled series of one thousand energy transmitters furnish the initial life force for the seraphic departure._” <a id="a97_521"></a>[[UB 29:3.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p3_11) and <a id="a97_570"></a>[UB 29:4.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_19)] (See question 74)
89. **A. How many of these thirty space energy forms are Energy Transformers capable of altering the form and potential of?**
	Ans.: “_They can and do change the physical form of the energies of space...they are actually capable of altering the form and potential of twenty-seven of the thirty physical energies of the superuniverse power charge._” <a id="a99_223"></a>[[UB 29:4.25](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_25)] (See question 71, #3)
	**B. Do they do this work independently?**
	Ans: No, they need help from their fellow controllers. <a id="a101_56"></a>[[UB 29:4.25](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_25)]
90. **As the Power Centers and Controllers can only exercise perfect control over seven of the ten energies contained in the three basic currents of the universe, the remaining three forms in each current (nine in total), are of a more subtle form of physical energy. What happens to these nine more subtle energies?**
	Ans.: Those forms of energies which are partially or totally free from the control of the Centers and Controllers, must represent the unpredictable realms of energy manifestation dominated by the Unqualified Absolute. <a id="a103_219"></a>[[UB 29:3.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p3_11)]
91. **We are also informed that the Machinary Controllers, (the second order of the Master Physical Controllers), are able to manipulate and control six of these nine forms of energy (27 out of 30) and that they sometimes react automatically to certain impulses from the Universal Absolute. <a id="a104_291"></a>[[UB 29:3.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p3_11)] Can we then assume that these Machinary Controllers as well as the Energy Transformers are agents of the Unqualified Absolute?**
	Ans.: No. “_The fact that three of these energies are beyond their control proves that they are not agents of the Unqualified Absolute._” <a id="a105_139"></a>[[UB 29:4.25](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_25)]
92. **How does the Unqualified Absolute figure in these transmutations, and are these living mechanisms of power aware of influences other than their own?**
	Ans: “_The Unqualified Absolute is a positive reality permeating the grand universe...[it] is a positive supercontrol of the universe in infinity.” “These living mechanisms of power are not consciously connected to the master universe's energetic supercontrol of the Unqualified Absolute...but are always aware of the superenergetic presence and indiscernible action of the Unqualified Absolute._” <a id="a107_399"></a>[[UB 0:11.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p11_8) and <a id="a107_446"></a>[UB 29:3.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p3_12)]
93. **What exactly is the work done by the Centers and their associates regarding the transmutation of physical energies for local use?**
	Ans.: They transmute the ultimaton into the revolving circuits within the electron. They “manipulate” the basic units of energy—the ultimatons—this is the primitive state of energy. In conjunction with the Physical Controllers, the Centers can actually control and direct energy even in the electronic stage. They are able to alter the revolutions of the ultimatons and at the same time transform this energy association so as to create this new substance—the morontia substance. <a id="a109_481"></a>[[UB 48:1.3-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p1_3)]
94. Are architectural worlds, such as transition worlds, made entirely of morontia elements?
	Ans.: No. “_All these worlds are architectural spheres which have exactly twice as many elements as the evolved planets. These custom-made worlds abound not only in heavy metals and crystals. They have their hundred physical elements, and in addition exactly one hundred forms of a unique organization of energy called morontia material._” <a id="a111_341"></a>[[UB 48:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p1_3)]
95. **Can the Centers and their associates effectively control this material energy when electronically organized energy is launched into the vortices of atomic systems?**
	Ans.: “_The power centers and their associates are most actively engaged in transmuting the ultimaton into the circuits and revolutions of electrons [when] these unique beings control and compose power by skillfully manipulating the basic units of materialized energy, the ultimatons... [They] always operate in accordance with universal law._” <a id="a113_346"></a>[[UB 42:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p4_3) and <a id="a113_393"></a>[UB 29:4.33](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_33)]
96. **Why can't they control the atomic system and yet they control the basic circuit system, the ultimaton circuits?**
	Ans. “_Gravity acts positively on the power lines and energy channels of the power centers and physical controllers, but these beings only react negatively to gravity—they exercise their antigravitational faculties._” <a id="a115_219"></a>[[UB 42:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p4_4)]
97. **The space force moves towards Paradise from the outer spaces and is transmuted level by level, to the level on which it can be “worked”, that of the energy power of the universes of time and space. Then it moves towards Havona [470.8] (These are the dual movements of the cycle of metamorphoses of reality, actual existents taking on a potential character <a id="a116_362"></a>[[UB 115:3.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_12)]. What happens to these circulating energies as they move inwards, towards Havona?**
	Ans.: “_Power-energy now appears to be reverting back to force, but a force of a very different nature from space-power and primordial force._” (the Unqualified Absolute)
98. **A. Briefly explain the Havona energy system.**
	Ans.: “_The energy systems of Havona are not dual, they are triune. It is the existential energy domain of the Conjoint Actor functioning on behalf of the Paradise Trinity_” [471.0]... “these basic energies manifest seven phases of excitation, so that Havona natives respond to forty-nine different sensation stimuli.” <a id="a119_320"></a>[[UB 14:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p2_3)] **B. Are there 200 chemical elements as in the morontia worlds?** Ans.: “_The materials of Havona consist of exactly one thousand basic chemical elements, plus the balanced function of the seven Havonian energy forms._” <a id="a119_584"></a>[[UB 14:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p2_3)]
99. **What is “transcendental” energy?**
	Ans: “Transcendental energy. This energy system operates on and from the upper level of Paradise and only in relation to the Absonite populations. On Uversa it is called TRANOSTA.” <a id="a121_182"></a>[[UB 42:2.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_18)]
100. **What is the “Monota” energy of Paradise?**
	Ans.: “_... monota is the living, non-spiritual energy of Paradise—an eternal counterpart of the living, spiritual energy of the Original Son—hence the non-spiritual energy system of the Universal Father... We cannot differentiate by their nature the spirit of Paradise and the monota of Paradise; they are apparently similar._” <a id="a123_330"></a>[[UB 42:2.19-20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_19)]

**Summary**

> « _Il y a la force, l'énergie et le pouvoir, mais tous n'ont qu'une seule origine. Les sept superunivers sont apparemment de nature duelle, et l'univers central de nature trine, mais le Paradis est de constitution unique...L'Absolu Non Qualifié soutient l'univers physique alors que l'Absolu de Déité motive le délicat supercontrôle de toute la réalité matérielle, et ces deux Absolus sont fonctionnellement unifiés par l'Absolu Universel._ » <a id="a127_445"></a>[[UB 55:4.5-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p4_5)]

> “_On absolute levels, energy and spirit are one. But the moment departure is made from such absolute levels, difference appears, and as energy and spirit move spaceward from Paradise, the gulf between them widens until in the local universes they have become quite divergent. They are no longer identical, neither are they alike, and mind must intervene to interrelate them._” (<a id="a129_380"></a>[[UB 116:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p6_3))

> “_The moment you depart from the unqualified concept of the infinite personality of the Paradise Father, you must postulate MIND as the inevitable technique of unifying the ever-widening divergence of these dual universe manifestations of the original monothetic Creator personality, the First Source and Center—the I AM._” (<a id="a131_327"></a>[[UB 56:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p1_6))

With regard to the Grand Universe (Havona and the superuniverses): “This domain of power-energy-matter is the realm of the intelligent activities of the Sevenfold functioning under the time-space overcontrol of the Supreme.” <a id="a133_225"></a>[[UB 42:2.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_15)] “…the power centers are closely associated in some manner with the cosmic overcontrol of the Supreme Being.” <a id="a133_380"></a>[[UB 29:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p3_3)] “Your world, Urantia, is one of many similar inhabited planets comprised in the local universe of Nebadon. This universe, with other similar creations, forms the superuniverse of Orvonton, with its capital at Uversa, from which our commission comes.
