Everyone has a birth mother. And, to foster greater love within the family circle, much can be gained from discovering and knowing the _divine feminine_. 

The truth of motherhood begins all the way from the Trinity in Paradise, and continues to God the Mother, the Supreme Being. <a id="a38_125"></a>[[UB 117:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p6_8)] " _All soul- evolving humans are literally the evolutionary sons of God the Father and God the Mother, the Supreme Being._ " This truth is further revealed in the person of our Universe Mother residing at the center of our local universe, and extends to us creatures—parental procreators— and then on to more children. 

Let us think of the person of our Universe Mother as our focal point. She is our near and divine mother who we can, and do, contact on a continual basis, because of the presence of her Holy Spirit on earth. She is ever present with us, and _to be adored_. 

The Greeks had a figure of speech, “The material is the shadow of the more real spirit substance.” I submit to you that the reason our families have fathers and mothers as parents is not mere biological happenstance or unrelated coincidence. The reason lies in the fact that _this is the way it is above_ , in our universe capital where resides Christ our Father, and our Mother, the Creative Spirit. Her Holy Spirit is a personal revelation to us, helping us to understand more clearly who she is and who Christ is. The day has dawned for us to be freed to _Adoration of the Mother_ —to see her and know her, and love her as she is. 

## Views of The Trinity 

Many religions contain trinity concepts, and a clear one is seen in Christianity. Yet some parts of Christendom have been slow to recognize the divine feminine. We hear of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Playing one day with a young child, I assembled several dolls and figurines in a pile on the floor. On a piece of paper I drew three circles. I placed a father on one circle, a baby on the middle, and pointing to the open circle said, “What goes on this circle?” She looked over the group of dolls, animals, and objects, and picked up a woman and placed her on the remaining circle. “A little child shall lead us.” This is a simple and clear picture of the trinity of God. 

And so, it doesn’t require an astute theology to plumb the mystery. The hang up has been, in simplest terms, a dominant cultural orientation slow to honor and recognize women on many levels. Fortunately, we have her spirit with us and wonderful examples all around, clarifying the picture for us.

## Mother Mary

In Catholicism a doctrine was codified by Pope Pius XII (Eugenio Pacelli) in 1950, called the Assumption of Mary. It promulgates the idea that Mary, the mother of Jesus was translated to heaven, without seeing death. It is known that a number of persons, such as Enoch and Elijah, and even people in the current era have been so translated from earth without seeing natural death. Interestingly, there is no verified history, tradition, or record of Mary’s death and burial. I do not have personal knowledge about whether she was translated or not. Yet, when I visit a Catholic or Orthodox church and observe the statues and icons of Mary, some of them quite artistic and beautiful, I enjoy taking some moments spending time contemplating our Universe Mother. Before any hasten to criticize such adoration, let me suggest that such religious practices, though perhaps incomplete, at the same time show an important evolutionary step toward recognition of the Divine Mother. There have been many such theological-evolutionary steps throughout history. 

It should be noted that psychologist Dr. Carl Jung (contemporary of Dr. William Sadler), through his archetype of The Great Mother, viewed this recognition in 1950 as a significant, even monumental development in the human psyche moving toward recognition of the _divine feminine_.

## Radha in Hinduism 

Readers of the revelation have speculated over the years that there could be a connection between the Hindu avatar Krishna and his wife Radha —and the historical Adamson and his wife Ratta. Adamson, the first son of Adam and Eve, was a pure-line violet race progeny (and Krishna is usually portrayed in paintings with blue skin color.) Ratta was the last of the pure- line offspring of the Prince’s staff from Jerusem. What a pair Adamson and Ratta must have been! 

The adoration in India and elsewhere of Radha, and also of Shakti Ma (part of the trinity pantheon with Shiva and Vishnu) shows the idealization of the mother in a large and ancient population. 

There are such examples to be found in every culture, including Danu (the Irish-Celtic goddess mother), El Shaddai and Shekinah (Hebrew feminine concepts of deity), Eve (first mother in many traditions), and Gaia (revived modern pantheistic goddess.) Christian Scientists often refer to God as “Father-Mother God.” The LDS or Mormon church teaches that all human beings are beloved spirit children of the Heavenly Father and the Mother in Heaven. 

## A Dystopian View Without Mother

In an opening scene from the science fiction film-noir movie _Blade Runner_ (Warner Bros., 1982), a “replicant” named Leon (played by Brion James), a near-perfect human-appearing android, is tested by his employer using a machine that magnifies and observes slight changes in the iris of the eye. Leon is asked questions to evoke emotional responses. When Leon is asked about his mother, he becomes enraged and violent. Perhaps the scene contains a message that the mother-child relationship is essentially what makes us human. 

## Mother-Love

A challenge some new believers encounter has to do with calling God “father.” Some of us grew up in loving homes enveloped in fairness, kindness and forgiveness, others to lesser degrees. In our culture individuals deal with the feelings they have about their birth mothers or the mothers who raised them—and just how to carry these experiences forward into their maturing lives. These feelings in some cases help them to recognize the presence of the divine Mother, and in others hinder. 

Fortunately, the religious experience is a transformative one, and transcendent. The way to knowing and loving our divine parents is fully open to all, equally, regardless of our upbringing or heredity. 

## Our Mother Who Is In Heaven 

We are so very lovingly cared for and watched over by our Mother. “Mother, we adore you.” Having covered some preliminary insights, let us now think about the wonderful realities of her ministry to each of us, as disclosed by the revelation of the Urantia papers: 

- The Mother Spirit of Salvington knows you fully, for her Holy Spirit on our world “searches all things.” <a id="a88_107"></a>[[UB 28:5.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p5_22)] It is comforting to know that if any personality in all the wide universes desires or has reason to know about us, such knowledge must be gained from the Mother. _She protects us_. 
- The Universe Mother Spirit never leaves the local universe headquarters world. <a id="a89_81"></a>[[UB 34:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p4_7)] _She is always home_. 
- Christ’s Spirit of Truth works as one with the presence of the spirit of the Mother. "_This dual spirit liaison hovers over the world, seeking to teach truth and to spiritually enlighten your mind, to inspire your soul, and to lead you ever towards the Paradise goal of divine destiny._" <a id="a90_290"></a>[[UB 34:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p5_4)] _Mom and Dad work together._ 
- "_The Holy Spirit is partly independent of your human attitude—and partially conditioned by the decisions and co- operation of your will. The ministry of the Holy Spirit becomes increasingly effective in sanctifying and spiritualizing your inner life as you more fully obey the divine leadings._" <a id="a91_299"></a>[[UB 34:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p5_5)] _Do what Mom says._ 
- "The Holy Spirit of the Mother ministers to your conscious realization of the faith-fact of your sonship with God." <a id="a92_118"></a>[[UB 34:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p5_7)] _You are her child._ 
- We need truth “Not in word only but also in power and in the Holy Spirit.” "The seed of theoretical truth is dead, the highest moral concepts without effect, unless and until the divine Spirit breathes upon the forms of truth and quickens the formulas of righteousness." <a id="a93_273"></a>[[UB 34:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_6)] _She is powerful._ 
- The spirit domination of your human life is increasingly attended by the characteristics of the Spirit in your life, “for the fruits of the spirit are love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance.” <a id="a94_243"></a>[[UB 34:6.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_13)] _She brings fruitfulness._
- "The Holy Spirit is your initial supermind bestowal. This ministry to your worship-craving and wisdom-desiring mind creates the capacity to realize the idea of human survival beyond this life." <a id="a95_196"></a>[[UB 92:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p0_4)] _She is forever._ 
- Spiritual reason and soul intelligence is the endowment of the Holy Spirit, the Creative Spirit’s gift to you. <a id="a96_113"></a>[[UB 101:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p3_2)] _She shares all with her children._ 

## It Takes A Family To Raise A Child

Let me speak clearly about our spiritual connections. The Thought Adjuster is very real, a pure spirit, and therefore somewhat remote to our almost wholly material minds at this time. On the other hand, the influence of Christ (who proceeds from the Universal Father and the Eternal Son) is unmistakable, and the presence of his partner, the Universe Mother (who proceeds from the Infinite Spirit) are very approachable and able to be experienced, personally known, loved, and adored. _She is adorable._ 

Christ, our Father, who visited as Jesus of Nazareth, and our Universe Mother are our true parents, our divine co-creators. Our universe is governed by dual supervision. Christ and Mother are marriage partners in the real, not allegorical, sense: they together literally designed and built their universe home, and bore many children and high personalities of the universe. They oversee our education, and are planning for our future. Just as children growing up need the influence of both a father and a mother, so we need the saving watchcare of both—Father Michael and Divine Mother. 

## To Love, Adore, Exalt, Honor

We hear and talk about the terms: worship, prayer, and meditation, and they are intrinsic parts of our lives. Importantly, we know that throughout the universes it is taught that worship is to be accorded only to our Universal Father in Paradise. But what about our heart-felt affections for Michael and Mother? _Adoration_ is the word. To “exalt, honor, and cherish” are other appropriate words. “Honor your father and mother.” 

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia">

At this point in my upward, inward journey, Michael and Mother are becoming closer, more approachable, and more real to me day by day. Now when I read encouragements to “love God,” or to “love God with all your heart and mind and soul and strength” I’m more likely to immediately think of Michael and Mother, creator Father and creative Mother of our universe. <a id="a113_361"></a>[[UB 174:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p4_2)] Perhaps its because each passing day I’m farther along in my journey to meet them face to face, and I look forward to it greatly. 

Our earthly mothers raised us and helped us leave the nest like little eaglets. At some point our local Universe Mother will hand us off to God the Mother, the Supreme, as we graduate to our superuniverse career. And then at a further point, the Supreme will send us on to discover the Eternal Mother on Paradise. 

I don’t remember my earthly father exactly telling me to love my mother, but he did tell me to do what she said, and the unspoken command was clearly “become what she hopes for you, and all you can be.” It has been natural for me to love my mother. I do read in the Revelation, regarding the Divine Mother, to “obey her leadings.” <a id="a117_331"></a>[[UB 34:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p5_5)] That is the way of love. And I read of the exquisite, divine love and mutual cooperation between our Creator Father and Mother, which is surely my best example and inspiration. Jesus said, 

> “ **The Father in heaven treats the Spirit Mother of the children of the universe as one equal to himself.** It is Godlike to share your life and all that relates to it on equal terms with the mother partner who so fully shares with you that divine experience of reproducing yourselves in the lives of your children. If you can only love your children as God loves you, you will love and **cherish your wife as the Father in heaven honors and exalts the Infinite Spirit, the mother** of all the spirit children of a vast universe.” (_The Urantia Book_, <a id="a119_555"></a>[UB 133:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p2_2)) 

Also, my earthly mother doesn’t need to say, “Love me,” but she did ask me to call more often, and she loved it when I came to visit. 

Maybe to love our divine Mother means just that... to call her up, frequently, and to follow, obey her perfect leadings. Still, I like to just say, “Mom, I love you.” 

## You Are Exalted (Hymn) 

> You are exalted, forever exalted on high, 
> I will praise you. 
> You are exalted, forever exalted and I will praise your name—Michael. 
> You are the Lord, forever you reign on high. 
> Heaven and earth rejoice in your holy name, You are exalted, forever exalted on high. 
> You are exalted, forever exalted on high, 
> I will praise you. 
> You are exalted, forever exalted and I will praise your name—Mother. 
> You are the One, forever you reign on high. 
> Heaven and earth rejoice in your holy name, 
> You are exalted, forever exalted on high. 
>

## A Visualization

Picture, if you will, a great stream of power and loving spirit extending from Paradise, through Havona, and focalizing on the capital of our local universe of Nebadon. Then picture another stream continuing from that universe capital and opening to the creations of time and space in which we live, move and have our being. Here is another way to picture this from the center, moving outward: 
- a. The Eternal Mother, Source and Center in Paradise 
- b. God the Mother, the Supreme Being residing in Havona and overseeing the evolving grand universe—our experiential mother 
- c. The Divine Minister, the Universe Mother Spirit, Christ Michael’s consort, without whom we could not so much as breathe a breath, think a thought, or take a step, who has given us her Holy Spirit 
- d. Our own birth mothers, grandmothers, great grandmothers, and cultural mothers on earth to whom we owe our beginning life.

People are prone to start from what is “at hand” and work backwards to origins. But this is not the way of wisdom. We must start from the core (inside) and work our way outward. 

Do not each of us carry inheritance traits of both our biological mother and father? Are not fathers sometimes called upon by necessity to fulfill the role of mother, and vice versa? 

The Trinity Inevitability. Universe philosophers have stated there are multiple, many, perhaps even infinite ways that all things can or could be done. But, there is only one absolute inevitability—the Trinity. <a id="a153_211"></a>[[UB 10:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p0_3)] All that we know or attempt to imagine could not be done but through the Trinity—the Father, the Mother, and their Conjoint Action.
