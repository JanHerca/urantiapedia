## The Coronation 

May 18 is a good day to celebrate our universe's Jubilee of Jubilees. August 21 is a big day also: Jesus' birth as a mortal. April 9 was an astounding day: Jesus' resurrection into morontia form. But on May 18 the people of Urantia have the opportunity to lead the way in all Nebadon—on Salvington, Edentia, Jerusem, and all inhabited planets—the jubilee celebration of Michael's confirmation from the Paradise Father of his completed universe sovereignty, and of the Mother's greater and personal revealing. This is great news. So what happened on May 18, 30 AD? Two great universe events, among several (see Addendum) occurred on that jubilee of jubilees day: 

1. Michael, our Creator Son and universe father, departs for his enthronement on Salvington (<a id="a37_93"></a>[UB 33:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p3_5)), and his ascent to the right hand of his Father to receive formal confirmation of his sovereignty of Nebadon. 

    It was about seven forty-five this morning when the morontia Jesus disappeared from the observation of his eleven apostles to begin the ascent to the right hand of his Father, there to receive formal confirmation of his completed sovereignty of the universe of Nebadon. <a id="a39_274"></a>[[UB 193:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p5_5)] 

2. Mother, our Creative Spirit, becomes personally knowable by all contacting individuals. 

    To many universe types of being, even this representation of the Infinite Spirit may not appear to be wholly personal during the ages preceding the final Michael bestowal; but subsequent to the elevation of the Creator Son to the sovereign authority of a Master Son, the Creative Mother Spirit becomes **so augmented in personal qualities** as to be personally recognized by all contacting individuals. <a id="a43_407"></a>[[UB 34:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p2_1)] 

## Personal relationship with Michael

As part of God the Sevenfold, our Creator Son and our Creative Mother Spirit are, to us, God. They are our creators, our parents, father and mother to us. To be personally related to Michael, the one requirement is that you share your inner life with him. 

> The doing of the will of God is nothing more or less than an exhibition of creature willingness to share the inner life with God—with the very God who has made such a creature life of inner meaning-value possible. Sharing is Godlike—divine. <a id="a49_243"></a>[[UB 111:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p5_1)] 

Michael is the divine word expression of the Father's thought. He is the designer and creator of the patterns and plans for superhuman, human, animal, and plant life on our world and universe. Michael is the minister of the mercy of the Father to all who struggle and are in need. Our relationship with him through his Spirit of Truth, endowed to all believers on Earth after his ascension, imbues us with power to live and share life on the intellectual and spiritual levels of truth-revealing. 

## Personal relationship with Mother

The Thought Adjusters/Controllers do not speak English to us, ordinarily, but rather communicate with us in the symbols of the superconscious. However, the Mother does speak our Earth languages. You may share your thoughts and feelings with her continually throughout the day, which develops into a real and personal dialogue. The conversation begins to take on true meaning through closeness and working out all the details of our life; through listening and obeying; through sincere adoration. 

Over 200 billion years ago our Mother began giving life and nurturance in our universe through her divine spark of life; through her Holy Spirit, through her assisting mind spirits, her angels, and many supernal beings. She likewise initiated life on our little world 550 million years ago, one among many of such loving and creative efforts by her throughout her universe. 

Since Mother is our universe source of mind, it is quite natural that we may find it easier to form concepts of her than of either the Son Michael or the indwelling Father (compare <a id="a59_181"></a>[[UB 9:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/9#p5_4)]). She draws all minds in our universe unto herself. She is the flexible actor focalizing all spiritual influences; initiating and upholding all life; coordinating all energy, material, and minds; and pervading all local universe space. The Mother ministers the combined love of the Father and the mercy of Michael, and is therefore also known to us as our Divine Minister.

(paraphrased) The Holy Spirit of the Mother is partly independent of your human attitude—and partially conditioned by the decisions and co- operation of your will. The ministry of the Holy Spirit becomes increasingly effective in sanctifying and spiritualizing your inner life as you more fully obey the divine leadings. <a id="a67_321"></a>[[UB 34:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p5_5)] Do what Mom says. 

## The Holiday: The Jubilee of Jubilees

On May 18... 
    call an assembly, 
    send out “Universe Jubilee of Jubilee” cards, 
    feed the poor, 
    ring the bells, 
    have a reading of these passages and a celebration in your living room, 
    distribute copies of the “Proclamation of Equality” regarding Michael and Mother, 
    gather with believers outdoors, 
    take the day off, 
    pray and meditate, 
    commune with God and the believers, 
    create a new ceremony, 
    write and sing new songs. 

For God's sake, do something to celebrate this great occasion. The rest of the universe—on the capital worlds and the many enlightened planets—already celebrates it as _the_ high holy day. Don't be left out. We, of all peoples, must lead the charge, as it was the events on our planet that made this possible: Michael's seventh and final bestowal. A jubilee is defined as an “anniversary celebration.” 

I hope to hear a word of good cheer from you! Glory to God in the highest! _Gloria in excelsis deo!_ 



> Upon the completion of the Creator Son's seventh and final creature bestowal, the uncertainties of periodic isolation terminate for the Divine Minister, and the Son's universe helper becomes forever settled in surety and control. It is at the enthronement of the Creator Son as a Master Son, at the **jubilee of jubilees** , that the Universe Spirit, before the assembled hosts, first makes public and universal acknowledgment of subordination to the Son, pledging fidelity and obedience. This event occurred in Nebadon at the time of Michael's return to Salvington after the Urantian bestowal. Never before this momentous occasion did the Universe Spirit acknowledge subordination to the Universe Son, and not until after this voluntary relinquishment of power and authority by the Spirit could it be truthfully proclaimed of the Son that “all power in heaven and on earth has been committed to his hand.” <a id="a91_909"></a>[[UB 33:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p3_5)] 
> 
> After this pledge of subordination by the Creative Mother Spirit, Michael of Nebadon nobly acknowledged his eternal dependence on his Spirit companion, constituting the Spirit coruler of his universe domains and requiring all their creatures to pledge themselves in loyalty to the Spirit as they had to the Son; and there issued and went forth the final “Proclamation of Equality.” Though he was the sovereign of this local universe, the Son published to the worlds the fact of the Spirit's equality with him in all endowments of personality and attributes of divine character. And this becomes the transcendent pattern for the family organization and government of even the lowly creatures of the worlds of space. This is, in deed and in truth, the high ideal of the family and the human institution of voluntary marriage. <a id="a93_826"></a>[[UB 33:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p3_6)] 
> 
> The Son and the Spirit now preside over the universe much as a father and mother watch over, and minister to, their family of sons and daughters. It is not altogether out of place to refer to the Universe Spirit as the creative companion of the Creator Son and to regard the creatures of the realms as their sons and daughters—a grand and glorious family but one of untold responsibilities and endless watchcare. <a id="a95_415"></a>[[UB 33:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p3_7)] 
> 
> The Son initiates the creation of certain of the universe children, while the Spirit is solely responsible for bringing into existence the numerous orders of spirit personalities who minister and serve under the direction and guidance of this selfsame Mother Spirit. In the creation of other types of universe personalities, both the Son and the Spirit function together, and in no creative act does the one do aught without the counsel and approval of the other. <a id="a97_466"></a>[[UB 33:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p3_8)]

**_Addendum:_** _The above recital covers the high points that occurred following Michael' ascension from Urantia. In collaboration with scholars from the community the following list of thrilling occurrences is enumerated. I am not privy to the exact time of Michael's enthronement at the jubilee of jubilees, however this timeline suggests or reveals that much, if not all of these events occurred quickly, even over the course of a little more than five hours, from about 7:45 am to about 1:00 pm on May 18, 30 AD. (Salvington has its own time zone—ha.)

1. Jesus' ascension from Mount Olivet, about 7:45 am, May 18, 30 AD <a id="a109_68"></a>[[UB 193:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p5_5)]_ 
2. Traveled to Edentia by way of Jerusem, and was returned to status of Paradise sonship <a id="a110_89"></a>[[UB 193:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p5_4)] 
3. Formal confirmation by the Universal Father of Michael’s completed sovereignty of the universe of Nebadon <a id="a111_109"></a>[[UB 193:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p5_5)] 
4. Enthronement on Salvington, jubilee of jubilees <a id="a112_51"></a>[[UB 33:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p3_5)] 
5. Greater and personal revealing of the Universe Mother Spirit <a id="a113_64"></a>[[UB 34:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p2_1)] 
6. Proclamation of Equality—Michael and Mother <a id="a114_47"></a>[[UB 33:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p3_6)] 
7. Worldwide bestowal of the Spirit of Truth with the accompanying joy, security, and confidence, about 1:00 pm, May 18 <a id="a115_120"></a>[[UB 194:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p0_1),2] 
8. Preparation of all normal minds for the universal bestowal of Thought Adjusters upon the people of earth <a id="a116_108"></a>[[UB 194:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_3)] 
9. Michael proclaimed Planetary Prince of Urantia, by our Paradise adviser, the Union of Days <a id="a117_94"></a>[[UB 114:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p1_1)] at the time of Michael's elevation to sovereignty <a id="a117_190"></a>[[UB 23:2.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/23#p2_18)] 
10. Institution of the Twenty-Four Counselors on Jerusem and arrival of their representative, our first Resident Governor General, concurrent with the outpouring of the Spirit of Truth, May 18, 30 AD <a id="a118_200"></a>[[UB 114:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p6_1)] 
11. Arrival of the twelve corps of the master seraphim of planetary supervision <a id="a119_80"></a>[[UB 114:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p6_1)) 

_This list is not exhaustive by any means. The reader may do further study to learn about the mighty and concurrent lessening of self-assertiveness of individuals and groups, equality of women and men, power to forgive, internment of rebel midwayers, subsequent organization of the midwayers, and generally inaugurating a new era of joy, security, confidence, power, and love._ 

_A word about Pentecost dates. The Pharisees of Jesus' time, many current day Jews, and Christians count Pentecost as fifty days from the day following the Passover feast. But not so with the Sadducees among whom were counted Annas and the then acting High Priest, Caiaphas—they held to an older and strict interpretation that the fifty-day counting of Omer would begin at the time of the ripening of the barley_ (cf. [Leviticus 23:9-23](/en/Bible/Leviticus/23#v9)). _Other feasts generally have a set day, but the festival of the first fruits was oriented flexibly to the agricultural reality of barley harvest time. For this and other reasons, adult males from surrounding areas would often spend a number of weeks in the precincts of Jerusalem to encompass a plurality of required festival attendances._ <a id="a123_807"></a>[[UB 194:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p4_1)] _Therefore it is entirely plausible that May 18, 30 AD was fifty days after the presentation offering in the temple of the first ripe barley harvest and therefore indeed Jerusalem's day of Pentecost at the Shavuot ending of the festival of weeks._

_Glory to God in the highest for the loving watchcare over our little, but prominent planet._
