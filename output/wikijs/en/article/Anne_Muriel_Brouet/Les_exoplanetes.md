Genevans discover **50 new exoplanets!** The harvest includes sixteen super-Earths! It's not a handful but a shovelful!

In front of the cream of extrasolar planet hunters gathered in Wyoming (United States), the **HARPS** spectrograph team, led by the famous Geneva astrophysicist **Michel Mayor**, announces the discovery of around fifty new specimens. The harvest - unprecedented in the history of exoplanets started in 1995 by the aforementioned and his colleague Didier Queloz, from the University of Geneva - is all the richer because it contains 16 super-Earths. In other words, planets of small mass, most probably telluric. The 50 new exoplanets are added to the $**6 0 5**$ already identified to date.

In the lot, the **HARPS** team — the instrument built eight years ago by UNIGE experts and installed at the European Southern Observatory in Chile — slipped **HD 88512 b**, a super-Earth which was the subject of a publication three weeks ago in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. With a mass of 3.6 times that of the Earth, 35 light years from us, it is located at the edge of the habitable zone, that is to say at such a distance from its star that the temperature allows the presence of liquid water. It is the second super-Earth discovered by **HARPS**, but above all the one which has the smallest mass ever measured with the radial velocity system.

“_This important harvest allows us to study the statistics of exoplanets_, specifies **Françesco Pepe**, astrophysicist at UNIGE. _We thus realize that there are many super-Earths or Neptunes._” Thus more than 50% of stars similar to the Sun have at least one planet with a mass lower than that of Saturn. And yet, astrophysicists are far from “seeing” everything!
