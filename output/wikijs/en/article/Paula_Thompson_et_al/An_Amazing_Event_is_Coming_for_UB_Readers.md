_by Sue Haskell, Paula Thompson, and Abert Einstein Lassiter_

On August 21, 2017, the United States experienced a very rare solar eclipse, in that (1) the path of totality crossed the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, (2) the path of totality made landfall exclusively within the United States, and (3) this was the first such solar eclipse since the country's declaration of independence in 1776. On April 8, 2024, portions of the United States may (weather permitting) witness the next total solar eclipse.

Do these dates sound familiar to Urantia Book readers?

According to The Urantia Book, August 21, 7 BCE, was the date of Jesus' birth (<a id="a46_79"></a>[UB 122:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p8_1)) and April 8, 30 BCE, is the only entire day Jesus' mortal body lay in the tomb after his death on the cross (<a id="a46_233"></a>[UB 188:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p0_1)). _The Urantia Book_ community commonly knows this date as the only full day of the “time of the tomb” (<a id="a46_381"></a>[UB 188:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p0_1)).

To have a total solar eclipse occur anywhere on the planet on either of these two important dates would be most interesting. However, to have these _two_ eclipses occur over the United States happening on _significant dates_ and _times_ near a _significant place_ is way beyond interesting. Some would say this is just a coincidence, and perhaps that is true, but could it be more? Could it not also serve as a wake-up call for followers of _The Urantia Book_?

To say that something is “co-incident” could also indicate that it is deliberate or purposeful. Perhaps we are too quick to dismiss occurrences like this. This is not to suggest that anyone should subscribe to “signs and wonders” (<a id="a50_231"></a>[UB 145:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p5_6)) but perhaps we can acknowledge that these unusual eclipse events have received the attention of _millions_ of people around the world. When something gets the attention of millions, and just so happens to coincide with significant dates in Jesus' time here, as revealed in _The Urantia Book_, isn't that worthy of our attention? At the very least, it represents an outreach opportunity to let the public know about the significance of these dates as an introduction to _The Urantia Book_.

Here are some other important facts about these two eclipses:

## The Two Eclipses Occur Seven Years Apart

According to Wikipedia regarding “Symbolism of the number 7,” “As an early prime number in the series of positive integers, the number seven has greatly symbolic associations in religion, mythology, superstition and philosophy.” Check out the following link to see how the number seven is so important in many of the earth's religions: [Symbolism of the number 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolism_of_the_number_7)

In the Urantia Papers the number seven is mentioned almost a thousand times, from the Seven Master Spirits, to the Seven Superuniverses, to the Seven Sacred Spheres of Paradise, to the seven creature bestowals of Michael, and many, many more examples. It is a key number.

According to calculations, on average, a total solar eclipse can be seen from the same place only once every 375 years, and most occur over oceans or uninhabited areas.

## Total Solar Eclipses Are Rare, Even More So on These Two Dates

Regarding total solar eclipses occurring on August 21 (of any year), before 2017, the previous occurred in 1914, and the next will occur in 2734, _and_, neither of those two eclipses was or will be over the United States.

As for total solar eclipses occurring on April 8 (of any year), since 2000 BCE there have been only five, with the next one occurring (after 2024) in 2722. Of those, only the 2024 eclipse will be over the United States. See https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/5MCSE/TP2009214174.pdf for details.

Also, consider that none of those occurred within seven years of each other.

## The Crossing of the Two Eclipses

The centerlines of the path of totality of the [2017](http://xjubier.free.fr/en/site_pages/solar_eclipses/TSE_2017_GoogleMapFull.html?Lat=37.64733&Lng=-89.28073&Zoom=16&LC=1) and [2024](http://xjubier.free.fr/en/site_pages/solar_eclipses/TSE_2024_GoogleMapFull.html?Lat=37.64732&Lng=-89.28073&Zoom=16&LC=1) eclipses _cross_ within Cedar Lake, Illinois, near Cedar Lake Bluffs, which is very near (less than eight miles) to the remarkable place known as the [Bald Knob Cross of Peace](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bald+Knob+Cross+of+Peace/@37.5515404,-89.3471206,458m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xa398d1ef56214553!8m2!3d37.551136!4d-89.3475609). [Use those links for Google Maps details.]

For the 2017 eclipse, its longest duration of more than two minutes forty-one seconds was also very near (less than thirteen miles) to the Bald Knob _Cross of Peace_.

Bald Knob Cross is a large white cross 111 feet tall. It is an awe-inspiring spiritual monument where people of all ages, cultures, and backgrounds can experience hope, joy, peace, and faith. See https://www.baldknobcross.com/ for more details.

Another coincidence? Even if you believe that this is merely a coincidence, it is a truly amazing coincidence.

One more coincidence. At this point of crossing, both eclipses happen at almost the same time of day, with the sun in almost the same spot in the sky (using the [2017](http://xjubier.free.fr/en/site_pages/solar_eclipses/TSE_2017_GoogleMapFull.html?Lat=37.64733&Lng=-89.28073&Zoom=16&LC=1) and [2024](http://xjubier.free.fr/en/site_pages/solar_eclipses/TSE_2024_GoogleMapFull.html?Lat=37.64732&Lng=-89.28073&Zoom=16&LC=1) eclipse maps):

## Timing of the Crossing of the Two Eclipses

The significant _timing_ of the two eclipses is at the point they cross over each other.

The 2017 eclipse came on the _date of Jesus' birth_, August 21.

The partial eclipse at the point of crossing in 2017 started at _11:52 a.m._ (which is about noon).

...and at noon, August 21, 7 B.C. . . . Mary was delivered of a male child (<a id="a99_76"></a>[UB 122:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p8_1)).

The 2024 eclipse comes on the date of Jesus' body's only full _day in the tomb_, April 8.

The partial eclipse at the point of crossing in 2024 ends at 3:18 p.m. (which is about three o'clock).

In _The Urantia Book_, three o'clock is a significant time.

> It was just before **three o'clock** [emphasis added] when Jesus, with a loud voice, cried out, “It is finished! Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.” And when he had thus spoken, he bowed his head and gave up the life struggle. (<a id="a107_240"></a>[UB 187:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p5_5))

>The day and a half that Jesus' mortal body lay in the tomb of Joseph, the period between his death on the cross and his resurrection, is a chapter in the earth career of Michael which is little known to us. We can narrate the burial of the Son of Man and put in this record the events associated with his resurrection, but we cannot supply much information of an authentic nature about what really transpired during this epoch of about thirty-six hours, **from three o'clock Friday afternoon to three o'clock Sunday morning** [emphasis added]. This period in the Master's career began shortly before he was taken down from the cross by the Roman soldiers. (<a id="a109_658"></a>[UB 188:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p0_1))

## Why Now?

The crossing of the two eclipses can be seen as truly symbolic of where the world stands now, “quivering on the very brink of one of its most amazing and enthralling epochs of social readjustment, moral quickening, and spiritual enlightenment” (<a id="a113_245"></a>[UB 195:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_2)) and at the _crossroads_ of advancement or regression.

This is _not_ merely an _astrological event_. It has everything to do with science and facts.

It is an amazing time in the history of humanity. We are more educated and connected than at any time in human history. Humans are also, due to years of a deadly pandemic, keenly aware that we are all in this together. Will we stand together or fall? Never before in our history has the _entire_ planet (every little village, every island, every jungle, and every city) been impacted by a single disease at the same time. _Every_ human seems to have an obligation to the whole of humanity. Pandemics have happened throughout human history, but they have never affected the _entire_ world population in such a short time period, and have never been witnessed so thoroughly by so many through the mass communication systems we have today.

The pandemic has been a powerful wake-up call for humanity, a devastating event that has shown us very clearly our human vulnerabilities. There are even now greater worldwide issues that all humans must come together to deal with. The problems of climate change, future pandemics, drinkable water, and mass population migrations are but a few.

These eclipses are powerful and significant events that clearly point to The Urantia Book.

The answers are in the Urantia Revelation. We have them. Are we willing to give them to the world?
