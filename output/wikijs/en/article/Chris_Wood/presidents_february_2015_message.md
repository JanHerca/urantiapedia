Fellow students of _The Urantia Book_, I want to give you exciting updates on four of the many ongoing projects the Urantia Association International is juggling.

In December we called for donations to help send a shipment of books to Zambia and Malawi, two countries with growing reader communities in southern Africa. Thanks to many generous donors and our dedicated “Seed” funding, 200 copies of _The Urantia Book_ set sail across the Atlantic. The ones to Malawi have already arrived safely.

There are eight study groups in Malawi, with 60 people who have finished their first reading of _The Urantia Book_, and there are many more who are eagerly reading. This shipment of books will allow for students to have their own copies as well as copies of the book to be placed in universities, hospitals, and libraries throughout the country. As many of you would know, Malawi has recently suffered from devastating floods, with half of the country being declared an emergency disaster zone. Grevet Moyo, who serves as Association President in Malawi, and Rick Lyon, former Executive Director of Urantia Association International, have teamed up to sell Malawi art in the United States to help one village. (Anyone wishing to purchase some of these paintings can contact the Central Office or Rick at [ricklyon@tctc.com](mailto:ricklyon@tctc.com).)

In Zambia there are 14 study groups, with an average of eight attendees per group, all of whom share copies of _The Urantia Book_. There are many stories about the Forum members’ excitement when they were allowed to take copies of _The Urantia Book_ home for personal study and to share with family and friends. In Zambia that same feeling of excitement will soon be shared by dozens of dedicated students.

In spring 2014, the Urantia Association of Ukraine began a project to distribute books in their country. Working with the Urantia Association International and Urantia Foundation, a pallet of books were imported to Kiev. This winter a new step forward was achieved when the major bookstore chain in Kiev began to carry copies of _The Urantia Book_! This is a short-term experiment to see how well it sells, but right now shoppers see _The Urantia Book_ highlighted in the bookstores near cash registers and in recommended reading shelves. Progress is often indiscernible; at times like these when progress is readily apparent, we must all cheer and congratulate the good team in Ukraine! Bravo!

Finally, our International Conference in Quebec, Canada, ought not be missed. Students of _The Urantia Book_ from around the world will gather to study, worship, and commune together across different languages and cultures. We have already confirmed attendees from six continents, with a program designed to explore the progression from Human to Divine, featuring workshops conducted in three languages and real-time translations of our plenary speeches. You will be able to meet and speak with members of our Central Office as well as the International Service Board and the International Representative Council. It will be a rare opportunity to see the teachings of the revelation through the lens of dozens of cultures.

The Urantia Association International continues to grow because of the dedicated service of students who reach out to help our small but motivated communities. More and more people are being touched by the teaching that we are all children of a loving God and therefore are brothers and sisters. What better message could we carry forward from generation to generation?

In service,  
Chris Wood  
President
