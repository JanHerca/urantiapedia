Melodies for the Soul represents my personal contribution to the dissemination of the teachings of the Master and Creator of our universe, Miguel de Nebadon.

For me, _The Urantia Book_ is the highest truth presented to our humanity up to now, for which I consider it a moral duty, of those who have had the privilege of knowing it, to inform many other human beings of its existence who perhaps They haven't had that shred of insight to get to him. But as I have been able to verify, many people to whom I have spoken about this fifth revelation find it very difficult to start reading it, as if they had a hard time believing in its authenticity. Furthermore, there are many people who believe that they already know the whole truth and are still talking about energies, astrology, esotericism, meditation, channeling, yoga, etc.

So I considered that, since I am a musician, I could try to make songs that would move the listener in such a way that, through that emotion, they would understand the beauty of the authentic message of the Master, and thus, they would come to glimpse the eternal values of the Master. Father's Kingdom. What happened was that I was the first to get emotional, seeing how those melodies and lyrics flowed in my mind, which only confirmed to me the divine presence that we all carry inside.

With the Melodies for the Soul I intend to help change the attitude of the individual so that, with the fraternity of many individuals, we are capable of changing the course of this humanity, which languishes within this so dehumanized materialism. _The Urantia Book_ is a means, a tool, but I understand that, above all, its purpose is to make this humanity progress towards that era of light and life that so many intelligences in this universe desire.

As a musician and a man of faith, I am convinced that the music that now comes out of me can win many souls for the Kingdom, and the Master will know how to help me.

With love,

JC
