[The significance of the Urantia Papers cannot be properly appreciated except that the reader is familiar with the limitations both inherent to and imposed upon their authors. These quotations are provided to assist our readers in their endeavors for understanding]

> “All finite knowledge and creature understanding are relative. Information and intelligence, gleaned from even high sources, is only relatively complete, locally accurate, and personally true.” 
> 
> “Physical facts are fairly uniform, but truth is a living and flexible factor in the philosophy of the universe. Evolving personalities are only partially wise and relatively true in their communications. They can be certain only as far as their personal experience extends. That which apparently may be wholly true in one place may be only relatively true in another segment of creation.”
> 
> “Divine truth, final truth, is uniform and universal, but the story of things spiritual, as it is told by numerous individuals hailing from various spheres, may sometimes vary in details owing to this relativity in the completeness of knowledge and in the repleteness of personal experience as well as in the length and extent of that experience.” (<a id="a39_351"></a>[UB 2:7.1-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p7_1))

> “The Urantia Papers. The papers, of which this is one, constitute the most recent presentation of truth to the mortals of Urantia. These papers differ from all previous revelations, for they are not the work of a single universe personality but a composite presentation by many beings. But no revelation short of the attainment of the Universal Father can ever be complete. **All other celestial ministrations are no more than partial, transient, and practically adapted to local conditions in time and space**.” 
> 
> “While such admissions as this may possibly detract from the immediate force and authority of all revelations, the time has arrived on Urantia when it is advisable to make such frank statements, even at the risk of weakening the future influence and authority of this, the most recent of the revelations of truth to the mortal races of Urantia.” (<a id="a43_349"></a>[UB 92:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p4_9))

> “Because your world is generally ignorant of origins, even of physical origins, it has appeared to be wise from time to time to provide instruction in cosmology. And always has this made trouble for the future. The laws of revelation hamper us greatly by their proscription of the impartation of unearned or premature knowledge. **Any cosmology presented as a part of revealed religion is destined to be outgrown in a very short time**. Accordingly, future students of such a revelation are tempted to discard any element of genuine religious truth it may contain because they discover errors on the face of the associated cosmologies therein presented.”
> 
> “Mankind should understand that **we who participate in the revelation of truth are very rigorously limited** by the instructions of our superiors. We are not at liberty to anticipate the scientific discoveries of a thousand years. Revelators must act in accordance with the instructions which form a part of the revelation mandate. We see no way of overcoming this difficulty, either now or at any future time. We full well know that, while the historic facts and religious truths of this series of revelatory presentations will stand on the records of the ages to come, within a few short years many of our statements regarding the physical sciences **will stand in need of revision** in consequence of additional scientific developments and new discoveries. These new developments we even now foresee, but we are forbidden to include such humanly undiscovered facts in the revelatory records. **Let it be made clear that revelations are not necessarily inspired.** The cosmology of these revelations is not inspired. It is limited by our permission for the co-ordination and sorting of present-day knowledge. While divine or spiritual insight is a gift, human wisdom must evolve.” <a id="a47_1186"></a>[UB 101:4.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p4_1)

> “Partial, incomplete, and evolving intellects would be helpless in the master universe, would be unable to form the first rational thought pattern, were it not for the **innate ability of all mind, high or low, to form a universe frame in which to think**. If mind cannot fathom conclusions, if it cannot penetrate to true origins, then will such mind unfailingly postulate conclusions and invent origins that it may have a means of logical thought within the frame of these mind-created postulates. And **while such universe frames for creature thought are indispensable** to rational intellectual operations, **they are, without exception, erroneous to a greater or lesser degree**.”
> 
> “**Conceptual frames of the universe are only relatively true; they are serviceable scaffolding which must eventually give way before the expansions of enlarging cosmic comprehension**. The understandings of truth, beauty, and goodness, morality, ethics, duty, love, divinity, origin, existence, purpose, destiny, time, space, even Deity, are only relatively true. God is much, much more than a Father, but the Father is man’s highest concept of God; nonetheless, the Father-Son portrayal of Creator-creature relationship will be augmented by those supermortal conceptions of Deity which will be attained in Orvonton, in Havona, and on Paradise. Man must think in a mortal universe frame, but that does not mean that he cannot envision other and higher frames within which thought can take place.” <a id="a51_800"></a>[UB 115:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p1_1)

## The purpose of revelation

> “The fact of religion consists wholly in the religious experience of rational and average human beings. And this is the only sense in which religion can ever be regarded as scientific or even psychological. The proof that revelation is revelation is this same fact of human experience: **the fact that revelation does synthesize the apparently divergent sciences of nature and the theology of religion into a consistent and logical universe philosophy**, a coordinated and unbroken explanation of both science and religion, thus creating a harmony of mind and satisfaction of spirit which answers in human experience those questionings of the mortal mind which craves to know how the Infinite works out his will and plans in matter, with minds, and on spirit.” (<a id="a55_764"></a>[UB 101:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p2_1))

> Reason is the proof of science, faith the proof of religion, logic the proof of philosophy, but revelation is validated only by human experience. (<a id="a57_149"></a>[UB 101:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p2_8))
