The realities of the Father are revealed within the qualities of divinity. And these qualities of divinity are personally appropriated by universe creatures in the experience of living divinely—and to live divinely means actually to live the will of God.

To material, evolutionary, finite creatures, a life predicated on the living of the Father's will leads directly to the attainment of spirit supremacy in the personality arena and brings such creatures one step nearer the comprehension of the Father-Infinite.

Such a Father-like life is one predicated on truth, sensitive to beauty, and dominated by goodness. And such a God-knowing person is inwardly illuminated by worship and outwardly devoted to the wholehearted service of the universal brotherhood of all personalities—a service ministry which is filled with mercy and motivated by love, while all these life qualities are unified in the evolving personality on ever-ascending levels of cosmic wisdom, self-realization, God-finding, and Father worship.

And we know already where Urantia is heading—for “the revelation of God to the world, in and through Jesus, shall not fail.”

> The goal of human self-realization should be spiritual, not material. The only realities worth striving for are divine, spiritual, and eternal—and are God-centered, never self-centered.

> The mind longs for certainty, and perhaps it longs most for a certainty which clubs it down. What the mind can understand, what it can ploddingly prove and approve, might be what it most despises.
> _Julian Barnes_
