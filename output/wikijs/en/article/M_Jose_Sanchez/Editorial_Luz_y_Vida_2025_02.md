## Breathe peace

The 21st century is about change. You've noticed that, haven't you?

We don't know what will happen tomorrow, but we know something will happen.

We don't know what life or your job will be like a year from now, but we know it will be different.

We don't know what technology will change everything, but we do know that something will turn everything upside down in five years. Or maybe seven. But that will happen.

What to do in a place where everything changes so quickly?

Well, the truth is that the best answer is this:

NOTHING.

Well, I clarify: nothing, but everything at the same time.

You know: I don't do anything, but I don't leave anything undone.

When everyone is running around like a headless chicken, it's best to maintain a low-information diet and turn off the TV or cell phone for a while during the day.

When everyone is chasing the latest shiny object that will MAKE US RICH, it's better to keep focusing on a classic that always works: doing things right, working meaningfully.

When everyone is thinking something, it's better to try to think against it, because thinking is almost exclusively thinking against it.

When everyone says the world will end tomorrow, we might as well turn to the great refuge of _The Urantia Book_ or to a dialogue with our Father, amidst the comforting silence of the night.

When everything seems to be falling apart, I'll take a deep breath and breathe out the anxiety. Because the world, your family, your job, and your neighbors will continue to change for years to come.

And ever faster. We live in times of acceleration. As Emilio Carrillo says: "We are in a hurricane of increasing magnitude." But let us not forget that at the center of the hurricane is where tranquility lies and where violence does not appear. Then we must return to the core, to our center as an element that gives us stability.

As we navigate these changes, holding on to what always works is more necessary than ever.

All we have to do is breathe and trust in your future self and in life.

Above all, that: trust in LIFE. Beautiful, unpredictable from our small perspective, and surprising in its wisdom. Trust in the existence of a grand plan at work.

I think it's wiser to resign as the CEO of the Universe, the one who has all the solutions to our problems. Because at that very moment, on that very day, we join forces with Life.

And the good thing is that we can all do it, if we want to. Having the life of a member.

Phew…

Do you feel peace?

It is called present, which is always peace.

Because anxiety is an excess of the future. And an excess of the future is what we suffer from… That's what happens to us.

And Jesus of Nazareth knew how to live in peace; he gladly gave his peace to all the people around him, knowing that we are in the hands of Someone greater than ourselves.

Will we let that PEACE come to us? Will we let it settle into our lives?

Today's world certainly doesn't make things easy for us. Many aspects seem designed to "hack" our primitive brains:

- The food is chemically altered to be addictive.
- Digital entertainment is available 24/7, just a click away.
- Work and schools, with a factory-like production model, suck away our creative and spiritual potential.
- Social media optimizes its algorithms to keep us engaged.

Some call this “the Matrix,” others “the hamster wheel.”

The truth is that we have lost our way to what really matters.

But the truth is also that NOT all is lost.

In recent years, we have witnessed a collective awakening. Millions of people have begun to transcend illusions to reconnect with their true essence, for what is better.

This movement is a natural response to a system designed to keep us numb and disconnected.

> The old and the inferior will be forgotten in the love for the new and the superior. Beauty is always triumphant over ugliness in the hearts of all who are illuminated by the love of truth. [UB 156:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_5)

And the most fascinating thing is that all of this is possible thanks to individuals like you, who make small decisions that generate big results.

And yes, there will be those who think that none of this matters, that its impact is insignificant, or that generating real change is impossible.

For those who believe this, I have a resounding answer: YOU ARE WRONG.

Let me explain why, and to do so, I want to introduce you to the _Law of Interdependence_.

The Law of Interdependence tells us that everything you see, every experience you have, is the result of an infinite chain of causes and conditions.

If you yell at someone, that anger spreads to the person receiving it and in turn will spread it to their environment.

If you act generously, that kindness multiplies.

If you decide to be kind to a stranger, he feels good, treats others better, and that vibe continues.

The invisible thread of "causality" makes your actions reach further than you imagine.

The ancient Hawaiians related this concept to the practice of Ho'oponopono: "If anything in the world needs healing, it begins with you."

By healing your own wounds, you contribute to the healing of your family, your neighbors, and the entire world.

So your only responsibility to turn around the situation we find ourselves in is to focus on being your best self.

That's the only thing you can control:

By working on yourself to cultivate compassion, kindness, and awareness, you are creating a ripple that extends beyond your understanding. A ripple that truly began centuries ago, with the arrival of our Master Jesus of Nazareth. The only one who knew that PEACE, GOODNESS, and BEAUTY would triumph on our blue planet.

That HE would triumph.

> No matter what the apparent conflict between materialism and the teachings of Jesus may be, you can rest assured that, in the ages to come, the teachings of the Master will fully triumph. [UB 195:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_2)

Let's join this unstoppable movement of transformation, where every human being counts.

Let us join our wise Creator.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

Let us join together to breathe in this Peace, which is surely about to arrive.

> “And now, as I am about to leave you, I would speak words of comfort. Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. I make these gifts not as the world gives—by measure—I give each of you all you will receive. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful. I have overcome the world, and in me you shall all triumph through faith.” [UB 181:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/181#p1_5)

This is the sincere wish of the Urantia Association of Spain and the reflection we offer you in this monthly newsletter, which we publish with great enthusiasm for another month.

Happy reading.
