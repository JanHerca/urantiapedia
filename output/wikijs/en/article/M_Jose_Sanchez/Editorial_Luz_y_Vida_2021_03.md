> _THE AGE of light and life is the final evolutionary attainment of a world of time and space…_ <a id="a42_97"></a>[UB 55:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p0_1)

We start the month of March 2021 with hope beating in our hearts and with the aim of contributing, modestly, to the unstoppable arrival of the wonderful age of LIGHT and LIFE on our planet.

Those of us who have read _The Urantia Book_ and delved into it know that our planet, Urantia, is different from the others in our system and even from Nebadon, our universe. But we also know from the book itself that we are not forgotten and left behind by the advice of the universe.

We are not alone. We are not abandoned and destined for final disaster.

> . . . Urantia is not a cosmic orphan stigmatized by sin and shut away from divine watchcare by rebellion. From Uversa to Salvington and on down to Jerusem, even in Havona and on Paradise, they all know we are here; and you mortals now dwelling on Urantia are just as lovingly cherished and just as faithfully watched over as if the sphere had never been betrayed by a faithless Planetary Prince, even more so. It is eternally true, “the Father himself loves you.” (<a id="a50_467"></a>[UB 114:7.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_17))

Our planet, therefore, continues its march of material, intellectual and spiritual progress, as do the other planets in our universe. We are heading towards the indescribable goal of the age of LIGHT and LIFE, despite everything we glimpse daily. And this unavoidable task, this marvelous destiny that we have on the horizon, is what the people who make up the URANTIA ASSOCIATION OF SPAIN have in mind.

To you, dear reader who is now reading these lines, we invite you to join our project to expand the mind and spirit on Earth. We invite you to read us, contribute ideas, disseminate, analyze, criticize... this bulletin that reaches your eyes today.

We are excited to start this monthly newsletter of the association that we want you to feel as your own, close to your concerns and spiritual desires. We have lovingly designed it to serve both the education or training of readers and study groups and the communication of interesting news and reviews to the Urantia community.

Join us on the adventure of building a new and transformed society as we seek to foster humanity's spiritual renaissance and the rise of the kingdom of heaven here on Earth. Our greatest hope is in this new revelation from God that invites us to serve our fellow men and love them.

We invite you, then, to enjoy this adventure inside and up, towards LIGHT and LIFE.
