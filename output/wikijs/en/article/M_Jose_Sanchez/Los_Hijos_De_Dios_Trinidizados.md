Introduction by M. José Sánchez

Being so close to a monastery where so many kings and princes rest, already dead, it does not seem very wrong to talk about some aspects that the Urantia Book points out about what awaits us after death.

When reading The Urantia Book, one of the amazing discoveries it offers us is that we finally get a glimpse of what Paul was referring to when he said “eye has not seen, ear has not heard, it never occurred to anyone to think what God has prepared for those who love.” ([1 Cor. 2](/en/Bible/1_Corinthians/2)). And what have they prepared for us after death? The calm and the beatific contemplation for all the eternity of the divinity? Perhaps the fusion and dissolution in an abstract entity? Eternal boredom and absolute tedium?

According to the Urantia Book, we must discard the idea of INACTIVITY, on the contrary, we will continue in our evolution of constant growth and perfection. If Deity, back in the dawn of eternity, could sit complacently still in its eternity and infinity, and did NOT, but moved to associate with other persons in the Trinity and created this universe, so are we going to do its children: associate with other beings, work and even create! with the trinitization technique.

The book describes three ways of working and associating the children of God, in whose center there is always God and Paradise.

1. Ascending ladder towards Paradise, which allows mortal people (and other beings) to ascend from their almost animal condition to the gates of Paradise.
2. Descending ladder, which allows perfectly created beings to fraternize with human beings and experience the limitations of time and space.
3. Deepening in trinitization, growth experienced by any ascending or descending being through the embrace of the Paradise Trinity.

This last aspect is what we are going to talk about because our book is very specific in many aspects.

Thus, we can become “Mighty Messengers”, “Those high in Authority” or “Those without name or number”, after the embrace of the Trinity and thus work in the seven superuniverses. It is very interesting what the book says about the _selection that Paradise makes_ to enter one body or another _is not arbitrary_ but rather it is personal experience and spiritual values that will determine who will be part of this group of beings encompassed in the term “<ins>the Trinitized Sons of Achievement</ins>”. Thus, the experience of the insurrection and having responded loyally to it would qualify us to be “Mighty Messengers”, or the ascending souls who have developed the ability to worship the Father with an understanding that transcends their peers, the higher spiritual minds, they would be part of the group of “Those without name or number.”

Although not only the document speaks of mortals, but also the “angels” (seraphim and intermediate beings) or the mortals who merge with the Spirit or with the Son, achieve the divine embrace: they are the “<ins> Trinitized Sons of Selection </ins>”. For example, ascending seraphim achieve this recognition for their valiant cooperation with some ascending mortal who was trinitized and thus receives the divine embrace to henceforth be a ”Trinidized Custodian."

But, for me, the most impressive part of the chapter is the following section: when the creatures replicate the action of divinity in the trinitization technique. When he speaks of the “<ins>Trinitized Sons of Perfection</ins>”, wonderful creatures that have been trinitized by Paradise-Havona creatures or by perfected mortals, some of which are retrinsized by Divinity in a new creative embrace.

Rather than getting lost in a cumbersome descriptive taxonomy about the TRINIDIZED SONS OF GOD, for me, it is more interesting to know different aspects of the supreme technique of Trinitization. What is the technique of trinitization? This supreme creative technique is not fully revealed except to those who have passed through it, therefore we are given only a sketch.

Apparently, creatures can only participate in this experience <ins>once</ins>, while the Paradise Deity has no limits in performing trinitization episodes. They also tell us that with this technique a <ins>singular modification of the personality of one</ins> of the two actors is produced, so that they become spiritually one, although they continue to be considered as two personalities; where one goes, the other goes, what one does, the other does. It is an _almost divine_ experience: when the Father and the Son united to eternalize the Infinite Spirit, they became one and have been one ever since.

When is it possible to make this so exceptional? Adjuster-fused mortal finaliters when stationed on Paradise have a recess period every Havona millennium. There are _seven ways_ to spend this duty-free period and _one_ of them is to associate with another finaliter or some Paradise Havona personality, and attempt trinitization of a creature. Everything starts from the fact that the creatures try to _spiritualize, idealize and update a selected and original concept, never trinitized before_. They try to bring into existence a concept selected by them. Apparently, this takes a lot of time and effort _and sometimes there's no success_, so those who fail go down to a special group who have endured the ultimate disappointment. These creature trinitized beings are endowed by the Father with personality. Furthermore, we are told that the trinitized children of a mortal ascendant and an inhabitant of Paradise-Havona express supercreational ideas, ideals and experience, they transcend the creational limits of the present age, therefore they belong to a future age, therefore They are _momentarily of no practical value_ in the administration of the superuniverses or the central universe.

Therefore, what an amazing future can await us: finite creatures who are thus contributing to the experiential expansion of the Supreme and replicating a divine technique. Worthy children of our Father...

Trinitization is a technique very similar to the creation of beings, as performed by the creators. It is an undertaking that is undertaken when we arrive in Paradise, when our consciousness of time is submerged in eternity. In the Book there are at least two allusions to the average time it takes a mortal to reach Paradise.

Our destiny as finaliters is determined by our life trajectory: for example, Mighty Messengers are finaliters who have begun life on worlds in rebellion. But this “determination” does not violate our free will. At this point in our evolutionary career, it is more than likely that our desires coincide with the choice of destiny that best suits us.

As humanity we must evolve at all levels: material, intellectual and spiritual. Western civilization is still going through the materialistic “fever”, but it is our obligation as human beings to evolve at the aforementioned levels. The circumstances that have occurred on our planet have led us to experience disastrous events, which are not necessary in themselves to develop harmoniously, since other planets have not gone through such adverse circumstances and yet they develop satisfactorily. We are all in the same boat, and we all have to learn from everyone. Science should not go against material-intellectual-spiritual progress.

Given this, it is inevitable to question the nature of evil and its existence. The Book clearly distinguishes between wrongful evil and deliberate evil. It is a fact that evil makes us learn. Nothing happens in vain. The Mighty Messengers were mortals from worlds in rebellion, so they are a living example that all experience is used to give rise to a greater and (of course) better good.

We recall here the “inevitabilities” of <a id="a79_40"></a>[UB 3:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p5_5). How could we grow without free will? We need choice. At all times we cannot assume the responsibilities of others, but our own. Necessity, and not well-being, is what sharpens our wits.

Comparing ourselves to Havona beings, we can say that they are perfect for the love **of** God, and ascending mortals will be perfect for the love **of** God.
