I have been a reader of The Urantia Book for about 7 years. Having had the great fortune to lead a study group of the book at my home for 5 years, I had to give it up following a move. This has in no way diminished my enthusiasm for the study or the application in life of the teachings of this masterful revelation.

Six years ago, without knowing a single reader, I really wanted to attend the world L U meeting in Helsinki. What a pleasant experience to find yourself among your own people, those who speak the same language, whether they are Russians, Finns, Australians, Greeks, Americans or French. Obviously, friendships were formed and projects took shape in my head. But what really struck me was the number of young people present at this meeting. I talked a lot with them, their level of awareness and responsibility being astonishing. Their ages varied between 22 and 30 years old. Almost all of them had been introduced to L U by their parents.

As for me, I had the incredible luck of being born to knowledgeable parents, full of love and common sense. The awakening of my spirituality was there, in the cradle where the fruits of the Spirit were my bread. However, I was an unbaptized child who did not belong to any church. The path to GOD certainly does not need to go through catechism or the church.

Today, having reached middle age, living together with a reader of the L U, he and I look in the same direction, that is to say the path towards our FATHER. Often we are so aware of the immense luck of having in our hands this magnificent tool called “The Urantia Book”. And we wondered how to disseminate these texts. A desire that each reader must certainly have felt: to share with others the discovery of this revelation. I prayed ardently that GOD would give us a sign; and I did not have to wait very long.

One day, when we were at the home of a recent reader of the book, we were very struck by the large number of young teenagers coming to see this reader, “to discuss the affairs of GOD, of life, then of love”. Clearly these young people on a spiritual quest, finding no listening from their parents, met regularly at the home of someone available for them on Sundays.

Back home, very quickly the idea took shape to try and suggest the initiative of a L U study group with these teenagers. We can't believe what joy and what responsibility we are offered to have the privilege of being able to be of service to these teenagers dying of spiritual hunger to know more about GOD, life after death, etc. There are 6 of them; a girl and 5 boys, all around 17 years old. Max and I are fascinated by their high level of intelligence and their ability to record. For several months now we have been meeting once a month on a Sunday afternoon. After 3 to 4 hours of study, no fatigue or weariness on their part. This is partly thanks to Max who has the pleasure of transmitting the teaching of L U to others. These young people ask him a multitude of questions on complex subjects to which Max provides the answers.

We explained to them that they represent the future of our planet. That they certainly possess an extraordinary maturity to be there with us, at their age wanting to study GOD's plan. And that we are so happy to be able to be there with them, at their side in their quest to find GOD and his Love.

We wish other readers of the L U to one day taste the joy of accompanying young people in their search for the Truth. And to be able to help them begin a balanced and fulfilling future life based on the fruits of the Spirit. Thus allowing them to discover in turn the Love of GOD and eternal life.
