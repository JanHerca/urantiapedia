After a short interruption in the regularity of our autumn meeting in Burgundy, we were happy to return, from November 10 to 12, 2006, to the small village of Armeau, nestled in one of the loops of the Yonne.

Etymologically, the name Armeau is intertwined with the history of its landscape. Border land shared between the county of Joigny and the king's fiefdom, it seems that Armeau has often remained a “desert”, a cyclically abandoned or unexploited area. Long spelled “Ermeau”, it comes from the Latin “eremus”. Its meaning would therefore be “the small desert”. Even today, indeed, Armeau is a quiet village where nothing of importance ever seems to happen, apart from the regular flow of Parisian vacationers on the national road 6, which crosses the village, and the autumn meetings of the AFLUB.

We therefore found ourselves, as usual, at the “La Vallée de l'Yonne” relay, in the heart of the village. Upon arrival, on November 10, 2006, the new arrivals were surprised, and the old ones happy, to find this comfortable accommodation, with its rooms with warm woodwork conducive to evenings, relaxation and study. The beautiful residence is bordered by the Yonne, and walks on its banks are conducive to meditation.

In the evening, almost the entire Urantian troop was present.

The reunion was sincere, full of joy and good humor.

The presence of the Belgians, who have long been missing, with Karuna and Johan Vandewalle-Leys and Bernard Mertens, fills us with joy.

We felt the same joy when we saw Georges Michelson-Dupont and his wife Marlène again the next day.

The setting was ready for good study in communion and fellowship.

The theme of this meeting, “Heritage and biological and cultural foundations of the individual”, was addressed through several presentations that were as diverse as they were fascinating.

Four different topics were prepared by various readers, and debated:
- Cultural and spiritual heritage of the individual — Max Masotti
- Inheritance and biological foundations of the individual — Chris Ragetly
- What is biological life? — Alain Coulombe, Dominique Ronfet (with slideshow)
- How adjutants work — Georges Michelson-Dupont

The interest in the themes aroused such enthusiasm that, exceptionally, the participants did not spend time visiting the surrounding area as we were used to.

This confirms our idea that the chosen subject and the new working method (all together, and not in small groups) found a very interesting echo among all the participants.

Special tribute must be paid to our dear president, who was like a fish in water with his qualities as an orator and moderator.

A big thank you to all the participants, eight women and twenty men, for their exemplary discipline and their interest, demonstrated by the listening they showed during the presentations and their participation in the debates, under the gaze of a large number of guardian angels and a Spirit of Truth always attentive and complicit.

As for the material side of things, we were surprised and spoiled by the creativity and talent of a cook and her assistants, who did their utmost to serve us succulent dishes.

The welcome was also very friendly and warm as well as the comfort and cleanliness of the rooms and premises.

This proves to us that interest in the spiritual in no way obscures the ability to enjoy the good sides of material life.

Saturday evening was reserved for the meeting of all regional managers, who discussed the projects completed over the last six months and those to come, as well as the structures to be put in place for the smooth running of the association; a meeting which ended at midnight.

Sunday morning was devoted to a public debate around eugenics.

This debate led to lively discussions between readers, but always in the same fraternal atmosphere, on the different points of view and approaches of the participants.

Having been unable to close this debate due to lack of time, an appointment was made for the next meeting at Notre Dame des Lumières, in May 2007, to try to define and conclude this complex and thorny problem.

Following the midday lunch, preparations for departure saw warm goodbyes and various hugs between all the readers, hoping to see us all again together at our next meeting in May at Lumières.
