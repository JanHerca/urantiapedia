<p style="text-align:center;">
Land of tenderness<br>
and beauty,<br>
Warmer and tender<br>
Than one flesh,<br>
Land of the sky<br>
Heaven of the earth,<br>
You are the clothing of fair children.<br>
<br>
God, in Your first goodness<br>
You have brought so much light,<br>
So much grace in the blue of the sea,<br>
So much sweetness on winter days.<br>
You did everything in color,<br>
You have filled our eyes<br>
And satisfied our hearts.<br>
<br>
Oh! the heavy wheat of every day<br>
Living on wind and light<br>
Living from the death of winter,<br>
Everyday heavy wheat<br>
Are radiant with Your love.<br>
<br>
God our Father<br>
How beautiful you have made the earth,<br>
Where we see only misery.<br>
<br>
You every day,<br>
Without being angry at our ingratitude,<br>
Of our iniquity,<br>
Never getting tired of you<br>
From our poor prayers,<br>
You put off, day after day,<br>
Splendid and sweet,<br>
The big sky, stretched out over us.<br>
<br>
Man is blind<br>
In his career.<br>
</p>

Daniel Courvoisier
