At its best the religion of the spirit is an intimate partnership involving actively sharing every moment of our existence with the indwelling spirit of God while voluntarily seeking to make all of life's decisions in full accord with the will of the Father. At the present level of development of mortal beings on Urantia, the Will of God under various circumstances is ofen best discovered with reference to the life and teaching of Jesus of Nazareth who always functioned in accord with God's will. Hence if we are thoroughly familiar with Jesus life, at any moment of time and in any circumstance, we can always ask ourselves, “What would Jesus have done?”—while at the same time striving to be in accord with the spirit within. Experience will teach us to recognize the state of mental peace, assurance, and confidence that accompanies sincerity in our decision making. ||
