In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful! Praised be God, Lord of the Universes.

Every time I start something, whatever it is, I always try to say this sentence feeling it. It was recommended to me by a Muslim brother, because according to tradition it brings a lot of “baraka”, that is, luck (that things turn out well).

Also, according to the Muslim tradition (those who submit to God), the mortal who gets to know the hundredth name of God will be immortal. This name is THE REAL. “To know” in the sense is equivalent to realizing, uniting, becoming one with the concept or the person. When we become fused with our Thought Adjuster, we have accomplished this, that is, we have succeeded in making the reality of God in ourselves, and consequently we leave Urantia without dying and go directly to Paradise, without passing through the mansion worlds or await the resurrection of the body. The Prophet Muhammad (God's glory be upon Him) gives a description of the seven heavens that circumscribe God, it is a vision of the mansion worlds, but it must be kept in mind that he does not accept in his mind the infinite love of God for his creatures and therefore cannot understand the concept of the Son of God. He knows that God is the Infinitely Compassionate and the Infinitely Merciful, but he does not come to the realization of Divine Love.

Continuing with the teachings of the Qur'an (I am a Christian, but I affirm with my fellow Muslims that the Holy Qur'an is perfect and that it is fully revealed), another of the Qur'anic practices that open communication with the Thought Adjuster is in [surah 24 ( The Light), verse 35](/en/book/Quran/24): “GOD is the LIGHT”, and it is one of the mystical keys that make us friends of God. Says the following:

> God is the Light of heaven and earth. His Light is comparable to a niche in which there is a burning wick. The wick is in a glass container, which is like a shining star. It is lit from a blessed tree, an olive tree, which is neither from the East nor from the West and whose oil almost illuminates even without having been touched by fire. Light on Light! God directs his Light to whoever he wants. God proposes parables to men. God is omniscient.

It is not complete, but I kept this because for Muslims it is a supererogatory action, that is, they make you a friend of God. At that time I worked for a long time sitting at a table, I made a glass niche and used olive oil. I turned it on at my work table. Every time I looked up from my work, my eyes went to the niche, to the memory of God. After a while, this simple fact began to give me a joy that grew until my heart lit up. I thanked the Father for my work, my ability to make it almost perfect because, since nothing I possess is mine (intelligence, will, knowledge, energy), absolutely everything that made my work possible comes from Him, my gratitude was constantly on the rise With practice, that shining star stays on your forehead (inner vision), you become almost constantly aware of its presence, and that even allows you to do dynamic meditation, that is, you can perform certain tasks while you are truly in divine contemplation.

Finally, I have pondered for years the following thought:

“I AM the LIGHT that illuminates every man who comes into the world”, together with “I AM the open door that no man can close”.

The only thing that the MASTER asks of us, as you well know, is:

“Love God above all things and love your neighbor as yourself.”

Now, how can we love God, whom we do not know through our senses, if we are not capable of loving our neighbor, whom we do know?

Jesus gives us the key again: “Be perfect, as your Father who is in heaven is”. How do you suggest we accomplish this? Well, I humbly understand that trying to do perfectly all our activities, from the most prosaic to the most sublime.

But let's break this down a bit. Now we can turn to the UB, which tells us more or less the following:

The mortal man, who manages to overcome his animal nature, automatically makes the third circle (the one corresponding to the Divine Minister; I understand it easier if I call it Earthly Mother). But how is this achieved? I think we will have to investigate what LOVE really is. How can we approach this concept? We know that God is ABSOLUTE and INFINITE LOVE.

If we focus our attention on the nature that surrounds us, we already have a fairly good approximation of that Love of God, translated into the organization of Life, vegetable or animal. He has foreseen everything, he has accomplished everything, so that life is perpetuated and perfected. Here I find an example of how the Love of God is within the reach of our senses.

If I look at my own body, from the outset I don't know how it is made, I don't know how it works, not even to move a finger am I able to know how that movement is achieved. What are the muscles involved, what electrical stimuli make movement of the muscles involved possible, through what nerve channels are they transmitted or in what part of my brain the impulse arises... What I do know for sure is that my Father has given me given a little universe for you to experience; that universe is my own body. I have not created it, I am not capable of creating another equal to it, I am incapable of directing it voluntarily. I just have to think that I have to move a finger, for example, and the finger moves...

Then I accept that my body is a small universe, comparable to any universe in the cosmos and, if that has happened with me, the same with any living being, and by extension I come to admire, respect and love nature and all its creatures...

As for me, I admire, respect and begin to love that Creator Being who has given me life. What tools have I used to get here? Observation, concentration and meditation. That is why I begin my communication with the aforementioned prayer, and whatever I do I have meditated on it many times, until I managed to fill my heart with gratitude, joy and love for God.

The next step, physical love, is apparently an animal expression (instinctive) for the perpetuation of the species, degrading for some... But the first time I kissed a woman I felt such joy and such fullness that I stopped confessing ( I was 19 years old, a practicing Catholic and almost daily communion). I flatly refused to accept the theses of Rome, I honestly thought that it had a lot of divine; I practically became an atheist. I was also lucky that my parents were one of those couples who are made for each other on every level. With the passage of time I came to realize that this love between a man and a woman is not only to engender life, but the key to making a harmonious and stable family possible.

I continue to marvel at how God foresees things, the development of his mortal creatures... I kept meditating on love, God is love and gives everything for the pleasure of giving. Without expecting anything in return. I once read that the closest thing on Earth to the Love of God is the love of a mother for her children. I refused to see women as objects of pleasure; my concept of women was transformed. I proposed to myself, with every woman that crossed my path, to find what was beautiful about her, no matter how old she was and whatever she was. This I have done for years. Over time I managed to stop desiring them a priori, I came to the concept of “flower-woman”: I saw them, enjoying what was beautiful about them, and wishing the best for them and for the man who had the fortune to love them...

As for my own wife, I applied the concept of perfection of love: giving everything and giving up my own pleasure. Of course it was gradual, but I got it. In this way, the animal nature of Man is overcome and the realization of the third circle is reached. I meditated a lot on the Principle that the woman embodied... One day I realized that every woman is worthy of respect, tenderness and love, because she is the earthly model of the Divine Minister, the Holy Spirit or the earthly Mother. Whenever you unite with your women, consider this principle first, and try to apply the concept of Divine Love in your relationship with her. This is the easiest and most powerful way I know of to approach the Holy Spirit. From here, try to meditate this thought: “They are all my children”, and realize it in your performance.

Some of you may tell me that with this human life is extinguished. I have the other part. Try that your children are not a consequence of animal excitement but of the Life Principle, that is, that they are made as a consequence of the love that unites the couple. You know that in all human love there is a divine component and, consequently, you recognize that in that act of union you both consciously become co-creators with God.

The next goal for approaching our Thought Adjuster is the attainment of the second circle, the circle of the Son. Think that in this situation we have the two seraphic guardians of destiny (gift of the Holy Spirit), [I suggest you focus your feeling of love on them. You will be surprised by the results], the Spirit of Truth (gift of the Creator Son) and our Thought Adjuster. How is the second circle achieved? Jesus gave the key to Peter:

«How many times do I have to forgive my brother, Master? Up to seven times? “No, Peter, up to seventy times seven, and until you see the Kingdom of Heaven come true before you.”

How can we forgive those who offend us? It is really easy if we recognize that the mighty presence of God is in them.

I am not exposing this because I believe someone special. On the contrary, I am very clear that the greatest in the family of God is the one who serves best and, of course, before me there are many. But some time ago, while walking the Camino de Santiago, the following question came to mind:

Which pilgrim is better, the one who leaves Roncesvalles, at the beginning of the path, or the one who arrives in Santiago? The answer is that both are the same; it is only a temporary matter that differentiates them.

I also tell you that my teacher urged me to use the Koran to get closer to God, and he was authentically Christian. But he really knew what he was doing.

I say goodbye with the greeting of my order:

Nothing for me, Lord, nothing for me. Everything is for the glory of your name.

The Peace of God be with you.
