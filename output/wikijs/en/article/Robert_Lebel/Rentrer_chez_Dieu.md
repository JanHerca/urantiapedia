Poem dedicated to Jean Royer

Go home dear God...
As we return home dearly

At the end of each day,
At the end of our travels,
And find near Him
The return of his heart.

Learn from Him
What it means to love...
And relight this fire
That he came to spread.

Know how to say thank you to Him,
And ask for forgiveness,
And embrace Him without fear
In the face of the world!

Search in His gaze
To get lost without end...
blissful silence
Simple people who understand each other.

Sadness and joy of the soul,
Anguish and hope,
Passions and worries...
Everything, everything passes through our eyes.

He knows everything, it's true.
He sees everything. Yet...
He waits for our hearts
Arranged in the Link.

Return to God...
Like coming home.
Tired, consumed,
But capable of loving.

To be there.... Just to be there...
Drop your arms...
And then let yourself be taken
When He opens His own.

I love you, God,
i love you,
Further than any love,
stronger than any fault.

And I know I am loved,
No, not alone, no,
But good with all those
That you have entrusted to me.

They are there by my side,
And I bring them to You:
Let them also come to You,
As we come home...

Robert Lebel
