All of us,
all from the same trait,
all coming from the full Line of the very high,
our destiny leads us towards the recognition of
our double birth.
Children of men, we are also born of
supreme design of the full Line of the very high.

Full line from the very top,
we are the target of your vibrant bow,
and your arrow stuck,
sting of infinity in the heart of our life,
is our love sting.

O full line from the very high,
of your presence,
of your present within our original core,
you want to highlight our thoughts.

The inner pilot guides us.
The magnetization of its compass is unwavering.
Full line from the very top,
Full stroke from the very top, we are of the same ink.
We don't know yet.
Our dotted hands search for the most
deep sleep
a glorious awakening by your side.
O Full Line from the very high,
the creature must dare to join the creator.
We will anchor the outline of our lives to your line.

Oh full line
Single trait that connects all creation
Single line without beginning or end
We want to blend into the drawing
of your original line.
We are yours.
Your infinite love is capable of animating
the slightest shred of true consciousness.
O Full Line from the very high, invisible to our eyes of flesh,
O Full Line, throughout the long journey which must bring us together, show us the way.

Oh full line,
Full line from the very top,
I beg you
Grant us your kind help.
O Full Line of the High Line, I pray to you.

Michel Bezier
