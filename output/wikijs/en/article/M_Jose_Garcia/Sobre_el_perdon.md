Reading in my beloved blue book, I realized that I did not dignify forgiveness in the category that the FATHER has it.

We know that we entered the KINGDOM by our living FAITH, but the measure to know in what depth we are in it, is the forgiveness that we profess to our neighbor. I quote: “_It is in the consideration of the technique of receiving God’s forgiveness that the attainment of the righteousness of the kingdom is revealed. FAITH is the price you pay for entrance into the family of God; but forgiveness is the act of GOD which accepts your FAITH as the price of admission._” <a id="a39_468"></a>[UB 170:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p3_3)

The neighbor turns my head. I consider the neighbor as someone who interacts with you in a wide circle of your daily life, that is, apart from your family and friends, the supermarket cashier, the one who sells you something, the taxi driver, etc. It is hard and difficult work because with this acceleration of the times that we have to live in, we do not have the necessary minutes to be able to look at the other and understand their personal motivations that lead them to this behavior. This is where we fail because by not giving ourselves this space, we flirt with prejudice and fail to see the other as they really are, and we get angry and annoyed because it invades our tranquility and harmony that it is so difficult for us to maintain. WHAT A DILEMMA!!!!!

It seems to me that with those close to us many times it does not happen very differently, because we are solving our own problems and we do not always pay the necessary attention to that loved one who speaks to us, therefore we partially understand what they wanted to tell us. We must deepen our efforts to look at the other and give him his time, in order to understand him and know how to forgive him, because that way we will be able to see what is happening to him. Just as the FATHER understands us because he gives himself the time (without time) to get to know each other one by one and what's more, he puts his beings to take care of us and protect us. How we lack!!!!!!
