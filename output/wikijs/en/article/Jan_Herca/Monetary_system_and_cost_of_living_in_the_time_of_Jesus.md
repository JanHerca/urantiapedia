## The Monetary System

The value of a coin was not equal to its precious metal content. It can be estimated that the denarius, the reference coin, was worth 1.6 to 2.85 times the value of the silver it contained.

The authority to mint gold or silver coins rested solely with the Roman emperor (at the time of Jesus, first Octavian Augustus and then Tiberius), and the minting of high-value coins was centralized in Rome. These coins were of interest to the tax collection machinery. As for bronze and copper coins, there was more permissiveness, and Rome allowed local minting by client kings or their provincial governors. In 18 BC, Augustus carried out a monetary reform that left the value and conversions of coins as we indicate in this document.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

The official coins of the Roman Empire and its provinces were these:

- Aureo (in Latin _Aureus_): it was the highest coin, made of gold. It was equivalent to 25 denarii or 400 ases.
- Gold quinary (in Latin _Denarius Aureum_ or _Quinarius Aureus_): it was half a golden coin, that is, 12 and a half denarii.
- Denarius (Latin: _Denarius Argenteus_): was the official coin of the Roman Empire, made of silver, a replica of the ancient Greek drachma. In the time of Jesus it was worth 16 ases. It started out worth 10 ases (hence the word denarius) but by the time of Jesus it had been devalued to 16 ases. One side featured a bust of the emperor and the other often featured Roman religious motifs, such as the _lituum_ (the augurs' staff) and ceremonial vessels. It weighed about 3.36 g, an eighth of an ounce (27 g).
- Silver quinarius (Latin: _Quinarius Argenteus_): or half a denarius, also made of silver; it was worth 8 ases.
- Sestertius (Latin: _Sestertius_): was usually a bronze coin, although it could be made of silver; it was a quarter of a denarius or 4 ases.
- Dupondius (Latin _Dupondius_): bronze, one-eighth of a denarius or two asses (hence its name).
- As (Latin _Aes_): Augustus minted a double series of bronze and brass or orichalcum, difficult to distinguish from the dupondii.
- Semis (Latin _Semis_): half of an as; minted in a double series of bronze and brass or orichalcum.
- Quadrant (Latin _Quadrans_): one-fourth of an as; it was bronze.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

However, in the area of ​​Judea and its surroundings, and in the rest of the known world, other coins were used locally and predominantly over official coins. They were never made of gold, since this metal was reserved for imperial coins, and were usually made of silver and bronze. Along with the official coins of the Roman Empire, provincial coins minted in Antioch and Tyre (of the Greek type) and later local Jewish coins (probably minted in Caesarea) were also in circulation in Judea. Added to this is the special case of the coin used for paying taxes at the Temple of Jerusalem, which could only be a special coin minted in Tyre.

In summary, the following coins were used in the Hebrew area:

- _Selah_ (Hebrew word, plural _sela'im_): silver. It was a coin equivalent to two Tyrian shekels, which were called there the tetradrachm, but which was obviously not the same as the Greek tetradrachm.
- Tyrian shekel: a _shekel_ (see below) minted in Tyre with which every Jew was required to pay the Temple tax, which was half a shekel per person per year. This was the reason for the existence of money changers in the Temple precincts, which Jesus lamented, since as usurers they received a hefty commission for exchanging coins. It was equivalent to four silver denarii. The famous thirty coins paid to Judas for his betrayal are believed to have been shekels (see below).
- _Zuz_ (Hebrew word, plural _zuzzim_): silver. It was a coin equivalent to the denarius and the drachma that was in use before the Jewish territory fell under Roman rule and was minted again by the Jews themselves during the Bar Kochba revolt, but during Jesus' lifetime it was disavowed in favor of the Roman denarius. However, due to its popularity among Jews, it is quite possible that in certain regions it continued in subversive and shadowy use. Although this term is used interchangeably with the denarius, the _zuz_ was actually originally equivalent to the Greek drachma, which was a quarter of a Greek tetradrachm, about 17 grams in weight, while the denarius was a quarter of a Tyrian shekel (or Jewish tax shekel) or a tetradrachma of the provinces of the Roman Empire, about 14 grams in weight. It was therefore somewhat more valuable than the drachma customary in the provinces and was hence preferred by the Jews.
- _Kalbon_ (Hebrew word, plural _kalbonot_): made of silver. It is not clear whether it was equivalent to one-sixth or one-twelfth of a denarius or _zuz_. If it was a sixth, then it was equivalent to an ancient Hebrew coin called _gerah_ or _ma'ah_ (plural _ma'ot_), and if it was a sixth, then it was equivalent to an ancient coin called _half-ma'ah_. Two _kalbon_ were the typical amount kept by the priests when collecting the temple tax, supposedly to pay the money changers.
- _Perutah_ (Hebrew word, plural _perutot_): made of bronze, equal to 2 _lepta_. It was equivalent to the Roman _quadrans_.
- _Lepton_ (Greek word, plural: _lepta_): made of bronze or copper, the smallest coin used in Judea at the time of Jesus. Also called _mite_. In English, it is sometimes erroneously translated as _obols_ or _ebolos_, although this was another Greek silver coin and was not equivalent. The famous widow in the gospels cast several of these coins into the temple treasury. ([UB 172:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p4_2))

It's worth noting that in Jesus' time, two currencies were always in use. One was the “official” currency used in the temple in Jerusalem (such as the _selaim_, the shekels, and the half-shekels), and then there was the same currency, but in use outside Jerusalem, in Galilee or other regions. These coins were often called by the same name, but contained much less silver, like half or a fifth less, and therefore had less value. When a tax was levied, it was usually indicated in amounts of the _selah_ of Judea, or the _selah_ of Galilee. A Galilean had to pay an extra percentage if he paid in the local currency of his region, or he was forced to exchange the currency for the official currency used in the temple through money changers who charged a commission for these transactions.

In the Phoenician and Carthaginian regions we had:

- Trishekel: silver, or three shekels.
- Dishekel: silver, or two shekels.
- Shekel or shekel: silver. It was worth 4 denarii or drachmas, or the tetradrachm .
- Half a shekel: worth half a shekel.
- Quarter of a shekel: worth a quarter of a shekel.
- Agora: worth 1/20 to 1/25 of a shekel.

In the Greek region (Alexandria and Greece) we had:

- Billon tetradrachms: introduced by Emperor Tiberius in Alexandria; it was worth four drachmas. An earlier silver tetradrachm existed, but it fell into disuse because of the billon coin. The billon is an alloy of silver and copper, approximately 50% in content, called from the French _billon_, meaning ingot.
- Drachma: made of silver; equivalent to the denarius, and represented 6 obols, 24 digalms, or 48 calcs of this period. It was the official currency of the Hellenistic period, which in pre-Roman times served the same purpose as the Roman denarius, but ceased to be minted during the Roman Empire in favor of the denarius.
- Obolus: silver; one-sixth of a drachma, introduced by Augustus in Alexandria. It was an intermediate coin between the Roman sestertius and dupondius.
- Dichalcus: bronze; a quarter of an obolus, introduced by Augustus in Alexandria. It was a coin between the Roman semis and as.
- Calcus: bronze, an eighth of an obolus, introduced by Augustus in Alexandria. It was a coin between the Roman semis and quadrans.

In Mesopotamia we had:

- Talent: although it was initially a Babylonian monetary measure, the one with the highest value, its designation later spread throughout the known world, to designate large sums of money. In Roman times a talent was 100 pounds of silver, or 1,200 ounces of silver (1 pound = 12 ounces), or 9,600 denarii (1 ounce, 27 g = 8 denarii), or 153,600 ases (about €230,000 in 2025 if we take as a possible conversion 1 ase = €1.5 in 2025).
- Mina: another monetary measure, not a coin, which was 1/60 of a talent, or 160 denarii or 2,560 ases.

In Pergamon we had:

- Cistophorus: A silver coin symbolizing the ancient kingdoms of Pergamon (kingdoms that would later become the Roman province of Asia), minted from the 2nd century BC and continuing to be issued through the 1st century AD, under the first emperors of the Empire. The name cistophorus comes from the person who carried the “cista mystica” used in the cult of Dionysus, which contained a serpent inside. Minted mainly in Ephesus and Pergamon and with a value of three denarii, it eventually adopted Roman motifs and styles.

In India we had:

- Satamana: Silver; equivalent to 3 karshapana.
- Karshapana: A characteristic rectangular silver coin from ancient India. Their single-sided minting, the absence of writing, and above all, the different symbols that distinguished the series (and perhaps the reigns, although these have not been clearly deciphered), differentiated these primitive coins from those minted in the Greek world. These primitive issues (5th-2nd centuries BC) were based on silver, their unit of account being the “ratti”, the mass of the scarlet gunja seed weighing 0.11 gr. The main coins are called: satamana, weighing 11 gr (100 rattis) and karshapana with 3.5 gr (32 rattis). It was approximately equivalent to a denarius.

## Comparison with today's currencies (in the year 2025)

Considering the prices and cost of living in Jesus' time, it's safe to say that there's a relative correspondence between the value of the Roman as and the 1.5 euro in the countries of the European Community today. This can give an idea of ​​what products would have cost at that time. But a caveat must be made. Of course, at that time the cost of living was lower, as there was hardly any middle class, and people lived with far fewer material comforts than those enjoyed in Europe today. However, the correlation of 1.5 euro / 1 as can be used to calculate the relative cost of basic foodstuffs.

## Jewish Coins of Herod the Great (37–4 BC)

The coins of Herod the Great continued the Jewish tradition of not depicting idols. However, a Herodian _prutah_ was the first coin since the Persian period to depict a living creature, an eagle, which may have been an allusion to the golden eagle that Herod had placed over the entrance to the Temple and which caused great offense to the Jews ([AJ 17:6](/en/book/Judaism/The_Works_of_Flavius_Josephus/Antiquities_17#v6_2)).

Other objects depicted on Herod's coins included a winged caduceus and the pomegranate (_rimmon_), one of the seven species mentioned in the Bible with which the Land of Israel had been blessed, a feathered helmet and shield, the stern of a ship, and a palm branch. The denomination of Herod's largest issue bears a year, Year 3, and shows several unusual designs, such as a helmet with large cheekpieces, surmounted by a star. The denomination of the second largest issue features a crested helmet and shield, as well as the Greek letter Chi within a diadem and a tripod with a ceremonial bowl. These designs are surrounded by the Greek inscription ΉΡΩΔΟΥ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ (of King Herod).

The Greek letter Chi, representing the “crown of Kehunah” (high priest), and the diadem, representing the “crown of Malchus”, are taken to mean that Herod claimed both offices for himself.

The most common _prutah_ issued by Herod the Great is similar in design to the Hasmonean coins, an anchor with the Greek inscription ΉΡωΔ ΒΆCΙ (King Herod), and a caduceus between two cornucopias, which was intended as a continuation of the Hasmonean coinage as well as a continuation of the Hasmonean dynasty.

## Jewish coins of Herod Archelaus (4 BC - 6 AD)

The most common coins of Herod Archelaus are small _prutot_ depicting a bunch of grapes (one of the seven species), a crested helmet with his name (Herod) and title (ethnarch) in Greek (ΉΡΩΔ ΕΘΝ), and the prow of a ship and a wreath with his name and abbreviated title. Grapes were commonly depicted on Jewish coins, as they served as a reminder of the country's fertility. Other coins of Archelaus showed the prow of a ship and a laurel wreath.

A rare double _prutah_ of Herod Archelaus depicts a galley attached to a double cornucopia, also inscribed in Greek with his name and title.

## Jewish Coins of Herod Antipas (4th BC - 39 AD)

Coins of Herod Antipas are quite rare, and can be divided into four categories: i) coins dated “24 years” with the inscription TIBETIΙΆC (Tiberias), where the coins were minted, with a crown on the reverse; ii) coins dated 33, 34 or 37, which also have the inscription TΙΒΕΡΙΆC on the reverse; iii) coins dated 43 with the inscription ΓΆΙΩ ΚΆΙCΆΡΙ ΓΕΡΜΆΝΙΚΩ (Gaius Caesar Germanicus) on the reverse; and iv) a single known example of a coin dated 'year 4' with the inscription TΕΤ ΡΆ-ΉCΔ, ΉΡ W.

Herod Antipas coins were minted in four denominations, with the inscription TΙΒΕΡΙΆC on the reverse within a wreath. The obverse bore the Greek inscription “Herod the Tetrarch” (ΗΡωΔΌΎ ΤΕΤΡΆΡΧΌΎ) with an upright palm branch. One type of variant represents a reed in an upright position.

## Jewish coins of Herod Philip II (4 BC - 34 AD)

The coins of Herod Philip II are mostly medium-sized bronze. He was the first Jewish ruler to put portraits of himself and the Roman emperors on his coins. An early coinage has a portrait of the Emperor Augustus, with the Greek inscription “KAICAPI CEBACTΩ” on the obverse, and “ΦΙΛΙΠΠΌΎ ΤΕΤΡΆΡΧΌΎ” on the reverse. Later coins showed Tiberius, depicted on the obverse with the inscription “ΦΙΛΙΠΠΌΎ TIBEPIOΣ ΣEBAΣ”, and “ΤΕΤΡΆΡΧΌΎ” on the reverse. Both types had a four-columned temple facade on the reverse, possibly the Temple in Jerusalem. The coins were dated according to the Emperor's regnal year.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

## Jewish Coins of Coponius (6 – 9 AD)

Coponius was the first Roman prefect of Judea, being appointed in 6 AD, when Herod Archelaus, son of Herod the Great, was deposed and exiled to Gaul by Augustus. Coponius’s coins feature the palm tree with two bunches of dates, which has appeared only in rare instances on the coins of Herod Antipas. The palm tree design was later used to represent Judea on coins issued by the Jews during the First and Second Revolts, as well as later Roman coins.

On the obverse, Coponius' coins show an ear of barley. The depiction of the palm trees and barley was done out of sensitivity to the Jewish belief not to depict living beings, especially human beings, on coins, so they do not have the portrait of Augustus, the emperor. However, the inscriptions on the coins clearly proclaim that Judea was occupied by Imperial Rome, hence the Greek letters surrounding the barley: [K] AISA-ros [«of Caesar»] with the date, also in Greek letters, in the frame of the palm tree.

## Jewish Coins of Marcus Ambibulos (9 – 12 AD)

Marcus Ambibulos was the prefect of Judea from 9 to 12 AD. He issued a coin for each of the three years of his rule. Like those issued by Coponius, the coins of Ambibulus depict a palm tree with two bunches of dates and an ear of barley.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

## Jewish Coins of Valerius Gratus (12 – 26 AD)

Valerius Gratus was prefect of Judea under the Emperor Tiberius. Gratus issued several different types of coins over as many years. Symbols depicted on the coins included palm branches, lilies, horns of plenty or cornucopias, vine leaves, and amphorae. His coins showed the title Caesar inside a crown, and TIB, the name of the emperor, or that of his mother Julia (IOYLIA), and the year of his reign above two cornucopias.

## Coins during Pontius Pilate (26 – 36 AD)

The bronze coins or _prutah_ issued by Pontius Pilate between 26 and 36 AD are of particular interest to Christians and Jews because of their connection to Jesus and their role in Jewish history. From his coinage, it is thought that Pilate was determined to promote Roman religion in Judea, regardless of whether it was offensive to the Jews. Unlike his predecessors, his coins depict Roman symbolism related to the imperial cult, such as the simpulum and lituus. However, it has been argued that if Pilate was deliberately trying to offend the Jews, he would have depicted a bust of the emperor on the obverse of his coins. Instead, he painted three ears of barley. A third type of coin displayed palm branches and an inscription.

The lituus was the wand of the augur and was used to interpret natural phenomena such as lightning, the flight of birds, and so on. The simpulum was a spoon used to make libations at sacrifices and was a common symbol of Roman priests. These symbols would undoubtedly offend Jewish religious sensibilities, especially since they appeared on a coin in such everyday use.

## The Tyrian Shekel for the Payment of Tribute

In the 2nd century BC, Rome had two types of coins in circulation in the Mediterranean region, one in Tyre, Lebanon, and the second in Antioch. Tyrian shekels and half-shekels, 95% pure silver, were minted in Tyre between 127 BC and 19 BC. In 19 BC Rome closed the mint at Tyre and began importing an inferior silver coinage from the Far East consisting of 80% pure silver.

The religious leaders in Israel, realizing that the new coinage was not pure enough to fulfill the commandment to give the temple in Jerusalem half a shekel, asked the emperor for permission to produce a ceremonial coin with sufficient purity to fulfill religious obligations. The priests were given special dispensation to produce the required coins, provided they continued the motifs of the Tyrian shekel, so as not to raise objections in the Roman Empire. However, the obverse of the Tyrian coin bore the image of Melkhart, the god of the Phoenicians also known to the Greeks as Hercules. The reverse featured an eagle on the prow of a ship with the legend: “Tyre, holy city and city of refuge,” and the date of its expedition. Despite the scriptural prohibition against such depictions, the priests had to accept the Roman demands and the Tyrian coin, unwilling to lose value in the tax.

The coins minted in Jerusalem between 18 BC and 65 AD were virtually identical to their Tyrian predecessors, with one addition: the letters KP appearing on the reverse in the upper right corner, perhaps an acrostic meaning “By the Authority of Rome.”

The weight of this shekel or “shekel” was very constant and reliable: it weighed about four whole silver drachmas, that is, about the same as a tetradrachm, or half an ounce. However, the half-ounce that was later used as a measure of precision in pharmacopoeias and was formerly called the “Attic half-ounce” (about 13.7 g).

This coin was fixed as a weight at a very early time. It is already mentioned in the scriptures ([Ex 30:13](/en/Bible/Exodus/30#v13) and [Ez 45:12](/en/Bible/Ezekiel/45#v12)) and both establish that it is worth 20 obols, but in reality it refers to 20 _gerah_, that is, 20 grains of _hharvb_ or _carob_ (a word that comes from the Arabic _alharob_ and in Latin it was _siliqua_).

This shekel was called the “sacred shekel” due to its use as the exclusive currency to make payments at the temple. The book of Leviticus is full of references to it specifying the different prices of the obligatory Hebrew offerings ([Lv 5:15](/en/Bible/Leviticus/5#v15)). The fine for an ox owner who kills another's servant was stipulated at 30 shekels of silver. Shekels were also used to redeem fines for trespass and damage to sacred objects. The redemption of a personal vow was assessed at 50 shekels for men and 30 for women, with the price being lower for young people under 20. A redemption fee was also payable for fields. As Leviticus indicates, “every assessment was to be weighed in sanctuary shekels” ([Lev 27:3-25](/en/Bible/Leviticus/27#v3)).

<br style="clear:both;"/>

The priests frequently abused this coin. Because it was not a commonly used currency, it had to be acquired through money changers, who charged a commission for the exchange. The Talmud tells us that if a person went to the temple to pay their half-shekel tribute with a full shekel, the priests would keep the entire shekel, demand an additional 2 _kalbonot_, and return a half-shekel to the taxpayer. The justification for paying the _kalbonot_ was apparently that the priests would later have to exchange these coins with the money changers, who would then charge them for the exchange. Furthermore, by returning a half-shekel to the payer, they were making it easier for them to pay for the following year. Eventually, the average Jew might pay as much as one-fifth of a shekel in currency exchange. (See [UB 157:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p1_1), [UB 173:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/173#p1_3)).

## The Cost of Living

Some basic commodity prices were as follows:

- One modius (the typical Roman unit of measure, equal to 6.67 kg) of wheat: up to AD 14, 16 asses in Rome, 8 asses in the rest of Italy, 5-6 asses in Palestine, 5-8 in Africa, 4-8 in Asis Minor, and 4 asses in Egypt; from AD 14 onward these prices rose, doubling by the end of the century. One modius of wheat would make 16-20 loaves of bread.
- A loaf of bread: 2 ases (a dupondius) in Rome. Elsewhere, this price would have to be reduced as before. For example, in Palestine it would be from one to half an ase.
- A sextarius of wine (approx. half a liter): 1 to 5 ases.
- A sextarius of good wine: up to 30 ases.
- A bath in a public baths: a quarter of an ase.
- A tunic: 15 serterces.
- A donkey: 500 sesterces.
- A slave: 500 denarii.
- A slave woman: 2,000 to 6,000 denarii.

## Salary

Some of the typical salaries of that time were:

- Secretary: 15 denarii/month.
- Teacher: 12 denarii/month.
- Messenger: 9 denarii/month.
- Soothsayer: 10 denarii/month.
- Common legionary: 10 asses per day (225 denarii/year). One denarius every day and a half, or two denarii every three days (equivalent to a current salary of 300 euros per month).
- Praetorian Guard: 375 denarii/year.
- Centurion: 3,750 - 15,000 denarii/year.
- A peasant, as we are told in [Mt 20:1-16](/en/Bible/Matthew/20#v1), used to receive one denarius a day for working in the fields in Jesus' time. But of course, a worker wasn't lucky enough to be hired every day. We all know that in the countryside there are times of hard work and times of little or no work, as can be clearly seen in the parable. Thus, a peasant's monthly wage might amount to no more than a few denarii after sowing, and would only rise to twenty denarii at harvest time.
A fisherman on the Sea of ​​Galilee, like many artisans, could expect to earn a denarius every two days, or 8 ases a day (equivalent to a current monthly salary of 240 euros).
