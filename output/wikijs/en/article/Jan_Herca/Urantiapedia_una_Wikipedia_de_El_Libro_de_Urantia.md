I am pleased to inform you that the web [https://urantiapedia.site](https://urantiapedia.site/) [^1] is finally accessible to the public, and I encourage you to visit it.

This project came to me as an idea a year ago and it is, of course, a long way from being finished. But it does contain a good handful of content, enough to show what is intended with it and attract the attention of more contributors.

The goal that I set for myself at the beginning was to create a website that would allow us to study _The Urantia Book_ in a much more coordinated way, where references to other books, to the sources of _The Urantia Book_, to other general content, would be all linked together and it will not be necessary to go to a multitude of websites or books to have everything at hand.


My first intention was to create an edition of the book that had footnotes, but I soon realized that creating new editions in print or digital is to fall into a cyclical error over and over again. _The Urantia Book_ is so dense, so complex and varied, that it requires a living and dynamic mechanism that allows the entire corpus of knowledge that is being created around it to expand over time. The solution soon popped into my head: a wiki.

There is no doubt that wikis are in fashion, and it is not uncommon to see how different groups of fans or communities create their own in a collaborative way to grow their website with everything interesting related to their topic of discussion. I believe this is something the Urantia community has not enjoyed for a long time and it will certainly enrich the understanding of the Book.

Above all, I say this because the current Urantiapedia, as it is assembled, is focused on the Spanish language, which unfortunately is a language that is completely left aside when websites and content related to the Book are created. There is a huge multitude of websites with invaluable resources for the study of the Book, but all of it is in English. For many Spanish-speaking people, English is not something accessible, and for the rest of us who defend ourselves with English, it still represents a burden.

For that reason I wanted to give this wiki a first approach to the Spanish language, although of course, since it is a wiki, it will admit in the future the inclusion of content in other languages if the idea succeeds and other non-Hispanic readers want join her.

The process to join the project is very simple and is described on the website itself. In the coming weeks and months the project will not stop growing since the semi-automatic processes that expand content are already developed and using this software I am generating more and more pages every day. In any case, there are many things to be able to contribute, this website is open to all, and any idea is welcome.

I hope you find it interesting and let me know your opinions. Please, share this news in any other mail group or platform where you think it could have more diffusion.

An affectionate hug

Jan Herka
