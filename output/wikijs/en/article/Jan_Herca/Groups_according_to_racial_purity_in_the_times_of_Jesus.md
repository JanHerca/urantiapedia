If there ever was a people most characteristic of the racial purity of their unions and their separation from the rest of the peoples of the world, it was the Jewish people of the time of Jesus. The different social groups were often marked by this fundamental Jewish idea of preserving the purity of the people. The priests, as holy heads of the people, scrupulously watched over the legitimacy of the priestly families and separated from their midst all descendants of priests who had been born of an illegitimate union. But they were not the only ones: in the theory and practice of religious legislation in the time of Jesus, the entire community was also divided according to its purity of origin. Only those who could be assured of a legitimate origin were considered true Israelites. The reason for all this lies in the belief held by the Jews of that time that they were the “chosen people of God.” They, the legitimate Israelites, were the authentic children of God, chosen by Him, and upon whom His promises would be poured out at the end of time.

Below we will look at these groups in order of Jewish purity from greatest to least.

## The Israelites of Pure Origin

Along with the clergy (priests and Levites), the Israelites of pure origin constituted the authentic Israel.

To enjoy some very important civic rights, one had to prove one's legitimate origin. Every legitimate Israelite knew his closest ancestors and could indicate which of the twelve primitive tribes he belonged to. Even if an Israelite wanted to hold public office, he was obliged to submit to a test of legitimacy, giving an account of its last five generations.

In Jesus' time, the most common tribe to which one belonged was that of Judah, and through it, to the family of David. This fact is easily explained because at that time, the family of David conferred distinction due to the messianic hope. Marrying or becoming related in some way to this large family of David was a great honor.

Another family or tribe to which one belonged most was that of Benjamin. (This was the case with Paul the apostle and his teacher Gamaliel.) There were many people related to this tribe.

Thus, any pure Israelite worth his salt, whether poor or rich, had a written record of his ancestors back to at least the fifth generation. And these genealogies in Jesus' time were something that was preserved and guarded in families with great value.

The main privilege conferred by the designation of legitimate Israelite was that only they could marry their daughters to priests. Only Israelite mothers of pure origin could give birth to sons worthy of performing altar service in Jerusalem, which was the highest position to which one could aspire. But this right was not the only one. All dignities, all positions of trust, and all important public posts were reserved for full Israelites. Proof of purity of origin was required for membership in the supreme courts, the Sanhedrin, and one of the 23-member tribunals, which had the right to pronounce capital sentences. This even extended to the court clerks and bailiffs, as well as community officials (especially the seven-member local council) and the trusted men charged by the community with the care of alms. In all these cases, genealogy was examined before granting a position.

There were even places in Palestine where the procedure was particularly exclusive and where the privileges of legitimate Israelites were even more widespread. Even in Sepphoris, where there was a Jewish garrison, proof of ancestry was required to join the troops.

However, of all the aforementioned civic rights enjoyed by legitimate citizens, we have not yet mentioned the most important: the religious right. Thanks to pure origin, one could, firstly, be assured of participating in messianic salvation, and secondly, of sharing in the merits of one's ancestors, which were transmitted to one's children and served as a substitute. This second participation was carried out in two ways: a) according to common doctrine, all Israel shared in the merits of the patriarchs, especially Abraham. These merits were to welcome prayers, protect in danger, assist in war, supply the merits lacking in each individual, atone for faults, appease God's wrath, suspend his punishments, deliver from _Gehenna_, and grant participation in God's eternal kingdom; b) but, in addition, each Israelite shared in the merits and intercession of their own ancestors if there were righteous people among them, and conversely, the choice of a wife who was not of the same condition of purity would have been avenged on their children.


## Despised professions

Family origin was not the only thing that marked the men and women of that time. There were also a series of professions that were considered despicable and socially degraded, more or less inexorably, those who practiced them. Let's go into detail about these professions and the reason why they were despised:

- professions related to transportation: donkey drivers, camel drivers, sailors, and coachmen. These people were suspected of being thieves, since they transported merchandise and could be tempted to steal something from it.
- shepherds: they did not enjoy a good reputation. As experience showed, they were often cheats and thieves, driving the flocks to other people's properties and also stealing some of the flock's produce. Therefore, it was forbidden to buy wool, milk, or goats from them, and to do so only directly from the livestock owners.
- Shopkeepers: suspected of exploiting their customers.
- Doctors: it was often said, “The best of doctors is good for hell.” They are mentioned as thieves because they were suspected of favoring the rich and neglecting the poor, who paid poorly.
- Butchers: suspected of dishonesty because they were exposed to the temptation of selling _tarepah_ meat, or meat from animals with fatal physical defects.
- Garbage collector, tanner, and copper smelter: three of the most despised trades. If a man worked in one of these three trades, his wife had the right to demand a divorce from the court and payment of the marriage contract.
- Weavers or tailors: suspected of immorality since their trade was considered women's work.
- professions that were based on fraud and were proscribed: dice players, usurers, gambling organizers, Sabbath-year commodity dealers, tax collectors, publicans (or tax collectors at customs), and money changers. Pharisees who accepted a publican's position were forced to leave the Pharisee community.

Those who held these offices could not hold high positions in public office. In many cases, their testimony was not accepted in court. In short, they were deprived of the civic and political rights that every Israelite could enjoy. This fact shows how striking it was at that time that Jesus called a tax collector to be his close disciple and that he announced the good news to tax collectors and sinners under the symbol of a communal banquet.

Also within this group of despised people we can include those whom the Orthodox Jews called _am-ha-arez_. Although the word meant “the people of the land,” over time, the term _am-ha-arez_ had acquired a pejorative tone, constantly fueled by the hatred and intrigues of the rabbis and priestly castes. Hillel asserted that the _am-ha-arez_ had no conscience and did not attain the status of men.

Orthodox Jews ended up giving this term to all human groups who, according to them, had usurped the land of Israel, especially since the Babylonian exile. During this deportation, many of the lands of Palestine were occupied by peoples of pagan and impure origin: Samaritans, Philistines, Arameans, and others. Upon their return, the Jews did not forgive them for this usurpation, and the hatred and contempt toward the _am-ha-arez_ reached the point where they were defined in the Talmud as those “who do not eat their bread in a state of ritual purity.”

In this state of affairs, one can better understand why Jesus preached to these poor people, deprived of all education, and why they listened to him with pleasure. Their position often reached the level of a poor slave. These men, the elderly, adults, and even children, were treated mercilessly. During work, it was permissible to whip them, beat them, and insult them with all kinds of insults and abuse, as long as it got them to work hard.

## Jewish slaves

The so-called “Jewish slaves” were not so Jewish. They were people who worked as day laborers for a maximum of six years and then abandoned their service, unlike pagan slaves, whose servitude was perpetual. Hence the difference in price: a Jewish slave cost about 5 minas, while a pagan slave cost 100 minas.

The number of Jewish slaves in Palestine was not large, and their legal status was regulated by law. A Jew could become a slave in three ways:

- If a thief could not make restitution for the stolen goods. According to the law, they were sold by order of the court. The sale could only be made to Jewish men. Herod the Great imposed that they could also be sold to foreigners. Women were not eligible for this option, so a female thief found herself in a more precarious situation: either someone would make restitution for her, or she would be subject to physical punishment.
- A Jew could also sell himself into slavery. This usually occurred in cases of extreme poverty. It could only be done with men, not women. Selling to non-Jews was possible, but this imposed the obligation of ransom on relatives. Most often, it was a desperate gesture by an indebted man who had lost all hope (like the prodigal son in Jesus' parable). Israelite women were prohibited, which placed poor women, especially widows, in a dead end.
- Girls under the age of twelve could be sold to a man. Normally, this meant that the girl became the wife of the Jew, but other times there was no marriage, and everything consisted of a contract of sale between the girl's father and the buyer. The poor girl, most often, was then exploited as a worker in her master's house.

The state of slavery with a Jewish owner lasted six years and could not last longer, unless the slave renounced his liberation and transformed it into perpetual service, in which case it ended with the death of the master. This occurred especially when the Jewish slave had children by a non-Israeli slave woman belonging to his owner and did not want to part with her or her children. The term could also end early if the ransom for their release was paid.

Regarding the legal status of the Jewish slave, it must be said that slave service was not considered dishonorable, and the owner was to spare the Jewish slave dishonorable slave labor. The Jewish slave, legally equal to the eldest son of the family, was entitled to the same treatment: good food, good clothing, and a good bed. Unlike the pagan slave, he could acquire property through discovery or gift and pay to shorten his time of service. His owner could not consecrate him through an interdict; if he was married, the owner was obligated to support his wife and children. In short, the legal status of the Jewish slave was regulated according to the prescription of the law: “He must be in your house as a day laborer.” He was like a laborer who rented his labor capacity to a specific owner for six years, paid with a predetermined wage in the form of the price at which he was purchased.

Only on one point was the male Jewish slave deprived of his rights, where the law prescribes: “If it was his master who gave the slave a wife, by whom he has had sons and daughters, then the wife and children belong to the master; the slave shall go alone.” Since an adult Jewish woman could not be the slave of a Jew, the passage was interpreted in this sense: the master had the right to give a pagan slave as a wife to the Jewish slave, even against her will; upon the slave's liberation, she and her children remained in the master's possession.

However, the harsh reality was often harsher than rabbinic legislation. Jewish slaves formed the lowest link in the Jewish social chain. In Varro's words, “the slave was a kind of tool that could talk.” Although they enjoyed a reputation for being lazy, dissolute, and thieving, the truth is that the treatment and working conditions in which they lived were not the ideal framework for claiming otherwise. Perhaps the general feeling of high-ranking Jews toward slaves can be summed up in the words of Jesus of Sirach: “Forage, stick, and load are for the donkey; bread, correction, and labor are for the servant. Make your servant work, and you will have rest; give him a free hand, and he will seek freedom. As the yoke and bonds bend the neck, so the evil servant suffers flogging and torture. Make him work, and do not leave him idle.” Although the legislation protecting slaves closed the door to arbitrary actions on the part of their owners, the sad reality was always the same, whether they were referred to by euphemisms such as servant or bondman.

## Illegitimate Israelites Marked with a Light Blemish

In this section we will examine three population groups, among which the proselytes stand out by far for their number. The members of these groups had in common that their union with Levites and Israelites of pure origin was recognized as legitimate. However, they could not marry into priestly families, a privilege exclusive to Levites and full-fledged Israelites. Their social position was clearly lowered; the exclusion from marriage with priestly families was not only a social deprivation, but also, ultimately, a religious one. Furthermore, these population groups were deprived of important civic rights: they had no place in certain assemblies and courts, and were prohibited from holding office.

### a) Illegitimate Descendants of Priests

Among the Israelites marked with a light stain were, first and foremost, the “profane” (_halal_, _halalah_), that is, the illegitimate children of priests. These were children born from the marriage of a priest with a woman who was not of the same purity or whom he could not marry for other reasons.

An illegitimate son of a priest, like his descendants, could not exercise the priesthood; Furthermore, he could not marry the daughter of a priest. If an illegitimate son of a priest had a half-brother of legitimate origin, he could not, should the latter die childless, enter into a levirate marriage with his brother's widow, since, given her illegal origin, she was not in a position to retain the name of a legitimate priest through a son. The illegitimate daughter of a priest could not marry a legitimate priest, not even in a levirate marriage. Furthermore, the widow of a halal, even if she were of legitimate origin, could not, according to the current priestly law, marry a priest; by marrying a halal, she had herself become illegitimate, since her own legitimate origin made no difference. And these prescriptions were strictly followed, even by the most liberal factions such as the Pharisees. However, the scribes did not approve of such prescriptions being put into practice even in cases of mere suspicion, rather than complete certainty. The so-called _'îssah_ families were priestly families in which some members were suspected of their strict purity. There was a lively controversy over these families in Jesus' time: the Hillelite-leaning scribes were willing to accept them, while the intransigent priests rejected them outright, and at the slightest suspicion, they did not marry the daughters of these families. However, the number of this group was very small.

### b) Proselytes

The proselytes were also part of the group of Israelites marked with a light blemish; they were much more numerous than the halalim. They were full proselytes, “proselytes of righteousness,” that is, pagans converted to Judaism who submitted to circumcision, baptism, and sacrifice. They must be clearly distinguished from the “God-fearers,” who only accepted the profession of monotheistic faith and the observance of part of the ceremonial laws, without fully converting to Judaism. Legally, they were considered pagans.

Long before the time of Jesus, during the Maccabees, conversion to Judaism had been imposed by force. As we approach the time of Jesus, a wave of opposition to Judaism spread throughout the Roman Empire, and conversions became increasingly rare. These conversions, however, were not uncommon during Jesus's lifetime, and were formalized as such in a ritual baptism at the Pool of Siloam in Jerusalem.

Most of the proselytes came from regions bordering the territory inhabited by the Jews. Some were from Idumea, others from Batanea, Auranitis, and Trachonitis. There was debate in Jewish circles about whether it was valid to admit people from Moab and Ammon as proselytes. People from Egypt and Edom could be. Many of them were from Syria (from Antioch, Palmyra, and other places). They were also from the kingdom of Adiabene, Media, and many other places.

Regarding their legal status, a proselyte did not enjoy the same rights as a full-fledged Israelite. On the other hand, they were subject to the full force of the law.

Regarding the status of the proselyte or pagan, the determining principle was: “A pagan has no father.” This legal principle reflects Rabbinic Judaism's extraordinarily pessimistic judgment on paganism, especially in its moral life: every pagan, even a wife, is suspected of having practiced prostitution; it is doubtful on principle that a pagan can know his true father.

Based on this legal basis, the legislation concerning proselytes primarily affected matrimonial rights: proselytes were not eligible to marry priests, although they could marry among themselves or with other groups of the population (Levites, Israelites of pure origin or with some taint of origin). They were also affected by the right of succession: the proselyte was allowed to appropriate, in the inheritance from his pagan father, only those objects, such as money and harvested products, that were not related to idol worship; another similar issue was that the children and wives of proselytes had no right to inheritance from their father and husband, even if they had converted with him. Regarding official positions, the proselyte was prohibited from being a member of the Sanhedrin and the 23-member tribunal, nor of other tribunals (such as the one that ruled on a refusal of marriage for dissocks or _halîsah_), although it was allowed in cases of disputes over property. The religious rights and privileges of the chosen people were not shared by the Israelites with proselytes. Instead, they did have to comply with the obligatory social assistance that every good Jew was obliged to provide to the needy.

It is worth remembering here that the Herodian royalty of Jesus' time was all Idumean, and therefore proselytes. King Herod and his later sons, according to Jewish law [Deuteronomy 17:15](/en/Bible/Deuteronomy/17#v15) (“You shall appoint one of your brothers as king; you may not appoint a foreigner”), could not be legitimate monarchs. This always provoked opposition among the Jewish people toward these rulers, and consequently, toward the Romans who had forced them to endure them.

### c) Emancipated pagan slaves or freedmen

Slaves obtained their freedom according to norms derived from Roman law. The freedmen constituted the third population group that formed part of the Israelites marked with a light stain. These were pagans by birth who, having become slaves in the service of a Jew, had submitted, upon becoming the property of the Jewish master, to circumcision and a baptism of conversion, and were later freed.

Emancipation could be obtained in the following ways: a) by the freedman's free will; b) by redemption through other persons; c) by forced emancipation, or by a court decision, when the owner, in the presence of witnesses, mutilated some part of the body, or by the emancipated person paying half its value; d) by the death of the owner; e) by a baptism of conversion to become free. However, a slave's true chances of becoming free were slim.

A freedman who had taken the baptism of conversion was from that moment on legally equal to other full proselytes. However, the practical reality was different, as ancient slavery carried a heavy moral weight. For example, every emancipated slave was considered like a prostitute because there was no doubt about her potential sexual commerce as a slave.

The number of freedmen was not high, and in Jesus' time, there was even debate about whether it was appropriate to allow emancipation. As for marriages, it was not uncommon for Israelite women to marry these freedmen, since they were only considered Israelites with a slight blemish. But the reality was that they were the last social stratum considered Jewish, and therefore greatly despised.

## Illegitimate Israelites marked with a serious blemish

Israelites marked with a light blemish were not permitted to marry those belonging to priestly and ruling families, but those with a serious blemish, as we shall see, were not permitted to marry with any social stratum, not even the previous ones. They were considered the dregs of the community and so despised that their only way of life was to isolate themselves in closed communities and not mix with the rest of the people.

### a) Bastards

These are the _mamzer_ (pl. _mamzerîm_). In general terms, they were all those born from a union prohibited in the Torah, mainly incest and adultery. But some rabbis had extended the idea to other cases, such as the son of a union with a _halûsah_ (or a childless widow whose brother-in-law did not agree to the levirate marriage), or with her relatives, or with a divorced woman who did not have a valid divorce paper. However, these latter cases were not unanimously accepted, and a more limited view was usually adopted, including incest and adultery.

The population group that constituted these _mamzer_, including their descendants, was significant. People marked with the grave stain were well known, although, naturally, they tried to hide their stain.

As for their legal status, they were not admitted into the Jewish community, nor were their descendants up to the tenth generation, that is, almost without limitation. This prevented the _mamzer_ from marrying, even levirate, with the families of priests, Levites, Israelites, and illegitimate sons of priests; bastards could marry only families of proselytes, emancipated slaves, and seriously blemished Israelites. If the daughter of a priest, a Levite, or a legitimate Israelite joined a bastard, she was from then on incapable of marrying a priest. Any child of any such union was considered a bastard; The same happened with every descendant of a bastard.

Bastards had no access to public offices; their participation in a court invalidated the decision. They were only allowed to participate in three-member courts for civil cases.

It must be remembered that the stain of bastardhood marked all male descendants forever, and there was an indelible debate about whether families of bastards would participate in the final liberation of Israel. Thus, it is understandable that the word “bastard” constituted one of the worst insults, and whoever misused it was punished with 39 lashes.

### b) Temple slaves, children of unknown fathers, foundlings, eunuchs

The temple slaves, _natînîm_, were also part of the group of Israelites marked with a grave stain by their origin. This was because, according to the Scriptures, these temple servants were Gibeonites by origin, and therefore not Jews. Sexual relations with them were prohibited.

Those without fathers and foundlings were suspected of being bastards and treated as such, and the same segregation as everyone else fell upon them.

Eunuchs were also not accepted into the community of Israel. They could not hold public office nor enter into marriages outside their rank. They were a numerous group, especially in the king's court and his harem.

## Pagan Slaves

This social group found itself in a special intermediate situation: it had very close relations with the Jewish community, but was nonetheless not counted within it. Its position with respect to Hebrew law was much worse than that of the Jewish slaves.

It is false that slavery was not in use in Jesus' time. Certainly, in Palestine at that time, the existence of industries employing large numbers of slaves was not attested; nor were there hardly any large estates cultivated by slaves on a large scale. But we certainly find domestic slaves of pagan origin in a large number of notable households in Jerusalem. We must recall here first the Herodian court and then the houses of the priestly nobility, where there were equally numerous slaves.

Slaves of both sexes were either purchased or born in the house. It is possible that the slave traders who brought their “merchandise” to the Jerusalem slave market came primarily from Phoenicia. Many of these slaves came from Arabia, as the number of Arab prisoners of war captured by the Jews during Herod's wars was high.

The price of slaves varied greatly according to age, sex, and physical and mental qualities or defects. Circumstances also had an influence: periods of war increased supply and lowered prices; in times of peace, they rose. During the Roman period, under Augustus, prices had risen considerably. These could range from 500 drachmas (5 minas) to more than 100,000 sesterces (more than 150 minas). In the first century BC, the average price was about 20 minas, and in the first century AD, 30 minas. In Palestine, prices also varied widely: during the Maccabean Wars, the price was negligible, then rose sharply, to 100 minas, which, compared to the current price outside Palestine, represented a relatively low price for slaves. This is undoubtedly due to the fact that in Palestine, luxury slaves, men (eunuchs, educated people) and women (zitherists, hetaerae), for whom the highest prices were paid, did not play a major role. The price of 20 minas will give an idea of their importance if we compare it with the average wage of a day laborer at that time, which was one denarius. The price of 20 minas (2,000 denarii) therefore corresponded to 2,000 times the daily wage of a laborer. A slave, male or female, therefore represented a very considerable value, although the pagan slave, unlike the Jewish laborer, could then be forced to work perpetually without any remuneration.

A description of the social situation of slaves must start from the fact that they were the complete property of their owner. The slave could not own any property; It is their owner who receives the fruit of their labor, and what they find, what they are given, what they receive in compensation for an injury or humiliation suffered—in short, everything that is theirs, even their children, belongs to its owner. Like any other owned object, it can be sold, given away, given as collateral, declared sacred, and constitute part of an inheritance. This situation, wherever slavery reigned, meant above all that male slaves were deprived of protection from mistreatment, punishment, and service, and that female slaves had to submit to the sexual whims of their owners. However, in Palestine, the fate of slaves was overall much more humane than in other parts of the ancient world, as the Jews had the humiliation of having served as slaves very much present in their historical memory.

Pagan slaves of both sexes who became the property of a Jew were required to undergo a ritual baptism to become slaves. If the slave was a woman, this baptism signified conversion to Judaism; Male slaves were required to undergo this conversion by also undergoing circumcision.

The pagan slaves were serfs, but circumcised; this explains the ambiguous and special situation in which they found themselves. By circumcision, they were “children of the covenant,” but like the freedmen, they were not members of the community of Israel.

As for the religious duties incumbent upon them, the slaves were required to obey only those precepts that had no relation to a specific time, since they were not masters of their own time. The slave, therefore, was freed from reciting the _Sema_, from carrying the phylacteries, from making pilgrimages during the Feasts of Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles, from living in the tents and waving the _Lulab_, and from blowing the horn at the New Year's Festival. On the contrary, he was obligated to pray at the table after the meal and to recite the “eighteen blessings” daily, as well as to affix the _mezuzah_ on the door.

The religious and civic rights that the slave obtained with his conversion to Judaism were limited. The advantages of Jewish religious laws affected the slave only to the extent that the rights of his owner were not infringed. First, he had the right to the Sabbath rest, like all Israelites; he had the right to participate in the Passover festival, including the Paschal banquet. Finally, his owner did not have the right to sell him to a pagan. This was roughly the extent of the rights that a slave obtained with his conversion. Otherwise, he had no rights. First, from a religious point of view, he could not, for example, lay his hands on the head of the victim in the temple or shake his portions; in the synagogue, he could not be counted toward the number of ten, nor could he read or make the blessing at the meal. He had no right to testify as a witness. Finally, he was deprived of all matrimonial rights. A slave, male or female, was incapable of contracting a valid marriage with any kind of Israelite, even one marked with a very serious stain; the child born from the union of an Israelite with a slave woman was (like the mother) a slave and belonged to the slave's owner. Regarding matrimonial law, therefore, slaves of both sexes, despite their conversion to Judaism, were still considered pagans.

Quite simply, pagan slaves were not Jews and had no essential Jewish rights, although they had to behave as if they were.

It is necessary to bear in mind this social situation, which made the word “slave” one of the worst insults punishable by anathema, in order to understand the indignation that Jesus provoked in some of his listeners when he called them “slaves of tradition.”
