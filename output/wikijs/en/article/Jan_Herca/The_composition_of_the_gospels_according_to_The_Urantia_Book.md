## The Sources of the Fourth Part of The Urantia Book

The writer of the fourth part of _The Urantia Book_ was a single being, a secondary midwayer who had in his custody the apostle Andrew ([LU 121:0](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p0_1)), who, assisted by a commission of eleven other midwayers and a Melchizedek, committed this part to writing.

The midwayer relied on the following sources for writing it:

- His own recollections of assisting the Apostle Andrew, and the recollections of other celestial beings (<a id="a34_105"></a>[LU 121:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_1)).
- The lost writings of Andrew (<a id="a35_35"></a>[LU 121:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_1)). Curiously, I have found that there must have indeed existed a gospel of Andrew, which is mentioned in [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Andrew), and of which absolutely nothing has come down to us.
- Human concepts or expressions of two thousand human authors, who have lived from the time of Jesus until the time when the fourth part of _The Urantia Book_ is written. It appears that some of these authors were even alive at the time of this writing ([LU 121:8.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_13)). These concepts and ideas, he claims, have been used in such a way that they have been modified, if necessary, to make the concept more truthful.
- The four extant gospels (<a id="a37_39"></a>[LU 121:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_1)).

## Facts from _The Urantia Book_ about the composition of the gospels

Regarding the process of gospel formation, _The Urantia Book_ describes a series of writings that appeared under the influence of one another and by different authors. The list is as follows:

- The _original Gospel of Mark_ (<a id="a43_34"></a>[LU 121:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_3)): This was written by John Mark, who was Peter's collaborator in Rome and was the son of Elijah Mark, the owner of the house where Jesus celebrated the Last Supper. In reality, this gospel was sponsored by Peter. Mark wrote it between 67 and 68. When he finished it, the last fifth was destroyed. This gospel, without this last part, is what we could call the _original Gospel of Mark_. _The Urantia Book_ says that Mark based his work entirely on his personal memories and those of Peter. It was not based on any other previous writing.
- _Gospels based on Mark_ (<a id="a44_40"></a>[LU 121:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_3)): these were modifications of the original Mark, mainly removing passages and adding material to the blank final section. It is curious that for quite some time there has been talk of a [_Secret Gospel of Mark_](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelio_secreto_de_Marcos), discovered in 1958 in a supposed letter by Clement of Alexandria. In my opinion, this letter is speaking of copies of some of these gospels based on the original Mark. The famous inconsistent verse in Mark ([Mk 10:46](/en/Bible/Mark/10#v46)) may be the point where, as _The Urantia Book_ says, this gospel broke down with the loss of its ending.
- _Current Gospel of Mark_: This is one of the gospels based on the _Original Gospel of Mark_ that finally got the Church's approval and was accepted as the correct one.
- _Matthew’s Original Notes_ (<a id="a46_31"></a>[LU 121:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_5)): Matthew took notes of many of Jesus’ sayings during Jesus’ lifetime (<a id="a46_144"></a>[LU 139:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p7_5)), and also shortly after Jesus’ death (<a id="a46_230"></a>[LU 121:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_5)). They were written in Aramaic. In my opinion, they served as a basis for other writings, but they have never been preserved on their own.
- _Gospel of Matthew in Aramaic_ (<a id="a47_34"></a>[LU 121:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_6)): This is a gospel written in the year 40 (_The Urantia Book_ does not say who the author was) and which was an expansion and correction of the _original Notes of Matthew_. It was apparently a personal document that someone owned or distributed very little, and the last copy was destroyed in a fire in a Syrian monastery in the year 416. In my opinion, this is the gospel that scholars call the [_Gospel of the Hebrews_](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelio_de_los_hebreos), of which only quotations have survived.
- _Gospel of Matthew in Greek_ (<a id="a48_34"></a>[LU 121:8.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_7)): was written by a disciple of Matthew, named Isador, in the year 71, at Pella, on the Jordan. For this he used, according to _The Urantia Book_, only Matthew's recollections, Matthew's original notes, and the _original Gospel of Mark_. In my opinion, he also used the _Modified Notes of Andrew_.
- _Current Gospel of Matthew_: is the result of successive modifications of the _Gospel of Matthew in Greek_ until it was finally fixed as we know it today.
- _Record by Cedes_ (<a id="a50_23"></a>[LU 121:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_9)): Kedes was a believer in Antioch who wrote this text in 78 AD. _The Urantia Book_ does not mention its contents. I have found no record of such a writing anywhere.
- _Andrew's Notes_ (<a id="a51_21"></a>[LU 139:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_9)): Andrew wrote these just after Jesus was crucified. Copies of this document circulated for a time among Christian communities.
- _Andrew's Modified Notes_ (<a id="a52_33"></a>[LU 139:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_9)): These are the _Andrew's Notes_ that were progressively modified to try to make them appear gospel-like.
- _Andrew's Gospel_ (<a id="a53_25"></a>[LU 139:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_9)): This is the document that the _Andrew's Modified Notes_ eventually became, after various additions and corrections by different authors. The last copy was destroyed in a fire in Alexandria about a hundred years after Andrew wrote the original. In my opinion, this gospel is the one that scholars also call the [_Gospel of Andrew_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Andrew), of which only mentions have come down to us, and which is wrongly considered identical to the so-called _Acts of Andrew_, and it is also, in my opinion, the one called by scholars the [_Q Document_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_document), so called because it is considered the original source of Matthew and Luke, and of which no copy has come down to us,and it has only been regenerated by analyzing the current gospels.
- _Gospel of Luke_ (<a id="a54_24"></a>[LU 121:8.8-9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_8)): Written by Luke, a disciple of Paul, from Antioch in Pisidia. He wrote it in 82 AD in Achaia. He based his work on the teachings of Paul, dozens of witnesses to the life of Jesus, the _original Gospel of Mark_, the _Gospel of Matthew in Greek_, the _Article of Cedes_, and the _Modified Notes of Andrew_.
- _Current Gospel of Luke_: This is the result of some modifications made to the Gospel of Luke.
- _Acts of the Apostles_ (<a id="a54_24"></a>[LU 121:8.8-9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_8)): This is the second part of his gospel that Luke wrote. His intention was to write a third part, I suppose recounting the adventures of Paul and Peter in Rome, but Luke died before finishing Acts.
- _Selta’s Apocalyptic Writing_ (<a id="a57_35"></a>[LU 176:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_8)): Selta was a clerk in Caligula’s court who wrote this article on the Messiah and the parable of the ten virgins. In the second century, the gospels of Matthew especially ([Mt 24-25](/en/Bible/Matthew/24)), and some of Mark ([Mk 13](/en/Bible/Mark/13)) and Luke ([Lk 21](/en/Bible/Luke/21)), were expanded to include a modified version of this writing of Selta as if it were an end-time discourse given by Jesus. This was apparently the greatest alteration that these gospels ever underwent in a spurious manner, and it grossly distorted the Master's authentic teachings on this subject.
- _First Epistle of Peter_ (<a id="a58_31"></a>[LU 139:2.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p2_12)). It was written by Peter himself, although the present version is a modification of the original by a disciple of Paul.
- _Original Gospel of John_ (<a id="a59_32"></a>[LU 121:8.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_10) and <a id="a59_80"></a>[LU 139:4.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p4_15)): was written by Nathan of Caesarea, a disciple of John, in 101 AD, in Ephesus of Asia (John was extraordinarily long-lived). Nathan based his work on John’s recollections and all other existing documents. In my opinion, the originality of the content of this gospel, which shows details that the other three current gospels do not,It is proof that there were other gospels and writings that also contained much valuable information.
- _Current Gospel of John_ ([LU 121:8.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_10)): The original gospel was greatly altered over time to make it appear as if it had been written by John himself. The striking Prologue, for example, was most likely a later addition.
- _Original Revelation of John_ (<a id="a61_34"></a>[LU 139:4.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p4_14)): This was written by John during an exile on Patmos. The original was much longer than the present book.
- _Current Revelation of John_: This is a version of the original, with large portions omitted and others modified.
- _First Epistle of John_ (<a id="a63_30"></a>[LU 121:8.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_10)): According to _The Urantia Book_, this was written by John himself to explain the work Nathan had done. However, there is no indication of this in this letter, such as a mention of Nathan or his gospel.
- _Notes of Thomas_ (<a id="a64_20"></a>[LU 139:8.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p8_12)): A few weeks before his death, Thomas began writing a gospel. It is not clear to me whether this document is the current [_Gospel of Thomas_](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelio_de_Tomás) of the scholars. In my opinion, this text uses the early writing of Thomas, but then adds many supposed Gnostic-type sayings of Jesus that were not part of Thomas's original writing. The final document is very Gnostic in its flavor, with cryptic, double-entendre statements.

There are many other books called “apocrypha” in Christian literature, as we will see later, but a quick glance at them shows that they are no longer documents related to the life of Jesus, but rather legends about Jesus (especially about his birth), parallel or derived stories from the gospels, or pseudo-mystical speculations. There is nothing of value left in these writings, since the original sources are exhausted with the previous ones.

## The Two-Source Theory

In my opinion, the two-source theory is correct ([Wikipedia in Spanish](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoría_de_las_dos_fuentes) and [Wikipedia in English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-source_hypothesis)), and _The Urantia Book_ conforms to it. Basically, what this theory says is that both Matthew and Luke used a double source to write their gospels, one that is known to us, the _Gospel of Mark_, and another completely enigmatic one, of which we have no news whatsoever, and which experts have baptized as the _Q documen_t. This would explain the coincidences between Matthew and Luke that are not reported in Mark.

But first, we should say that in _The Urantia Book_ we are missing a mention that says that Isador wrote the _Gospel of Matthew in Greek_, also using _Andrew's Modified Notes_ as a source, just as Luke did. This is logical if we consider that we are told that Isador moved from Jerusalem to Pella (<a id="a72_323"></a>[LU 121:8.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_7)). Isador must have known Andrew, who surely also lived in Jerusalem with Peter for a time. Therefore, Isador must have had access to Andrew's writings, the _Andrew's Notes_ or one of their modified versions.

Continuing with the two-source theory, what experts call the _Q document_ would be none other, according to _The Urantia Book_, than the lost writings of the apostle Andrew, the _Modified Andrew's Notes_ (which is precisely a document that is not lost in the celestial world and was used as an invaluable source to write the fourth part of _The Urantia Book_, according to [UB 121:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p0_1)).

The name that experts give to some works is indicated by an equal sign (=). In orange, the documents for which we have no text today; in orange stripes, we have some indication in Christian literature with some fragment; in green, the documents that we have complete. The lines mark the influence that some writings exerted on others. The dotted line is the only one not mentioned in _The Urantia Book_, and which I assume is also valid.

## Considerations on the composition process of the gospels

As we can see, the number of gospels that were written was very low. The reason given by _The Urantia Book_ is that the first generation of disciples (the apostles) very faithfully followed the idea that Jesus had instilled in them of not recording his teachings in writing ([LU 121:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_3)).

The second generation of disciples was something else. It is curious to note that all the evangelists were actually second-generation writers: Mark was actually a follower of Peter, although he knew something about Jesus; Isador was a disciple of Matthew and the authentic writer of the Gospel of Matthew; Luke was a follower of Paul, who, moreover, did not know Jesus; and finally Nathan, the writer of the fourth Gospel, was a disciple of John Zebedee.

There could have been six gospels. It is clear that we are missing the _Gospel of Andrew_, which is nothing more and nothing less than an expanded version of what experts today call the _Q document_, and which surely contained many unpublished passages from the life of Jesus that no other gospel mentioned, and which now, fortunately, _The Urantia Book_ rescues for us ([LU 121:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p0_1)). And we are also missing the _Gospel of Thomas_, but not because it had the misfortune of being destroyed, but simply because Thomas died before he could finish it. The only thing that has come down to us from it are some sayings, surely many of which were certainly written by Thomas, which is what experts today call the _Gospel of Thomas_.

Of the five gospels that we finally have, something remarkable is clearly evident: practically the story told follows a unique scheme or pattern. The only gospel that truly appears very original and outside this pattern is the _Gospel of John_. This offers us a deplorable panorama for trying to obtain a plural view of Jesus' life. What we really have in the five gospels is, at best, a dual view.

Basically, the accounts of Jesus' life were composed following these stages:

1. During his life or just after Jesus' death, we have some notes taken by Matthew and Andrew. They are basically phrases, sayings of Jesus, and some speeches.
2. Some disciples augmented these writings by adding short stories related to Jesus. These are the gospels that have not survived to this day, such as the _Q document_ (in reality, the _Q document_ was the proto-gospel of Andrew, which I call the _Modified Notes of Andrew_) or the _Gospel of the Hebrews_, which I call the _Aramaic Gospel of Matthew_. These writings circulated in a very limited way and surely contained many inaccuracies because they were never under the patronage of an important apostle, hence their designation as “of the Hebrews” and similar titles (Nazarenes, Ebionites). Later, these writings were considered incorrect and marginalized until they disappeared. It is striking that the _Gospel of Andrew_, the authentic _Q document_ I believe, and which had so much subsequent influence, ended up as a mere mention and no one bothered to preserve more copies, to the point of disappearing. Mustn't its content have been extremely original and important?
3. The gospels begin to be written. The first to write it is Mark. He was the one who established the outline or model for all subsequent gospels (baptism-preaching-passion of Jesus in Jerusalem). It is curious that _The Urantia Book_ says that Mark based himself entirely on personal memories and those of Peter, when he had access to the notes of Andrew and Matthew, or the gospels that arose from these notes. This fact is something that exegetes have already observed in Mark. Mark seems to have a unique originality and to be the first gospel to be written, while Matthew and Luke seem to copy Mark and also from another source.
4. Matthew and Paul sponsor their gospels (Matthew and Luke). These writers write much more complete gospels, for they not only use Mark's model, but also incorporate more material. Much of this material comes from _Andrew's notes_ (_The Urantia Book_ doesn't say so, but I am convinced that Matthew used Andrew's notes as well). Unknowingly, when we read the gospels of Matthew and Luke, we are reading the lost gospel of Andrew. I believe this lost gospel is what scholars call the _Q document_, and it would explain the similarities between Matthew and Luke not found in Mark (the two-source theory). However, even though these evangelists added many new passages not in Mark and gave us greater insight into the life of Jesus, they ultimately follow Mark's outline very closely. For example, a striking fact about these three Gospels (called synoptic because of their close similarity) is that Jesus' entire preaching seems to take place over the course of just one year. Since there are few chronological references, it's unclear how long Jesus' public life lasted.
5. Thomas begins to write his gospel, and begins like Andrew and Matthew with some notes with sayings and phrases of Jesus. But he dies soon after, and his intention of writing another gospel came to nothing. Some disciples expanded and wrote down these notes of Thomas, and that is the _Gospel of Thomas_ that we have today. Experts have found that there are many unpublished phrases from Jesus in this writing that are not found in Mark, Matthew, or Luke, which shows that it was an original writing by Thomas, based only on his own memories. Unfortunately, we will never know what the gospel this apostle would have written would have been like. Would it have been based on the other three or would it have been an original story?
6. An unknown author expands _Andrew's notes_ and turns them into a gospel. He surely used a lot of material from the other three gospels, so that this gospel ultimately seems like a copy of the others, although with enormous originality derived from the fact that it used a source with much important content. That this gospel must have been important in its content for understanding Jesus is derived from the fact that a quarter of _The Urantia Book_ is largely based on this gospel, of which the heavenly beings have a copy. What a great shame that this gospel, unfortunately, was destroyed! How much more we would have learned about Jesus! The last existing copy was burned, according to _The Urantia Book_ ([LU 139:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_9)), about a hundred years after the original was written (AD 30). This unfortunate event appears to have occurred during the [Kitos War](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerra_de_Kitos), from 115 to 117, since this date indicates a Jewish revolt that spread to Alexandria, during which the Jews burned many Alexandrian buildings. Curiously, it was the Jews who ultimately destroyed this gospel.
7. Finally, John writes his Gospel, with the clear intention of narrating episodes from the life of Jesus that had not been told and of offering, in his opinion, a clearer and more accurate view of some of Jesus' words. The amount of detail John offers about the Last Supper has no equivalent in other Gospels. And there are many miracles that no one else recounted, such as the one at Cana. It is clear that the Synoptic Gospels represent an outline in the story of Jesus' life (which includes two sources, Mark and Andrew), but thanks to John we have a second, distinct and original view of Jesus.

## The Other Gospels That Experts Call Apocryphal

There are many other writings, apart from those already mentioned here, which are sometimes called Gospels, which belong to those writings that in Christianity were called apocryphal. However, it is very incorrect to call them Gospels. Most of them do not follow the real outline of a story about the entire life of Jesus (from his birth to his death and resurrection), with a significant number of sayings and teachings about him. These writings are essentially extensions of existing gospels or pseudo-mystical literature of the time, and none dates from as early as the 1st century; all are from the 2nd century or later. In my opinion, this literature is pure speculation by 2nd-century writers trying to fill in the gaps, and unfortunately, there is nothing in them that offers us new information about the life of Jesus.

A list of these writings, excluding the apocryphal ones already mentioned above, could be as follows:

- _Protoevangelium of James_ ([Spanish Wikipedia](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoevangelio_de_Santiago) and [English Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infancy_Gospel_of_James)): an account only of the conception and birth of Jesus, much of which was already present in the other gospels. It is simply an expansion made in the 2nd century. ([Link on Urantiapedia](/en/Bible/Protoevangelium_of_James))
- _Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew_ ([Wikipedia in Spanish](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelio_del_pseudo-Mateo) and [Wikipedia in English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Pseudo-Matthew)): an expansion of the story of Jesus' birth, with a multitude of fanciful stories about his childhood, made during the 2nd century. ([Link in Urantiapedia](/en/Bible/Gospel_of_Pseudo_Matthew))
- _Book of the Nativity of Mary_: a much later version, from the 9th century, of the previous writing. ([Urantiapedia link](/en/Bible/Book_of_the_birth_of_Saint_Mary))
- _The Book of the Infancy of the Savior_ ([Spanish Wikipedia](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liber_de_infantia_Salvatoris)): The same as above, a 9th-century version of the above writings. ([Urantiapedia link](/en/Bible/Latin_Infancy_Gospel))
- _Gospel of Pseudo-Thomas_, Israelite philosopher: A fanciful account of supposed miracles involving the child Jesus, 2nd-century. ([Link on Urantiapedia](/en/Bible/Infancy_Gospel_of_Thomas))
- _Arabic Infancy Gospel_ ([Spanish Wikipedia](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelio_arábe_de_la_infancia)): a later version of the Protoevangelium of James and the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew. ([Urantiapedia link](/en/Bible/Syriac_Infancy_Gospel))
- _History of Joseph the Carpenter_ ([English Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Joseph_the_Carpenter)): a 4th-century version of the above writings, which expanded on the part concerning Joseph's life and death in old age. ([Urantiapedia link](/en/Bible/History_of_Joseph_the_Carpenter))
- _Armenian Infancy Gospel_: A 6th-century expansion of the existing childhood accounts of Jesus. ([Urantiapedia link](/en/Bible/Armenian_Infancy_Gospel))
- _The Book of the Infancy of the Savior_: An 11th-century compilation of the previously known childhood accounts of Jesus. ([Urantiapedia link](/en/Bible/Latin_Infancy_Gospel_B))
- _Gospel of Peter_ ([Spanish Wikipedia](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelio_de_Pedro) and [English Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Peter)): Only fragments of this text are available, and references are made to it by early Christian fathers. In my opinion, this Gospel is nothing more than a remnant of one of the Syrian versions of the Gospel of Matthew, which I have called the Gospel of Matthew in Aramaic. It was written around 130. The Early Fathers, in fact, mention it critically, denying that it could be the work of the Apostle Peter. Some communities surely used the Gospel of Matthew in Aramaic under the heading of the Gospel of Peter to give it greater authority, as it contained certain statements contrary to Christian orthodoxy. ([Urantiapedia Link](/en/Bible/Gospel_of_Peter))
- _Gospel of Nicodemus_, _Acts of Pilate_, or _Descent of Christ into Hell_ ([Spanish Wikipedia](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelio_de_Nicodemo) and [English Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Nicodemus)): is an account of the trial of Jesus, where Pilate is now not as guilty of the verdict, of the death and resurrection, and of Jesus' descent into Hell, from where he returns victorious. Composed in the 2nd century. ([Urantiapedia Link](/en/Bible/Gospel_of_Nicodemus))
- _Gospel of Bartholomew_ ([Spanish Wikipedia](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelio_de_Bartolomé) and [English Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Bartholomew)): Written in the 3rd century, it contains some very original dialogues between Bartholomew and Jesus, but also material on Jesus' descent into hell that has been seen before. ([Urantiapedia link](/en/Bible/Gospel_of_Bartholomew))
- _Book of St. John the Evangelist, the Theologian_: description of Mary's assumption into heaven. A very modern writing, from the 4th century. ([Urantiapedia link](/en/Bible/Account_of_St_John_the_Theologian))
- _Book of John, Archbishop of Thessalonica_: similar to the previous one, and also from the 4th century. ([Urantiapedia link](/en/Bible/Book_of_John_Archbishop_of_Thessalonica))
- _Transit of the Virgin Mary_ or _Narration of the Pseudo-Joseph of Arimathea_: a very late account, from the 13th century, about the assumption of Mary into heaven, following in the footsteps of the previous ones. ([Urantiapedia link](/en/Bible/Narration_of_the_Pseudo_Joseph_of_Arimathea))
- _Gospel of Judas_ ([Wikipedia in Spanish](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelio_de_Judas) and [Wikipedia in English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Judas)): a series of conversations between Jesus and his apostles, where Judas has a special role, but which put into Jesus' mouth pseudo-mystical statements of a Gnostic type, where the important thing is to know certain mystical secrets that provide eternal life. 2nd century.
- _Gospel according to Mary_ ([Wikipedia in Spanish](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelio_de_María_Magdalena) and [Wikipedia in English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Mary)): the same dynamic as the previous one, some conversations between Jesus and his disciples after his death, with a more important role this time of Mary Magdalene, where supposedly Jesus reveals some secret mysteries about the universe.
- _Dialogue of the Savior_ ([Wikipedia in English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_of_the_Saviour)): this one does have an appropriate title because it is more of the same as the previous ones, some conversations between Jesus and his disciples where Mary Magdalene has a special role, and where she offers them mystical secrets. 2nd century.
- _Secret Book of John_ ([Wikipedia in Spanish](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelio_apócrifo_de_Juan) and [Wikipedia in English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocryphon_of_John)): a speech, not even in the mouth of Jesus, with Gnostic ideas about gods, angels, demons and the genesis of creation. 3rd century.
- _Secret Book of James_ ([Wikipedia in English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocryphon_of_James)): is actually a letter attributed to James, from the first half of the 2nd century, where he narrates some words that Jesus said before his assumption into heaven. And the truth is that it is one of the few texts in which the speech has a tone quite similar to the traditional one.
- _Gospel according to Philip_ ([Wikipedia in Spanish](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelio_de_Felipe) and [Wikipedia in English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Philip)): a set of mystical reflections of a Gnostic type, where the apostle Philip almost does not appear, from the 3rd century.
- _Wisdom of Jesus Christ_ ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sophia_of_Jesus_Christ)): another book of conversations between Jesus and his disciples with Gnostic ideas from the mouth of Jesus. 3rd century.

- _Book of Thomas the Athlete_ ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Thomas_the_Contender)): a speech by Jesus supposedly directed to the apostle Thomas, which contains Gnostic references but is largely original and whose words are very reminiscent of the traditional gospels. 2nd century.
- _Revelation of Peter_ ([Wikipedia in English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnostic_Apocalypse_of_Peter)): a vision supposedly by Peter, with clear Gnostic perceptions, and which seems to be a writing intended to disqualify a certain Pauline tendency by putting Peter as guarantor of the faith. 3rd century.

- _Gospel of the Nazarenes_ ([Wikipedia in English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_the_Nazarenes)): we have a few fragments, but in my opinion, and following some experts who believe this, this gospel is nothing more than a copy of the so-called Gospel of the Hebrews, which I have called _Gospel of Matthew in Aramaic_, like the Gospel of Peter. 2nd century.
- _Gospel of the Ebionites or of the Twelve_ ([Wikipedia in Spanish](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelio_de_los_ebionitas) and [Wikipedia in English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_the_Ebionites)): we have a few fragments of this gospel that must have been a Gnostic-type text. 2nd century.
- _Gospel or traditions of Matthias_ ([Wikipedia in English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Matthias)): we have very few fragments of this gospel, supposedly written by Matthias, the successor of Judas Iscariot, to give us an idea of ​​its content, and which only appeared mentioned by the Church Fathers with invitations to the ascetic life.
- _Gospel of Eve_ ([Wikipedia in English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Eve)): this is how the Church Father Epiphanius called it, but it is a text of the sexual sect of the Borborites.
