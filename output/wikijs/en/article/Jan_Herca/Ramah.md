Ramah is one of the towns that _The Urantia Book_ ([UB 138:9.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p9_3)) says the apostles visited during their first personal working tour of Galilee, during the months of August and September of 26. When identifying Ramah, many towns can confuse us: 
- a Ramah of Benjamin (8 km north of Jerusalem) 
- Ramathain-Zophin, present Neby Samwil (4-5 miles NW of Jerusalem) 
- Ramoth in Gilead, east of the Jordan, possibly present Reimun (5 miles west of Jerash) 
- Southern Ramoth (in the Negev) 

The Ramah that Jesus and the sons of Zebedee visited is none of these. It was located on the road from Capernaum to Antioch Ptolemais (modern-day Akre or Akko). It is described in some sources as a city in the territory of Naphtali, which may be the modern-day Khirbet Zeitun er-Rameh, east of the present-day town of Rameh. 

Galilee is divided into two regions: Lower Galilee or the south, and Upper Galilee or the north, separated by the plain of Ramah ([Joshua 19:36](/en/Bible/Joshua/19#v36)). This Ramah is the one that Joshua gave to the tribe of Naphtali, along with Kedesh and Hazor. 

It is also identified with a city in the territory of Asher—west of Naphtali—but its exact location is difficult to pinpoint. Some believe it to be the same town as a Rameh located southeast of Tyre. 

Ramah means “height” and is applied to many high places or tells in Palestinian geography, “high places of Baal,” which in ancient times were used as sanctuaries. 

## References

A very interesting book, [Through Samaria to Galilee in the Jordan](http://books.google.com/books?id=A4xRtP5rPmsC), by Josias Porter, mentions two Ramahs, one Ramah of Asher (p. 177), and another Ramah of Naphtali (p. 106), near Safed, situated in a valley between mountains, rich in olives and vineyards. There are ruins that attest to its antiquity.
