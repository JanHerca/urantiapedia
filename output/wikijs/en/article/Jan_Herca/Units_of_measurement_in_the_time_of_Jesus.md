## Hebrew units

### Units of length

For the Hebrews, the thumb is the first form of measurement and is called _etzbagh_ or "inch." A thumb is also equal to six grains of barley, which was a very primitive way of counting grain. The thickness of the little finger was also another measure and was called _ziith_.

Four fingers were called _tefahl tefach_, plural _tefahiml tefachim_. This measurement is very often translated in the scriptures as "hand span", but it must be understood that it is a short palm. The Latin equivalent was the _palmus_, with four _digits_ (7.3925 cm). There were other measurements somewhat larger than this "short palm" or "smaller palm". One was a measurement with the palm extended that was called _zzit_ (_sit_), which was greater than four fingers. Another was the _zereth_, which is the distance between the tip of the thumb and the little finger with the palm extended to the maximum, and which was equal to twelve fingers, that is to say that the _zereth_ or "larger palm" was equivalent to three "smaller palms". The _zereth_, moreover, was already significant because it was half a cubit ([Ez 43:13](/en/Bible/Ezekiel/43#v13), [Is 40:12](/en/Bible/Isaiah/40#v12), [1 Sam 17](/en/Bible/1_Samuel/17)).

Bricks were usually designated by their length. There were two types in particular: a brick with a length of a palm-length or _zereth_, and this dimension was called _lebana_, the width of this brick being half a _lebana_; then there was a square brick of a palm-length and a half, and this measurement was called _ariahh_.

The _ama_ or _emah_, plural _emathaim_, or six _tefahiml_, which is frequently translated as "cubit", is a very common measure, mentioned in the measurements of Noah's ark ([Gn 6:15](/en/Bible/Genesis/6#v15)) and of the sacred tabernacle ([Ex 25ff](/en/Bible/Exodus/25)). This _ama_, as we see, can be interpreted as two _zereth_ or two "handspans", and therefore equivalent to a cubit. Solomon's temple also always referred to this measure ([1 Re 6ff](/en/Bible/1_Kings/6)). It was a measure in widespread use even in nations beyond the Hebrew one.

However, there is a point to be made about the “cubit.” There were two kinds of cubits: one was the “legal cubit” and the other the “common cubit.” The “legal cubit” was an exact measurement, six _tephahhim_ or “handspans.” The “common cubit” covered only five “handspans,” that is, the usual length of a man’s arm from the elbow to the tip of his fingers, and since each man might not have the same arm length, it was somewhat variable.

The cubit, whether legal or not, was a widely used measure in different parts of the world and adopted various names. Not only _amah_, _emah_ or _emoth_, but also _atsila_, which the Romans renamed _axilla_, or _gomed_, _gerima_, _garmida_, or _kal_. It has always been an easily reproducible and widely used measure everywhere.

A _cane_ or _kane_, plural _kanim_, was another larger measure. It measured six _emoth_ and a _zereth_ in length, that is, six and a half legal cubits, and was sometimes also called _zzalil_ ([Ez 40:3](/en/Bible/Ezekiel/40#v3); [41-42](/en/Bible/Ezekiel/40#v41)).

The _kumah_ was the name given to the measure of the height of the erect human man, and was estimated to be about three _emoth_ to the head, having one more _amah_ if the hands are stretched towards the sky.

These were the most common length measures for measuring small lengths. In some trades, however, other specific measures were used. For example, stonemasons and architects used _gazith_ stones. In the collection of sheaves, the _hhabilah_ was used, which was more a measure of the thickness of the bundle than of length. There were also other stones that marked dimensions such as the _pizzla_ or the _morbia_, the latter being three _emoth_ long.

For surveying purposes, the cubit or similar measure was not very practical, which is why other measures were often used. One frequently mentioned is the _pagham_ or "sole of the foot", plural _paghamim_. It was also called _regel_ and was estimated to be equivalent to two _tephahhim_. The sorah_ was in turn four _emoth_ wide. The Latins called this measure _porca_.

Another measure similar to this one is the _tsaghad_, sometimes called _pezzigha_, which could be considered the “step.” But this measure was the least reliable. Some men take much longer steps than others ([2 Sam 6:13](/en/Bible/2_Samuel/6#v13)).

Among the longest measures of length is the berath, translated as "mile." It is mentioned a few times in the scriptures ([Gn 35:16](/en/Bible/Genesis/35#v16), [Gn 48:7](/en/Bible/Genesis/48#v7), [2 Re 5:19](/en/Bible/2_Kings/5#v19)). The rabbis used to say that this mile was roughly equal to one thousand emoth. The mile is sometimes also called a cherub or erub, the maximum distance that could be walked on the Sabbath.

Another intermediate measure would be the _ruzz_ or _rizz_ (plural _rizzim_ or _ruzzim_) or seventy _kanim_, that is, about 450 cubits, or according to some other mentions, 266 paces. A mile or _berath_ is usually estimated to contain seven and a half _rizzim_, but this mile is surely the "big mile" of almost four miles that is usually called _parazza_ or else the calculations would not add up.

### Capacity units

The oldest unit is the _sato_ or _zzeah_ or _seah_ (plural _zzeim_ or _seim_), which was already used in the time of Abraham ([Gn 18:6](/en/Bible/Genesis/18#v6)). The chicken egg was always a widely used unit, called _ghachal_. The _kab_ (plural _kabim_) was a measure for liquids equivalent to 24 eggs, about 1.2 liters today. The fourth part of the _kab_ was the _robeagh_ (which was translated as _quartum_ in Latin), also called _log_ if it was to speak of liquids (or _sextarium_ in Latin). The _sato_ was 6 _kabim_, that is, about 7.2 liters. The _sato_ is also related to the dimensions of length when it was assured that 50 square cubits of land produced a sato of seed. The _sato_ is also implied in that _modio_ or _seah_ spoken of by the prophet Elisha, as told in the book of Kings. A _seah_ was apparently a very exact measure made with a type of jar that had a mark in its center to be able to measure half ([2 Re 7:1,16](/en/Bible/2_Kings/7#v1)). This half of the _sato_ or three _kabim_ was a popular measure even in the time of Jesus as attested by the gospel of Matthew ([Mt 13:33](/en/Bible/Matthew/13#v33)). It was a very reasonable amount of flour to make the bread necessary for a family for one day.

An _epha_ or _ephi_ or _epha_ (plural _ephim_) contains three _zzeim_ or _satos_, and therefore 18 _kabim_. Ruth the Moabite is what she got after gleaning and threshing the field and is sometimes translated as three _modii_ (_satos_) ([Ruth 2:17](/en/Bible/Ruth/2#v17)). The _epha_ is the most popular measure of capacity since ancient times for large quantities and in buying and selling ([1 Sam 17:17](/en/Bible/1_Samuel/17#v17) and [Is 5:10](/en/Bible/Isaiah/5#v10)). It was used in other places. The Chaldeans called it _chaila_.

Since the _ephah_ was a very popular measure and had an official jar for measuring it, many measures arose from it. The _gomer_ is one-tenth of the _ephah_ ([Ex 16:32-36](/en/Bible/Exodus/16#v32)). This measure was very popular as a measure of the daily amount necessary for the sustenance of a person, and was used for manna in the desert and later for other products under the name of bundle or _manipulus_ ([Lv 23:10-11](/en/Bible/Leviticus/23#v10)). For the Chaldeans this measure was referred to as _halah_ or _haltha_.

Larger measures of capacity include the _chor_ or _coro_, which was 30 satos, that is, 180 _kabim_ or ten _ephahs_. These were the measures that kings often used to speak of large-scale production ([1 Ki 4:22](/en/Bible/1_Kings/4#v22); [5:11](/en/Bible/1_Kings/5#v11)).

Sometimes the translation complicates the identification of the measures because there was one called a _homer_ (similar to _gomer_) but this _homer_ was equivalent to a _chor_ and its tenth part was usually called a _bath_. Therefore, as Ezekiel states, the _ephah_ and the _bath_ would be the same, or at least they should be, as the prophet admonished ([Eze 45:11](/en/Bible/Ezekiel/45#v11)). The _homer_ and the _bath_ were used for liquids and the _chor_ and the _ephah_ for dry matter, but they were practically identical in volumes. The _homer_ is also often called a “donkey’s load.” Sometimes this _homer_ or _chorus_ was too much for a donkey, so there was also another measure, called _lethech_ or _letekh_, half the _chorus_, which was also called “a donkey's load.”

There were other, less well-known measures, based on the capacity of similar baskets and vessels, such as the _zzal_ or _canistrum_, the basket probably from [Mt 14:20](/en/Bible/Matthew/14#v20), called in Syriac _chupha_; the _mispal_, equivalent to _lethech_; or the _kalzzatra_, a leather vessel with capacity for four _kabim_.

A unit widely used for wine and oil was the _hin_, which was twelve _quarters_ or _logim_, that is, three _kabim_ or the equivalent of that measure when speaking of measuring grain, also very frequent, which was _half a sato_. It is not uncommon to find this measure in the Bible ([Ex 29:40](/en/Bible/Exodus/29#v40); [30:24](/en/Bible/Exodus/30#v24), [Lv 23:13](/en/Bible/Leviticus/23#v13), [Nm 15:4-10](/en/Bible/Numbers/15#v4); [28:5-7](/en/Bible/Numbers/28#v5), [Ez 4:11](/en/Bible/Ezekiel/4#v11)).

Other less common and difficult to measure measures were the _cado_, which was translated as jug, and which was equivalent to the amount of liquid that a woman was able to transport ([Gn 24:15](/en/Bible/Genesis/24#v15), [Jue 7:16](/en/Bible/Judges/7#v16), [1 Re 18:34](/en/Bible/1_Kings/18#v34)). There was also another small measure called in Hebrew _mesurah_ (usually translated as "measure") which is what Ezekiel was commanded to drink from one day to the next ([Ez 4:11](/en/Bible/Ezekiel/4#v11)), and the _tharvvad_, a large tablespoon, as well as the _zzizz_, another kind of ladle, and the _kortob_, a very small measure with three-fifths of an egg. Based on vessels and not on spoons we have evidence of a _kephiza_ (a kind of hundredth of a cor), a _kantar_ or _kankan_ (or pitcher), the _anbag_, the _teni_, the _selahhath_, the _thvman_ or _thamnetha_ (an Aramaic word), the _tharkab_ (of two kabim), the _sargas_, the _garba_, the _hhabiahh_ and others.

### Weight units

The fundamental unit for Hebrew weight was the "sacred shekel of the Sanctuary," that is, the weight of the silver shekel with which payments were made at the temple, and which had the weight of half a Roman ounce, that is, about 13.7 g. [^1] The scriptures are littered with references to weights using this shekel as a unit (such as [Jdg 8:25](/en/Bible/Judges/8#v25) and [1 Chr 8:15](/en/Bible/1_Chronicles/8#v15)).

The rest of the weights considered by the Hebrews are based on this "shekel", as is the case of the half shekel or the _gerah_ (<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>20</sub> of the shekel), whose weights were used to quantify quantities of other metals or products.

To designate a very large weight, the Hebrews used the _kichar_ or _kikkar_ (pl. _kikkarim_), which is usually translated as _talent_. It was a flat and wide weight (from which it gets its name since _kikkar_ means "plain"), and was the typical Hebrew word to designate a cake of bread or dried figs. The value of this talent seems to have been anciently 3,000 shekels, that is, about 40 kg, but this is difficult to specify because in ancient times the shekel was not a very specific weight, and when weight was established the talent was not in very general use. The talent, however, is a frequently repeated measure in the Old Testament when referring to shipments that kings made to others (for example, [2 Kings 18:14](/en/Bible/2_Kings/18#v14)).

half a shekel | 6.85 g
shekel | 13.70 g
talent | 20 to 40 kg


## Roman units

The Romans weighed, counted and measured in pounds, aces and feet respectively, all divided into twelve units (for example, an ace = twelve _unciae_). Undoubtedly, the Romans opted for the decimal system (still in force and used since the early days of Ancient Egypt, 5000 years ago) in order to be able to count with the fingers of both hands (one is one finger, five is an open hand and ten is two crossed hands, IVX). The use of the duodecimal system was used in Mesopotamia, possibly because of the fact that it was counted with the phalanges of the fingers, because it is a number divisible by 2, 3, 4 and 6 and, perhaps, because it is associated with the twelve lunar cycles.

In the forum of Roman cities, the "mensa ponderaria" was kept under religious guard, with the standards for comparing the measures and weights used in commercial transactions.

### Units of area and length

Surface measurements were the _acta_ geodesic (equivalent to half a day's work) and the _jugerum_ (from _jugum_ = yoke, which was equivalent to a full day's work). An _actus_ was equivalent to 120 square feet. Although theoretically they were surface measurements, in reality they were more like work measurements.

The Roman system of length measurements had the following units, in order of size:

- _digitus_, o dedo, que equivale a 18,481 mm o a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> pies.
- _palmus_ is not actually related to the palm (which would be the measurement between the ends of the thumb and little finger with the hand extended), but rather to the Castilian _coto_, which is the width of the palm of the closed hand without the thumb, and was equivalent to 4 fingers, 7.3925 cm or ¼ feet.
- _pes_, or foot, comprising 16 _digitus_ or 4 _palmus_, that is, 29.57 cm. The archetype of the Roman foot is deposited in the temple of Juno Moneta.
- _palmipes_, or palm-foot, which was equivalent to 20 fingers or 5 _palmus_, that is, 36.9625 cm or <sup>5</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub> feet.
- _cubitus_ or _ulna_, similar to the elbow, which was equivalent to 6 _palmus_, 44.355 cm or <sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> feet.
- _gradus_, which was equivalent to 40 _digitus_, 10 _palmus_, that is, 73.925 cm or <sup>5</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> feet. It is a measure similar to the "step" of later times.
- _passus_, actually a double step, was the distance between two steps of the same foot while walking. It was equivalent to 2 _gradus_, 20 _palmus_, 5 feet or 1.4785 m.
- _decempeda_ or _pertica_, equivalent to 10 pies, 2,957 m, 2 _passus_, 4 _gradus_ and 8 _palmipés_.
- _actus vorsus_, o furrow of 24 _passus_, 35,489 mo 120 pies.
- _stadium_, or stadium, which comprises 125 _passus_, that is, 184.81 m.
- _millia passus_, which gave rise to the mile. Its name comes from the fact that it is 1,000 passus, that is, 1,478.5 m or 5,000 feet.
- _leuca_ or league, which was equivalent to 1,500 passus, 7,500 feet, or 2,222 m.

For measurements of length the _pertica_ or the _actus vorsus_ were used. The _actus vorsus_ squared, multiplied by two, gave the _iugerum_.

### Capacity units

The table summarizes the units that were in common use in ancient Rome:

Roman unit | Latin name | Value | Conversion
--- | --- | ---: | ---:
cochlearia | _cochlearia_ | &frac14; ciato | 1.14 cl
ciato | _cyathus_ | &frac13; square | 4.56 cl
salad _acetabalum_ | &frac14; hemina | 6.84 cl
square | _quartarii_ | of the acetabulum | 13.68 cl
hemina | _hemina_ | &frac12; sextario | 0.2734 l
sextario | _sextarius_ | &frac16; leave | 0.5468 l
congio | _congius_ | &frac14; sesquimodio | 3.2810 l
half a day | _semodii_ | &frac12; a lot | 4.3770 l
a lot | _more_ | | 8.7500 l
six hundred and fifty | _sequismodius_ | <sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> modios | 13.1250 l
ánfora o cuadrantal | _anphorae_ | 3 modios | 26,2500 l

The _congius_, the _sextarius_, and the _cyathus_ were measures of liquids, and the last two were also used for solids.

### Weight units

Initially the measure was the pound divided into twelve parts, called ounces, and the ounce in turn was divided into 24 scruples.

The weights were also brought into line with the Greeks and four Roman pounds became worth three Attic minas.

The ounce (symbol: oz) is a unit of mass used since ancient Rome to weigh goods and other items more accurately, especially if their weight was less than a Roman pound. The ounce is still commonly used in English-speaking countries, and was formerly more widely used throughout Europe. It was approximately equivalent to 27.4 g.

The word ounce comes from the Latin _ūncia_, derived in turn from the Proto-Indo-European _*oinoko-_ (from which _único_ also derives), a suffixed form of the root _*oino-_ (from which _uno_ also derives). The _ūncia_ was the fractional unit used by the Romans, who used duodecimal fractions; that is, it meant "one twelfth". In the monetary context, the _uncia_ was the coin with a value corresponding to <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub> of an as. On the other hand, the ounce of weight was <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>12</sub> of a pound (note that the 16-ounce pound is later than the 12-ounce pound). The English words _ounce_ and _inch_ are also derived from _ūncia_.
