In every study group I’ve attended over the years conjecture invariably enters our discussions. Some of it is wild speculation; other comments are more thoughtfully informed. In this issue of Journal we feature two interesting propositions. David Kantor, who has been working on a documentary focused on Christianity and _The Urantia Book_, speculates on the role of Christian philosopher Thomas Aquinas’ 13th century _Summa Theologica_ as possible groundwork for the fifth epochal revelation. James Woodward gives us a detailed analysis of that allusive word “morontia,” and why it was necessary for the revelators to invent a new term to embrace a new concept more adequately.

Also, in this issue Mark Blackham explores the idea that the celestial personalities far above us sometimes find themselves at odds with one another. In his article “Dealing With Conflict In A Spiritual Life,” Mr. Blackham observes that disagreement in the heavenly realms is not unusual, particularly at the system, constellation, and local universe levels. He delineates the multiple beings whose role it is to mediate and reconcile the problems arising in creating and managing our grand universe.

Bringing us back to how our celestial friends _do_ guide and enlighten us with new truths, Richard E. Warren provides a three-part study on “Truth, Beauty, and Goodness and the Father,” and how those three supreme values inform and help us develop our relationship with God.

## Thomas Aquinas and Some Speculation on the Origin of The Urantia Book

Curiosity, rumors, second-hand recollections, and imaginative speculation continue to fuel interest in a topic of widespread interest—How _The Urantia Book_ came into existence. While the true story likely never will be known by humans simply because it involves things beyond our comprehension, it’s possible to amuse ourselves by creating a plausible story from these suppositions as they combine with information taken from _The Urantia Book_ and the history of Christianity. So, consider the following as mere speculation.

Emma Christensen, the last of the Contact Commissioners, told me that work on the revelation began in the Middle Ages. Other apocryphal sources specify the 1200s.  From comments in _The Urantia Book,_ we can reasonably assume that Machiventa was present on the planet in the capacity of Resident Governor General sometime in the High Middle Ages. This period, particularly in the 12<sup>th</sup> century, saw a widespread spiritual awakening across Europe. It was the apex of Christian civilization.  There was a desire to know more about Jesus and how to live a Christ-like life (see references below).

## What is Morontia?

Definitions

Though it may be premature to forecast wide acceptance of _The Urantia Book_, it’s clearly rising in visibility due to decades of wise dissemination efforts and, of course, the internet. The first page of the Foreword, however, carries four statements calling attention to the serious problem of confusion on Urantia. We are notified—and warned—that progress on our world will depend on the evolution of human wisdom _and_ _revelation_. Our own community of reader / believers is also confused about certain terms and definitions found in the teachings. We ought to resolve this confusion among Urantia Book devotees as we continue to take the advanced messages out into the mainstream. It is in that spirit that I advance my personal theory: morontia is akin to supermorality.

Evolving mortal creatures experience an irresistible urge to symbolize their finite concepts of God. Man’s consciousness of **moral duty** and his **spiritual idealism** represent a value level—**an experiential reality**—which is difficult of symbolization. <a id="a91_259"></a>[UB 0:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p2_1) \[all bold indicates author’s emphasis\]

## Dealing With Conflict in A Spiritual Life

_Mark Blackham, Canada_

Conflicts are an inevitable part of life on inhabited worlds, especially those worlds in the earlier stages of social and spiritual evolution. And this is certainly the case at the present stage of development on Urantia.

Things have improved over the centuries and, no doubt, they will continue to improve over time. But not until the distant future, when our planet finally attains the utopian ages of light and life, will we be entirely free of discord. This is not to say that, at such a time, we will all be of the same mind. But the way we deal with our differences will change significantly. Until we reach that utopia, and apart from national wars, we will experience two personal spheres of conflict—one is the conflict that takes place in the inner life (mind and soul), and the other is the conflict that occurs in the outer life (family and social).

## Truth, Beauty, Goodness, and the Father’s Will

**Part 1 of 3**

To material, evolutionary, finite creatures, a life predicated on the living of the Father's will leads directly to the attainment of spirit supremacy in the personality arena and brings such creatures one step nearer the comprehension of the Father-Infinite. Such a Father life is one predicated on truth, sensitive to beauty, and dominated by goodness. <a id="a121_355"></a>[UB 106:9.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/106#p9_12)

When the adventure of organizing time and space began, God commanded an imperfect universe to: "Be you perfect, even as I am perfect." In time, along with the rest of creation, we will attain perfection and satisfy this preeminent and organizing command from the Father of all by living truth, creating beauty, and performing goodness.
