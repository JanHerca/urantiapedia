Me: I so wish to truly KNOW you! 

MY CHILD, 

I am as close as your thoughts 
I give mind 
I am as close as your beating heart 
I give life 
I am as close as your lungs 
I give breath 
I am as close as your body 
I give being to your very cells. 

See me in the minds and bodies of those you love, 
in acquaintances, in strangers passing by, 
in those you fear, even your enemies. 
See me especially in those who would destroy you. 
All these are your brothers and sisters, my children, 
they are my beloveds, just as you are, my adored child. 

See me in the trees and clouds and grass, 
even in the vegetables you grow for food. 
See me in the cows, the pigs, the chickens, 
the creatures of the sea, created to nourish you. 
See me also in the weeds you dig up, 
and the bears and lions and wolves whom you fear. 

See me in your animal friends and pets, 
dogs and cats and horses, 
birds even lizards and snakes 
yet the tiniest bugs and myriad insects. 
They are all a part of me. 
Each has his role to play. 

See me in the natural beauty around you— 
green plants and blue sky, fall colors, 
spring flowers, that delicious spring green, 
that impossible blue sky behind the magnificent sunset. 
I am in the winter drab as well as the snowy white. 
See me in landscapes beyond your imagination, 
mountains and valleys, rocks, oceans and rushing rivers 
canyons and majestic vistas.

See me in harmonious paintings, sculptures, 
even buildings and landscapes created with human hands. 
See me in poetry and music birthed 
by my gift of mind used to express 
both practical and spiritual relationships. 
You see, I am in and of all that is around and within you. 
You are of me and I am of you. 
Yet I am not you and I am still more than you, 
I am myself. 
I am. 

This is how you will know me, child: pay attention to what is there, look with spiritual eyes, with the intention of finding me. In wanting and longing to know me, you already know me. Continue coming to me in quiet times, in times of fun and laughter, in good food and companionship, in hard labor and in your rest. As I am everywhere, will you find me, but only because you seek me. If you do not seek me, I am hidden, nowhere to be seen. Seeking is the key. Seeking me opens many doors. 

Seek me, my beloved child. I answer each and every sincere call. 

I love you very much, dear one. 


Your Mother, whom you know as the Holy Spirit
