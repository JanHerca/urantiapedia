The Urantia Book tells us that “Jesus talked for more than an hour to the assembled groups on, ‘The Mission of adversity and the spiritual value of dis-appointment.’” (<a id="a36_168"></a>[UB 151:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p0_1))

I have been studying The Urantia Book for only a short time, but when I read this passage I felt very aware that it had great significance for me—that I related to it.

I had a conventional upbringing in the Anglican Church but, as so often happens these days, my faith became less relevant to me as I became older. There were spicier, more materialistic pursuits. All quite usual.

I had a successful career as an accountant and my work involved my living overseas in various countries. I led a very enjoyable and successful life. I was healthy and happy, self-contained, and satisfied with myself. Spiritual matters or considerations about the real meaning of life rarely crossed my mind.

Suddenly, in 1972, a black cloud appeared on the horizon! All was not well. My eyesight was deteriorating. In 1973, after two operations, I became blind in the right eye. Between then and 1979 I underwent six operations on the left eye which left me with 30% vision in it—with the assistance of contact lens and spectacles. The prognosis was that I would also lose all sight in this eye.

It would be an understatement to say that these circumstances changed my life. My confidence was shattered, my social life curtailed, and my career ruined. However, as I now write this article, I think “so what!” Looking back, I consider this experience has been the greatest blessing I ever received. Or may I say, “__I have experienced the spiritual value of disappointment.__”

The first positive to occur was that I learned of the wonderful power of other people’s prayer working in my life. I did not go blind. I was fortunate in knowing many Christian people, largely among those with whom I worked. So many of these wonderful folk prayed for me at a time when I was unable to do so for myself. I know this is what saved my eyesight. Nothing else could have.

My spiritual progress after that was, I regret to say, very slow. I was recalcitrant and resisted the whole way. God’s patience was another blessing I have now come to know. At first, I did not see that the material success that I still craved was not important. Gradually however, as I was able to relinquish my resentment about my mishaps. I started to see my situation from a different standpoint—that is, spiritually.

I never forgot the blessing I received through the prayers of those people, and I started to realise that there is another and more important side to life. Since that time, I have pursued a sometimes hesitant, but nevertheless ongoing spiritual development. This was at first through mainstream Christian church involvement and then later, conjointly with my Urantia Book studies.

I have come to know the great love God has for me. I am learning the reason for my Urantia existence. It is to learn, spiritually, his plan for my salvation. Knowing this, my main purpose in living is to help others also come to this realization.

If my particular “adversity” had not occurred, I would never have found the spiritual path which I now tread. Adversities in this life are many and varied, but I know what Jesus meant for me, and for others, when he talked of “__the mission of adversity and the spiritual value of disappointment.__”
