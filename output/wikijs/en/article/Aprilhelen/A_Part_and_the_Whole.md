“Unity” immediately ignites within me an excited passion for the Supreme Being, which was the first aspect of God I truly understood as a child. How fabulous that we each are participating in the collaboration of its evolution! Here is a short list of ideas that are possible actions one can engage in to add value to the Supreme Being.

**Worship God.** Live in awe and wonder. Sing, praise, and love.

**Know God.** Understand the attributes of God: omnipresence, omnipotence, omniscience, limitlessness, supreme rule, and primacy.

**Increasingly become like God.** Study the life and teachings of Jesus and be more like him.

**Remember that there is only one of you!** Be in partnership with the fragment of God that dwells within you.

**Know Thyself.** Do the inner work to remember who you truly are through observation, acceptance, patience, and relaxation.

**Be confident that only you can do what you can do.** Know your unique value; use your talents to serve humanity.

**Take advantage of challenges and fears.** Be excited with gratitude for the opportunity to problem solve on the path of experience.

**Get creative and have fun.** Live in curiosity, walk in bliss, and do the absurd! Continue throughout your life to try new things, study other genres, and take a different road.

**Use humor as a superpower.** Be the artist of finding just the right words to press the release valve of stress and tension. Let your laughter roar and your smile be contagious!

**Express spiritual values.** With every thought, word, and deed, as well as the energetic frequency that you emanate and the body language you choose, act as if it were that last moment you were ever going to see that sibling in front of you.

**Serve.** Balance self-care and serving your communities. Serve on many kinds of teams. Be of service in difficult ways.

**See unity in diversity.** Love through understanding as many beings in the universes as you can. Know that each one of us is doing the best we can with what we have at this moment on our various paths. Celebrate our differences!
