Urantia is poised to experience a spiritual revolution, the likes of which has never been witnessed before on this planet:

> _Urantia is now quivering on the very brink of one of its most amazing and enthralling epochs of social readjustment, moral quickening, and spiritual enlightenment_. <a id="a50_168"></a>[[UB 195:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_2)]

It has now been more than seventy five years since a Midwayer Commission declared that message to our troubled world! Where and how do we, as readers and students of _The Urantia Book_, fit into this planetary scenario of social, moral, and spiritual reformation? Consider the following:

> _The religion of Jesus is the most powerful unifying influence the world has ever known._ <a id="a54_92"></a>[[UB 194:3.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_17)]

Could it be that this _religion of Jesus_ is the fuse that ignites and the driving force behind this global renaissance? And if so, just how does this take place….who are the key players….and just what is the divine plan for this unprecedented spiritual renewal?

These intriguing questions and many more are to be considered and answered at ANZURA’s forthcoming national conference, to be held in Hobart, Tasmania from the 16<sup>th</sup> to the 19<sup>th</sup> September 2016. It was almost six years ago that Hobart hosted its inaugural national conference and once again you are warmly invited to gather with us at the Maryknoll Retreat Centre overlooking the picturesque Blackmans Bay, just fifteen minutes south of the city centre.

#### Our Theme

> _Sooner or later another and greater John the Baptist is due to arise proclaiming “the kingdom of God is at hand”–meaning a return to the high spiritual concept of Jesus….There must come a revival of the actual teachings of Jesus…_<a id="a62_233"></a>[[UB 170:5.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p5_19)]

> _….the teachers of this new religion are now equipped with spiritual weapons…_<a id="a64_80"></a>[[UB 194:3.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_11)]

> _Religion does need new leaders, spiritual men and women who will dare to depend solely on Jesus and his incomparable teachings. If Christianity persists in neglecting its spiritual mission while it continues to busy itself with social and material problems, the spiritual renaissance must await the coming of these new teachers of Jesus’ religion who will be exclusively devoted to the spiritual regeneration of men._ <a id="a66_421"></a>[[UB 195:9.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_4)]

Who are these “new teachers of Jesus’ religion”, who courageously proclaim his life-giving message to the world? What qualifies them to be such? What are these “spiritual weapons” that they are equipped with? How do they perform this critical role on behalf of their fellow mortals? These are pertinent questions to consider as we respond to the call to be teachers of the religion of Jesus. Are we willing to step up to the task? If not us….then who?

We will have exclusive use of the Maryknoll Retreat and Conference Centre; situated only a short walk from the beautiful waters of Blackmans Bay. Run by the Tasmanian Presentation Sisters since 1979, the Centre offers a chapel for worship, a large conference room, a kitchen, dining room, and several smaller rooms that could be used for study group discussions. Accommodation is all on-site and consists of three double rooms, five twin rooms, and twelve single rooms which all share communal bathrooms and toilets; in addition, there are three self-contained hermitages each suitable for a couple or small family. We’ll do our best to provide attendees with requested accommodation. Beds all have electric blankets and each bedroom has an electric heater. Bed linen and towels are supplied. Tasmania gets pretty cool this time of year so make sure you bring plenty of warm clothes to wear.
