## President’s Message – December 2023

_Enrique Traver, Brazil_

**Our Long-Range Plan**

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/IUA_Tidings/image-1.jpeg">
</figure>

Students of _The Urantia Book_, and especially the people at Urantia Association International, have a mission clearly defined by the teachings of the fifth epochal revelation, as well as in our first Bylaws amendment, which was recently approved by our International Representative Council (IRC).

"The mission of Urantia Association and its Constituent Associations is to foster study of _The Urantia Book_ and to disseminate its teachings."

All those who find God can embrace this mission by recognizing our affiliation to the Universal Father and, consequently, by accepting the brotherhood of all mortals on the planet. Although it is a mission that can be carried out individually, we can also come together as a group of students who are passionate about the revelation. Together, we can coordinate our efforts to fulfill this mission. This is how the Urantia Association came into being, beginning with the challenge of formulating a plan that can unite its members as a team in order to work objectively and harmoniously in this direction.

Having a Long-Range Plan (LRP) to guide our work serves multiple purposes, such as helping us to stay focused on where we want to go, what we need to do, and how we should do it:

## 2024 Urantia Association International Conference Update

_Marian Hughes, USA_

**Nurture Your Soul with Study, Worship, and Camaraderie!**

<figure id="Figure_4" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/IUA_Tidings/Baltimore-2-706x407.jpg">
</figure>

_The Urantia Book_ reminds us that we mortals are a gregarious lot. A Melchizedek states in Paper 49, "Human beings are all gregarious." In Paper 99 another writes, "The fact of man’s gregariousness perforce determines that religious groups will come into existence." It is wonderful to attend a Urantia conference to attain a deeper understanding of the revelation, but let us also heed the words of our Estonian brother, Kamo Kalda, from a Urantia Foundation conference report_:_

_“Whenever I speak with someone who has attended a conference, they usually don’t remember the topics of the presentations, but they do remember the people, the emotions, and the joy."_

It will be six years since the last, in-person international conference, due to Covid canceling the Peru conference of 2021. Time (and Zoom) breeds complacency, so let us not forget the value of gathering in numbers, the force of our Adjusters when we come together in a large group, the strength that we garner from the Spirit of Truth that shines so brightly when we study and pray in-mass. Let us come together to meet and hug our global brothers and sisters, joyfully embrace our geographically distant friends, and to laugh, learn, worship, and live in our mortal, gregarious fashion.

## 2023 ANZURA Annual Conference Report

_Daniel Swadling, Australia_

**Talkin' 'Bout A Revelation**

<figure id="Figure_5" class="image urantiapedia">

</figure>

It has been an honor and a privilege to be involved in bringing this conference to Urantia Book readers of Australia and New Zealand. It was well attended with people coming from across Sydney, Newcastle, Central Coast, Melbourne, Canberra, Hobart, Adelaide, Western Australia, New Zealand and the USA. Thank you all for coming! We had a great time catching up with old friends and making new ones, engaging with each other and exploring much about our favorite topics!

The problem we wanted to try to address at this conference was _how_ we, as a readership, talk about _The Urantia Book_ revelation with people less familiar with it. And despite being avid followers of its teachings, we seem to lack some basic principles and adequate tools or experience to attractively convey its concepts to new readers. It is hoped that the conversations started at this conference have been helpful and that the topic will continue to be addressed.

## Third Latin American Conference Report

_Fernando Maldonaldo, Mexico_

**The Fifth Revelation in the XXI Century**

This past October, the third Latin American conference of readers of _The Urantia Book_ was held in the historic area of the ancient Teotihuacan. Amidst this backdrop over 1500 years old and later reclaimed by the Aztecs, the Third Latin American Urantia Book Conference centered on the theme of the Fifth Revelation in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century.

Urantia Association International organized the conference with the support of Urantia Foundation and the local Urantia Association Mexico. Each of these entities cooperated for months planning, developing objectives, making decisions and obtaining the necessary funds for a successful event.

Forty-three participants traveled to the ancient site of Teotihuacán located outside Mexico City. Additionally, almost 300 readers joined the online broadcast––a Latin American Conference first. Urantia Book readers from 11 countries participated, including 15 young adult readers.

## Focus on the Father – Spiritual Gifts

“True faith is faith only if the actions of your life are in harmony with it and never contradict it.” — Leo Tolstoy

The concept of faith—a gift we may give ourselves—is in some ways misunderstood, as are other fundamentals of evolutionary religion. Urantia Book students have more clarity on the concept, as careful study sweeps away confused definitions. It becomes a problem for humanity when true religious ideals are minimized or limited by the avoidance of spiritual meanings and values in a quest for an easy existence. The consecration of faith does require effort; there is a wide gulf between the human and divine, but we have an inner bridge.

When it comes to the bestowal of spiritual gifts, the Father is limited by man’s capacity for receiving these divine endowments. Although the Father is no respecter of persons, in the bestowal of spiritual gifts he is **limited by man’s** **faith** and by his willingness always to abide by the Father’s will. <a id="a137_310"></a>[UB 166:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p4_1) emphasis added

## The Mission of the Prisoner Inquiry Response Team

_PIRT Team_

“_The Urantia Book_ is the Truth I Have Been Looking for My Whole Life”

<figure id="Figure_8" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/IUA_Tidings/PIRT-LOGO-TIDINGS-HEADER.jpg">
</figure>

“After reading some of your book, _The Urantia Book_, I have become highly intrigued. I am writing to you to request a copy of this outstanding literary work so I can know more about God the Father of ALL, and every aspect of Him and his heavenly host.”

These enthusiastic words dictated by a prison inmate are an excerpt from a letter written to me as a member of the Prison Inquiry Response Team (PIRT), a ministry sponsored by the Urantia International Association. Another inmate wrote, “I am an avid truth seeker, and recently a friend shared _The Urantia Book_ with me. I have been amazed, edified, and overjoyed. It ties together so many loose ends and confirms certain ideals of mine while also expanding upon them.”

## Update to the Urantia Association Bylaws

_Gaétan Charland, Canada_

Dear Urantia Association Members, Presidents, and Vice-Presidents,

<figure id="Figure_9" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/IUA_Tidings/Gaetan-150x150.jpg">
</figure>

I trust that you're aware of the revised version of the _Bylaws of Urantia Association International_, a document that has received an extensive update. These Bylaws represent the culmination of years of Urantia Association’s experiences, growth, and dedication to promoting _The Urantia Book_ and its invaluable teachings worldwide. Delving into a legal text might seem tedious; some may even question its relevance to our spiritual mission and work.

However, it's crucial to recognize that these Bylaws form the bedrock of our existence as a legal entity. They not only provide the framework for our service operations but are also indispensable for navigating the complexities of the diverse languages and cultures within our organization. Compliance with the laws of various countries necessitates having governing documents that regulate our affairs and define our societal role. These guidelines prevent confusion as to the duties and interactions of all our dedicated volunteers. Clarity on governance provides assurance that our elected leaders can focus on our mission to promote an epochal revelation.
