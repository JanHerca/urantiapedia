> _What a transcendent service if, through this revelation, the Son of Man should be recovered from the tomb of traditional theology and be presented as the living Jesus to the church that bears his name, and to all other religions!_ [[UB 196:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p1_2)]

## About the Jesus Metaverse and the Center for Unity

The Center for Unity is currently developing a Jesus Metaverse app that is a strategic, technologically savvy and innovative way to share Jesus with young adults focused on the untold story of Jesus. Our core focus is “to transform the world by sharing a new revelation of Jesus’ life, creating experiences that produce spiritual transformations.”

The user experience in the Jesus Metaverse is based on carefully curated content, presented in a visually engaging and easy to use manner. The media presentations are the basic “building blocks” of the experience. The quality of the experience, the service we provide to our users, therefore relies on two main factors: 1) The quantity and quality of the content and, 2) the quality of the design and implementation of the software.

For a deeper view into the Jesus Metaverse, take a look at this [presentation](https://bit.ly/JesusMetaverse-Deck-May-2022) and the [jesusmetaverse.org](https://bit.ly/JM-site-direct) website.

We are currently looking for Presentation Curators who will be tasked with finding specific pieces of content for Metaverse “nodes.”

## What is Presentation Curation?

The Jesus Metaverse app is based on a computer model of the entire life and teachings of Jesus. We are curating this model from biblical (the four Gospels) and non-biblical sources (e.g., Part IV of _The Urantia Book_).

To learn more of the process of building this model, and what are “nodes” and “connections,” please view [this](https://bit.ly/Data-curation-Canva) presentation.

Each Metaverse “node” consists of curated content of various [types and categories](https://airtable.com/shrHr3hCcOR9Vm30M).

The process of curating presentations, or content pieces, consists of searching the expanses of the Internet to find specific items we could display in the pages of the Jesus Metaverse app.

**Job Description**

As a Presentation Curator, you will be tasked with finding specific pieces of content for Metaverse “nodes.” You will be provided with a list of Urantia Book related and other suitable websites in which to search and specific criteria for the types of content we are looking for. Finally, we will provide a computer tool where you can document the curated content.

**Required Skills**

1. Excellent computer skills (Google docs and sheets, online software use)
2. Excellent Internet search skills
3. Good command of English
4. Reliable Internet connection and proficient use of a web browser.

**Training and Tools**

The Center for Unity team will provide one-on-one training (presentations and videos) and ongoing support. You will be working directly with Lisa Tao (the Content Production Lead) and Gabriel Rymberg (the Data Curation Lead and Jesus Metaverse project manager).

**Commitment Level**

We will curate presentations for the foreseeable future, simply because content about Jesus is constantly produced.

\*\*We ask that you be prepared to devote at least one hour a day to this task, for at least one month.\*\*

**How to Apply**

If you feel the call to serve with us, please fill in this volunteer skill [survey](https://bit.ly/JM-Volunteer-Skills-EN).

If you are not sure if this is for you, and would simply like to talk to us to find out, please contact Gabriel at [gabriel.rymberg@thecenterforunity.org](mailto:gabriel.rymberg@thecenterforunity.org) and let us know what your feelings are.

> _If the Christian church would only dare to espouse the Master’s program, thousands of apparently indifferent youths would rush forward to enlist in such a spiritual undertaking, and they would not hesitate to go all the way through with this great adventure._ [[UB 195:10.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_10)]
