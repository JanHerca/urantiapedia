## _Jesus, the Master Teacher_ 

June 9 – 12, 2016 San Antonio, Texas, USA

**Celebrating a Partnership Between the Urantia Association of the United States and The Urantia Book Fellowship**

Urantia Association of the United States (UAUS) is pleased to announce that the next national conference for the United States will be jointly sponsored by UAUS and The Urantia Book Fellowship (the Fellowship), in June of 2016. The organization of this event will be sponsored by the Lone Star Urantia Association (the Texas Local Association of UAUS) and the Education Committee of The Fellowship.

This momentous event will be held at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas and will be exploring _Jesus, the Master Teacher_ – covering a wide variety of topics and how to apply them in our lives. The conference and pre-and post-conference events will also be held on this beautiful campus. Their website at [https://new.trinity.edu](https://new.trinity.edu/) has a virtual tour that you can visit before the conference begins.

In the spring of 2015, Chris Wood approached David Kulieke, the Fellowship Education Committee chair, about what he saw as an opportunity for a combined conference based on the intended theme for the UAUS annual conference of training teachers and leaders. He and David had several conversations on the subject, eventually bringing in the newly elected President of the Fellowship, Michael Challis, as well as securing the approval of both the Fellowship and Urantia Association organizations.

Then at the international conference of Urantia Association in Quebec in July, 2015, President Chris Wood announced that the Urantia Association of the United States would present its 2016 annual conference together with the regularly planned 2016 Summer Study Session of the Fellowship’s Education Committee. These Fellowship summer study sessions are designed to enhance in-depth and high quality study of the teachings of _The Urantia Book_.

Both organizations hope to see many people at the conference/summer study session to celebrate “Jesus, the Master Teacher” as well as the enduring friendships of readers of _The Urantia Book_.
