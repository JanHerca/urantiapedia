## Program

### Day 1: Sonship with God, Cosmic Citizenship, and Planetary Evolution

**Conference Opening**  
Words from Urantia Association International President – Enrique Traver (Brazil)

**Welcoming to Peru & Introduction**

**How Do Ancient Cultures Provide Opportunities to Inspire Cosmic Citizenship?**  

_by Lourdes Burga-Cisneros – Urantia Peru Association President (Cusco, Peru)._

Cusco, Peru, is a site with traces of the blood of Adam and Eve who hoped to spread a spiritual message; whose footsteps we could wisely follow with the help of the Spirit of Truth.

**1.1. What is the Core Spiritual Message of _The Urantia Book_?**  

_by Angie Thurston (Washington D.C, U.S.A)_

What does it mean to you to be a son or daughter of God? _The Urantia Book’_s teachings are very diverse, but the number one spiritual message is that God is a loving and merciful father and that we are all family, no matter what we believe or don’t believe. This core message is the trunk of a tree with many flowering branches. This talk will introduce the listener to how, in these difficult times, we can experience the supreme joy of spiritual truth and its power to transform.

**1.2. What is Cosmic Citizenship and How Can We Apply it Practically?**  

_by Jeffrey Wattles (Ohio, USA)_

God is spirit, but the Creator works on material and intellectual levels, too. Cosmic citizens establish spiritual goals as their top priority, and _The Urantia Book_ teaches many ways to coordinate, integrate, and unify these levels. This talk will touch on the concepts of cosmic mind (16:6), cosmic truth (2:7), using an example that will help listeners understand how to apply and work effectively as a cosmic citizen with the down-to-earth facts of daily life.

**1.3. How Does Humankind Evolve from Primitive Origins to a Glorious Planetary Destiny?**  

_by Elisabeth Callahan (California, USA)_

We are on the way to the age of light and life; in that age, we integrate in our lives the positive achievements of all previous ages. A review of these ages helps us understand what happened in the distant past that helps explain the turmoil in our world today.

### Workshops

See at the end of the Program information on how to view the workshop descriptions and how to make your choices as part of the registration process.

### Day 2: Cosmic Citizenship, Holistic Personal Growth, and Our Planetary Contributions

**The New Urantia Book High-Quality Spanish Revision** – Unity, Teamwork, and Advanced Methodological Processes in the Creation of a Referential System for Quality Work.  

_by Panelists: Anibal Pacheco (Chile), Olga Lopez (Spain), Raul Pujol (Cuba), and Víctor García-Bory (Mexico)_ 

An interactive panel will discuss a 10-year long journey of challenges, service, teamwork, and friendship, as well as the results achieved.   

**2.1. What Are Some Principles of Holistic Personal Growth for Cosmic Citizenship?**  

_by Alejandro Ampudia (Lima, Perú)_

Personal growth should be understood as the way to awaken cosmic consciousness and elevate spiritual perception in order to become cosmically mature and balanced beings. There is a set of values that we must acquire faithfully and consistently because they constitute the steps of holistic growth. As we seek for perfection in the love of God, prayer and worship are indispensable tools to move forward on this path.

**2.2. How Shall We Design Projects to Promote Planetary Progress as True Cosmic Citizens?**

_by Olga López (Barcelona, Spain) & Sebastián Nozzi (Argentinian in Heidelberg, Germany)_

How can we help during this difficult and dangerous transition in our planetary history? What great projects for planetary progress are highlighted in _The Urantia Book_? We may design a contribution to one of these. We may modify a project that we are already working on or join an existing project (teamwork multiplies results).

**2.3. What Sources of Spiritual Power Enable Us to Go Forward With Our Goals?**  

_by Emeka Anazodo (Lagos, Nigeria)_

The very power or energy that flows from the Deities into all universes, creating and sustaining all things and beings, is the ultimate source of spiritual power. All spiritual power emanates from God, the Universal Father, as he is the First Source and Center of all things and beings. The spiritual power is the quickening effect of all spiritual influences which indwell, surround, and impinge upon us and we need it in order to break through our own resistance and outer obstacles to living spiritual values (166:3.8).

**Conference Closing**  

Passing of the torch to the President of the National Association that will be hosting the next international conference in 2024.
