Lord, if I don't sing to you, don't be angry.
You see, I don't have time for anything.
You have to live, walk, be with people;
look at the forest, the sea; climb heights,
pains, stairs; going down basements,
abysses, mines, wells, hearts;
enter the workshops and kitchens;
sow, harvest, deal with metals,
carving rock, planing wood;
sweat in the sun, get wet in the rain;
open windows, keep the fire going;
bake bread, shout along the roads;
put the child to sleep, mend clothes;
cry for the deceased and learn
death itself a little every day.

You don't need me, you have your Saints;
the choirs of your Virgins and Archangels
They praise and bless you in their glory.
But, to the one who is only a man, who sings to him?
Your heavenly fields
White lilies bloom, without winter.
But who brings lilies to the poor man's house?
The stars stop on your forehead.
But who brings down lightning?
from sun to prisons without doors?

The Angel kneels before Mary.
But who says to the sinful mother
“blessed be the fruit of your womb”?
With gold incense and myrrh
The Magi enrich you in the cradle.
But who kneels?
and give your treasures to barefoot children?
Your hand is raised
and the water is wine, the bread endless.
But who puts the tablecloths?
in the widow's house
and who offers a ray of hope
to those who stay up at night?

You see: so much to do down here;
I have to wind them daily
to so many hearts and watches.
I have to walk around the street looking for
to so many of my children and tell them
the things they already know, the things they ignore,
remove pebbles from their eyes,
put a star in their hair,
tell them about the strength of their hands,
and the beautiful color of his blood,
of the song they carry in their mouths
of the world of tomorrow and its children.

You see: there is no time left for anything.
