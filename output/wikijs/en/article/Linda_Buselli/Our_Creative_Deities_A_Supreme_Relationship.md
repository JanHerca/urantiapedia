The following was presented at the conference on the Creative Mother Spirit in Kansas City, Missouri, in 2004. 

In searching _The Urantia Book_ for references to the personal relationship between our Creator Son and Creative Spirit, I found virtually nothing personal, just functional relationships. 

However, let it be made clear that our Creative Spirit is a person, and always has been to Michael, regardless of whether or not other universe personalities recognized her as such in the past. On page 433, it says: “_Two beings are regarded as operating on the mating, complemental, or partnership basis;_” <a id="a37_308"></a>[[UB 39:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p3_6)] Our Creator Son and Creative Spirit are the Nebadon pattern for all three types of personal relationships. Now, having made that point, here we go. 

“For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.” This axiom of physics has profoundly influenced our view of the physical world, but it also has tremendous repercussions in our understanding of the mental and spiritual aspects of this level of the universe we call Supremacy. And one of those with which we have some experience is the difference between so-called male and female, or passive and aggressive, or yin vs. yang. In studying the relationship between our Creator Son and our Creative Spirit, we find a pattern for these differences and better yet, a _reason_ for them. In _My Fair Lady_, Professor Higgins moans “Why can’t a woman be more like a man?” Apparently, according to the pattern established by our Creative deities, the universe answer is “She’s not supposed to be!” 

We can start with their origins. The Creator Son and Creative Spirit are associated in a unique way from the moment of their creation. “_When a Creator Son is personalized by the Universal Father and the Eternal Son, then does the Infinite Spirit individualize a new and unique representation of himself to accompany this Creator Son to the realms of space, there to be his companion, first in physical organization and, later, in creation and ministry to the creatures of the newly projected universe._” <a id="a41_505"></a>[[UB 34:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p0_1)] The Creator Son and Creative Spirit have a personal relationship from the very beginning. 

In the growth and fulfillment of finite actualization of timespace potential within a local universe, the Creator Son and the Creative Spirit MUST function together. He is limited by space, she by time, but “. . . _when these two function in administrative union, they are practically independent of time and space within the confines of their local creation. Therefore, as practically observed throughout a local universe, the Creator Son and the Creative Spirit usually function independently of both time and space since there is always available to each the time and space liberation of the other._” <a id="a43_604"></a>[[UB 34:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p3_6)] The fact is, neither could fulfill their role in the growth of Supremacy without the other. 

And they do grow and evolve simultaneously along with their creation. From page 1272 of _The Urantia Book_: “_In the local universes even the Creators evolve: The presence of the Conjoint Actor evolves from a living power focus to the status of the divine personality of a Universe Mother Spirit; the Creator Son evolves from the nature of existential Paradise divinity to the experiential nature of supreme sovereignty._” <a id="a45_423"></a>[[UB 116:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p4_8)] These Creative Deities represent two extremes of consciousness within the Supreme Mind. The Creator Son is highly personal: “. . . _each is unique, diverse, exclusive, and original in nature as well as in personality._” <a id="a45_689"></a>[[UB 21:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/21#p2_10)] 

On the other hand, although the Creative Spirit is also unique, _The Urantia Book_ describes her as “. . ._group conscious of destiny._” <a id="a47_137"></a>[[UB 17:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/17#p6_4)] It seems that as he grows from individual personality expression to the group consciousness gained by the experience of living the lives of his creatures, she moves from group consciousness and expression to a more individual personality expression. They grow together but from opposite ends of the spectrum of personal consciousness and expression in the Supreme. 

We find these opposite types of consciousness in mortals, both a more individual personality expression and a more groupconscious expression. On Urantia, although each displays qualities of both types of consciousness, men, or yangs, tend to display a more aggressive individual personality expression, and women, or yins, tend to be more group conscious, “family” oriented. This may be the source of “women’s intuition”—an awareness at some level of mind of the mindedness of others. 

I would like to avoid using the terms male/female, aggressive/ passive, etc. because we have too many negative associations with some of these words, and I am really talking about a quality that pervades the realm of Supremacy at all levels, including mind and spirit. However, since I quote extensively from _The Urantia Book_, I’m limited at those times by the book’s terms. I would prefer to use the terms yin and yang to describe these two universe qualities which must be in balance. 

This is the Tai Chi, the symbol of universe balance used in Eastern religions. And please note two important aspects here. Each contains something of the other, and they are totally equal and coordinate. Frankly, I can’t think of a better symbol for the duality of the Supreme as expressed in the relationship of the Creator Son and Creative Spirit.

## The Differences Are Necessary 

Why are two such different views of reality so necessary? Try this experiment. Stare straight ahead for a moment, and without moving your head, cover one eye with your hand. Now, not only are you seeing only about half of what you saw before, you have lost the ability to see the image in the reality of three dimensions. You can have no depth of perspective. Anyone without the ability to use binocular vision, and I’ve known someone like that, is denied a driver’s license, for obvious reasons. The same problem of spatial reality arises when there is a severe hearing loss on one side. And these examples represent just the physical side of a relationship that actually extends into the mental and spiritual realities. 

_The Urantia Book_ tells us that “_The differences of nature, reaction, viewpoint, and thinking between men and women, far from occasioning concern, should be regarded as highly beneficial to mankind, both individually and collectively. . . .Such dual associations greatly multiply versatility and overcome inherent limitations,. . ._” <a id="a63_336"></a>[[UB 84:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p6_5)] The book then goes on to point out that these differences will persist through the local and superuniverse ascensions. They will disappear during the Havona experience and reappear again on Paradise and in the Corps of the Finality. It’s as though this duality is a mark of our being children of the Supreme. We are simply following a pattern of Supremacy laid down for us by our Creator Son and Creative Spirit. 

## Dual Aspects of Consciousness 

This duality as expressed by the Creator Son and Spirit may also be applied to the consciousness of entire planets. The Urantia races are considered sons of God and as such are highly individual persons. We are a Father-fusion world; the Adjusters are seeking union with unique personalities who are evolving toward the consciousness of relationships, the group consciousness required for the growth of Supremacy. Our progression through the universe will be quite involved with our “socialization” and ability to work with groups of diverse types of beings. We will need to acquire more of the nature of the mindedness of our Creative Mother Spirit. 

Now let us consider those mortals who fuse with a fragment of our Creative Mother Spirit. The inhabitants of such worlds are mortal, as we are, and will ascend through the local universe as we do. However, with few exceptions, they remain in the local universe as its permanent citizens. I would suggest that their personality develops as does that of the Creative Spirit, from group consciousness toward personal expression. I have always theorized that Ellanora of Panoptia was able to prevent a single soul from her planet being lost during the Lucifer rebellion because of the function of a group consciousness on her world, a planetary mind circuit. Perhaps Ellanora’s leadership indicates that she was a more individually personalized member of her race and therefore able to exert her influence more strongly through the planetary mind circuit. I cannot imagine such an event occurring on Urantia with its highly individualized minds. In our society we are only beginning to realize how important group awareness and cooperation will be to our planetary future. 

## Attributes of the Creative Spirit 

Have you ever felt sorry for these Spirit-fused mortals because they will not reach Paradise or the Corps of the Finality? They will never venture into the outer space levels as we will. I used to feel sorry for them, but after a closer study of the nature of our Creative Spirit, I no longer do. In fact, I think they may well feel sorry for us. 

To understand this, we have to realize the attributes of our Creative Mother Spirit. She is the local universe control center of all energies, physical (including life), mental, and spiritual. She is the stabilizer of Nebadon; her presence defines it. She is the communications center of Nebadon; all circuits go through her, even Michael’s Spirit of Truth. Her consciousness IS the consciousness of Nebadon. The book tells us that we will find the Supreme all at once, as a group. Thus, if group consciousness defines the Supreme, it would seem that her spirit-fused children are the perfect choice to remain and stabilize the realm of Supremacy. And it may be in their very nature to want to stay, just as it seems to be in ours to want to leave “home” in search of adventure. 

In her book, _Gift of the Sea_, Anne Morrow Lindbergh talks about the beautiful image of a woman as the still axis within a revolving wheel of relationships, obligations, and activities. She says: “…to be a woman is to have interests and duties, raying out in all directions from the central mother-core, like spokes from the hub of a wheel. The pattern of our lives is essentially circular. We must be open to all points of the compass; husband, children, friends, home, community; stretched out, exposed, sensitive like a spider’s web to each breeze that blows, to each call that comes.” It is in the very nature of our Mother Spirit, through her control of the physical, mindal, and spiritual circuits to be constantly aware of all of us, of the slightest breezes in our lives, and to provide a stable, nurturing environment for us, a universe home, if you will. At least in this universe age, our Creative Mother Spirit’s activities seem well-defined. 

## Future Stages of Growth 

Currently, our creative deities have passed through the first stages of universe formation. In perfect coordinate action they have created the physical planets and life forms of Nebadon and established a pattern of perfect cooperation and perfect co-dependency. Michael has completed his seven bestowals, and our Mother Spirit has grown to full personality recognition. They will continue to function together in this state for an age to come. But then what happens? 

In regard to the relationship of the Creator Son and Creative Spirit and their destiny, _The Urantia Book_ says: “. . . _sometime in the far-distant future, in the now mobilizing universes of outer space, we believe that the liaison between a sevenfold Master Son and a seventh-stage Creative Spirit may attain to absonite levels of service._” <a id="a83_344"></a>[[UB 21:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/21#p6_3)] We know that in the present universe age “_The Universe Mother Spirit…never leaves the local universe headquarters world_. . .” <a id="a83_516"></a>[[UB 34:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p4_7)] However, from page 635 “_If the Creator Sons are destined to the outer universes, the Divine Ministers will undoubtedly accompany them._” <a id="a83_698"></a>[[UB 55:10.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p10_11)] This is an eternal partnership. 

The book also describes how this will be accomplished. In the discussion of the local universe stage of light and life on page 634 “_On attaining this fourth stage of development the Creator Son becomes administratively free; the Divine Minister is progressively blending her ministry with that of the superuniverse Master Spirit and the Infinite Spirit._” <a id="a85_357"></a>[[UB 55:10.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p10_9)] 

As Michael becomes administratively free, she is also freeing herself of her control over the energy and mind circuits of the local universe: “_At the same time new status would be imparted to all orders of permanent citizenship, such as Material Sons, univitatia, midsoniters, susatia and Spirit-fused mortals._” <a id="a87_314"></a>[[UB 55:10.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p10_10)] Please note that the Spirit-fused mortals are the only mortal representatives of ascending evolutionary sons mentioned in this group. As I just implied, perhaps they are to represent her presence in the future universe age in some undisclosed manner. 

This has important implications because “. . ._the orders of creatures native to the local universes are quite varied. No two are administered or inhabited by dual-origin native beings who are in all respects identical Within any superuniverse, one half of their inherent attributes are quite alike, being derived from the uniform Creative Spirits; the other half vary, being derived from the diversified Creator Sons._” <a id="a89_421"></a>[[UB 21:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/21#p2_10)] I have interpreted this statement to mean that the Spirit-fused mortals are more like each other, planet to planet and universe to universe, than are the Father-fused types of mortals, who vary greatly. And this is important because the book tells us that when the Supreme Being factualizes, the authors of _The Urantia Book_ “. . ._believe that the present demarcations between the seven superuniverses will gradually disappear, and that the entire grand universe will function as a perfected whole._” <a id="a89_970"></a>[[UB 117:7.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p7_15)] Who better than these Spirit-fused mortals to personify the group consciousness of the Supreme to the pilgrims we will send them from the outer space levels? 

## A Cosmic Pattern 

Meanwhile, here on Urantia, as we live out our mortal experiences, we can witness the different natures and expressions of both the Creator Son and the Creative Spirit as we try to balance the yin/yang relationships in our own lives. And _The Urantia Book_ is very clear about the fact that, unlike the perfected relationship between the Creator Son and Creative Spirit, “. . ._the sexes never can hope fully to understand each other._” However, it also says “_Men and women need each other in their morontial and spiritual as well as in their mortal careers….Never, even in the Corps of the Finality, will the creature metamorphose so far as to obliterate the personality trends that humans call male and female; always will they be mutually dependent on co-operation in the solution of perplexing universe problems and in the overcoming of manifold cosmic difficulties._” <a id="a93_874"></a>[[UB 84:6.6-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p6_6)] 

We are experiencing a mortal version of the cosmic pattern set forth by our Creative Deities. To put that into the vernacular of our pop culture, men are from Mars, women are from Venus… and it’s a heavenly arrangement.
