> _Spirit-gravity pull and response thereto operate not only on the universe as a whole but also even between individuals and groups of individuals. There is a spiritual cohesiveness among the spiritual and spiritized personalities of any world, race, nation, or believing group of individuals. There is a direct attractiveness of a spirit nature between spiritually minded persons of like tastes and longings. The term *kindred spirits* is not wholly a figure of speech._ (<a id="a37_474"></a>[UB 7:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/7#p1_6))

Our discernment generally allows us to know if we are in the presence of a person with the same tastes, desires and spiritual affinities. Everything depends on our spiritual evolution. Of course, our past experiences are there to guide us, but it is the experience that we have acquired with the help of our Thought Adjuster that will be of the greatest service to us in these exchanges between people with spiritual affinities;

I think that we can consider these exchanges as a foretaste of the epochs of light and life that await the evolutionary worlds (only on the mental and spiritual levels). After all, what is most important in our ascending career is the exchanges between personalities, intellectual and spiritual exchanges. In a somewhat more distant future, exchanges between morontia and spiritual personalities will be quite possible, especially after the passage of the first Mansion Worlds.

“_Will is the manifestation of the human mind that allows subjective consciousness to express itself objectively and experience the phenomenon of aspiring to be like God._” (<a id="a43_174"></a>[UB 130:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p2_10)). We can consider that will is the logical continuation of free will, which is a gift from the Father. It is through will that our ideas and potentials are transformed into acts. It is up to us to do or not the will of the Father. If our decisions are positive we can aspire to experience the phenomenon of being like God. Deciding through spiritual discernment to follow a spiritual attraction is an act that allows subjective consciousness to express itself positively and objectively. It is simply showing common sense, wisdom, and when this act takes place on the spiritual level, it has cosmic consequences, that is to say long-term consequences, to say the least. See: “_The act of a creature choosing to do the will of the Creator is a cosmic value and has a universal significance to which an unrevealed but omnipresent coordinating force, probably the workings of the ever-expanding action of the Supreme Being, immediately reacts._” (<a id="a43_1164"></a>[UB 117:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p6_4))

Thus, by describing our spiritual experiences to people with the same tastes, the same deep desires and the same affinities of spirit, we are able to derive the greatest satisfaction, for our mutual edification.
