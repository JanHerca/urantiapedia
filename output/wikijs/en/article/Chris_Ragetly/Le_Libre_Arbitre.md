Free will is a characteristic which is common to deities, superhuman personalities, and evolutionary mortals. No other being, force, creator, or agent in the vast universe of universes can interfere in any degree with the absolute sovereignty of human free will operating in the realms of option concerning the eternal destiny of the personality of the choosing mortal. 71.3. This observation is valid for all existing personalities of the central and superuniverses, and it is probable that it will be the same for creatures of the future ultimate and coabsolute levels. It is also probable that certain creatures who function more or less automatically on the finite levels do not possess this attribute. Certain Master Physical Controllers, such as the Frandalanks and the Chronoldeks, do not appear to have free will; they are intelligent beings, but more or less like living machines.

> _The relative free will which characterizes the self-consciousness of human personality is involved in:_
> _1. Moral decision, highest wisdom._
> _2. Spiritual choice, truth discernment._
> _3. Unselfish love, brotherhood service._
> _4. Purposeful co-operation, group loyalty._
> _5. Cosmic insight, the grasp of universe meanings._
> _6. Personality dedication, wholehearted devotion to doing the Father’s will._
> _7. Worship, the sincere pursuit of divine values and the wholehearted love of the divine Value-Giver._ (<a id="a46_107"></a>[UB 16:8.7-14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_7))

This engagement of relative free will is thus activated in 7 specific cases. It must first be noted that the free will of the human personality is relative. This means that it can only exercise its choice within a very specific framework. The scene where the life of a human creature takes place is this relative framework. A human personality does not have the possibility of exercising its choice outside of its earthly life, with the exception of its choice to do the will of the Father, or not to follow this choice. A human personality therefore has the choice of exercising its free will in space only on Urantia, (we can consider that the fact of having walked on the moon and having sent probes to Mars as well as to other planets of our solar system is a kind of enlargement of this choice in space). As for the free will that is exercised in time, the choices of an Urantian have personal consequences of capital importance for this particular Urantian. He can transcend time into the past, by recalling memories, and use these memories to plan future actions. This human creature thus projects himself into the future, transcending time in this way. In effect, he can thus decide his eternal future. By his moral, spiritual decisions, selfless love, group loyalty, cosmic insight, devotion to doing the Father's will, and worship, this Urantian secures for himself an eternal destiny.

Let us develop the seven cases cited in The Urantia Book where human free will is involved:

1. ***Moral Decision, the Highest Wisdom***: We are here shown that the highest wisdom is found in positive moral decisions. This is a consideration not always evident among Urantians, or even among other human personalities on other evolutionary planets.
2. ***The spiritual choice, the discernment of truth***: It is thanks to the Monitor of Mystery and the Spirit of Truth that we discern the truth, with no doubt the help of the Spirit of the Divine Minister and her numerous offspring.
3. ***Selfless love, brotherly service***: From the moment the spiritual choice is made, selfless love is released into brotherly service. And this is the case throughout our evolution, as soon as a phase is mastered, this one, and the previous ones, serve as points of support for the next phase.
4. ***Intentional cooperation, group loyalty***: When a personality, whoever he may be, has been part of a group for years, especially a work group, a certain loyalty is built up towards it, and this loyalty is gradually transformed into sincere love not only towards the group, but also towards each of its members. I am thinking among others of the study groups of the _Urantia Book_. It may be that in the distant future the members of the same study group will find themselves on a morontia world in the universe; what joy and happiness it will be to meet again for new studies and discoveries.
5. ***Cosmic insight, the understanding of universal meanings***: This insight functioning on the cosmic level is acquired only with the aid of the Mystery Monitor, the Spirit of Truth, and the Spirit of the Divine Minister, plus a certain habit of understanding and applying the universal meanings taught to us in the various revelations; for example, when Jesus teaches us how to listen and then grasp the positive in a person, this teaching is valid not only for Urantians but also for all other personalities with whom we will come into contact in the course of our evolution. It is on the mansion worlds that we will fully acquire this understanding of universal meanings, it is: ...the coordination of morontia lamota with human philosophy. It is then that surviving mortals acquire practical clairvoyance in true metaphysics. This is the true introduction to the intelligent understanding of cosmic meanings and universal interrelationships. (<a id="a56_950"></a>[UB 47:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p5_3))
6. ***Consecration of the personality, devotion to doing the Father's will wholeheartedly***: Free will approaches the supreme goal, the personality not only begins to form the habit of doing the Father's will, but this habit becomes an essential need for that personality.
7. ***Worship***, when we sincerely pursue divine values and love with all our heart the divine Giver of Values. It is through a sustained and continuous relationship with the Father, as Jesus demonstrated to us, that we reach the supreme goal of our free will, our love for the Father has become an integral part of our life, we are nourished and have our reason for being in this infinite and eternal love. Divine values are now familiar to us and we put them into practice daily.

The Supreme is influenced by the choices and decisions of evolutionary creatures because: _The spirit presence of divinity is neither capricious nor arbitrary; its experiential variance is inherent in the free will with which personal creatures are endowed._

_That which determines the differential of spirit presence exists in your own heart and mind, and consists in your own choosing, in the decisions of your mind, and in the determination of your own will. This differential is inherent in the free-will reactions of intelligent personal beings, the Universal Father having ordained that such beings should exercise freedom of choice. And the Deities ever faithfully heed the ebb and flow of their spirits in meeting the conditions and fulfilling the demands of this differential in creature choice. Sometimes they bestow more of their presence in response to those who earnestly desire it, sometimes they withdraw from the scene when their creatures make adverse decisions in the exercise of their divinely bestowed freedom of choice. Thus does the spirit of divinity humbly obey the choices of the creatures of the realms._ (<a id="a62_873"></a>[UB 13:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/13#p4_4))
