When the Michael Sons come forth from Paradise to undertake the creation and organization of a universe, they take a solemn oath not to assume full sovereignty of the new creation until seven creature bestowals have been successfully completed and confirmed by the Ancients of Days having jurisdiction over the superuniverse concerned. ([UB 119:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p0_3))

The purpose of these incarnations in creature form is to enable these Creators to become wise, compassionate, just and understanding rulers. They become mercifully benevolent as a result of these successive bestowal experiences. ([UB 119:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p0_4))

Michael of Nebadon made his first bestowal about a billion years ago, lasting twenty years of standard time ([UB 119:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p1_2)). He did so in the likeness of a Melchizedek Son, and completed 24 emergency missions in the Salvington universe. ([UB 119:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p1_4))

A little further on, we can read: [UB 119:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p1_5) “_By universal consent, he became head of the Melchizedeks because he won our love and adoration by his incomparable wisdom, his supreme love and his splendid dedication to his duties. He loved us, he understood us, he served with us and we are forever his loyal and devoted fellow Melchizedeks..._” For this first outpouring, Michael fulfills the unified will of the Father, the Son and the Spirit. ([UB 119:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p8_4))

The second bestowal of Michael was in the likeness of a primary Lanonandek Son of Nebadon. Michael replaced a system ruler who had gone into rebellion. That system, Palonia, mourned the passing of the noblest and most benevolent system ruler Nebadon had ever known. He was beloved throughout the system and adored by his fellows.

of all groups of Lanonandek Sons. Even his misguided predecessor sent him the following message: “_You are just and upright in all your ways. Although I continue to reject the rule of Paradise, I am forced to confess that you are a fair and merciful administrator._” ([UB 119:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p2_6))

In this second outpouring, Michael revealed the will of the Father and the Son ([UB 119:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p8_4))

The third bestowal of Michael was in the likeness of a Material Son (an Adam), and took the function of a planetary prince of world 217 quarantined following the second systemic rebellion of Nebadon, (system 87 of constellation 61) (1312).

The author of this booklet (No. 119), describing the bestowals of ChristMichael is Gavalia, the chief of the Evening Stars of Nebadon ([UB 119:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p0_1)), he regrets not being authorized to relate the patience, fortitude, and skill with which this Material Son met the trying situations on this troubled planet. ([UB 119:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p3_5) and [UB 119:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p3_6))

In this third outpouring, Michael revealed the will of the Father and the Spirit ([UB 119:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p8_4))

Michael's fourth bestowal was in the likeness of a seraph of the highest order of angels of a local universe, and was assigned to the Corps of Teaching Counselors. ([UB 119:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p4_2)). His mission lasted 40 years of standard universe time. He worked on 22 different worlds. His last mission was to assist and aid in his bestowal, a Trinity Teacher Son. In this fourth bestowal, Michael revealed the will of the Son and the Spirit. ([UB 119:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p8_4))

The fifth bestowal of Michael was in the similitude of an ascending pilgrim under the name of Eventod. He sojourned on Uversa, the capital of Orvonton, our superuniverse, for eleven years of standard time. He received the assignments and performed the duties of a mortal spirit being. In every way he was tempted and tested, he proved himself worthy of the confidence of his superiors, and commanded the respect and loyal admiration of his spirit companions. ([UB 119:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p5_2)) In this fifth bestowal Michael lived out the will of the Conjoint Actor. ([UB 119:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p8_4))

The sixth bestowal of Michael was in the likeness of a morontia mortal at the headquarters of the 5th Constellation, Endantum, the author states that this was one of the most extraordinary and astounding epochs in Michael's bestowal experience. When Michael returned from this morontia bestowal, it was evident to all of us that he had become one of our fellows, that the universe ruler was also the friend and compassionate helper of even the humblest forms of created intelligence in his realms. (1315:6 and [UB 119:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p6_4)) In the sixth bestowal as a morontia mortal he lived out the will of the Eternal Son. ([UB 119:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p8_4))

The seventh outpouring is described in more detail in the first part of this article.

Michael's character and personality are described very succinctly in the first four bestowals, but in the fifth and sixth, which are the stages that will concern us immediately after Jerusem, there is no information that can help us understand Michael's character, except in its broad outlines. Michael as Jesus, Son of Man, shows us a total, complete and perfect personality; his character is completely balanced and always up to the occasion. As the Son of God (that is to say, the Creator Son) The Urantia Book describes him to us in all his divinity, but it is much more difficult to grasp his personality and character during his first six bestowals. It seems that his power of adaptation to the different personalities that he represents in his bestowals is total, for example, when he is a Melchizedek, he is a perfect being of this order, since he becomes their leader etc...

But there is one more mystery that concerns him, here it is [UB 48:6.26](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p6_26) “_...if your own mind does not serve you well, you can exchange it for the mind of Jesus of Nazareth, which always serves you well._” Can we take advantage of this astonishing exchange to keep a little of the character of Jesus within us?
