There are doubtless several reasons why the archangels established a divisional quarter on Urantia.

They are not made known to us. But we can speculate.

For example :

1. One reason is probably that Urantia is the planet that hosted Michael of Nebadon during his seventh and final bestowal.
2. Urantia being a decimal planet, and relatively still very young from the physical, mental and spiritual point of view, it is perhaps appropriate that a divisional headquarters of the archangels be located there, if only to be on hand during the great natural catastrophes which occur there, such as that of last December 26 in South Asia (there have been more catastrophic ones in the past). One of the missions of the archangels is: “_...they are devoted to the work of creature survival and to the advancement of the ascending careers of the mortals of time and space..._” ([UB 37:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p3_2)) and also: “_...This immense group of record keepers is engaged in updating the curriculum of every mortal of time from the moment of ***birth*** through his career in the local universe until he leaves Salvington for the superuniverse regime or is ”erased from recorded existence“ by order of the Ancients of Days._” ([UB 37:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p3_7)) and also: “***During the transit of surviving mortals between their worlds of origin and the mansion worlds***, _whether their personalities have been reconstituted in the third period or are ascending at the time of a mass resurrection, ***their personality data*** are faithfully preserved by the archangels on their worlds of special activity. ***The archangels are not the preservers of personality*** (as guardian angels preserve the soul) but it is nonetheless true ***that every identifiable factor of personality is effectively preserved in the custody of these faithful repositories of the elements of human survival***. As to the exact location of the mortal personality during the intermediate period between death and survival, we do not know._” ([UB 112:5.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_15))

I am sure that there are many other reasons for the existence of this divisional headquarters of the archangels on Urantia. As to the importance of the fact of its existence on Urantia, The Urantia Book points it out to us, but without giving us its real significance, I believe because it is for us to discover it in the Book. See this quotation: “Do you grasp the significance of the fact that your humble, confused planet has become a divisional headquarters for the administration of the universe and the direction of certain archangelic activities relating to the Paradise ascension plan? ***This undoubtedly foreshadows that <ins>further ascension activities</ins> are to be concentrated on the bestowal world of Michael, and it gives a stupendous and solemn importance to the Master's personal promise: ”<ins>I will come again.</ins>" ...*** ([UB 37:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p3_4))

What are these ascension activities that will be linked to the existence of this divisional headquarters of the archangels on Urantia? I believe that we must here completely get rid of our mortal notion of time. These “other activities” can only occur in a time frame that can only be located in a fairly considerable number of years, several million, one can also think that the personal promise of the Master “I will return” could inaugurate such activities. At this distant time, it is not impossible that Urantia will be reestablished in the normal cosmic circuits and that the affair of Lucifer \& Co, has long been closed. It is also not impossible that these “ascension activities” have to do with the ascension plan of terrestrial escape of mortals of the modified secondary ascension orders ([UB 49:6.15-17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p6_15)) and mortals of the modified primary ascension order [UB 49:6.18-22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p6_18). As it can also be activities of which we have no idea.
