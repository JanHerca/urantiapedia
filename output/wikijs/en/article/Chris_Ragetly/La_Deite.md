In The Urantia Book, the term “Deity” is applied to various divine personalities, whether single, existential associate, or experiential associate, but the term can also refer to non-divine personalities. In the introduction, a Divine Counselor points out several levels on which total Deity functions.

> _The term God always denotes *personality.* Deity may, or may not, refer to divinity personalities._ ([UB 0:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p2_10))

> _DEITY is personalizable as God, is prepersonal and superpersonal in ways not altogether comprehensible by man. Deity is characterized by the quality of unity—actual or potential—on all supermaterial levels of reality; and this unifying quality is best comprehended by creatures as divinity._ ([UB 0:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p1_2))

_Deity functions on the personal, prepersonal and superpersonal levels_ [UB 0:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p1_3). The personal level is understandable to us, God is a person. The prepersonal level is that of the Mystery Monitors. The superpersonal level is undoubtedly linked to certain realities other than personal and prepersonal that our finite mind has great difficulty in grasping. Note that we are talking about total functional Deity.

_The Total Deity is functional on the following seven levels:_

1. _Static — Self-contained and self-existent Deity._ This is the level on which God was alone, without Son or Spirit, he was not yet the Universal Father of anyone or anything.
2. _Potential — Deity willing itself and having its purpose in itself._ At this moment, God potentially possesses all future realities.
3. _Associative — Deity personalized in itself and divinely fraternal._ God is now the personalized Father. He fraternizes with his Eternal Son.
4. _Creative — Self-distributive and divinely revealed Deity._ God the Universal Father creates his various Sons, including the Creator Sons, bestows personality on a multitude of creatures, and is capable of fragmenting himself by bestowing his Mystery Monitors on mortal creatures. He delegates much of his functions to other deities such as the Eternal Son, the Infinite Spirit, the Creator Sons, etc. He reveals himself through the ministry of his Eternal Son, the Infinite Spirit, and his many other divine Sons.
5. _Evolutionary—Self-expansive and creature-identified Deity._ Such as God the Supreme.
6. _Supreme — Self-experiential Deity and unifying the creature with the Creator. Deity functioning on the first level of identification with the creature as the supercontroller of grand universe space-time and sometimes referred to as the Deity Supremacy._ Such as the Supreme Being.
7. _Ultimate — A self-projecting, space-time transcending Deity. Omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent Deity. Deity functioning on the second level of expression of unifying divinity as the effective supercontroller and absonite sustainer of the master universe. Compared to the ministry of the Deities to the grand universe, this absonite function in the master universe is equivalent to the universal supercontrol and supersustainer sometimes referred to as the Ultimacy of Deity._ God the Ultimate is the only example. [UB 0:1.3-10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p1_3)

There is a level of personalization of Deity which is called _God the Sevenfold_, this associative Deity functions on the levels of space-time. _This sevenfold Deity which, for the creatures of finite space-time, personalizing in its time the power in the Supreme Being, is the functional Deity of the evolutionary mortal creatures of the Paradise ascension career_ [UB 0:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p8_9). _To compensate for the finite character of the creatures' status and to overcome their limitations of concept, the Universal Father has established for the evolutionary creatures a sevenfold approach to Deity._

Here is the composition of this Deity:

1. The Creator Sons of Paradise.
2. The Ancients of Days.
3. The Seven Master Spirits.
4. The Supreme Being.
5. God the Spirit.
6. God the Son.
7. God the Father.

This associative Deity concerns us directly, for it is the ladder which enables us to cross and climb the many stages of our evolutionary career. We do not know whether among the Creator Sons it is only the 700,000 Sons who are at the head of the 700,000 local universes of the 7 superuniverses or whether it is all the Creator Sons who continue to be created beyond the figure of 700,000.

We begin our evolutionary career through the ministry of our Creator Son, Michael of Nebadon. He represents to us the first link in this sevenfold chain of Deity. As we advance through the various sectors of Orvonton, we will enjoy the direct or indirect ministry of the Ancients of Days of Uversa.

We are under the personal influence of the Master Spirit ${ }^º$ 7, the ruler of our Orvonton superuniverse. By this direct influence we bear the characteristic mark of an individuality reminiscent of the ancestral nature of Master Spirit No. 7, and this physical mark of our Orvonton Master Spirit is a part of our material origin. We will live our entire morontia career under the continuing influence of this same Master Spirit, and our subsequent spirit career will never entirely efface the characteristic mark of this supervising Spirit.

It is on the billion worlds of Havona that we will have the opportunity to experience the invisible influence of the Supreme Being. Then on the 5th circuit of Havona we will have the opportunity to understand God the Spirit.

On the 4th circuit of understanding God the Son. And finally on the 3rd circuit of understanding God the Father.

We will thus have had the chance to climb the different stages of this sevenfold Deity who in fact is there for our sole benefit.
