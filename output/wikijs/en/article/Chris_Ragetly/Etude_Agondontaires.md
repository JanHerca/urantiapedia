**Remarks — II — .Agondontaries, Finaliters and Trinitized Sons of Achievement**

(Quotations from _The Urantia Book_ are in italics. To emphasize their importance, some passages have been put in bold.)

Do all agondontaries become Mighty Messengers?

> _When a mortal finaliter is Trinity embraced—becomes a Trinitized Son, such as a Mighty Messenger—then has that finaliter attained destiny, at least for the present universe age. Mighty Messengers and their fellows may not in the exact sense be seventh-stage spirits, but in addition to other things the Trinity embrace endows them with everything which a finaliter will sometime achieve as a seventh-stage spirit. After Spirit-fused or Son-fused mortals are trinitized, they pass through the Paradise experience with the Adjuster-fused ascenders, with whom they are then identical in all matters pertaining to superuniverse administration. These Trinitized Sons of Selection or of Attainment at least for now are finished creatures, in contrast to the finaliters, who are at present unfinished creatures._ (<a id="a45_810"></a>[UB 40:10.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p10_12))

Let us note that the Mighty Messengers are trinitized in classes of 700,000, those High in Authority are trinitized in classes of 70,000 and those Deprived of Name and Number are trinitized in classes of 7,000. Let us note in passing that: <a id="a47_240"></a>[UB 40:10.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p10_12) _These Trinitized Sons of Selection or Attainment are, at least for the moment, completed creatures, in contrast to the finaliters who are currently unfinished creatures._

To become a Mighty Messenger, one must first be an agondontary. But must the latter exercise loyalty in the face of rebellion in his local universe of origin, in material or morontia form, or can he exercise this loyalty in his superuniverse (i.e., in other local universes) during his ascending spiritual career? It is not on Havona or on Paradise that an ascending pilgrim can become an agondontary, for these two cosmic realities are perfect, imperfection cannot exist there.

It is likely that many agondontars become Mighty Messengers. But not all, Tabamantia always has the status of finaliter. See:

> On Jerusem the ascenders from these isolated worlds occupy a residential sector by themselves and are known as the *agondonters,* meaning evolutionary will creatures who can believe without seeing, persevere when isolated, and triumph over insuperable difficulties even when alone. This functional grouping of the agondonters persists throughout the ascension of the local universe and the traversal of the superuniverse; it disappears during the sojourn in Havona but promptly reappears upon the attainment of Paradise and definitely persists in the Corps of the Mortal Finality. Tabamantia is an *agondonter* of finaliter status, having survived from one of the quarantined spheres involved in the first rebellion ever to take place in the universes of time and space. (<a id="a53_774"></a>[UB 50:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p7_2))

When we pass through our local system, there is a good chance that we will occupy a separate residential sector on Jerusem, since we will be classified as agondontaries, and that this classification persists throughout Orvonton, to disappear in Havona, where our evolution is only on a personal level and where we will not be part of an ascending group. Once classified as residents on Paradise, we will again be classified as agondontaries.

Mortals who have acted loyally in the face of the rebellion are therefore destined to become

Mighty Messengers. These mortals are agondontaries before becoming Mighty Messengers.

> _Every ascendant mortal of insurrectionary experience who functions loyally in the face of rebellion is eventually destined to become a Mighty Messenger of the superuniverse service. Likewise is any ascendant creature who effectively prevents such upheavals of error, evil, or sin; for action designed to prevent rebellion or to effect higher types of loyalty in a universe crisis is regarded as of even greater value than loyalty in the face of actual rebellion._ (<a id="a61_468"></a>[UB 22:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/22#p2_3))

In the following passage The Urantia Book tells us that among the last group of pilgrims admitted into the order of the Mighty Messengers, this included pilgrims from Nebadon:

> _The senior Mighty Messengers were chosen from those ascendant mortals of time and space who were among the earlier Paradise arrivals, many having traversed Havona in the times of Grandfanda. But the first trinitizing of Mighty Messengers was not effected until the candidate corps contained representatives from each of the seven superuniverses. And the last group of this order to qualify on Paradise embraced ascendant pilgrims from the local universe of Nebadon._ (<a id="a65_471"></a>[UB 22:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/22#p2_4))

Let us note in passing that the universe of Nebadon has been home to evolutionary mortal creatures for 200 billion years: See <a id="a67_126"></a>[UB 57:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p3_10) _200 billion years ago, the contraction and condensation of Andronover progressed with an enormous generation of heat in its central cluster, or nuclear mass. Relative space appeared even in the regions neighboring the central mother wheel. The outer regions became more stable and better organized;_ ***some planets revolving around the newborn suns had cooled sufficiently to be suitable for the implantation of life. The oldest inhabited planets of Nebadon date from this time.*** This may give an indication of the time it takes to reach Paradise (200 billion Urantia years).

> _Mighty Messengers are embraced by the Paradise Trinity in classes of seven hundred thousand, one hundred thousand for assignment to each superuniverse. Almost one trillion Mighty Messengers are commissioned on Uversa, and there is every reason to believe that the number serving in each of the seven superuniverses is exactly the same._ (<a id="a69_341"></a>[UB 22:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/22#p2_5))

This makes 7 thousand billion Mighty Messengers functioning in the 7 superuniverses. It must be remembered that the Mighty Messengers all come from universes that have experienced one or more rebellions. It therefore seems that if rebellions are not commonplace, it is nonetheless true that this happens from time to time, given the fairly large number of Mighty Messengers, not to mention all the agondontaries who are currently in the process of ascension.

At first glance it seems rather curious that agondontaries from Nebadon should already be admitted into the order of the Mighty Messengers (to be an agondontary one must have resisted rebellion in some way, and all the Mighty Messengers seem to have come from the group of agondontaries), for it may be thought that it is only on one's universe of origin that one can become an agondontary. The other consideration which comes into play is the length of time it takes to reach Paradise, not to mention the length of time it takes to be admitted into the Corps of the Finality before one is even admitted into the order of the Mighty Messengers. Now, we know that the first rebellion that took place in Nebadon happened 850 million years ago (this period of time does not seem to us to be sufficient to go through the different stages of the local universe, the superuniverse, the billion worlds of Havona, and the long instruction of Paradise before even becoming part of the Corps of the Finality), see (<a id="a73_1005"></a>[UB 119:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p1_1) and <a id="a73_1053"></a>[UB 119:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p2_1)), initially, it therefore seems logical to think that the first agondontaries of Nebadon appeared at this time. But, The Urantia Book teaches us that the oldest inhabited planets of Nebadon date back 200 billion years (<a id="a73_1316"></a>[UB 57:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p3_10)).

This period of time seems to us much more suitable to allow the pilgrim to go through all the stages mentioned above, but it comes up against the fact that there were no agondontars on Nebadon before 850 million years ago. We believe we can explain this contradiction: in fact, The Urantia Book says:

> _Mighty Messengers belong to the ascendant group of the Trinitized Sons. They are a class of perfected mortals who have been rebellion tested or otherwise equally proved as to their personal loyalty; all have passed through some definite test of universe allegiance. At some time in their Paradise ascent they stood firm and loyal in the face of the disloyalty of their superiors, and some did actively and loyally function in the places of such unfaithful leaders._ (<a id="a77_470"></a>[UB 22:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/22#p2_1))

The Urantia Book lets us understand that one can become an agondontar somewhere other than in one's universe of origin (***at a given moment of their ascension...***) so we must face the facts: a pilgrim can perfectly well, during his ascension, find himself on an evolutionary sphere in rebellion, or on the capital of a system not part of his universe of origin (as was doubtless the case for students visiting Satania at the time of Lucifer's rebellion). (<a id="a79_459"></a>[UB 48:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p3_10))...Student visitors are permitted to go to all inhabited planets, even if isolated., and (<a id="a79_593"></a>[UB 114:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p5_5)) Each administrative day on Urantia begins with a consultative conference attended by the general government, the planetary chief of the archangels, the Most High Observer, the supervising supernaphim, the chief of the resident Life Carriers, and invited guests from among the high universe Sons or from among certain student visitors then sojourning on the planet.***

This gives the student visitor full latitude to give his or her point of view and, if necessary, to act or appeal to the appropriate authority.

All this demonstrates that the possibilities of acting accordingly in the face of one or more rebellions during our ascension through our superuniverse is a possibility that should not be ruled out.
