Why am I assailed by doubts and uncertainties?
It seems to me that the others don't have any, or at least not as many.
How can I strengthen my faith and make it a habit?

I tried meditation, yoga and what else,
but they all left me hanging, with a bitter taste.

Why finally this incessant quest?
Do I have to search endlessly?
Who will show me the way?

Is it that burning spark
what are we talking about here or there?
Is this hearsay?

And yet she insists,
I feel it well, she persists,
constantly putting myself back in step,
even if I stumble and turn.

Maybe one day I will feel safe.
But then, who will tell me?
Is it that spark that beats inside me?

I hear her, she's knocking on my door,
I have to open it for him.
