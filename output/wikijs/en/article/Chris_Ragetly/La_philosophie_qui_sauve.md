> _The Father desires all his creatures to be in personal communion with him. He has on Paradise a place to receive all those whose survival status and spiritual nature make possible such attainment. Therefore settle in your philosophy now and forever: To each of you and to all of us, God is approachable, the Father is attainable, the way is open; the forces of divine love and the ways and means of divine administration are all interlocked in an effort to facilitate the advancement of every worthy intelligence of every universe to the Paradise presence of the Universal Father._ ([UB 5:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p1_8))

The Divine Counselor who makes this statement is careful to say that the Father is approachable and accessible to each of us mortals, but also to all the other creatures who populate the universes of time and space. The Father is no exception to anyone. This place in Paradise reserved for each of us exists. During our evolutionary ascension, we will have to live and work on a multitude of spheres, each more different from the other, and on each of these spheres, starting with the world of houses No. 1, we have our place, and this place exists. It is up to us to choose whether we will one day occupy these places. The way is open. Let us show ourselves worthy of the trust that the Father has placed in us.

> _The fact that vast time is involved in the attainment of God makes the presence and personality of the Infinite none the less real. Your ascension is a part of the circuit of the seven superuniverses, and though you swing around it countless times, you may expect, in spirit and in status, to be ever swinging inward. You can depend upon being translated from sphere to sphere, from the outer circuits ever nearer the inner center, and some day, doubt not, you shall stand in the divine and central presence and see him, figuratively speaking, face to face. It is a question of the attainment of actual and literal spiritual levels; and these spiritual levels are attainable by any being who has been indwelt by a Mystery Monitor, and who has subsequently eternally fused with that Thought Adjuster._ ([UB 5:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p1_9))

When in a prodigiously distant day we find ourselves face to face with the Father, this encounter will forever change our future eternal life. Of course we cannot imagine what this divine meeting will be like or what it will really mean, but already we feel a spiritual emotion that makes us dream, we the tiny mortals of Urantia. All our efforts are for the moment directed towards the next stage, that of our fusion with our Mystery Monitor. This is the condition for one day finding ourselves face to face with the Father.

> _Although the approach to the Paradise presence of the Father must await your attainment of the highest finite levels of spirit progression, you should rejoice in the recognition of the ever-present possibility of immediate communion with the bestowal spirit of the Father so intimately associated with your inner soul and your spiritualizing self._ ([UB 5:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p1_3))

> _The inability of the finite creature to approach the infinite Father is inherent, not in the Father’s aloofness, but in the finiteness and material limitations of created beings. The magnitude of the spiritual difference between the highest personality of universe existence and the lower groups of created intelligences is inconceivable. Were it possible for the lower orders of intelligence to be transported instantly into the presence of the Father himself, they would not know they were there. They would there be just as oblivious of the presence of the Universal Father as where they now are. There is a long, long road ahead of mortal man before he can consistently and within the realms of possibility ask for safe conduct into the Paradise presence of the Universal Father. Spiritually, man must be translated many times before he can attain a plane that will yield the spiritual vision which will enable him to see even any one of the Seven Master Spirits._ ([UB 5:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p1_1))

Having the opportunity to commune now with the bestowed spirit of the Father, our Mystery Monitor, is an opportunity that should be seized as often as possible. Consider how Jesus engaged in such a practice daily. If we cannot live the life of Jesus, we should instead draw inspiration from Him and try to live our lives as each of us thinks we can do them best. If our Mystery Monitor is so intimately associated with our soul and our spiritualizing self, it is only natural that we should try to communicate with our divine associate whenever the opportunity arises.
