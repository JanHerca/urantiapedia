> “I admonish you ever to remember that your mission among men is to proclaim the gospel of the kingdom ...You are to go forth preaching the love of God and the service of man.” [[UB 193:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p0_4)].

Dear reader, you have likely heard or read by now about the beginning steps towards the formation of The Spiritual Fellowship. Meredith Sprunger and I are so very pleased and privileged to be co-founding this religious organization.

Over 40 volunteers are dedicated to building this vision into a viable organization. Meredith and I invite you and hope that you will join the ranks of this historic endeavor. The Spiritual Fellowship (_TSF_) is dedicated to serving all people in their growing relationship with God. TSF embraces the philosophy of living that boldly dares to suggest that active living faith in the Loving Parenthood of God and the spiritual kinship of all people is the purpose of living and the supreme reality. TSF will be a structure that supports those wishing to leaven this dark planet by proclaiming the Gospel of God's personal and intimate love and the good news of our eternal salvation potential.

TSF encourages the building of local faith-families worldwide where God is celebrated, children are raised in community, seekers are invited to share in this spiritual life of hope, love and service, and members are inspired to become kingdom builders. TSF is answering Jesus“ mandate: ”I admonish you ever to remember that your mission among men is to proclaim the gospel of the kingdom ... You are to go forth preaching the love of God and the service of man" [[UB 193:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p0_4)].

There are many who criticize our efforts. Many have sincerely expressed doubt that this is the right time in Urantia history to develop and initiate a religious organization like The Spiritual Fellowship. Most have valid concerns that are important to dialogue upon. I ask you who sincerely seek to do God's will, give us the 2-3 year projected development time. See what TSF becomes before you judge. Some of the critics against TSF are simply lazy and do not wish to be kingdom builders. They look back in history and say, “It can't be done because it's never been done before.” Yet, with God all things are possible. Others suggest that there are too many problems — “a mountain of obstacles.” This, in my opinion is another cop-out, for: “Difficulty whets the ardor of the truth lover, while obstacles only challenge the exertions of the undaunted kingdom builder.” [[UB 156:5.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_21)] Still others have a personal agenda of maintaining control and use arbitrary excuses such as “The world isn't ready for the Fifth Epochal Revelation” or “No religious institution should ever be organized around the Urantia Papers.” Some have even self-appointed themselves to aggressively thwart such actions in the past. This article is not for them. But for those readers with valid concerns and an open mind, I ask you to spend a moment seriously evaluating TSF: Why Now? Ask yourself the following questions and see what the Spirit of Truth reveals to you.

1. Do you think that Christ Michael would eventually want one religious worldwide faithfamily that, while celebrating diversity, lives in respectful unity here on Urantia? If yes, when do you think he might wish this to happen?
2. In your opinion, does any current world religion or religious organization have the potential to become that unifying factor? If your answer is no,
3. What would be the indicators that it is now time to “construct a new and appealing philosophy of living?” [[UB 2:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p7_10)]
4. Who should determine “the right time?”
5. Once deemed “the right time,” whether today or 15 centuries from now, what are the necessary organizational first steps towards the eventual attainment of a religious faith community that would be capable of proclaiming this gospel?
6. Who are the “right people” and how might these leaders be chosen to begin this historic endeavor?
7. When we investigate the question of whether now is the time to initiate this endeavor, what are the factors that both support this effort and/or discourage it? 
8. Is there qualitative evidence that now is not the right time?
9. We learn, “There is great hope for any church that worships the living God, validates the brotherhood of man, and dares to remove all creedal pressure from its members.” [[UB 103:5.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p5_12)]. If TSF is faithful to this mandate and encouraging religious liberty by removing creedal dictates, then isn't this a promise of hope?
10. Christ tells us: “You are commissioned to preach this gospel of the kingdom... and you must not allow anything to divert your devotion to this one duty. Let all mankind benefit from the overflow of your loving spiritual ministry, enlightening intellectual communion, and uplifting social service; but none of these humanitarian labors, nor all of them, should be permitted to take the place of proclaiming the gospel.” [[UB 178:1.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_11)] Isn't it high time we start proclaiming the gospel?

Finally, dear reader, I challenge you with “Why not?” We cannot fail in attempting to create a noncreedal supportive organization — we fail only if we fail to try now. If it is not God's will to support The Spiritual Fellowship, it will wither on the vine. But wouldn't it be far wiser to side with Gamaliel instead of the Sadducees on this question? Gamaliel said, “Refrain from [thwarting] these men and let them alone, for if this counsel or this work is of men, it will be overthrown; but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them, lest haply you be found even to be fighting against God.” [[UB 194:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p4_10)] We are mandated by our Creator Son through our beloved scriptures to go outside of our own community and boldly proclaim this gospel, “... go you now into all the world preaching this gospel of the kingdom of heaven to all men” ([UB 193:0.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p0_5)).

So when all is said and done, “What do you recommend we do today?” I hope that you feel inspired enough to join us, now, if only to pray that we may clearly discern God's will for The Spiritual Fellowship. If you wish to share thoughts, questions, or would like to help create TSF, please write me personally at: shenrymft@hotmail.com. God bless you!
