Here is an interesting question from our friend Patrice Monsigny published on the AFLUB forum that we are sharing with the sagacity of readers: Your comments or reasoned responses are welcome in the editorial office, they could be published in your next LINK.

Hello everyone

**For physicists and astronomers:**

It’s not easy to replace the big bang with the nuclear island of Paradise or even the “Paradise-Havona” system.

**For geologists and biologists:**

It is difficult to recognize that the origin of life on earth is not the result of chance, but that life was implanted by the “Bearers of life” 500,000 million years ago.

**For paleontologists:**

It is not easy to admit that man is not descended from the monkey born in Africa 300,000 years ago but from the North American lemur which emigrated to Asia 1 million years ago.

**For anthropologists:**

It is not easy to replace Darwinism with sudden and successive mutations of plant and animal life.

**For geneticists:**

After having abolished the notion of race, how can we recognize that there were 6 colored races from the Sangik family 500,000 years ago.

**For demographers and eugenicists:**

Must we perpetuate ourselves without any control, even if it means drowning the earth with human beings, when The Urantia Book asks us to practice eugenics!

**For the Catholic religion:**

How can we admit that the glorified Christ is not the 2nd person of the trinity, but Christ Michael of Nebadon with the seven outpourings.

.... Neither science nor religion alone can ever hope to arrive, in and of themselves, at an adequate understanding of universal truths and relationships without being guided by human philosophy and illuminated by divine revelation. <a id="a69_233"></a>[UB 103:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p6_5)

Brotherly friendship
