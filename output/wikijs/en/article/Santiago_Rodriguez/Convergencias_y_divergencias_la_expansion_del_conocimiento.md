A year ago now, in [Luz y Vida nº 41](/en/article/Santiago_Rodriguez/Convergencias_y_divergencias_la_agricultura), we recalled the importance at a social level and of evolution in the human being that agriculture has had, and how science has been finding traces of it in times closer and closer to the activities of Adam and Eve 38,000 years ago.

The different scientific findings should take us even further back in time, bringing us closer to the arrival of the Planetary Prince 500,000 years ago. But we have to give our investigators time.

Led by Harvard University and in collaboration with the Institute of Evolutionary Biology, which is a joint center of Pompeu Fabra University (UPF) and the CSIC, they have carried out the first large-scale analysis of the genome of ancient human remains from the East near, and with this analysis they have been able to shed light on the genetic identities and migrations of the first farmers detected on our planet. (Study published in the magazine “_Nature_” on July 25, 2016).

_Genomic analysis of Andamanese provides insights into ancient human migration into Asia and adaptation_

In this study, they have found three genetically different farming populations that lived in the Near East area (Iran, Turkey, and the Israel-Jordan area) between 14,000 and 3,400 years ago.

Scholars of the subject have been perplexed and cannot find a way to explain the fact that it seems that what was shared was the knowledge of agriculture by different areas, and yet there was no mixture of individuals. They expected that knowledge of the advanced technique of agriculture would have been achieved within a community and over time, as individuals mixed with others from other areas, knowledge would expand as it giving the racial mix.

This, which has puzzled scholars of the subject, does not surprise us, since after reading paper 68, more specifically <a id="a55_119"></a>[UB 68:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p5_9), they indicate that both the Planetary Prince, our controversial Caligastia, and Adam and Eve made an effort to greatly for teaching the superior techniques related to this activity, among many other things.

_The Urantia Book_ explains to us that the teaching of agriculture was not only not invented by the natives of the planet, but that they were superior techniques taught little by little both by the entourage of the Planetary Prince and by Adam and Eve. He also tells us about the teaching dissemination method, which consisted of preparing the different human groups. For this, the most appropriate individuals were prepared to send them back to their places of origin, which favors and explains precisely what keeps our current researchers surprised, because in this way knowledge is spread by the different groups before it the groups themselves mix biologically.

On this occasion, _The Urantia Book_ gives a logical explanation to what our researchers found. Another question is that researchers can assume what is indicated in _The Urantia Book_ as logical.
