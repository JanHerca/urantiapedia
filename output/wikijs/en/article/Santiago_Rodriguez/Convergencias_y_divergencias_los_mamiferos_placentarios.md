One of the most controversial issues that we have with the UB is that of the dates. The developers have insisted on “bombarding” us with an endless number of them and science, in its observational fluctuations, brings us closer to and further away from them.

Despite the limitations of disclosure, I tend to think that the data provided to us by the developers should be fairly close to reality. Nor would it make sense to give us information knowing that it is totally false, when we were not asking for it either. If the limitations of the revelation prevented the revelators from giving us data, it would have been much more elegant to have spared them, so my conclusion is that if they are there, they must contain some or perhaps a lot of truth.

In August 2011, there was a news item about studies on evolution that clearly implied a great divergence with what was exposed in _The Urantia Book_. The research project was carried out by a team of Chinese and American scientists that included Dr. Zhe-Xi Luo of the US-based Carnegie Museum of Natural History, doctors Ji Qiang and Yuang Chongxi of the Institute of Geology of the Beijing-based Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences and Dr. Meng Qingjin from the Beijing Museum of Natural History.

The studies carried out on the “Juramaia sinensis”, established that the appearance of placental mammals goes back at least 160 million years ago and this is how it appears established in Wikipedia.

However, in Paper 61 of _The Urantia Book_ we find the following quotes:

> *50,000,000* years ago the land areas of the world were very generally above water or only slightly submerged. The formations and deposits of this period are both land and marine, but chiefly land. For a considerable time the land gradually rose but was simultaneously washed down to the lower levels and toward the seas. (<a id="a59_325"></a>[UB 61:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p1_1))

> Early in this period and in North America the placental type of mammals *suddenly* appeared, and they constituted the most important evolutionary development up to this time. Previous orders of nonplacental mammals had existed, but this new type sprang directly and *suddenly* from the pre-existent reptilian ancestor whose descendants had persisted on down through the times of dinosaur decline. The father of the placental mammals was a small, highly active, carnivorous, springing type of dinosaur. (<a id="a61_505"></a>[UB 61:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p1_2))

The discrepancy as to the time in which they appeared is extraordinary. It is difficult to find a point of approximation between both proposals.

The controversy remains between different researchers. In fact, a new study has just appeared that turns around how long ago these placental mammals appeared.

Publications by Paul Velazco and other researchers at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, who have studied 40 fossils of different species and analyzed a large number of physical characteristics in both fossil and living mammalian species, have concluded that the occurrence of these placental mammals should be established about 66 million years ago, and they further conclude that they appeared “quickly”, circumstances that agree much better with the data pointed out by the information contained in _The Urantia Book_.

Perhaps time will be leaving things settled in their place, little by little... and the dates established in _The Urantia Book_ will coincide more and more with the studies of the different subjects.
