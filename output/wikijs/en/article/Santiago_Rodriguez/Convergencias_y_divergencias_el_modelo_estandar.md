_Possible endorsement of the Standard Particle Model and possible divergence with the UB_

A few weeks ago the news broke of what could be confirmation of the existence of the Higgs Boson. Although there are still tests and studies pending to be able to categorically affirm that the new particle found corresponds to what was predicted by Higgs in 1964, the scientific community is expectant since this possibility seems to be very high.

Although from a practical point of view in daily life and imminently this discovery is not going to bring us any news, it is very important because it seems to indicate to the scientific community that the Standard Model is a good candidate for explanation and understanding of what surrounds us.

I will not go into the description of this Standard Model, just a brief review to focus the situation.

Currently in Physics, the way in which matter and energy interact with each other is better understood if it is expressed in terms of movement and interactions between particles. And this way of thinking pleases scientists because with a few laws and theories you can predict and explain the operation of many things.

Thus, the Standard Model establishes that all matter is explained by the existence of 12 particles (6 of them are classified as “quarks” and 6 as “leptons”, among which is the electron), and establishes that the way in which that some particles interact with others is by virtue of some “forces” that have been reduced to 4. So everything we are learning about interacts with one or more of these 4 forces (strong force, weak force, electromagnetic force and gravity). The way of interacting is reduced to the exchange of particles that carry these forces.

Although the Higgs Boson is not one of the aforementioned (neither particles nor force carriers), the theory allowed the possibility of explaining the mass of the different particles with the exchange of another (the Higgs Boson).

If the finding of the Higgs Boson is confirmed, science will establish that the Particle Model is good enough to explain what we are learning, although it has a series of insufficiencies that have not yet been resolved, the best known perhaps being that it is not explains the gravitational force.

Regarding the possible convergences or divergences with the UB, what we can establish for the moment is that, unless this Standard Model is reformulated, its acceptance supposes a flagrant divergence, since it establishes that the 12 constituent particles of the matter (among them the electron) are really elementary; that is, they are not made up of smaller ones.

Although the UB states:

> _Light, heat, electricity, magnetism, chemism, energy, and matter are—in origin, nature, and destiny—one and the same thing, together with other material realities as yet undiscovered on Urantia._ (<a id="a62_200"></a>[UB 42:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p4_1))

What evidently converges with the intention of unification in the previously exposed science.

Our UB talks about electrons in the following terms:

> _1. Ultimatonic matter—the prime physical units of material existence, the energy particles which go to make up electrons._ (<a id="a68_127"></a>[UB 42:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p3_3))

> _Gravity presence and action . . .The most nearly empty space known in Nebadon would yield about one hundred ultimatons—the equivalent of one electron—in each cubic inch. Such scarcity of matter is regarded as practically empty space._ (<a id="a70_239"></a>[UB 42:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p4_6))

> _2. *Ultimatonic rays.* The assembly of energy into the minute spheres of the ultimatons . . . As the ultimatons aggregate into electrons, condensation occurs with a consequent storage of energy._ (<a id="a72_200"></a>[UB 42:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p5_4))

> _The ultimatons, unknown on Urantia, slow down through many phases of physical activity before they attain the revolutionary-energy prerequisites to electronic organization. Ultimatons have three varieties of motion: mutual resistance to cosmic force, individual revolutions of antigravity potential, and the intraelectronic positions of the one hundred mutually interassociated ultimatons._ (<a id="a74_395"></a>[UB 42:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p6_4))

> _Mutual attraction holds one hundred ultimatons together in the constitution of the electron; and there are never more nor less than one hundred ultimatons in a typical electron. The loss of one or more ultimatons destroys typical electronic identity, thus bringing into existence one of the ten modified forms of the electron._ (<a id="a76_332"></a>[UB 42:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p6_5))

Which diverges from the idea of the Standard Model, which does not establish a composite structure for the electron.

Although it is true that there are hypotheses and theories that did contemplate it that way. In 1974, [Jogesh Pati](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jogesh_Pati) and [Abdus Salam](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdus_Salam) postulated the possibility that both quarks and leptons (I remind you that these are the 12 particles that make up matter) were composed of by “preons”. For the moment, this model has been slowed down by the impossibility of obtaining experimental results that support it, as well as a new setback: if the Higgs Boson is confirmed, it would be contrary to the predictions of the preon model.

The divergence seems to be confirmed for the moment since, although the UB is already written with the limitations of revelation, of course in science the last word has never been said.
