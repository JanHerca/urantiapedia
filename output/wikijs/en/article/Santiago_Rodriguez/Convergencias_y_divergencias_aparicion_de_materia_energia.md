> _Light, heat, electricity, magnetism, chemism, energy, and matter are—in origin, nature, and destiny—one and the same thing, together with other material realities as yet undiscovered on Urantia._ (<a id="a38_200"></a>[UB 42:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p4_1))

There is also a great deal of convergence that the material universe that we can observe did indeed have a beginning in time. Although it is true that the considerations of the moment in which this occurred are far from converging, and in this article we will not go into it.

Today's scientific community tends to consider instant “zero”, the moment when it all began, to be quite precise as an event that occurred some 13.7 billion years ago. Not all of the scientific community accepts the Big Bang phenomenon and what it entails for granted, but we must also be fair and say that more experimental evidence has been found to support this theory.

Alternative theories today have more difficulties in describing the observed reality. It is also true that, at present, the Big Bang theory does not explain everything observed.

I want to insist on the idea that the Big Bang is a physical-mathematical model that tries to explain the appearance and subsequent evolution of the physical universe that we know, and it has to be consistent with the observations that are within our reach, so it is It is understandable that it is not considered finalized or definitive. Although I repeat, despite everything, it is the model that best fits the observations.

The nuance that I want to highlight on this occasion is not the moment in which everything begins but how and when energy-matter appears on the stage of objective reality.

For science, this “zero” moment is the instant in which all the matter and energy that currently exists in the universe appeared. It is also speculated that it is the moment in which the existence of space itself (the “container” of everything that exists) begins, and the existence of “time” as a physical reality also begins.

After this initial moment, everything that happens in the cosmos is nothing but an enormous dance of first only energy and then matter and energy, where an infinity of transactions are also produced that alternately and partially transmute one into the other.

Matter and energy evolve in different ways until, nowadays, they make up the cosmos as we know and observe it.

From the point of view of _The Urantia Book_, this appears not to be so. There is a very interesting nuance to take into account.

From a careful reading of <a id="a62_26"></a>[UB 29:5.5-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p5_5), we can find the following process description:

One of the tasks performed by the Master Force Organizers is to transmute, transform the “primordial force” (which we are told is not sensitive to Paradise gravity, since it is still part of the domain of the Unqualified Absolute). into “powerful or primal energy” that is already subject to the pull of the gravity of Paradise. That is, there is a transition from something that is in a potential state and becomes something actual or “real”; they also reveal to us that this phase, this stage of energy that has ceased to be potential, is not yet reactive to local or linear gravity, let us remember that this linear gravity is what we, our science, knows and measures as “gravity” . So for us it is still possibly physically undetectable.

Once this transmutation is done, the “associated force organizers” immediately go into action and now transform it into “secondary stage energy” or gravity-energy.

It is from this last transformation when this matter-energy becomes sensitive to linear gravity, which would make it susceptible to our measurement and observation instruments, so it is now when I interpret that they are equivalent to the matter-energy you know our science.

What is really divergent from the current concept of science is that the phenomenon of the appearance of matter-energy observable for us does not occur (did not occur) at a given moment, at the so-called “zero” moment, in which everything appeared, but it is something that has been taking place over time, the appearance (the materialization of energy —and matter as something denser than energy—) is a phenomenon that in the light of revelation possibly has not still concluded, since it is part of the preparation of the physical scenario of the local universe of each Miguel. This process has occurred gradually over time and is possibly not finished.

This situation would present a renewed approach in cosmological considerations. Let us bear in mind that one of the interests of the scientific community is to establish what the course our universe will follow, and this course depends to a great extent on the amount of matter-energy contained in it; Many efforts have been made to try to estimate it, since based on its value they will be able to establish the physical future of the cosmos: either an indefinite expansion if there is not enough matter, or a subsequent contraction if the amount of matter exceeds a certain value.

But current science does not contemplate, among other things, the revealed fact that the appearance of matter-energy is an unfinished process. Therefore, speculations about the fate of the universe from a scientific point of view, which are not yet final, would have to be reviewed.

The main problem could be in the need for science to find proof that this matter-energy creation process is not something from the remote past.
