Until now, the issues discussed in this section had to do with facts that presented convergences or divergences between what is accepted by a majority of specialists about current knowledge and those same facts described by the Urantia Book itself.

We know that our reality is not only made up of facts; there must also be room for both meanings and values, these being at least as important as the facts themselves (if not more).

Somehow, both the meanings and the values are being tested in recent times in a stormy way. Different social groups, different values. Many of the inequalities that exist were geographically confined or circumscribed, so taking them into account was a good exercise in self-awareness. In addition, the relative divergences between separate geographical areas made the most distant ones go almost unnoticed, both by the individual and by the group from another distant area.

In the current century, we have made a lot of progress in globalization and the coexistence between cultures, communication is faster and reaches more places. Coexistence between physically close individuals from different cultures makes the concept of brotherhood more demanding and requires more flexibility.

The ease in the movement of people and the existence of social networks make it possible for ideas and ideals to travel and intermingle with few obstacles anywhere in the world.

We are witnessing how certain social groups with growing economic power seem to be trying to impose “forms of coexistence” that many of us consider unacceptable, both for what they are and for what they represent. They are characteristic of very old situations in the evolutionary process of the planetary civilization and should be widely surpassed.

This brings to the door of our house, unquestionably, not only that material inequalities, social inequalities and evolutionary differences, both personal and group, exist, but also that they are very pronounced on a planetary level. Anachronistic values surpassed by many coexist door to door with higher values.

The evolutionary difference between individuals and between groups, manifested through the attitudes, actions and ideals of individuals, is evident, it is very large and it is found everywhere.

Expressed the current situation, tremendously divergent socially and culturally, I now want to draw attention to some shelled aspects of reading _The Urantia Book_.

The first of these is to remember that our personal journey through Urantia will allow us to take only one thing with us, and it is the consequence that the experience of having used the mental and spiritual circuits that are at our disposal throughout the journey through the great universe <a id="a56_292"></a>[UB 117:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p5_13), and we have already begun that journey here on Urantia.

For mortal man, existing is equivalent to growing <a id="a58_50"></a>[UB 117:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p2_2). If there is no growth, there is death. And we are talking about experiential growth, that is, successive changes of state motivated by _decisions taken into action_, since by “experience” we must understand the action that we voluntarily perform after making a decision. <a id="a58_366"></a>[UB 117:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p5_13)

We are called to service, to selfless work for the well-being of our own earthly companions, in particular for worthy beings who are in need and in distress.

We have a challenge, a mandate as individuals, and we know that the manifestation of greatness on a world like Urantia is the demonstration of self-control. <a id="a62_157"></a>[UB 28:6.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p6_20). Furthermore, we are aware that the planetary culture will rise if the quality of the mind rises. <a id="a62_299"></a>[UB 50:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p6_4). And we must be very attentive to ideals, since the ideals of a generation open the channels of destiny for immediate posterity. <a id="a62_470"></a>[UB 81:6.26](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_26)

> _At first life was a struggle for existence; now, for a standard of living; next it will be for quality of thinking, the coming earthly goal of human existence._ (<a id="a64_165"></a>[UB 81:6.28](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_28))

Since values must not be static, we must promote those changes that lead to growth. The meanings have to be expanded and the values have to be exalted. <a id="a66_152"></a>[UB 100:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p3_5)

The creative imagination has to produce valuable results and this will be so if the stage on which that imagination acts is not occupied by prejudices, hatred, fears, resentments, revenge and fanaticism. <a id="a68_204"></a>[UB 111:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p4_9)

A spirit-dominated human life is manifested in the increase in quantity and quality of the fruits of the spirit (381.7) 34:6.13, which mold the character of the personality and achieve pleasing and ennobling self-control. <a id="a70_222"></a>[UB 143:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p2_8).

The fruits of the spirit, sincere and loving service, are the social lever that elevates the races that are in darkness. <a id="a72_121"></a>[UB 178:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_6). Mental poisons: fear, anger, envy, jealousy, distrust, intolerance, hinder the spiritual progress of the evolving soul <a id="a72_285"></a>[UB 110:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p1_5)

Knowing our reality, and if in this world of great divergences we want to converge towards adequate spiritual growth as individuals and as a group, we have no choice but to not only _become aware and decide_, but also _we must do_; We have to face the tremendous divergences of social inequality and of values and principles of the different social groups, groups of extraordinary violence, some with the human race itself, others with the environment.

How can we harmonize the divine mandate of improvement as individuals and as a group, which impels us to try to eliminate the poisons of the spirit and to progress in its fruits? How can we converge on this elevation of mental quality in the world in the face of desperate hunger, war and misery and in the face of the atrocious terrorist attacks on human beings? What are we to think of them, to feel for them, to think and feel about their activities and attitudes? What are we to do as connoisseurs of Urantia reality?
