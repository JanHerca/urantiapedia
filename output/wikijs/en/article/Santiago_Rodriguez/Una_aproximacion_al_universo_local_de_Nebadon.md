When we think about the contents of the LU, which deals with so many and varied topics, we tend to try to establish the relative importance of some or others; matters as disparate as the knowledge of material physical reality or the discovery of spiritual perception seem to have to be in different places on our scale of values, however, let us not forget that the LU itself does not position the various topics in different places on that hypothetical scale of values, in fact it reveals to us that:

> Curiosity—the spirit of investigation, the urge of discovery, the drive of exploration—is a part of the inborn and divine endowment of evolutionary space creatures. [UB 14:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p5_11)

So, once we understand the administrative structure presented by the LU, curiosity arises, and why not, the need also, to situate ourselves in the physical universe in which we are immersed. I emphasize the word “physical” because the LU reveals to us that a local universe is actually much more than a place...

The revelators have not made it easy for us, on the one hand the limitations of the revelation itself, on the other hand what the revelators have deemed appropriate to tell us and added to this, the fact that scientific knowledge of our cosmological environment is something that is still being investigated, all this I repeat, leads us to a situation in which the information contained in the UL does not correlate in an easy or indisputable way with the scientific vision of the cosmos.

Therefore, we have no choice but to perform a juggling act to try to give shape to what we know, and somehow spatially locate the elements that the LU presents to us.

There is a lot of data in the LU, and with the intention of being as rigorous as possible, I will assume that what is described in the LU is true. That is, I start from the premise that the revealers do not tell us the whole truth, but that they do not deceive us, and this leads me to assume that the distances and data that appear in the LU are reasonably accurate, although perhaps with some reservations. I will try to superimpose them on current knowledge.

The main objective of this work is to locate Nebadon, our local universe, in physical space, as well as to estimate its possible size.

To facilitate reading, both the description of the calculations performed and the citations to the LU used will appear in appendices at the end of the work. The citations to the LU appear in blue and in Appendix 1.

I insist: there is no single way to visualize our universe, but I find it stimulating to propose one that can serve as a starting point and allow imagination and intuition to lead us to contemplate other possibilities...

I will take a tour from the confines of the Master Universe to our System, alternating the scientific description with some of the possible options that the LU itself raises.

## 1.-Scientific description of our cosmic environment.

### 1.1 What our eyes see.

I will begin with a scientific description of our place of residence and some of the other places referred to in the LU that are part of current scientific knowledge.

One of the first things we must keep in mind is that we, our solar system, are immersed in the central plane of the Milky Way, so it has been and continues to be long and difficult to shape our galaxy, since we are forced to observe it from within. It's as if we were trying to understand the structure, shape, and dimensions of a fog bank from within the fog itself, with no possibility of observing it from the outside.

Science has had to make great efforts to try to find out what is outside our galaxy and even more complicated has been and is trying (in fact it is not a process that can be considered concluded) to find out how big the Milky Way, our galaxy, is and what its structure is.

When we observe the sky with our own eyes, and we do so on moonless nights and far from light pollution, we already find the first vestiges of the galactic plane: the Milky Way or the Way of St. James, known and described since ancient times, since this “milky road” has always been visible in our firmament.

Over the years, humanity has also arbitrarily named groups of luminous objects (mostly stars, and all of them from our own galaxy) that it has found in the firmament; this is how constellations are born, and they still serve to orient us in the firmament today.

In the following image we can see a representation of the firmament with the brightest stars as well as the constellations they form and also the background of the Milky Way.

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">

</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

### 1.2 What science establishes

Science has established that our solar system is located in a specific area of a larger structure, a galaxy, called the Milky Way, despite the complexity of observing it from within, various studies have concluded that it is a barred spiral galaxy, meaning that at its center there is an elongated structure, a “central bar.”

Our galaxy has an estimated mass of 10^12^ solar masses (1 trillion times the mass of the Sun); it has an average diameter of 100,000 n and is estimated to contain between 200 and 400 billion stars.

The galaxy is not only the central part (disc and bulge), it has other structures such as the halo, which also contains matter, old stars, gas, etc., and where globular clusters are also distributed - groups of between 100,000 and 1,000,000 stars that orbit the galaxy.

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/028.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

The Sun appears to be located about 27,700 ly from the center of the Galaxy, or 55% of its radius, and roughly in the galactic plane. At this point, the Milky Way is about 2,000 ly thick.

Another fact provided by current science is that star formation in our galaxy is low compared to other galaxies; the most recent estimate has gone from values of 5 to approximately one star per year. [Wikipedia: Milky Way](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%ADa_L%C3%A1ctea)

It also determines that our solar system moves around the center of the Milky Way in an orbit at a speed of just over 200 km/s, which means that it takes us about 226 million years to complete one orbit around it.

So we have some diagrams that try to represent what current science tells us about our galaxy:

<figure id="Figure_4" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/002.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

Recent data reveal that the structure of the Milky Way is more complex than previously assumed, there even seems to be data that leads to the belief that it was formed by incorporating an ancient, smaller galaxy into its structure: [Wikipedia — Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enana_El%C3%ADptica_de_Sagitario)

This has created zones of dust and stars between the two galactic structures that are too faint to be easily visible, both due to their low density and the fact that they are located on the other side of the galaxy, obscuring the very center of the Milky Way.

An artistic recreation of our galaxy from a scientific point of view would look something like this:

<figure id="Figure_5" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/029.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

<figure id="Figure_6" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/003.jpg">
</figure>

The difficulty of observing what is on the other side and in the same plane of the Milky Way is evident in the fact that not long ago (2003) the presence of a small but very close galaxy was determined: [Canis Major Dwarf](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enana_del_Can_Mayor). It is located 25,000 galaxies from us and 42,000 galaxies from the galactic center.

In fact, between 1971 and 2010, around 16 stellar streams appear to have been found; that is, streams of stars that follow different paths from most of the rest of the galactic stars themselves. They populate the galactic halo, and there is speculation that they may be remnants of other galaxies that have gradually been incorporated into our Milky Way.

Thus, computer simulations give the Milky Way an appearance similar to that seen in the illustration on the right:

<br style="clear:both;"/>

We can arrive at a representation like the one seen in the following image:

<figure id="Figure_7" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/030.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

The Milky Way has ceased to be a typical galaxy structure, becoming an object much more complex in components and structure.

In order to orient ourselves in the representations of the Milky Way, we must find our position in it, that is, that of our Sun, and we also need to see how the constellations extend and in which direction. We will also establish an estimate of distances. The following images will help us with this:

<figure id="Figure_8" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/004.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

Starting from the location of the Solar System (in red), a galactic coordinate system is established, which basically consists of establishing a circumference around the Solar System, that is, 360 degrees; the direction pointing towards the center of our galaxy (the constellation of Sagittarius) is established as the origin of this circumference (0°).

So it's easy to see that when we look towards the constellation of Sagittarius, we are looking towards the center of our galaxy, and when we look towards the constellation of Orion (180°), we are looking towards the opposite side. In this same diagram we find the distances from the Sun to different parts of the galaxy expressed in light years (ly) or kpc (kilo parsecs, 1 pc is equivalent to 3.26 ly, so one kpc is 3260 ly). We can see that the distance to the galactic center would be about 25,000 ly. In yellow we have the orbit that the Sun travels around the galactic center, and in different colors the names that science gives to the different galactic arms.

The triangle in a grayish shade represents the shadow cone cast by the galactic center itself, which prevents us from easily observing what lies within its shadow cone. (See image above.)

Obviously, not all constellations are represented, since only some are represented through which the galactic plane passes; that is, the others will be either above or below the plane represented here. When we look at a constellation in the starry sky, we are looking at a part of the galaxy, and let's not forget that what we see in the constellation may be more or less close to us; the constellation does not indicate a distance but a direction.

If we take a step outward and try to describe what science tells us about the immediate and closest environment of our galaxy, keeping in mind that nothing can be definitively stated, the galactic environment we know appears in the following diagram:

<figure id="Figure_9" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/005.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

The plane indicates the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy (Milchstraße in the diagram), the green vertical lines indicate the position above or below the plane of the different galaxies that make up the local group, those with the black dot with the name of the galaxy at the top of the line will be above the plane, and those with the name and the white dot at the bottom of the line are below the plane. The coordinate axis at the bottom center of the diagram represents the perspective of (1MLj) 1 million al, so that the distance along the three axes of the different galaxies that make up the drawing can be estimated.

In it we find two large groups of galaxies, the lower one with the Milky Way at its center and the upper one with another group of galaxies mainly around the Andromeda Galaxy.

All these galaxies are part of what science today defines as the “Local Group”, there are more than 54 galaxies in an area of 10 million ly, grouped around the three most massive ones which are the Milky Way, the Triangulum Galaxy (M33) and the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), all of which seem to revolve around the common center of mass established between the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy.

As Appendix 2, we will find an exhaustive list of the galaxies that form the Local Group.

Another representation that can help locate the main galaxies that are part of the Local Group is the following image, which also attempts to make a three-dimensional representation of the group from a different perspective than the previous scheme.

**Local Galactic Group**

<figure id="Figure_10" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/006.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

For the purpose of this work, I think it is not worth going to the representation of larger areas of the known cosmos, however in Appendix 3, we can see a representation of the situation of the galaxies in an environment that covers an approximate area of 21 million al per side and a thickness (z axis) of approximately 10 million al.

It's worth noting that the area that lies towards the zone where our galactic shadow is located has practically no known galaxies... and probably there aren't, but it could also be that we haven't been able to find them yet.

With the “scientific panorama” developed and revealed, we can now glimpse what current science knows about our galactic neighborhood. Now let's turn our attention to the LU text and its descriptions in order to try to recognize structures, locations, positions, etc.

## 2.-Description of the LU of our cosmic environment.

Before beginning, I want to remember and make clear the limits of the revelation [UB 101:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p4_2), in which they expressly mention that cosmology has been greatly affected by these restrictions, which leads me to not lose sight of the fact that the data contained and expressed in the descriptive texts on matters relating to cosmology must be taken with due caution.

This places us in a situation of even greater uncertainty, since on the one hand, science has not fully established itself in cosmological matters and on the other hand, we are asked to keep in mind that some of the data presented in the UB may not be entirely accurate and may be more or less distorted by the restrictions of revelation.

In principle, it would seem logical to assume that the LU data affecting objects in our cosmos recognized by science could be conditioned by what was known about them at the time of revelation, but the data referring especially to places that science does not know of their existence, a priori does not seem to have a reason why they should be imprecise.

This will be the premise I will use when considering data. As an example, I can say that the data on the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy, which appears specified in the LU, will be given as a type of data conditioned by the knowledge of the time. But, for example, the distance from Jerusem to any other place, I understand that it would not be restricted by revelation since Jerusem does not exist for our current science.

It's also interesting to note that the revelators' description of our environment focuses more on administrative issues than merely physical ones. Therefore, the image we must form of, say, a superuniverse must be more complex and complete than the one we can form of a simple grouping of suns.

As a starting point for study, I will present the following summary table of the administrative direction of our planet within the Master Universe: [UB 15:14.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p14_5) and following

<div class="urantiapedia-table-wrapper">

### 2.1 Master Universe

Although the main reason for the work is to locate our local universe (Nebadon), it is clear that we must locate it in a suitable environment, which is none other than that of the 70th Superuniverse (Orvonton), which in turn we must locate within the Grand Universe as part of the Master Universe.

Space, where our cosmic adventure of evolution in time unfolds, is immense and finite. It extends from the area near Paradise to beyond the Master Universe. It is the canvas containing the matter-energy of the time and space creations. [UB 11:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p7_4)

This canvas that emerges from Paradise is divided into two parts, one that includes the entire stage of our existence, which the LU calls the “penetrated space”, and enveloping it, we could almost say containing it, we have the “unpenetrated space”, of which apart from its existence, little or nothing else is known.

From Paradise and into space extends all that is currently created, the creations of time and space: the Master Universe

Thus the Master Universe is revealed to us to be not infinite, a geometric description is given to us in [UB 11:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p7_3), so I invite you to visualize it as an immense toroid in which the central orifice and what is outside the toroid would correspond to unpenetrated space, the center would be occupied by Paradise (which is outside of space) and in space from eternity, there would be Havona; a possible scheme of this geometry would be:

<figure id="Figure_11" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/007.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>


[UB 14:1.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p1_10) Havona revolves in a plane around Paradise, in concentric circles (7 circles). The dark bodies surround it (I understand that not only in a plane), but in the entire volume, like a sphere that once again would be incomplete due to the fact of colliding with the areas of the unpenetrated space, they also hide it from the view of the superuniverses, and since these bodies do not absorb or reflect light, they could either be transparent, which would allow their interior to be seen, or the way to not see their interior would be to make the light surround them, so that to the eyes of the observer, it would not even appear as a vacuum or hole in his observable universe, but you could observe without solution of continuity what is on the other side of the cosmos, the movement of these belts themselves would facilitate the distribution of the light coming from the other part of the cosmos, in the manner in which the air is distributed around a sphere (without counting the zone of turbulence), the following diagram illustrates the area surrounded by the dark bodies, in both cases this area appears transparent to an outside observer, in the first case, we would see its interior, it is the second, the one I advocate,

<figure id="Figure_12" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/031.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

In this way, the central universe remains hidden from observation by any superuniverse, and from any angle.

The empirical fact that wherever we look we find no limits, we do not see the limit with the unpenetrated space, can be explained with the previous analogy, since the light would travel through the geometry of the Master Universe without crossing the unpenetrated space, but we would not visually appreciate the discontinuity that would be implied by encountering the zone of unpenetrated space.

With Havona hidden from our observation, the next thing we encounter outward are the 7 superuniverses, the first creations of time and space, also called the “superuniverse space level,” [UB 15:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p1_3) which runs in an elliptical path around the Paradise-Havona system.

We are also told that going out from Havona, in any direction you choose, you will eventually reach the outer limits of the Grand Universe, [UB 12:1.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p1_13) , that is, the Grand Universe surrounds, completely envelops the Paradise-Havona system, and is in turn enveloped by the next space level. That is, its borders end in one direction, toward Havona, in any other direction in the first space level, and perpendicularly, both above and below, it will end either in the unpenetrated zones of space, or more likely in the first space level, which would envelop it as the Grand Universe does with Havona, which somehow leads me to think that the overall form of the Grand Universe is similar to that indicated above for the Master Universe, which we could represent as a torus within another torus. Of course, the exterior is incredibly larger than the interior.

<figure id="Figure_12" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/008.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

This would be a view of the geometry of the superuniverse space level and the rest of the space levels as well as the Master Universe as a whole.

Curiously, the toroidal shape is loaded with symbolism; in fact, it is similar to an infinity symbol rotating around a vertical axis that passes through its center:

<figure id="Figure_13" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/032.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

### 2.2 Grand Universe. Superuniverse Space Level

Of the other six superuniverses, apart from their relative arrangement and surrounding location of Havona, little more is known. A schematic cross-section of the torus above might be like the one appearing in Sadler's study:

**SIMPLIFIED DIAGRAM OF THE MASTER UNIVERSE**

<figure id="Figure_14" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/009.jpg">
</figure>

The innermost area, designated “P,” is Paradise Island. The surrounding area is the central universe, Havona. Surrounding Havona are the seven superuniverses; they are designated by numbers; our superuniverse, Orvonton, is number seven. The four outer areas are the four levels of outer space (See Appendix III, “Space Levels of the Master Universe”).

I visualize each superuniverse as a “wedge” that, if we consider them equal or almost equal in size, will be on the order of (360° / 7), about 51°-52°. That is, one-seventh of the portion of space that immediately surrounds Havona. Occupying a region from the first inner torus to the place where the first space level begins.

The spherical wedge helps us visualize the portion that should actually be made on the previously mentioned toroid.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

<figure id="Figure_15" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/033.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

We do not know where Havona is in our firmament, we know that it is on the galactic plane and that when we are in a suitable position, looking towards the center of our galaxy, we look towards Paradise.

Although they describe a circular motion of the 7 superuniverses around Havona, this has such a large radius that they will surely pass unnoticed for a long time without the possibility of measuring it, as can be seen from the commentary [UB 15:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p1_1). and following pages of the LU.

To recap a bit, based on the vision offered to us of this spatial framework, we would have the following elements:

- a Paradise outside of space, so we will probably not perceive it physically.
- A Central Universe (Havona) surrounding Paradise and concealing it from the rest of creation by concentric rings of dark gravity bodies. Probably hidden from our vision, but possibly “visible” by its gravitational field.
- Unpenetrated space. Originating above and below Paradise itself and enveloping the Master Universe.
- The superuniverse space level containing the 7 superuniverses, surrounding Havona and enclosed by the first space level, illustrated with the previous image of the concentric toroids.
- The outer rim of the Master Universe is irregular and almost certainly unfinished. [UB 12:1.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p1_13). It would then be easy to understand why the Master Universe is not readily distinguishable as a collection of elements of which we can say: these are outside and these other elements are within.
- The foregoing leads me to consider that when I think of Orvonton, I am not thinking of a galaxy or a group of them, since it is a portion of space, which includes at least one galaxy, the Milky Way. [UB 12:1.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p1_12)
- Regarding the physical location of the other six superuniverses, he says little or nothing. He only considers that we share the same spatial plane and must somehow be around ours.

We will now explore what the UB reveals about our superuniverse.

### 2.3 Orvonton. The Seventh Superuniverse.

Regarding its shape, according to the adopted criteria, it would be one of those toroidal wedges mentioned above.

About its size and position in the known cosmos. We'll see what clues the revelation offers in this regard.

Throughout the LU we are told about our relative position, within the superuniverse spatial level, where we find ourselves.

How much of the known cosmos is contained in Orvonton? In other words, we'd like to find out where it is and how big it is.

Our galaxy, the Milky Way, represents the central core of Orvonton [UB 15:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p3_1). It is therefore clear that Orvonton is larger than the Milky Way, since it contains it.

[UB 12:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p2_3) If we consider the nearby galaxies as if they were the “island universes” referred to, we are invited to think that several of these galaxies closer to us are part of Orvonton.

It also gives us an indication of belonging to Orvonton, that is, it tells us what condition those neighboring galaxies must meet to be part of the 70th superuniverse and it is the fact that we travel together, which would lead us to think that galactic systems that are sufficiently close so that they share movements with the Milky Way, could be part of our superuniverse.

One of the main clues that revelation gives us to determine the size of Orvonton is the number of stars it contains. As a starting point, we can estimate 10 billion stars (10^13^ stars) [UB 15:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p6_10)

The other key is the distance from the superuniverse center to the outermost system of inhabited worlds, which is slightly less than 250,000 miles (300,000 km). [UB 32:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p2_11)

And here a major stumbling block arises. In a spatial volume containing the Milky Way and having a radius of 250,000 α, it is necessary (See Appendix 2) to take into account around a dozen galaxies, so although the idea
In general, it would be adequate, the problem lies in the number of stars contained in this volume, since we would be considering values of the order of “only” between 4 x 10^11^ and 5 x 10^11^ stars

This situation immediately leads us to two working hypotheses:

1. Or we have the stellar equivalent of 20 Milky Ways, within a radius of 250,000 ly, which we have not yet discovered, and we have not even realized.
2. Or the alternative would seem to be that the Milky Way and its immediate surroundings of those 12-15 satellite galaxies actually contain 20 times more stars than currently estimated by science.

At present, neither of the two previous possibilities seem plausible to me, and if I had to choose one, I would choose the possibility that the Milky Way contains on the order of 20 times more stars than currently assumed.

I don't see it possible that in an environment of 250,000 al there are the equivalent of 20 Milky Ways and that we have not yet been able to discover them.

I can explore a third possibility and try to accept a slightly more complex situation that can reconcile the two data presented in the LU, and that does not involve such a drastically changing current scientific knowledge.

This possible alternative would be to consider the Local Group of galaxies as members of Orvonton, although maintaining the tone to which the revealers have accustomed us, there does not seem to be data in the LU that support what we observe without any doubt; there are very few categorical things in the cosmology of the revelation.

Let's look at the points in favor of this hypothesis:
1. Science establishes that the Local Group physically travels together toward the Great Attractor. [UB 12:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p2_3)
2. Thirteen of Andromeda's 27 satellite galaxies lie in the same plane as the 12-kJ thick Milky Way, and all spin in the same direction. [Nature 493: 62–65, 3 January 2013](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11717)
3. The number of stars estimated to be contained in the local group of galaxies is on the order of 0.7 x 10^12^. Although these astronomical data may not be definitive, the number is reasonably close to the UB value of 10^13^ [UB 15:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p6_10).

In Appendix 3, we can find a three-dimensional representation of the galactic environment of the Milky Way, which allows us to spatially locate what science calls the “Local Group of Galaxies”

In the LU revelation, we can find other data that could fit this third working hypothesis:
1. The Magellanic Clouds appear to be part of Orvonton. [UB 15:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p4_8)
2. Globular clusters have been found around several galaxies. [UB 15:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p4_8) both in the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy. Indeed, this type of object seems to be abundant in the outskirts of most of the large galaxies.
3. In paragraph [UB 15:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p4_7) we can understand at first glance that Andromeda is outside the “inhabited superuniverse,” but I want to call attention to the expression used by the revelators. We are assuming the fact that all seven superuniverses are inhabited by definition, which makes the express inclusion of the adjective “inhabited” seem redundant, were it not for the fact that it brings out and emphasizes the fact that a superuniverse can have inhabited parts and uninhabited parts, which would make it plausible that Andromeda is part of the superuniverse even though it is uninhabited.
4. [UB 32:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p2_11) From the outermost system of inhabited worlds to the center of the superuniverse is about 250,000 al. This distance would be considerably less than the entire size of Orvonton, but again the UB emphasizes that these are distances to the inhabited system of worlds, therefore in a superuniverse setting with inhabited and uninhabited areas this statement would not be contradicted.

To be rigorous, we find other data in the revelation that in principle would disagree with this idea:
1. Globular clusters are predominant near the outer margins of Orvonton [UB 15:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p4_8), and they appear to be abundant around the galaxies, at least the large ones, the Milky Way with about 200, Andromeda over 500, and the Triangulum Galaxy which has been counted with about 60. So while it is true that they exist around the galaxies, it is true of all the large ones, so it could be true but not unique to Orvonton.
2. Nebadon, our local universe, is located near the outer rim of the Grand Universe [UB 12:1.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p1_13) would seem to indicate that everything outside the location of Nebadon, in the opposite direction to Uversa, would be outside the Superuniverse unless we qualify it and understand it as the rim of the inhabited Superuniverse.
3. [UB 12:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p2_2) In principle, the human eye can see the Nebula (Andromeda Galaxy) called in astronomical jargon M31. I personally see it and there are those who claim to be able to see the Triangle Galaxy (M33), both components of the Local Group of galaxies.

If we choose for our superuniverse to extend over an area of only about 250,000 km², we have the following two images that schematize what it would be like and what elements (remember that they would be galaxies primarily but not exclusively) it would be composed of; this is the situation discussed above, where our superuniverse includes the Milky Way as the main galaxy and then the satellite galaxies closest to them. Remember that in this scenario, we are missing many stars to reach the number indicated by the LU for the superuniverse. Once again, I include the galactic coordinates to help us with our orientation. Our location would be on the “Milky Way” but just on the opposite side of “Sagittarius Dwarf,” that is, on the line that joins 0° and 180°.

<figure id="Figure_16" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/010.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

Another scheme that would help us with the configuration of this environment would be this one, which only includes an environment of about 200,000 to the radius.

<figure id="Figure_17" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/011.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

If we opt for the third hypothesis in which the scenario is the Local Group of galaxies, so that we have a number of stars of the order of magnitude of those described in LU, and we would have to do the exercise of thinking that only the central part of this environment (which would also include the Milky Way and something beyond as an inhabited area, the position scheme would be the one indicated in the following diagram.

<figure id="Figure_18" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/034.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

The 1 Mpc circle, just over 3 million α in radius, would encompass the number of stars collected in the UL for our superuniverse. The white circles represent the three largest galaxies.

The red cross marks the area around which the cluster rotates; it is its center of mass. The colors of the galaxies denote the galaxy type and morphology, but this is not relevant in our study.

Somehow, the data provided by the LU, when compared with what science currently knows about our cosmic environment, allows us to establish a lower and upper limit on the size of Orvonton.

So we either assume a lower limit of the volume contained in a toroidal wedge of just over 500,000 times the diameter that would include the Milky Way as the main galaxy along with about twenty much smaller satellite galaxies, and we will wait for science to eventually determine that the number of stars in the system described is actually 20 times greater.

Or we adopt as a more realistic criterion the possibility that the number of stars established by science is correct (within the same order of magnitude) and we will have to assume that the size of Orvonton is that of the toroidal wedge comprising the Local Group with a diameter of about 5,000,000 ly, assuming on the other hand that the inhabited area is limited to the immediate surroundings of the Milky Way occupying a spherical volume of about 500,000 ly in diameter from a center close to the center of the Milky Way.

After these possible interpretations of the spatial content of Orvonton, what is certain is that the Milky Way is part of it, and we are within it, so we can continue our exploration to try to locate Nebadon. It is undoubtedly and inevitably within the Milky Way.

### 2.4 Inside Orvonton. In the Milky Way.

Within the Milky Way, we could try to find the following administrative units that make up a superuniverse, recalling the table included at the beginning of point 2 of this work: the Major Sector and, within it, the Minor Sector, and, forming part of it, the Local Universe; within the Local Universe, we would have the Constellation, and within the Constellation, the Local System; and Urantia, forming part of one of the stars that make up the Local System of Satania.

We repeat the same objective, that is, we look for the size and location where the different administrative units could be located.

About the size of the different units:

We can try to define them based on the number of stars they appear to host. Obviously, having the exact number would be ideal, but we don't have it, so we have to settle for an estimate of the order of magnitude we're talking about.

In this way we can return to the table we saw in section 2 and try to complete it with additional data.

The first estimate, which we will also consider the upper limit, would be to start from the LU data already mentioned, for Orvonton of more than 10^13^ stars [UB 15:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p6_10).

To determine the number of stars in each of the administrative divisions, we will consider the number of inhabited planets expected in each of them, and assuming that the star/inhabited planet ratio remains the same, we deduce the stars they could contain. This is reflected in the 4th column “No stars LU~1~”

The estimate of the lower limit to the number of stars will be given by extrapolation from the number of stars in our own local system. It is reflected in the last column, as follows: “No stars LU~2~” indicates the expected number of stars, assuming that the ratio of planets to the number of stars remains the same as that indicated in the LU itself for our Satania system.

In this case, I've considered that “more than 2,000 stars” could be, for example, 2,200 stars. Ultimately, it would be a number between 2,000 and 3,000 stars.

### 2.5 Inside Orvonton. Splandon the 5th Major Sector

We can't say much about the 5th Major Sector (Splandon), and even less about the other major sectors. As for its size, higher estimates would give values slightly more than twice the size of the Milky Way, while lower estimates would put it at about half the size of the Milky Way. (See table)

Certainly neither option seems comfortable, but I do not see it possible to obtain more precision and accuracy from the data revealed.

Let's see if we can infer anything about their position.

We are told that it moves (like the other 9 Major Sectors) around Uversa, and that the 100 Minor Sectors that comprise it rotate around it. [UB 15:3.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p3_12)

We know that it comprises 1/10 of a Superuniverse, which would lead us to assume, as in the case of the Superuniverse, that the 10 Major Sectors are partially inhabited, that is, there will also be a part of each of them that is not inhabited. [UB 15:13.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p13_1)

At the Major Sector level, the pattern we discussed at the Superniverse level seems to be repeated, with one inhabited area and another uninhabited area.

The idea that the Milky Way, both because of the number of stars it contains, the fact that it is an object with parts rotating around a center, and because of its size, could fit the description of a Major Sector is very suggestive, and since we are in it, we would be saying that the Milky Way would be, if not all of Splandon, the 5th Major Sector, then at least the inhabited part of it; but if we assume this to be true, we face a challenge: we know that the Milky Way represents the central core of Orvonton, so we would be assuming that the 50th Major Sector would be the central core of Orvonton, which would make it in some way a more relevant, more important, or at least different Sector than the rest of the Major Sectors, and this is a concept that has no precedent in the descriptions of the UB, and it also does not seem very logical in the superuniverse administration.

From the statement made in [UB 15:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p3_1), it becomes more plausible to think that the Milky Way Galaxy is in some way part of the different Major Sectors, if not all of them, at least several of them, in this way we could give meaning to the revelation that “_The immense star system of the Milky Way Galaxy represents the central nucleus of Orvonton_”

### 2.6 Inside Orvonton. Test the 3rd. Minor Sector

It is number 3 of the 100 Minor Sectors that make up the Major Sector to which we belong.

If we are to take into account that our Local Universe (Nebadon) is one of the most recent creations of Orvonton [UB 12:1.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p1_12), considering the numbering summarized in the previous table, in which it is stated that Splandon is the 5th Major Sector of 10 existing, and that Ensa is the 3rd of 100 Minor Sectors, it would seem to indicate to us that the order number of the major and minor sectors does not seem to attend to their antiquity, but perhaps rather to a determined spatial position.

On the other hand, the comments he makes about a minor sector do not lead us to think, as in the case of the major sector or the superuniverse, about a region of space, but rather it seems to indicate that a Minor Sector is the region that includes 100 Local Universes, thus revealing to us that Ensa, which is the third minor sector, already has 100 local universes, with ours (Nebadon) being the one that makes number 84. [UB 15:14.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p14_7), this order number does invite us to think that it is not the last but rather one of the most recent...

Then, in the case of the size of our Minor Sector, we will restrict it to a portion of the Milky Way, which could contain a hundred Local Universes.

Regarding its position, what we know is that we are inside it, so the portion of the Milky Way that contains us must be part of Ensa.

The UB mentions Sagittarius, [UB 41:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p0_4) and tells us that it is the center of our Minor Sector of Orvonton. It also tells us that it is very far away, that it is immense, and that two immense star streams issue from it [UB 15:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p3_5)

If we now superimpose scientific knowledge on revelation, we could conclude that our Milky Way (the one presented by science) corresponds to a Minor Sector, since science establishes that our solar system revolves around the galactic center in Sagittarius. Our galactic center is very far away, 27,700 ly, and we see two enormous spiral arms of stars emerging from it...certainly, given the diagram, the temptation to conclude that the Milky Way presented to us by science is the Minor Sector described by the Milky Way is high.

However, we must make the same consideration that we made about the Major Sector to rule it out, unless we want to assume that Ensa, one of the 1000 minor sectors of Orvonton, is the “central nucleus” of our Superuniverse.

There is also a problem reconciling the number of stars the Minor Sector might have with the number of stars the Milky Way appears to have. (Between 200 billion and 400 billion – that is, between 2 x 10^11^ and 4 x 10^11^ – for the Milky Way and the estimate given in the table of between 2.2 x 10^9^ and 10^10^ stars for a minor sector.

We will look for an alternative that allows us to approximate the data entered into LU as closely as possible.

Regarding the possibility of motions within the Milky Way, it is true that science has not yet established all the motions of the solar system's environment that the UB predicts. [UB 15:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p3_7) so we cannot confirm them, but it is also true that the study of our Milky Way is incomplete, so we cannot rule out that in the future it will be determined that it exists; we must bear in mind that we are certainly talking about relatively slow movements to have been able to discover them in just a few years of stellar observation.

Regarding the place referred to by the LU “in Sagittarius” we can consider that since 1764 what is called the “Sagittarius Star Cloud” was known, also called Delle Caustiche, NGC 6603 or M24 [Wikipedia — Small Sagittarius Star Cloud](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peque%C3%B1a_Nube_Estelar_de_Sagitario)

It is a region located in the constellation of Sagittarius, M24, and inside it NGC 6603 is a star grouping, an open cluster of a hundred components and located at an estimated distance of 9400 ly.

The cover image, taken by me from the Priorat region of Tarragona, and consisting of 35 consecutive photographs with a 5-minute exposure each, shows this area. It shows the region's position in the summer sky from our latitude. Data from the photo are in Appendix 4.

The following image shows some astronomical objects that can serve as a reference, and framed with a greenish circle, the asterism called the “Sagittarius Star Cloud,” a place that could be where the headquarters of our minor sector is located.

Below is a diagram of the area captured by the image, so you can more easily locate it in the sky, as well as a panoramic view of the sky at the date and time the images were taken, so you can have a reference to the area of sky photographed.

<figure id="Figure_19" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">

<br style="clear:both;"/>

<figure id="Figure_20" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/013.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

In the image above, we can see the box representing the image taken. The arc of the circle that crosses the different constellations represents the galactic plane, where the Milky Way passes in the night sky. Just below the rectangle in the photograph, we can see the “0,” which represents the direction toward the center of our galaxy.

Therefore, the working hypothesis would be that the center of the Minor Sector around which the Local Universes that compose it revolve would be located about 9400 meters from ours in the direction of the constellation of Sagittarius.

In the following diagram we can see the relative position of our Sun and NGC6603, the estimated center of the Minor Sector, in our Milky Way:

<figure id="Figure_21" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/014.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

And this object, known at the time of the publication of the UB and by the same name as the revelators [UB 15:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p3_5), also fulfills the description that it is very far away in the enormous and dense Sagittarius star cloud, it is a subgalactic system, and we observe two great streams of star clouds as stellar spirals, since it is clearly in one of the spiral arms (the Scutum-Centaurus arm) of the Milky Way.

### 2.7 Nebadon, our local universe.

We can begin by considering what science says about our immediate surroundings, since Nebadon is located in this part of the galaxy, since we are in it.

It would seem fair to conclude that in this very “close” environment, the results of today's science are sufficiently acceptable; even revelation itself encourages us to think so [UB 41:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p3_10).

Thus, we can briefly summarize the techniques for estimating astronomical distances: some are direct measurements, and others (for larger distances) are estimated by comparing the brightness and distances of closer objects, which makes these latter measurements more susceptible to error.

_As direct measures we have:_

- The distance to the Moon through the echo of a laser allows us precision of a few cm.
- The distance to Venus, using radio frequency echo.
- Electromagnetic radiation echo for the Solar System.
- Trigonometric parallax. It allows us to obtain reliable data up to about 500 pc (remember that 1 pc is 3.26 light-years, so we're talking about up to about 1630 light-years).


_Comparative brightness measurements:_

- With Cepheids we can estimate distances between galaxies

Browsing the [Atlas of the Universe](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/) page we can estimate volumes of space and the number of stars contained, so in a radius of about 2100 we can count around 100 million stars, which we remember was our upper ceiling for the size of Nebadon.

Thus, we will construct a table that will give us the radius in light years of a sphere, the volume that sphere encompasses, the number of stars that science proposes for those volumes, and we will calculate the corresponding stellar density.

<div class="urantiapedia-table-wrapper">

| Radius (h) | Volume of sphere (h) | Number of stars | Stellar density<br>(number of stars/h^3^) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | Not determined |
| 5 | 524 | 2 | 3.82 10^-3^ |
| 13 | 8181 | 33 | 4.03 10^-3^ |
| 17 | 20580 | 67 | 3.26 10^-3^ |
| 20 | 33510 | 127 | 3.79 10^-3^ |
| 50 | 5.24 10^5^ | 1800 | 3.44 10^-3^ |
| 250 | 6.54 10^7^ | 260000 | 3.97 10^-3^ |
| 5000 | 5.24 10^11^ | 6.00 10^8^ | 1.15 10^-3^ |

</div>

An important conclusion is that stellar densities up to diameters of 500 ly and probably somewhat beyond remain very similar with an average of 3.72 10^-3^ stars per cubic light-year, and then for larger distances, of the order of 10,000 ly in diameter, the value drops to 1.15 10^-3^.

The explanation for this result lies in the fact that, as we have seen previously, the galaxy is not spherical, but an elongated and fairly flat object, such that in the vicinity of our Sun the thickness of the galaxy is about 2000 ly, so a radius of 5000 ly already includes a portion of space far from the galactic plane and therefore with a considerably lower stellar density, so the stellar density decreases in broad study environments.

We must also bear in mind that the stellar distribution in our galaxy is not homogeneous; it can be greatly influenced by the distance from the galactic center, where stellar density grows enormously, as well as on the periphery of the galaxy, in globular clusters.

#### How big is Nebadon?

Now we can estimate what the LU tells us about this in order to compare it with the scientific result.

Our Minor Sector, which houses 100 Local Universes, and ours is number 84, is destined to contain 10 million inhabited worlds, and as for the estimate of the number of stars it contains, we place the lower band at 22 million and the upper at 100 million (see table on pg. 19).

In [UB 41:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p0_3) it tells us that despite its varied primordial origin, our Local Universe (Nebadon) is currently made up of a series of spatial components that today travel together as a single unit, that is, they share a determined region that is characterized, among other things, by having a trajectory of movement common to all its components, within the journey they make in the superuniverse itself.

As we get closer to the location of our Sun (and therefore our Earth), we are exploring areas that are closer and theoretically better known to our science.

If we have established that the headquarters of our minor sector, Ensa, is located about 9000 al away in the direction of the constellation of Sagittarius, it is clear that our local universe must be established between us and that area of our Milky Way.

We will gather more information in order to determine where it extends and how large Nebadon might be.

In a Superuniverse we have 10^12^ inhabited worlds; Orvonton is illuminated by more than 10 trillion suns (10^13^ suns), then it gives us a first relation of 1 inhabited planet every 10 suns at the level of a superuniverse, although in reality we cannot be sure if this same relation is maintained at the level of a local universe.

Although there are inhabited systems with more than one planet per sun, this is not the norm, so when making estimates, we might assume we count one star for each inhabited world. This means that in Nebadon, we will have approximately 10 million inhabited stars, once the process of life dissemination has concluded.

_Upper limit for the volume of Nebadon:_

We can estimate that the number of stars existing in Nebadon is about 100 million if the proportion of the Superuniverse were maintained, so we can consider this as the maximum ceiling for the number of stars.

Thus, we could visualize Nebadon as a spheroid about 4200 Å in diameter, which is the volume that would contain those 100 million stars.

But there's more data in the UB that can help us estimate Nebadon's size. The UB also tells us about Nebadon's stellar density (i.e., the number of stars per unit volume that we can expect in our own local universe).

> The suns of Nebadon are no different from those of other universes. ... But there is abundant room to accommodate all these enormous suns. They have, by comparison, as much room in space as a dozen oranges circulating within Urantia were the planet a hollow globe. [UB 41:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p3_2)

The following data are not intended to be exact, but they should serve to estimate the order of magnitude of what we are considering. We can estimate, as a starting point, the sizes of an orange and our Earth, as well as those of a medium-sized star. (Appendix 6)

To summarize, leaving the calculations in Appendix 6, the LU estimates for the local universe of Nebadon is a stellar density of 1.173 10^-3^ stars per cubic light year.

The value estimated by science (1.15 10^-3^) (table on pg 24) is not only of the same order of magnitude, but is also very similar to the result calculated with the LU data (1.173 10^-3^)

Which also allows us to reflect that Nebadon probably extends not only through the central part of the galactic plane, but also includes areas of lower stellar density extending through the upper and/or lower part of it.

_Lower limit for the volume of Nebadon:_

Regarding the lower limit to the number of stars, starting from the previously mentioned quote [UB 41:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p3_1) I will establish as a round number (remember that what is important is the order of magnitude more than the value itself), a stellar quantity of 30 million stars, and we will look for a form in space that with the estimated density will allow us to accommodate all those stars.

Number of stars 3010^6^, divided by the density of Nebadon that the LU gives us (1.17 10^-3^), will give us an idea of the volume in cubic meters we are talking about:

$$
V_Nebadon = 30 \cdot 10^{6} / 1.17 \cdot 10^{-3} = 2.564 \cdot 10^{-3} \mathrm{ly}^{3}
$$

This volume would be contained in a sphere with a radius of 1829 ly (3658 ly in diameter).

In short, we have established a volume for Nebadon, which should be between 2.6 x 10^10^ ly^3^ and 8.5 x 10^10^ ly^3^. If we consider densities of the order of 1.17 x 10^-3^ stars per cubic ly (ly^3^).

If we were to move in densities measured by our science for shorter distances of about 2 or 3 thousand to the surrounding area, in which as we saw, the estimated density rose to an average of 3.72 x 10^-3^ stars per cubic light year, we would be talking about a volume range for Nebadon that would go from:

$$
V_{Nebadon} = 30 \cdot 10^{6} / 3.72 \cdot 10^{-3} = 8.06 \cdot 10^{9} \mathrm{ly}^{3}
$$

Until:

$$
V_{Nebadon} = 100 \cdot 10^{6} / 3.72 \cdot 10^{-3} = 2.688 \cdot 10^{10} \mathrm{ly}^{3}
$$

An ellipsoid containing that volume could have measurements on the semi-axes: 2480 x 1900 x 1300 high (Appendix 7).

Since there is not much more data to compare with, in this work, I will adopt a conservative value, assuming for Nebadon as a working volume of 10^10^ to^3^.

#### What shape is Nebadon?

What would be the form of a local universe? The LU itself gives us a clue about this when it describes Havona, defining it as a perfect world, already established and finally stabilized [UB 14:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p0_2) And this perfect world serves as a model for the others, [UB 32:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p3_3), then it is possible that the general form of a local universe tends to resemble the form of the Central Universe. [UB 12:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p2_3)

In this way, the simplest form that resembles the descriptions of Havona and even Paradise itself, is the circle, and with its three-dimensional variants such as the sphere and spheroids.

In a system of perfectly stabilized worlds, and given that astronomical objects are in motion and not stationary, as our logic tells us, the physical model is the ellipse or the circumference, so I will consider the sphere or the ellipsoid (volumes of revolution of the circumference or the ellipse), as the three-dimensional model to be taken into account regarding the shape of the administrative units of the local universe.

In fact, the shape of Paradise itself is a flattened ellipse.

We know that the sizes of the local universes can be quite different, but the amount of visible matter does not appear to vary that much, [UB 32:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p1_3). This leads us to think that with some probability the number of stars contained in the local universes is quite similar, which forces the size of the local universe to be considerably smaller in the areas of greatest stellar density in the galaxy than in the areas of the galactic periphery where more spatial volume is required to contain a similar number of stars.

With this approach, I will start by assuming that Nebadon has an ellipsoid shape of approximately: 2100 ly of the semi-major axis, 1050 ly of the semi-minor axis, which will be located in the galactic plane and a “thickness” i.e. in the direction perpendicular to the galactic plane of about 1000 ly. This volume, already at the density of our galactic environment, would be occupied by a number of stars on the order of 30 million.

Recall that the stellar density for Nebadon provided by the UB was slightly lower, so we had assumed a portion of Nebadon possibly extending into the upper plane of the Milky Way with lower stellar density.

#### Where does Nebadon extend?

Now that we have established a shape and size for Nebadon, let's continue to delve into its position in our Milky Way.

In order to focus and understand what the sizes we have been talking about mean in the Milky Way as a whole, I am going to include some diagrams that are a representation of our own galaxy on a plane seen from above, in which only the central and most populated part appears, and on this representation, we will project figures of certain sizes to estimate their proportions, as accepted by current science.

<figure id="Figure_22" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/015.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

In this image, the yellow-orange dot represents the position of our Sun and solar system, evidently at this scale the Sun and solar system merge into the same point.

I have drawn some concentric circles that help us estimate the distances from our position.

Another image that also presents a legend about the different areas of the galaxy and the galactic coordinates that will allow us to position different galactic elements:

<figure id="Figure_23" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/035.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

An enlarged area of the Milky Way in which we can intuit the volume of space occupied by a sphere of radius 5000 α or 1500 α and 3000 α respectively.

<figure id="Figure_24" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/016.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

We start from the revealed knowledge that our Sun belongs to Nebadon, therefore the circles marked in blue, being centered on our Sun, either in part or in whole, must be part of Nebadon.

Let's now see what LU tells us about where our Sun is within Nebadon...

Satania (our local system) is close to the outermost system of Norlatiadek (our constellation), so there appears to be another system farther out than our own. Even Norlatiadek is now traversing the outer periphery of Nebadon. [UB 41:10.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p10_5)

Then our Sun must be on the outskirts of Nebadon.

A key quote on this subject is: [UB 41:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p3_2) “... The largest star in the universe, the Antares star cloud, is four hundred and fifty times the diameter of your sun and sixty million times its volume.”

It tells us that the largest star in Nebadon is Antares.

This quote is important because it will allow us to deduce, if not so much the exact position that Nebadon occupies within the Milky Way, at least some limits for our Local Universe.

If we look for stars larger than Antares and place them in the Milky Way, we will have a map that will show us the outside of Nebadon, it will allow us to draw a border of which we know that Nebadon is NOT part of it.

To locate the various stars in the galaxy, we will use galactic coordinates and their projection onto the galactic plane to represent them and estimate the outline of Nebadon. A full explanation is provided in Appendix 5.

Although the current scientific estimate for Antares, based on its luminosity and temperature, is 645 solar diameters, I will look for stars that are larger than 450 solar diameters, as indicated by the LU. (Appendix 5)

Representing the projection of these stars larger than Antares in our Milky Way, we obtain a map like the following:

<figure id="Figure_25" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/017.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

Although this is an area that is too large for the volume we assign to Nebadon, it already allows us to intuit the area over which the position of our local universe will be able to extend, which cannot be other than where these stars as large as, or rather larger than, Antares are not found.

Representing these stars in a diagram of the Milky Way, which would be an enlarged portion of the previous image, we would obtain the following situation:

<figure id="Figure_26" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/036.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

The center is our solar system, the green star is Antares (Alpha Scorpio), which belongs to our Local Universe.

The red circle represents a distance of 5000 α from our Sun, which we have already established as outside our Local Universe.

The last blue circle represents those 4200 al of distance, which will be the maximum distance to which we will extend Nebadon.

If we were at the center of our local universe, it would extend over an area between the blue circles marking 2000 and 3000 ly, which could correspond to a radius of 2100 ly.

Now taking into account that our position will be on the outskirts of the Local Universe and also on the outskirts of the System, we will expand an area in which those 4200 to the diameter will fit for our Local Universe

Taking into account, as we mentioned, that we chose the shape of an ellipsoid, the representation on the plane is of an ellipse, an oval of about 4200 to 1/2 in diameter, with our solar system at one end, and we will develop the oval in the area where the stars larger than Antares allow us and which act as our limits.

<figure id="Figure_27" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/018.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

Now we have achieved a size, a shape and a place in the Milky Way of our Local Universe (Nebadon).

### 2.8 Satania, our local system.

Regarding our solar system Monmatia, since it is the starting point of our knowledge, we know that there is only one other solar system that is farther from Jerusem than we are [UB 41:10.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p10_5)

SATANIA. Its headquarters are on Jerusem. Urantia is the 606th of 619 inhabited planets. There are over 200 that are evolving favorably. This makes between 800 and 900 out of a total of 1000. [UB 15:14.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p14_5) So from a physical standpoint, practically and at least 90% of our system is finished.

We know that Satania is far removed from Uversa (the headquarters of the 70th Superuniverse) and also from the great group of suns which function as the physical or astronomical center of Orvonton. [UB 32:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p2_11) . In fact, Satania is near the outermost system of Norlatiadek; that is, there appears to be another system more outer than our own. Even Norlatiadek is now passing through the outer periphery of Nebadon. [UB 41:10.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p10_5) My present opinion is that the physical setting for Satania is now complete; that is, there may be some planets yet to be inhabited, but probably the planets are already formed or in the process of formation.

Once again, Urantia is on the outskirts, in this case also outside the Local System, so in the above scheme we will look toward the center of the local universe for a zone containing between 2,000 and 3,000 stars. [UB 41:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p3_1)

There is an indicator in the revelation itself that tells us that science knows this part so close to us well, since it establishes that of the 30 suns closest to ours, only three are brighter.

To verify this detail, just take a look at Appendix 8, where we find the list of these stars, and how indeed of the 30 closest, only three are brighter.

> Your world is called Urantia, and it is number 606 in the planetary group, or system, of Satania. This system has at present 619 inhabited worlds, and more than two hundred additional planets are evolving favorably toward becoming inhabited worlds at some future time. [UB 15:14.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p14_5)

If the system is expected to have about 1,000 inhabited planets, and taking into account the previous paragraph, there are already more than 820 inhabited worlds on the way.

It can be concluded with little risk of error that virtually all the stars in the system already exist on the cosmic stage.
As I did in the case of Nebadon, we can set an upper and lower limit to determine the size of our local system.

We are told that Satania has over 2000 bright suns, then it would be reasonable to look for a patch of space that contains more than 2000 stars and clearly fewer than 3000.

Thus the estimated volume of Satania for 2200 stars (for example) would be:

$$
V_{Satania} = 2200 / 1.173 \cdot 10^{-3} = 1875533 \mathrm{ly}^{3}
$$

This Volume of Satania would be like that of a sphere with a radius of 76.50 al (153 al in diameter), taking into account that we have used the density that the LU gives us for our Local Universe of Nebadon, similar to the one we have in our Satania system.

If we use the value of stellar density of our cosmic environment, as tabulated of 3.72 x 10^-3^ stars per cubic light year, we would get Volumes of:

$$
V_{Satania} = 2200 / 3.72 \cdot 10^{-3} = 591398 \mathrm{ly}^{3}
$$

In this case we would be talking about a sphere with a radius of 52 ly (104 ly in diameter).

We have established a lower and an upper limit for the spatial volume occupied by our local system, and it is a spheroid of between 52 and 76 μm radius.

A map with the brightest stars within a radius of 50 lys can be found at ([link](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/espanol/50lys.html)):

<figure id="Figure_28" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/019.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

This is a Sun-centered map, but even though the Sun is not at the center of the Satania System, I think it is very likely that most, if not all, of them are part of our Local System.

A schematic of what Satania might look like, which would be configured by stellar objects at a distance less than about 160 ly in the direction in which our Local Universe presumably extends, would be something like that presented in the following two schematics, which would be a view from above of our galaxy and another of its profile.

In the blue circle would be Antares (Alpha Scorpio) which, although belonging to our universe, would be outside our local system.

<figure id="Figure_28" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/020.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

In the following image we have the most enlarged area in which we clearly see Urantia (our Sun would be the orange star in the center), and Satania extending in the direction towards the center of the Milky Way, so Jerusem is possibly near the center of the tangle of white stars represented.

<figure id="Figure_29" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/021.jpg">

<br style="clear:both;"/>

And the profile view in the thickness of the Milky Way:

<br style="clear:both;"/>

With this tour I conclude the work of locating ourselves within our own galaxy, in accordance with what was revealed in the LU.

Below I will detail the explanatory appendices for some of the aspects covered, as well as the quotes from the European edition from which I have extracted the information.

## Appendix 1

### Quotes from The Urantia Book

> The vertical cross section of total space would slightly resemble a Maltese cross, with the horizontal arms representing pervaded (universe) space and the vertical arms representing unpervaded (reservoir) space. The areas between the four arms would separate them somewhat as the midspace zones separate pervaded and unpervaded space. These quiescent midspace zones grow larger and larger at greater and greater distances from Paradise and eventually encompass the borders of all space and completely incapsulate both the space reservoirs and the entire horizontal extension of pervaded space. [UB 11:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p7_3)

> Space is neither a subabsolute state within the Unqualified Absolute, nor its presence, nor is it a function of the Ultimate. It is a gift of Paradise, and the space of the grand universe and all outer regions is believed to be actually penetrated by the ancestral space potency of the Unqualified Absolute. This penetrated space extends horizontally from the vicinity of peripheral Paradise outward throughout the fourth space level and beyond the periphery of the master universe, but how much further we do not know [UB 11:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p7_4)

> **The Seven Superuniverses** are not primary physical organizations; nowhere do their boundaries divide a nebular family, neither do they cross a local universe, a prime creative unit. Each superuniverse is simply a geographic space clustering of approximately one seventh of the organized and partially inhabited post-Havona creation, and each is about equal in the number of local universes embraced and in the space encompassed. **Nebadon**, your local universe, is one of the newer creations in **Orvonton**, the seventh superuniverse. [UB 12:1.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p1_12)

> **The Grand Universe** is the present organized and inhabited creation. It consists of the seven superuniverses, with an aggregate evolutionary potential of around seven trillion inhabited planets, not to mention the eternal spheres of the central creation. But this tentative estimate takes no account of architectural administrative spheres, neither does it include the outlying groups of unorganized universes. The present ragged edge of the grand universe, its uneven and unfinished periphery, together with the tremendously unsettled condition of the whole astronomical plot, suggests to our star students that even the seven superuniverses are, as yet, uncompleted. As we move from within, from the divine center outward in any one direction, we do, eventually, come to the outer limits of the organized and inhabited creation; we come to the outer limits of the grand universe. And it is near this outer border, in a far-off corner of such a magnificent creation, that your local universe has its eventful existence. [UB 12:1.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p1_13)

> Although the unaided human eye can see only two or three nebulae outside the borders of the superuniverse of Orvonton [UB 12:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p2_2)

> In the not-distant future, new telescopes will reveal to the wondering gaze of Urantian astronomers no less than 375 million new galaxies in the remote stretches of outer space. At the same time these more powerful telescopes will disclose that many island universes formerly believed to be in outer space are really a part of the galactic system of Orvonton. The seven superuniverses are still growing; the periphery of each is gradually expanding; new nebulae are constantly being stabilized and organized; and some of the nebulae which Urantian astronomers regard as extragalactic are actually on the fringe of Orvonton and are traveling along with us. [UB 12:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p2_3)

> 1. **Physical Gravity**. Having formulated an estimate of the summation of the entire physical-gravity capacity of the grand universe, they have laboriously effected a comparison of this finding with the estimated total of absolute gravity presence now operative. These calculations indicate that the total gravity action on the grand universe is a very small part of the estimated gravity pull of Paradise, computed on the basis of the gravity response of basic physical units of universe matter. These investigators reach the amazing conclusion that the central universe and the surrounding seven superuniverses are at the present time making use of only about five per cent of the active functioning of the Paradise absolute-gravity grasp. In other words: At the present moment about ninety-five per cent of the active cosmic-gravity action of the Isle of Paradise, computed on this totality theory, is engaged in controlling material systems beyond the borders of the present organized universes. These calculations all refer to absolute gravity; linear gravity is an interactive phenomenon which can be computed only by knowing the actual Paradise gravity. [UB 12:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p3_8)

> This is the one and only settled, perfect, and established aggregation of worlds. This is a wholly created and perfect universe; it is not an evolutionary development. [UB 14:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p0_2)

> The Havona planetary circuits are not superimposed; their worlds follow each other in an orderly linear procession. The central universe whirls around the stationary Isle of Paradise in one vast plane, consisting of ten concentric stabilized units—the three circuits of Paradise spheres and the seven circuits of Havona worlds. Physically regarded, the Havona and the Paradise circuits are all one and the same system; their separation is in recognition of functional and administrative segregation. [UB 14:1.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p1_10)

> On the outskirts of this vast central universe, far out beyond the seventh belt of Havona worlds, there swirl an unbelievable number of enormous dark gravity bodies. These multitudinous dark masses are quite unlike other space bodies in many particulars; even in form they are very different. These dark gravity bodies neither reflect nor absorb light; they are nonreactive to physical-energy light, and they so completely encircle and enshroud Havona as to hide it from the view of even near-by inhabited universes of time and space. [UB 14:1.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p1_14)

> The Havona planetary circuits are not superimposed; their worlds follow each other in an orderly linear procession. The central universe whirls around the stationary Isle of Paradise in one vast plane, consisting of ten concentric stabilized units—the three circuits of Paradise spheres and the seven circuits of Havona worlds. Physically regarded, the Havona and the Paradise circuits are all one and the same system; their separation is in recognition of functional and administrative segregation. [UB 14:1.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p1_10)

> Within the limited range of the records, observations, and memories of the generations of a million or a billion of your short years, to all practical intents and purposes, Urantia and the universe to which it belongs are experiencing the adventure of one long and uncharted plunge into new space; but according to the records of Uversa, in accordance with older observations, in harmony with the more extensive experience and calculations of our order, and as a result of conclusions based on these and other findings, we know that the universes are engaged in an orderly, well-understood, and perfectly controlled processional, swinging in majestic grandeur around the First Great Source and Center and his residential universe. [UB 15:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p1_1)

> Urantia is situated in a local universe and a superuniverse not fully organized, and your local universe is in immediate proximity to numerous partially completed physical creations. You belong to one of the relatively recent universes. But you are not, today, plunging on wildly into uncharted space nor swinging out blindly into unknown regions. You are following the orderly and predetermined path of the superuniverse space level. You are now passing through the very same space that your planetary system, or its predecessors, traversed ages ago; and some day in the remote future your system, or its successors, will again traverse the identical space through which you are now so swiftly plunging. [UB 15:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p1_3)

> Urantia belongs to a system which is well out towards the borderland of your local universe; and your local universe is at present traversing the periphery of Orvonton. Beyond you there are still others, but you are far removed in space from those physical systems which swing around the great circle in comparative proximity to the Great Source and Center. [UB 15:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p1_6)

> Each of the seven superuniverses is constituted, approximately, as follows:
> One system embraces, approximately. . . . . . . . . 1,000 worlds
> One constellation (100 systems). . . . . . . . . . . . 100,000 worlds
> One universe (100 constellations) . . . . . . . . . 10,000,000 worlds

> Practically all of the starry realms visible to the naked eye on Urantia belong to the seventh section of the grand universe, the superuniverse of Orvonton. The vast Milky Way starry system represents the central nucleus of Orvonton [UB 15:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p3_1)

> The rotational center of your minor sector is situated far away in the enormous and dense star cloud of Sagittarius, around which your local universe and its associated creations all move, and from opposite sides of the vast Sagittarius subgalactic system you may observe two great streams of star clouds emerging in stupendous stellar coils. [UB 15:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p3_5)

> The Sagittarius sector and all other sectors and divisions of Orvonton are in rotation around Uversa, and some of the confusion of Urantian star observers arises out of the illusions and relative distortions produced by the following multiple revolutionary movements:
> 1. The revolution of Urantia around its sun.
> 2. The circuit of your solar system about the nucleus of the former Andronover nebula.
> 3. The rotation of the Andronover stellar family and the associated clusters about the composite rotation-gravity center of the star cloud of Nebadon.
> 4. The swing of the local star cloud of Nebadon and its associated creations around the Sagittarius center of their minor sector.
> 5. The rotation of the one hundred minor sectors, including Sagittarius, about their major sector.
> 6. The whirl of the ten major sectors, the so-called star drifts, about the Uversa headquarters of Orvonton.
> 7. The movement of Orvonton and six associated superuniverses around Paradise and Havona, the counterclockwise processional of the superuniverse space level. [UB 15:3.7-14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p3_7)

> Not all spiral nebulae are engaged in sun making. Some have retained control of many of their segregated stellar offspring, and their spiral appearance is occasioned by the fact that their suns pass out of the nebular arm in close formation but return by diverse routes, thus making it easy to observe them at one point but more difficult to see them when widely scattered on their different returning routes farther out and away from the arm of the nebula. There are not many sun-forming nebulae active in Orvonton at the present time, though Andromeda, which is outside the inhabited superuniverse, is very active. This far-distant nebula is visible to the naked eye, and when you view it, pause to consider that the light you behold left those distant suns almost one million years ago.
> The Milky Way galaxy is composed of vast numbers of former spiral and other nebulae, and many still retain their original configuration. But as the result of internal catastrophes and external attraction, many have suffered such distortion and rearrangement as to cause these enormous aggregations to appear as gigantic luminous masses of blazing suns, like the Magellanic Cloud. The globular type of star clusters predominates near the outer margins of Orvonton. [UB 15:4.7-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p4_8)

> The superuniverse of Orvonton is illuminated and warmed by more than ten trillion blazing suns. [UB 15:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p6_10)

> A **major sector** comprises about one tenth of a superuniverse and consists of one hundred minor sectors, ten thousand local universes, about one hundred billion inhabitable worlds. [UB 15:13.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p13_1)

> The **minor sector** governments are presided over by three Recents of Days. Their administration is concerned mainly with the physical control, unification, stabilization, and routine co-ordination of the administration of the component local universes. Each minor sector embraces as many as one hundred local universes, ten thousand constellations, one million systems, or about one billion inhabitable worlds. [UB 15:13.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p13_4)

> Your world is called Urantia, and it is number 606 in the planetary group, or system, of Satania. This system has at present 619 inhabited worlds, and more than two hundred additional planets are evolving favorably toward becoming inhabited worlds at some future time.
> Satania has a headquarters world called Jerusem, and it is system number twenty-four in the constellation of Norlatiadek. Your constellation, Norlatiadek, consists of one hundred local systems and has a headquarters world called Edentia. Norlatiadek is number seventy in the universe of Nebadon. The local universe of Nebadon consists of one hundred constellations and has a capital known as Salvington. The universe of Nebadon is number eighty-four in the minor sector of Ensa. [UB 15:14.5-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p13_4)

> The minor sector of Ensa consists of one hundred local universes and has a capital called Uminor the third. This minor sector is number three in the major sector of Splandon. Splandon consists of one hundred minor sectors and has a headquarters world called Umajor the fifth. It is the fifth major sector of the superuniverse of Orvonton, the seventh segment of the grand universe. Thus you can locate your planet in the scheme of the organization and administration of the universe of universes.
> The grand universe number of your world, Urantia, is 5,342,482,337,666. That is the registry number on Uversa and on Paradise, your number in the catalogue of the inhabited worlds. I know the physical-sphere registry number, but it is of such an extraordinary size that it is of little practical significance to the mortal mind. [UB 15:14.7-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p14_7)

> 2. **Mechanical Controllers.** These are the exceedingly versatile and mobile assistants of the associate power directors. Trillions upon trillions of them are commissioned in Ensa, your minor sector. [UB 29:4.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_18)

> The local universes are all approximately of the same energy potential, though they differ greatly in physical dimensions and may vary in visible-matter content from time to time. [UB 32:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p1_3)

> The Satania system of inhabited worlds is far removed from Uversa and that great sun cluster which functions as the physical or astronomic center of the seventh superuniverse. From Jerusem, the headquarters of Satania, it is over two hundred thousand light-years to the physical center of the superuniverse of Orvonton, far, far away in the dense diameter of the Milky Way. Satania is on the periphery of the local universe, and Nebadon is now well out towards the edge of Orvonton. From the outermost system of inhabited worlds to the center of the superuniverse is a trifle less than two hundred and fifty thousand light-years. [UB 32:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p2_11)

> Except in the central universe, perfection is a progressive attainment. In the central creation we have a pattern of perfection, but all other realms must attain that perfection by the methods established for the advancement of those particular worlds or universes. [UB 32:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p3_3)

> One or more—even many—such nebulae may be encompassed within the domain of a single local universe even as Nebadon was physically assembled out of the stellar and planetary progeny of Andronover and other nebulae. The spheres of Nebadon are of diverse nebular ancestry, but they all had a certain minimum commonness of space motion which was so adjusted by the intelligent efforts of the power directors as to produce our present aggregation of space bodies, which travel along together as a contiguous unit over the orbits of the superuniverse.
> Such is the constitution of the local star cloud of Nebadon, which today swings in an increasingly settled orbit about the Sagittarius center of that minor sector of Orvonton to which our local creation belongs. [UB 41:0.3-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p0_3)

> Satania itself is composed of over seven thousand astronomical groups, or physical systems, few of which had an origin similar to that of your solar system. The astronomic center of Satania is an enormous dark island of space which, with its attendant spheres, is situated not far from the headquarters of the system government. [UB 41:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p2_2)

> There are upward of two thousand brilliant suns pouring forth light and energy in Satania, and your own sun is an average blazing orb.
> The suns of Nebadon are not unlike those of other universes. The material composition of all suns, dark islands, planets, and satellites, even meteors, is quite identical. These suns have an average diameter of about one million miles, that of your own solar orb being slightly less. The largest star in the universe, the stellar cloud Antares, is four hundred and fifty times the diameter of your sun and is sixty million times its volume. But there is abundant space to accommodate all of these enormous suns. They have just as much comparative elbow room in space as one dozen oranges would have if they were circulating about throughout the interior of Urantia, and were the planet a hollow globe. [UB 41:3.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p3_1)

> In one group of variable stars the period of light fluctuation is directly dependent on luminosity, and knowledge of this fact enables astronomers to utilize such suns as universe lighthouses or accurate measuring points for the further exploration of distant star clusters. By this technique it is possible to measure stellar distances most precisely up to more than one million light-years. Better methods of space measurement and improved telescopic technique will sometime more fully disclose the ten grand divisions of the superuniverse of Orvonton; you will at least recognize eight of these immense sectors as enormous and fairly symmetrical star clusters. [UB 41:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p3_10)

> Urantia is comparatively isolated on the outskirts of Satania, your solar system, with one exception, being the farthest removed from Jerusem, while Satania itself is next to the outermost system of Norlatiadek, and this constellation is now traversing the outer fringe of Nebadon. [UB 41:10.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p10_5)

> Mankind should understand that we who participate in the revelation of truth are very rigorously limited by the instructions of our superiors. We are not at liberty to anticipate the scientific discoveries of a thousand years. Revelators must act in accordance with the instructions which form a part of the revelation mandate. We see no way of overcoming this difficulty, either now or at any future time. We full well know that, while the historic facts and religious truths of this series of revelatory presentations will stand on the records of the ages to come, within a few short years many of our statements regarding the physical sciences will stand in need of revision in consequence of additional scientific developments and new discoveries. These new developments we even now foresee, but we are forbidden to include such humanly undiscovered facts in the revelatory records. Let it be made clear that revelations are not necessarily inspired. The cosmology of these revelations **is not inspired**. It is limited by our permission for the co-ordination and sorting of present-day knowledge. While divine or spiritual insight is a gift, **human wisdom must evolve**.

The gray plane is the one that contains our galaxy, which is at coordinates (0,0,0).

The units of measurement are kiloparsecs (1 kpsc = 3260 al).

If we look at the projection on the planes, the galaxies that are above our galactic plane are represented in green, and those that are below in blue.

### Photograph of the M24 area

The photograph is made by grouping 35 individual images totaling 2 hours and 39 minutes of exposure, of the Sagittarius zone indicated in the diagrams.

The area photographed is towards the South on summer nights.

70mm lens closed at f:4.0, the night of July 10-11, 2010, from Torroja del Priorat (Tarragona)

I used a DSLR camera on a telescope mount to compensate for the Earth's rotational motion.

## Appendix 5

### Galactic coordinates. Stars larger than Antares.

The usual system for giving the coordinates of a celestial object is by RA (right ascension) and Dec (declination), but this system is geocentric, and will not be as intuitive when representing the position of different objects within the Milky Way.

The fact that we do not place the origin of the coordinates on the Earth but on the Sun is also irrelevant, given that the Earth-Sun distance is tiny compared to intergalactic distances, so we will use the galactic coordinate system.

This coordinate system is centered on the Sun, and aligned with the apparent center of the Milky Way so that the equator is aligned with the plane of the galaxy.

The coordinates are galactic longitude and latitude.

The **galactic longitude** is measured on the plane of the galaxy, counterclockwise from the line that joins the Sun with the center of the galaxy (0° ≤ l ≤ 360°).

**Galactic latitude** is the angle an object makes with the plane of the galaxy. It is measured in positive degrees north and negative degrees south (-90° ≤ b ≤ 90°).

<figure id="Figure_33" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/024.jpg">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

The origin of coordinates with this system is found in the [equatorial coordinates](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordenadas_ecuatoriales): [right ascension](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascensi%C3%B3n_recta) $=17 h 45 m$ $37,224 s$, [declination](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declinaci%C3%B3n_(astronom%C3%ADa)) = -28° 56' 10.23'' (in the constellation of Sagittarius), although the true center of the Milky Way -corresponding to [Sagittarius A*](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*)- is slightly displaced from this point, in right ascension = 17h 45m 40.04s, declination = -29° 00' 28.1'' (galactic coordinates: I = 359° 56' 39.5'', b = -0° 2' 46.3''), the Galactic North Pole is located at the coordinates: right ascension = 12h 51m 26.282s, declination = +27° 07' 42.01'' (in the constellation of [Coma Berenices](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_Berenices)), and the South Galactic Pole at the coordinates: right ascension = 0h 51m 26.00s, declination = -27° 7' 42.0'' (in the constellation of [Sculptor](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculptor)). All these coordinates are given for [J2000](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89poca_(astronom%C3%ADa))

Since the galactic coordinates do not tell us the distance to the Sun, I will include an additional calculation, to try to later make the representation of the projection on the galactic plane of the object in question, which will give me a projection distance that will be the result of multiplying its distance in latitude by the cosine of the latitude.

## Appendix 6

### Relative sizes

We will perform calculations to estimate the stellar density in our own local universe.

We will start from some average data of the objects to be compared, we will make the corresponding calculations and we will obtain the average density of stellar population in Nebadon

- Average size of an orange: we can assume about 8 cm in diameter. (0.08 m)
- Earth size: radius 6371 km (6,371,000 m) (12,742,000 m)
- Medium-sized sun 1,600,000 km (1,600,000,000 m) in diameter.

To make the calculation easier and since it is an approximation, we will estimate that the volume that houses the 12 stars is spherical.

Then the proportion between the size of an orange and that of the Earth will be the same as that of the Sun and a sphere of space, which will be the volume that houses 12 stars.

$$
\frac{0.08}{12 742 000}=\frac{1 600 000 000}{x}
$$

Since what we have placed in the proportion are diameters in $m$, the result of clearing “$x$” will be the diameter in meters of the sphere of space that houses 12 suns.

X = 2.548410 10^17^ m, to make it more manageable and taking into account that a light year (ly) is equivalent to 9.4607 10^15^ m.

X = 26.9367 in diameter, which has a volume of:

$$
V = \frac{4 \pi r^{3}}{3}
$$

$$
V = 10233.67 \mathrm{ly}^{3}
$$

If 12 stars are housed in this volume V, the approximate density in stars per cubic light year will be:

$\mathrm{d}=\frac{n \text { stars }}{\text { Volume }}$

$d=12 / 10233.67 =1.173 \cdot 10^{-3}$ stars per cubic light year.

## Appendix 7

### Volumes of ellipsoids

<figure id="Figure_34" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/Spain_Association/Una_aproximacion_al_universo_local_de_Nebadon/026.jpg">
</figure>

$V=\frac{4 \pi}{3} abc$

Where a , b and c are the lengths of the semiaxes on the $\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{y}, \mathrm{z}$ axes of the figure.

In this way, an ellipsoid with the semiaxes:

a: 2480 to

b: 1900 to

c: 1300 to

It gives a volume of 2.566 x 10^10^ ly^3^, which with the estimated densities we will have a range of results that will focus us on the possible size of Nebadon.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

If we consider the density provided by the LU for Nebadon of $1.17310^{-3}$ stars per cubic light year, the maximum ceiling of the number of stars of 100 million requires a volume:

Volume = 10^8^ / 1.173 x 10^-3^ = 8.525 x 10^10^ ly^3^

If we go to the rounded lower limit of 30 million stars, which we already mentioned above, the volume is set to:

Volume = 3 10^7^ / 1.173 10^-3^ = 2.558 10^10^ ly^3^

It can even be verified that by taking densities from our closest environment that we had already established at about 3 times the numbers provided by the LU, we will still be in the same order of magnitude for the volume of the local universe.

## Appendix 8

### Stars closest to us

In this table, we find the relationship of the 50 stars closest to us, and some interesting data such as the spectral type that will tell us about its temperature, the columns of visual magnitude (m) and absolute magnitude (M), the latter is what will allow us to compare the brightness of two objects, since the measurement it indicates is as if both were placed at the same distance, however the visual magnitude tells us the brightness with which we observe the object from Earth.

Then the coordinates in Right Ascension and Declination appear, as well as the distance in light years to us.

We have 50 star systems within a radius of 17 al, with a total of 67 stars, in which the data that science provides us are the magnitudes of these stars, the (m) visual magnitude is the brightness with which we see them from Earth, it is the apparent magnitude, which appears when we observe it, but since not all stars are at the same distance, if we do not know how far away the star we are observing is, we cannot know how much it really shines, for this, astronomy has defined another concept (M) which is the absolute Magnitude, which is the apparent magnitude (brightness) that the body would have if it were placed 10 parsecs away or 32.616 al away. In this way we can compare the brightness of the two bodies. We must also bear in mind that the magnitude values go a little against the usual logic, so that the brighter a body is, its magnitude value is smaller, and can have negative values.

The differences in brightness between the brightest stars (m = 1) (1st magnitude), and the weakest ones that we can see with the naked eye (on a moonless night and away from artificial lights) which are $m=6$ (6th magnitude) is about 100 times. So a 1st magnitude star shines 2.5 times more than a 2nd magnitude star.

Therefore, to check what is indicated in the LU:

> There are over two thousand brilliant suns shedding their light and energy upon Satania, and your own sun is a blazing globe of the average type. Of the thirty suns nearest your own, only three are brighter. [UB 41:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p3_1)

We have to compare the (M) absolute magnitudes, and if we look at the included table, the M of the Sun is 4.85, then any star with an M lower than this value will indicate that it is brighter than the Sun.

If we look closely at the table, which also shows the distances of stars from the Sun, we see that the 30 closest stars begin with number 1, Proxima Centauri, at 4,242 ly, and end with number 19 on the DX Cancri list, located 11,826 ly away. And only three stars are actually brighter than the Sun (M = 4.85):

Alpha Centauri A... M= 4.38

Sirius A.... M=1.48

Procyon A.... M=2.66
