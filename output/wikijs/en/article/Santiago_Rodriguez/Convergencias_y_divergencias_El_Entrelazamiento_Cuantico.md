_Possible endorsement of the Standard Particle Model and possible divergence with the UB_

One of the many surprising and novel things about what is established in the UB, with respect to any other revelation, is found in the description of the supervisory tasks that high-ranking beings carry out in the universes and in the superuniverses.

They describe to us a physical world that has certain limitations, and the beings that administer the Great Universe see themselves in the need of having information in real time about what happens in any part of it. But the distances are immense and mechanisms are needed to overcome these drawbacks, which on the other hand are typical of the spatiotemporal structure of the portion of reality that we could call “finite reality”, as opposed to what would be “absonite reality”.

The UB describes a truly surprising phenomenon that, although it operates on a mental and spiritual level, also works on a material level:

> _The Conjoint Actor is able to co-ordinate all levels of universe actuality in such manner as to make possible the simultaneous recognition of the mental, the material, and the spiritual. This is the phenomenon of *universe reflectivity,* that unique and inexplicable power to see, hear, sense, and know all things as they transpire throughout a superuniverse, and to focalize, by reflectivity, all this information and knowledge at any desired point. The action of reflectivity is shown in perfection on each of the headquarters worlds of the seven superuniverses. It is also operative throughout all sectors of the superuniverses_ (<a id="a46_636"></a>[UB 9:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/9#p7_1))

I certainly don't think we can even glimpse the mechanisms of this extraordinary process. But it is also true that in nature, in its broadest sense, things happen gradually; there is usually a close relationship between everything that exists. Somehow they are not isolated mechanisms, but are interrelated, so perhaps we could come across material phenomena that somehow share part of the mechanisms of these strange and extraordinary (at least for us) reflectivity phenomena.

At least that is what certain experiences suggest to me that seem strange to science and to the classical concept of reality and, of course, to our frequently inflexible common sense.

Despite the fact that certain conclusions drawn from the theory of quantum mechanics were not very acceptable to Einstein himself, the fact is that little by little this theory has been imposed, because the predictions it makes are very precise and fit tremendously. to what is observed experimentally, no matter how disturbing it may seem.

Quantum teleportation processes have been achieved 143 km away: http://science.portalhispanos.com/wordpress/2012/09/09/un-experimento-de-la-esa-en-tenerife-bate-elrecord-mundial-de-teleportacion-cuantica/

More experiments with quantum teleportation between diamond crystals (macroscopic objects): http://neofronteras.com/?p=3674

We can even speak of establishing from the present a fact in the past:

Without going into any kind of technical detail, and trying to simplify the experiment as much as possible, we could say that one of the disturbing predictions for common sense, including that of scientists, of quantum mechanics has been physically verified.

We can “entangle two particles”, then we can theoretically separate them as much as we want (in the experiment they did it 143 km apart), we could even make them several light-years away from each other, and the theory it allows (and the experiment corroborates it) that when we act on one of them, in some way that we do not understand, that information is transferred automatically and at the same moment to the other particle.

Obviously, this opens up a wide variety of possibilities that are being explored.

And I can't help but remember that I had already read about this phenomenon of instantaneous transmission of information somewhere (although surely reflectivity is even more powerful and complex than what we have found), but this convergence of UB and modern science.
