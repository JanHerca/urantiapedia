As diverse representatives of the JOINT ACTOR, the Supreme Spirits constitute the reliable representatives of the sovereignty of the spirit-in-power of the Supreme Being, who does not yet personally exercise power. And, through the Reflective Spirits, they synchronize the governments of the superuniverses.

“SUPREMACY is diversified Deity”

The Deity level of Supremacy can be conceived as a reality of activity related to finite existences. Finite realities may not have an end, but they always have a beginning. Creatures are limited by space and time; they are created.

Deity can be personalized as God, and can be prepersonal and superpersonal.

The Deity is all that is divine and is characterized by unity.

Deity can be existential, as in the case of the Universal Father, the Eternal Son, and the Infinite Spirit. It can be associative in the case of God the Sevenfold. However, in the Supreme Being, Deity is experiential and diversified.

Thus, the SUPREME BEING is the god of time and space, a god who as a supreme being is experiencing, experimenting and evolving.

The SUPREME BEING is the focalization of the shadow projected by the Infinite Absolute, which culminates the transmutation of existential potentials at the level of the experiential manifestation of the finite.

In doing so, the SUPREME BEING is carrying out the task of personally identifying the creature with the CREATOR and achieving unity in the Godhead as an evolved god.

In the matter of eternity relationships, the function of Deity is twofold; God the FATHER, God the SON, and God the SPIRIT are eternal and existential, while in the conceptions of God the ULTIMATE, God the SEVENFOLD, and God the ABSOLUTE, they are post-creation personalities of the central universe Havona who are actualizing on the spheres of time and space.

These high, actualizing Deity personalities are eternal in the future, from the moment they acquire personality and power in the growing universes through the technique of experiential actualization.

Therefore the presence of the Deity is twofold: existential and experiential.

The SUPREME BEING is a diversified Deity in the process of formation and is at the same time the evolutionary unification of experiential Deity. [UB 14:6.23](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p6_23)

The creation of Havona is the eternal and perfect proof of the spiritual reality of the SUPREME BEING. Havona is a revelation of the perfect and symmetrical nature of GOD THE SUPREME prior to the beginning of the power-personality synthesis of the finite reflections of the Paradise Deities in the experiential universes of time and space.

Havona is the perfect model of the SUPREME BEING's universal potential. It is a finished picture of the perfection that the SUPREME BEING will one day in the future achieve.

THE SUPREME BEING has a triple function in the experience of mortal man:

- **First**: He is the unifier of the space-time Divinity of GOD THE SEPTUPPLE.
- **Second**: It is the maximum of the Deity that finite creatures can understand.
- **Third**: It is the only way for mortal man to approach the transcendental experience of relating to the absonite minds, the Eternal Spirit and the Paradise personalities.

Those ascending mortals who succeed in attaining the Finaliter goal, having been instructed on the superuniverse spheres and trained in the Central Universe of Havona, accumulate in their personal experience the potentials for full comprehension of the divinity of GOD THE SEVENFOLD, but unified in the SUPREME BEING. Subsequently, the Finaliters serve in the universes not of their nativity for the further acquisition of experience.

And it is through the ministry of the indwelling Adjusters that finaliters can encounter the UNIVERSAL FATHER. But it is through experience that they come to know the SUPREME BEING.

The finaliters are destined for the revelation of the Supreme Deity to the universes of the future in outer space beyond the Grand Universe. ([UB 56:8.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p8_2))

The Supreme Being is the Deity culmination of the experiential evolution of the Grand Universe; he is the total synthesis of space-time evolution; he is physical evolution around a Spirit nucleus and the dominion of the Spirit nucleus over the surrounding and revolving realms of physical evolution.

This is a reaction to the divine mandate of the highest Paradise personality, in the sense of DIVINE HIGHNESS. It is a reaction of the finite mortal and personal human to the personalization of THE SUPREME BEING, which is actualized in the culmination of the totalizing experience of the evolutionary finite of time and space.

Do you remember how an anthill works? Each individual in the anthill works, or rather, fulfills its function as part of the whole, unaware that it belongs to the whole. The anthill.

In the African jungles, when the swarm arises, billions of ants move as a single individual who, directed by an inexplicable force-group mind, known as the spirit of the anthill, devastates every edible element, animal or vegetable in its path (It works in the same way as the spirit of the hive; which perhaps, is better known to you)

This is a crude example of the meaning of the Supreme Being but it helps to understand the idea or concept.

The concept of the SUPREME BEING must provide for the differential recognition of Spirit personality, evolutionary power, and power-personality synthesis. That is, the unification of all evolutionary power with the evolving Spirit personality. ([UB 106:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/106#p2_2))

Something like the unification of the WWW of the global Internet with the power of personal action and decision, as if it were a single intelligence. Millions of individuals use this system to communicate and obtain information. In reality, it is the sum and synthesis of the knowledge of the computer world. It is another example of an approach to the concept of the SUPREME BEING. Someday, by who knows what means, this could become universal. Who knows?

Well, as a final analysis, the Infinite Spirit, who is God in his manifestation as the third person of Paradise Deity, descends through the central universe of Havona and expands throughout space-time, providing forces, energies, matters, and minds in the universe spheres of universes of time and space.

Forces and energies are organized and evolved in deep and vast space, or rather, are organized by the sons of the Infinite Spirit, the Power Directors, the Power Controllers, and the Power Centers, in conjunction with the sons of the Eternal Son—the Creator Sons of God—all of this is experiential; it is a transaction in time and space involving a wide range of living beings, including both creator divinities and evolving creatures.

All of this is a transmutation of forces and energies in a sequential, not sudden, manner. Everything in its due time develops according to divinely established plans; nothing in this vast creation is a product of chance, but rather a product of the CAUSALITY of all causes. Now there is something where before there was nothing, something that develops, grows, and organizes. From the spiritual and physical forces emerge the various energies that organize themselves according to a creative and intelligent plan or project; and when the organized energies condense, matter emerges, seemingly inert, and from it, inert matter, emerges life implanted by the existing spiritual life. Material life develops, becomes intelligent, recognizes its Maker, and then elevates itself until it comes to resemble the One who created it. For there are those who have so decided, and look! When all is completed, all will be good, beautiful, and true.

This entire enormous transaction encompasses a wide range of beings and things in numbers that border on the limits of the concept of infinity, including even absonite beings with divine characteristics, creators, and evolutionary creatures.

The entire process encompasses the vast experience of divinity in space and time, from the Thought Adjusters to the incarnated life of the Paradise Sons of God.

The Supreme Being is power gained, experience accumulated in the long process of creation, demonstrated power, experiential power in contrast to the unfathomable power of Paradise eternity. In the Supreme Being, power is accumulation, summation, and demonstrated synthesis. In short, it is the accumulated values of the experiential beings of all creation in the universes of time and space. It is the path back to HIM Who created it. The return to God.

The Supreme Being encompasses all values that evolve in time and space, achieving a spiritual personalization of all that is valuable.

Even finite mortals participate in the personal experience of the Supreme. Integration into the Supreme enables them with certainty to attain the sublime experience of attaining Paradise and being able to see the FATHER God.

Michael of Nebadon—Who is like God—is like the Paradise Father because he partakes of Paradise perfection; thus, evolving finite mortals on their ascension career will one day attain kinship with the experiential Supreme because they truly share and are a part of the evolution of the experiential Supreme.

## EXISTENCE AND EXPERIENCE

Time, space, and experience constitute obstacles to creaturely conception; yet without time and space, experience and the existence of experiential creatures are not possible. No creature could achieve sufficient understanding to perceive the reality of the spaceless universe. Without spatial perception, no creature could imagine the simultaneous relationships between interacting things and phenomena in its environment, much less in the distant cosmos. Without sensitivity to time, no creature could possibly perceive the relationships of sequence, the chain of time's passage. Without experience, no evolving creature could even exist. Only the ABSOLUTES of infinity truly transcend experience because they are existential. They exist in the continuous present of eternity.

At the absolute level, there is no such thing as space-time. All potentials can be perceived as actual.

For mortal and finite, material and evolutionary creatures, a life based on living the will of the Eternal Father leads directly to the attainment of spirit supremacy in the personal realm and brings the creature one step closer in the personal realm to an understanding of the Universal Father. (The creature knows a little more about the Universal Father when he attains the Degree of Supremacy, that is, when he becomes integrated into the SUPREME BEING.) It is a God-knowing personality, one that is inwardly illumined by intelligent worship and outwardly dedicated to the wholly sincere service of the universal brotherhood of all personalities into a loving and merciful servant. These qualities of life are unifying the evolving personality; on the ever-ascending levels of cosmic wisdom and self-realization, they are moving toward God-encounter and the loving worship of the Eternal Father. (LU 106:9.12)

In Document 115, we read that no matter how much a finite creature with a human mind evolves, it will never be able to fully understand universal realities, for the simple reason that for a mind of limited capacity and limited understanding, there is no possibility due to a lack of capacity. It's like trying to put the ocean inside a bottle.

The human mind, even if highly developed and with great untapped potential, is only so far-reaching. Therefore, human beings must be content with a relative understanding that may be sufficient for the purpose for which they were created. For higher understanding, it is necessary to be endowed with a supermind.

When the human mind wants to discover the realities that have made it what it is, where it comes from, in what environment it finds itself at the spatial and temporal level, it often asks questions and seeks answers that may be incorrect or erroneous conclusions, and that is why it needs help from a supermind; a mind that truly teaches it about ancient times and how things were made and what were the causes that projected and procreated life as we know it today.

Even if we come to understand something about truth, beauty, and goodness—morality, ethics, love, duty, the origin of existence, purpose, Deity, destiny in space-time—it will always be a partial and relative understanding for finite mortals.

The comprehension of God is far more than that of Father, but the concept “FATHER” is the highest human concept capable of comprehension; nevertheless, the comprehension of the Father-Son relationship is enhanced by the comprehension of the Creator-creature relationship and by those supermortal concepts of Deity which will be attained on Uversa, the superuniverse headquarters of Orvonton, and in Havona, the central universe headquarters, culminating on Paradise, the headquarters and residence of universe Deity: the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.

When man reasons about the realities of the universe, he must think logically within a universal framework, but this does not mean that he cannot visualize other structures of higher thought that have a place within his capacity for thought.

To facilitate the relative understanding of the cosmic reality of the universe of universes, the exposition can be presented at three levels of thought: the finite level, the absonite level, and the absolute level. Of these three levels, only the absolute level is eternal and unqualified, truly existential. “The Absolute simply IS.”

The absonite and finite levels are derivatives or conditioned modifications, transactions or attenuated qualifications of the original, primordial, and absolute reality of infinity.

The realms of the finite exist by virtue of the will and eternal purpose of the mind of the existential realms.

The minds of high or low (but finite) creatures may and do propose theories concerning cosmic values, but in the final analysis, when investigated in depth, the finite exists because a first cause (God) so willed it to.

The wise man observes his surroundings, marvels, and is perplexed; he cannot explain such wonder in the nature that surrounds him, and he attributes intelligent characteristics to nature based on the phenomena he observes in the relationships of ecosystems. For life to emerge and sustain itself, many complex factors intervene in the process, for anyone to think of it as mere chance.

From the point of view of a finite creature, infinity contains potentials that are a future possibility, rather than a present possibility.

Value or worth is a concept of broad significance in universal reality. (We perceive things, facts, ideas, which we measure and categorize by their value.)

From an existential perspective, nothing new can occur in the galaxies of the universes, because the condition of completeness of infinity is inherent in the “I AM,” which is eternally present in the seven Absolutes; it is functionally associated in the trinities, and transmissibly associated in the triodities. But the fact that infinity is present in this way (existentially) does not hinder, or make inevitable, the possibility of new cosmic experiences.

The whole scheme of creation and evolution on all experiential levels is apparently a matter of converting potentials into actuals, and this transmutation or transformation is equally relevant in the domains of space power, mental power, and Spiritual power.

The method by which the potential possibilities of the cosmos are transformed into actual existents varies according to the level, being experiential evolution in the finite and experiential-eventual at the absonite level.

Now, existential infinity is truly indescribable in its entirety. But precisely for this reason, it must include, as part of its totality, the possibility for finite evolutionary experience (from origin to final goal). And logically, all of this implies progressive growth in quantity, quality, diversity, and ultimately universal unification.

The possibility of such experiential growth becomes actual-universal through the triodic relationships affecting, upon, and in the Supreme.

Everything related to the Supreme Being's creation is linked to the realization of being and doing something real and valuable. Thus, everything of true spatial, personal, mental, and spiritual value is integrated into the Supreme Being, because, having emerged from the fundamental First Original Source, Eternal and Infinite, it returns with the purpose of becoming something of divine quality, with the accumulated values of personal experience, which, when combined, receive the unification personality in the image and likeness of its Creator.

The best example we have is Michael of Nebadon, who having left the Paradise Central Island, passing through the central universe of Havona, arrived in the space of the Grand Universe (Orvonton) to create the local universe of Nebadon, resides on the capital Salvington and from there descends to Urantia (Earth); takes human form, passes through the experience of human life suffering an atrocious death by crucifixion, conquers death by resurrecting on the third day and returns victorious to the heights; is recognized by the Most Highs as ruler of his local universe by merits of his own experience and attains (or better yet, achieves) Supremacy.

On one occasion, Jesus of Nazareth was speaking with a young man, the Indian youth Ganid, who was accompanying the Master on his tour through Alexandria. ([UB 130:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p4_2)) Speaking of reality, he said: _The source of universe reality is the Infinite. The material things of finite creation are the time-space repercussions of the Paradise Pattern and the Universal Mind of the eternal God. Causation in the physical world, self-consciousness in the intellectual world, and progressing selfhood in the spirit world—these realities, projected on a universal scale, combined in eternal relatedness, and experienced with perfection of quality and divinity of value—constitute THE REALITY OF THE SUPREME. The highest level attainable by finite creatures is the recognition of the Universal Father and the knowledge of the SUPREME._

The creature can only unify with the Creator through perfection, harmony, and unanimity of will. This state of divinity can only be achieved if the creature continues to live in eternity.

The desire to do the Father's will must always be supreme in the soul and must dominate the mind of an ascending son of God.

Inert matter by itself cannot be transformed into a divine being; for a causation devoid of mind cannot transform the rudimentary, amorphous, and simple into complex and refined elements, much less into elevated mental spirits capable of reflecting and making wise decisions using their free will.

Experience without spirit cannot transform the material minds of time into divine characters of survival.

It is entirely impossible to express the reality of infinity in human language; since the absolute cosmos is almost limitless, it is impossible to fully grasp the idea of infinity and eternity, because the idea of infinity and absoluteness is, in fact, unconditional.

Man, a finite creature lost in an infinite cosmos, must humbly settle for distorted reflections and attenuated concepts of that limitless, boundaryless existence that never begins, never ends, and whose comprehension is beyond his capacity.

The human mind cannot reach an understanding of an Absolute if it does not first attenuate it, in order to break the unity of reality.

The primordial ecstasy of infinity requires segmentation before humans can attempt to understand it.

There is a unity in infinity that is expressed in the Urantia Book documents as: THE ABSOLUTE “I AM”, which is the main postulate of the mind.

The Infinite Eternal Universal God, the First Source and Center of the Universe of universes, which in some philosophies is called the All and also, Absolute Reality, is expressed or allows himself to be known in the circles of the Deities as THE UNIVERSAL FATHER and the meanings of God or Gods (Eloim of the Hebrew language) should not be confused with Deity or Divinity.

The Deity is characterized by unity; it can be personalized as God. It can be prepersonal or superpersonal.

Divinity is the quality of being divine, that is, perfection in all things. The word God is a verbal symbol used to designate all the superpowerful personalizations of the Deity. The word God requires a different definition for each phase or personal level where the Deity functions, since the total Deity functions on seven different levels of reality.

The mind of the human creature is perplexed when it is told that the reality of infinite unity can manifest itself as Unity, Duality, Trinity, and Diversity.

As Unity, the Absolute “I AM.” As duality in relationship, eternal FATHER-SON. As trinity, universal FATHER-SON-SPIRIT. As diversity, the SUPREME BEING. Although infinity is on the one hand <ins>unity</ins>, it is also at the same time <ins>diversity</ins> without end or limit.

Infinity, as observed by human intelligence, is the ultimate paradox of finite philosophy and metaphysics.

Although the nature of the Spiritual man extends upward in the experience of worshiping the Father who is Infinite, the ultimate concept of the SUPREME BEING exhausts the capacity for intellectual comprehension. Beyond the Supreme, concepts become increasingly names, increasingly designations of authentic reality.

But an approach to understanding the absolute level comprises a postulate in three phases of reality:

1st - ORIGINAL. The unconditioned concept of the First Source and Center. The manifestation of that Source is I AM, from which all reality originates.

2nd - CURRENT. The union of the THREE ABSOLUTES of actuality. THE ETERNAL SON, Second Source and Center; THE JOINT ACTOR: Third Source and Center, and the ISLE of Paradise: This trio constitutes the true revelation of the ORIGINAL of THE FIRST SOURCE AND CENTER.

3rd - POTENTIAL. The union of the three Absolutes of potentiality, that is: the absolute Deity of potential power, the DEITY ABSOLUTE, the UNQUALIFIED ABSOLUTE, and the UNIVERSAL ABSOLUTE. This triodity of existential potential constitutes the revelation of the potential of the ORIGINAL “I AM,” the FIRST SOURCE AND CENTER of all infinity of absolute reality. [UB 104:5.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p5_12)

In this way, the infinite repositories of the reality of latent energy—of spirit or cosmic mind—which is the content, so to speak, of the Absolute, are interrelated. And for the creatures of space-time, the SUPREME BEING is a revelation of the total unity of the I AM.

The interaction of the original, the actual, and the potential produces tensions within Infinity, resulting in the possibility of growth of the entire universe, and the growth of the entire universe gives rise to the growth of the nature of the SEVENTH, the SUPREME, and the ULTIMATE.

From the perspective of time, what is ACTUAL is what was, and what is POTENTIAL is what will be in the future. What is ORIGINAL is what IS, from the perspective of eternity. The differences between what is ORIGINAL, what is ACTUAL, and what is POTENTIAL are not apparent from the perspective of eternity. These triune qualities are not seen in the eternal levels of Paradise because in the eternal, everything IS.

From the creature's perspective, actuality is what is felt, seen, and touched—that is, what is perceived through the senses and feelings. The obvious. But potentiality is the capacity to be. Actuality exists at the very center of all that is, and from there it expands toward the peripheral eternity of infinity and ultimately converges at the CENTER of all things. The ORIGINAL is the first cause and then balances the double movements of the cycle of the metamorphosis of reality from potentials to actuals and the empowerment of existential actuals.

The THREE ABSOLUTES of potentiality are operative at the highest, broadest, and deepest level of the eternal Cosmos. Therefore, they do not function at subabsolute levels.

In the descending levels of reality the triodity of potentiality manifests as GOD THE ULTIMATE and over the SUPREME BEING.

The potential may fail to actualize the temporal, with respect to a part, at some subabsolute level, but never in the sum.

God's will does not always prevail in the individual, but it invariably prevails in regard to the whole.

What man seeks in his ascension to Paradise is the actuality of Deity. What evolutionary man seeks is the potentiality of human divinity.

The Original is what makes possible the coexistence of the integration of current man, potential man and future man.

The dynamics of the Cosmos may be endless due to the transmutation of potentials into actuals, which have their reason for existence in the original I AM. This makes it impossible to limit or restrain the infinite. Anything identified with the infinite “I AM” cannot find an end to progression because the actuality of the potentials of the “I AM” is absolute.

Thus, the final penetration into the beauty and goodness of the SUPREME BEING can only open a wide range of possibilities for those creatures who wish to progress and follow the path that leads to those absonite qualities of ultimate divinity that are hidden beyond the conceptual levels of beauty, goodness, and truth.

The origins of God the SUPREME must begin in the TRINITY OF PARADISE.

To talk about the origin of the SUPREME BEING we must always start from the Original Deity, because God the SUPREME is a branch of an origin.

God the SUPREME is growth and progress, He is an entity that grows like an immense tree rooted in the DIVINE TRINITY, its trunk in the Master Spirits, its branches in the highest personalities from Paradise, spread throughout the immense Cosmos of space and time and its fruits are the achievement of the finalists who find God.

The Supreme Being is, above all, a being with a spiritual personality. The Supreme Being is a growing Deity, growth through evolution; growth that is fueled by the two triodities, Potential and Actual.

It is difficult for finite minds to understand how infinite triodities can function at the finite level, but one must pause to consider that their very infinity must contain the potential of the finite.

Infinity encompasses all things, from the lowest and most conditioned of finite existence to the highest and most unconditioned of absolute realities.

Thought Adjusters are eternal proof that the ETERNAL AND ABSOLUTE GOD, as absolute, can actually make direct contact with the lowest and least volitional creatures of the entire Universe.

The reality of the SUPREME is the total finite reality, which is in progressive and dynamic growth among the unconditioned potentials of the CENTER OF ALL THINGS.

The finite domain will thus be actualized through the cooperation of the absonite agencies of Paradise and the personalities of the Supreme Creators of time and space.

The Spirit person of the SUPREME BEING is derived from the PARADISE TRINITY, but the prerogatives of the ALMIGHTY SUPREME are based on the successes of GOD THE SEVENFOLD, while the power possibilities of the ALMIGHTY SUPREME with the Spirit person of GOD THE SUPREME occur through the ministry of the CONJOINT ACTOR (the Infinite Spirit in action), who bestowed mind upon the SUPREME BEING and coordinated him as the uniting factor of this evolving Deity.

In the relationship of the SUPREME with the TRINITY, the SUPREME BEING is absolutely dependent on the TRINITY OF PARADISE.

As the central universe age (HAVONA) gives way to the age of the seven superuniverses, the discernible action of the Divine Trinity as immediate creator gives way to the creative acts of the Paradise Sons of Deity.

The SUPREME BEING encompasses possibilities of cosmic action that are apparently unseen or unmanifested in the Eternal Son, the Infinite Spirit, or the impersonal energy realities of the Isle of Paradise: this is said taking into account the absoluteness of these three basic actualities.

The SUPREME BEING grows not only as the creatures of the universes attain the likeness of GOD (it must be remembered that God creates his Sons in his image and likeness), but this Deity (which is finite) also experiences growth as a result of the dominion of the creature and the Creator over the finite possibilities of the Grand Universe.

The movement of the SUPREME BEING is twofold: intensely toward Paradise and Deity and extensively toward the unlimited Absolutes of potential. In the present era of the universe age, this twofold movement is revealed in the descending and ascending personalities of the Grand Universe.

The personalities of the SUPREME CREATOR and all his divine associates reflect this divergent outward movement of Supremacy, while the ascending pilgrims of the seven superuniverses indicate the inward convergent tendency of Supremacy.

The finite Deity is constantly seeking this double correlation inward, toward Paradise and the Deities contained therein, and outward, toward infinity and the Absolutes contained therein.

The mighty surge of Paradise Creator Divinity personalizing the Creator Sons and energizing the Power Controllers signifies a vast movement of Supremacy into the realms of potentiality, while the endless procession of ascending creatures of the Grand universe attests the mighty convergence of Supremacy toward unity with Paradise Deity.

Humans have learned that sometimes we can discern the movements of the invisible by observing the effects on the visible. We cannot see the air, but we breathe it and feel it; we see the movements of the leaves on the trees and the movements of the waves and sailboats at sea; we do not see the Hertzian waves of radio and television, but we do see the effect produced when we hear the sounds and see the images on our receivers. These are all-too-familiar examples, but what about cosmic rays, ultraviolet rays, gamma rays, beta rays, etc.?

## THE NATURE OF THE SUPREME

The Father I AM in the Deity of the SUPREME has attained relative liberation from completeness, from the limitations inherent in the state of infinity-eternity and the absoluteness of BEING. But God the Supreme has liberated Himself from all existential limitations only through submission to the conditioning of His experiential function in the universe.

By gaining the capacity for experience, the finite God also becomes subject to the need for it.

Upon reaching the liberation of eternity, the Almighty encounters the barriers of time, and the SUPREME could only know growth and development as a consequence of the partiality of existence and the incompleteness of his nature or reason for being.

All this must be in accordance with THE FATHER'S PLAN which has based finite progress on the creature's effort and achievement through perseverance and development of personality by faith.

By thus ordering the experience of the evolution of the Supreme, the Father has made it possible for finite creatures to exist in the universes and by experiential progression, and someday to attain the DIVINITY of SUPREMACY. God the SUPREME is the personification of the finite shadow cast throughout the grand universe of time by the INFINITE ONENESS of the inscrutable nature of the Paradise FATHER, THE FIRST SOURCE AND CENTER, THE ABSOLUTE ORIGIN OF ALL THAT EXISTS.

The SUPREME BEING is the focus of Deity and the cosmic sum ( $\sum$ ) of the finite capacities of the natures of the absolute actual Cosmos and of the absolute potential and of the unqualified absolute potential.

The Supreme Being cannot be fully understood without considering its source, function, and destiny. Its relationship to the Trinity that originated it. Its relationship to the universe of activity (the universe in which it operates) and to its destiny, the Ultimate Trinity, which represents its immediate destiny.

By the process of summing up ( $\sum$ ) evolutionary experience, the SUPREME connects the finite with the absonite, just as the mind of the CONJOINT ACTOR integrates the divine Spirituality of the personal ETERNAL SON with the immutable energies of the original Paradise pattern, and just as the presence of the UNIVERSAL ABSOLUTE unifies Deity activity with the reality of the UNQUALIFIED.

The Supreme is the personification of all universal experience, the focus of all finite evolution, the maximization of all creaturely reality, the consummation of cosmic wisdom, the embodiment of the harmonious beauties of the galaxies of time, the truth of supreme spiritual values. P. 1304: 2

The Supreme is the unification of the three phases of Deity reality:
1. GOD THE SUPREME: The Spiritual unification of certain aspects of the TRINITY OF PARADISE.
2. THE SUPREME ALMIGHTY: The unification of the power of the creations of the Grand Universe.
3. THE SUPREME MIND: The contribution of the INFINITE SPIRIT and its coordinates.

The Grand Universe is the triple domain of the Trinity Deity of Supremacy.

The Master Spirits, the Ancients of Days, and the Creator Sons derive their power as ALMIGHTY for use in the universes of time and space. And the power of supremacy evolves along with the evolution of creatures in their respective universes until they reach the seventh level.

Once all the contents are added together... ( $\sum \mathrm{T}$ ), the total forms a single set.

One unit: THE SUPREME BEING.

This unity (the unity of the Supreme) must be a revelation of the undetected functioning in the original unity of THE FIRST CAUSE AND CENTER. THE ORIGINAL PATTERN. THE OMNIPOTENT “I AM,” THE UNIVERSAL FATHER OF ALL THAT IS, AND WILL BE.

To Him be all the glory and praise forever and ever. Amen.
