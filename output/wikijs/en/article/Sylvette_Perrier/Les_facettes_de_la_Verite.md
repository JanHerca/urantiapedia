The truth is like an immense jewel, made of several precious stones of various colors, each as sparkling as the other, cut into a multitude of shimmering facets. Humans see one facet, sometimes another, depending on the place and the time where they are. They can distort the image of what they have seen because of the shimmering effects, and the vision specific to the one who observes. But the truth always shines, and one day perhaps not before 200 billion years, we will have the complete panoramic vision of a large piece of this Diamond mountain which, for the moment, overhangs from very high above our personalities teeming on the Urantian soil.

Throughout the discovery of human religious and philosophical beliefs, it is always a joy to discover these innumerable fragments of Truth anchored everywhere. - despite the matrix of errors that surround them. These are undoubtedly the vestiges of what our great Instructors of Humanity taught, on the face of the planet, and which fortunately - have survived everywhere.

Examples that I have discovered in my little life:

1. The “Path of the Stars” of the Cathars.

The souls of the dead deemed worthy, took this Path after having crossed seven heavens (“small heavens” or modes of the “astral”). The Path of the Stars led them towards the Divine.

The comparison is striking with the seven worlds of the mansions, then the journey to the other morontial, spiritual spheres...up to Paradise.

2. The “purgatories” of the Christian (and para or peri-Christian) religions are a harsh image of the educational worlds of the houses!

> “The morontia realms are the local universe liaison spheres between the material and spiritual levels of creature existence. This morontia life has been known on Urantia since the early days of the Planetary Prince. From time to time this transition state has been taught to mortals, and the concept, in distorted form, has found a place in present-day religions.” (<a id="a51_368"></a>[UB 48:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p1_1))

3\. According to a Celtic dogma: the souls of the dead fly towards the West (at birth they came from the East). Hence, more or less Solar worship - Striking parallel with the geographical orientation of the Revelations which, in principle, in the Past, came to the East of Urantia; but the last of which (the fifth) came to the West, to Chicago!

4. The “Feathered Serpent” (a pagan god) of the Peruvian Indians is perhaps a reminiscence of the fandors.

5\. The geography of Allah's Paradise: splendid landscapes full of greenery where rivers, fountains, waterfalls and sparkling lakes abound, strangely resembles the spheres of the constellations! (At least those of Norlatiadek)

6. The belief in reincarnation (or rather: transmigration of souls into another human body, for another life on earth) would perhaps be the tragically distorted dramatic interpretation of the transitional sleep with seraphic transport, followed by repersonalization and awakening in the resurrection rooms, of the human soul on the mansion worlds.

How lucky we are to finally have the maximum of Truth (currently) in our hands to water our souls, with our Fifth Revelation, offered in the case of our Book with the Sapphire-colored cover!
