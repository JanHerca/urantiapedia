Immeasurable nostalgia,
Rocks day and night.
Sweet incurable wound
Who rolls me towards Infinity...

Roll and pitch, night ship
Under the blue moon.
Hurry up and get out of the well,
stormy oceans.
Hurry up, the night is going to die,
Beyond the black waves.
Already pointing towards the future
A nightmare dawn.

Incurable nostalgia...
Oh my sweet, my embryo flower
My little rose, my soul daughter,
Under the caress of the ray
Wake up my sleeping one,
Sweet light of my heart,
For our eternal happiness.

Return to Love
of the Eternal Divine,
Towards the heat of the day
Which never ends.
In infinite sweetness,
Where we will finally live
I will forget all pain,
Small embryonic rose
Oh my drop of Light.

Poem written in 1963 by Sylvette Perrier
