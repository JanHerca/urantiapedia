I dreamed that I had an interview with God.

“So, would you like to have an interview?” God asks.

I replied: “If you have time?

God smiles.

“My time is eternal; what questions do you have for me?
“What surprises you most about human beings?

And God answered.

“_It is because the human race is worried about the future._
_He has forgotten the present so that he lives neither in the present nor in the future._
_It is that they live as if they will never die, and they die as if they had never lived._

_It's because they are bored in their childhood, they can't wait to grow up and when they are grown up, they want to become young again._
“It’s because they lose their health wanting to earn money, then lose their money wanting to regain their health.”

God's hand took mine and for a moment we were silent, then I asked Him.
“As parents, what life lessons would you teach our children?

God responded with a smile.
“_Teach them that they can't force anyone to love them, but what they can do is have love for each other._
_Teach them that the most important thing is not what they have in their life but who they have in their life._
_Teach them that it is not good to compare their lives with those of others._
_Teach them that it only takes a few seconds to cause a deep wound to those we love, and that it only takes several years for them to heal._

_Teach them to forgive by practicing forgiveness._
_Teach them that there are people who love them, but they just don't know how to show their feelings._

_Teach them that money can buy everything...but not happiness!!!_
_Teach them that two people can have the same idea and yet see it differently._

_Teach them that it is not always enough to be forgiven by others, but that they must also forgive others themselves._

_And also teach them that I am here...Always._ »
