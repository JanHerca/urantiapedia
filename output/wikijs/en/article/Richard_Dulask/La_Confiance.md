**Trust: our weapon against worry**

Through the ability to trust that God has given us, we have the power to free ourselves from complications, to purify ourselves from corrosive emotions. With time and application, there is no negative emotion that trust cannot make disappear. All anxiety, all fear of the future can be abolished. When we learn to trust God absolutely, we are freed from all our worries. Our state of consciousness rises to a level where we are positive, sure, confident and able to act as we are meant to do. Our state of consciousness feels free and light.

Trust is a great power with universal application. It is as simple as breathing, so simple that even a child can do it. Perhaps a short prayer or an affirmation of the truth is enough to put us in a trusting state of mind. Perhaps we want to precede our affirmation with a moment of relaxation by breathing deeply or resting for a few moments. This is helpful in reminding the body that it does not have to worry, that all the details of our lives are given to God who has the perfect solution. We can use this ability to trust in God, anywhere and at any time. It only takes a moment of relaxation to entrust our concerns to God's care, to trust Him completely.

As we get into the habit of expressing our trust, our trust becomes stronger and stronger. We remember that since God knows everything, He has a perfect solution for every case. We remember that God being all Love, He understands and accepts us completely. This power of having absolute trust in God is a light that dispels all darkness. We perceive our problem more clearly. Confident and relaxed, we see all things as they really are. The darkness of the mind, the phobias of the imagination, the tensions and vain concerns, all evaporate like fog in the sun!

As it grows, we understand that trust is a liberating force, breaking the chains and shackles created by our fearful mind. Trust, like anxiety, is a habit. While worry weakens us, faith in God makes us strong if we give Him the attention we give to what torments us. As we become more and more accustomed to expressing our trust, we understand that we can count on God to deliver us from all evil and bring us greater blessings.

What do we want? A more satisfying career? Help to get out of our financial straits? Better health? Serenity and wisdom? To be more capable of loving?

With confidence we can surrender our legitimate desires to the tender care of God. Calm and confident in the development of our Good, we can allow ourselves to be patient, to wait for the perfect moment of the flowering of each of our blessings. There is no need for us to struggle excessively. On the contrary, easily, effectively, we are attentive, when they present themselves, to the opportunities that God offers us in our life.

What a great privilege and joy it is to be able to entrust all our cares to God! We can have absolute faith in Him. Others may disappoint us, be too busy to listen to us, or too absorbed in their own troubles to pay us any attention. However, we can always turn to God, certain of His tender attention to the details and aspects of our existence. God is our constant companion, our perfect friend, always ready to come to our aid. All our legitimate desires correspond to what God wants for us. Let us count on God to protect us, to direct us. Let us count on Him to teach us wisdom. Let us count on Him to maintain our health and vitality. Let us count on Him to bring into our existence the people and events that will increase our happiness.

God is waiting for us to invite Him to share our lives, to help us achieve all our worthwhile goals. He does not force us to accept His gifts, but with love, He expects us to accept them with trust.

The extent to which we can rely on God has no limits and the effects of our trust in our lives know no bounds. Only we can limit GOD's participation in our existence.

Let us experience it. Let us put all our trust in God and we will see what wonderful things He will accomplish in our lives. Each day, let us take the time to calm down, to trust, to listen to God's instructions and to obey His tender direction. His advice is available to all His children and at all times. God only asks us to take the time to calm our personal thoughts and to listen to Him.
“Be still and know that I AM GOD,” is a biblical injunction! There is no better way to quiet our personal thoughts, no easier, than to absolutely trust God and rely on Him for the fulfillment of all our legitimate and good desires.
