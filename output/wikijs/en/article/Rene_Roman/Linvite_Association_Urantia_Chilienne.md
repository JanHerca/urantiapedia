Dear friends and fellow readers of _The Urantia Book_:

After 5 years of solitary study of this monumental work, I joined the Urantia Association International (UAI) in 2001 where I was first secretary, then vice-president of the Urantia Association of the South (AUCS) and currently president of the Urantia Association of Chile (AUCH), founded on April 3, 2006 after the dissolution of the AUCS.

Our association is made up of 34 members, half of whom have already completed a first reading of The Urantia Book, signed the request for incorporation, accepted the UIA regulations and who now support the noble principles and objectives of the Urantia Foundation.

We were fortunate to have 3 members of French nationality who spent a long time in Chile and played an important role in the founding of the two associations: AUCS and AUCH. They are Andrée Devaux, Nadine and Marcelle Soutif Loubet. Marcelle unfortunately died on July 13, 2008, at the age of 57, in a bus accident during a trip through the “Salar de Illumi”, in the south of Bolivia. An educator and single, she was very dear to all of us. In her honor, we gathered and commemorated her memory during an emotional meeting by examining paper 48 on morontia life.

Our website, [www.urantiachile.org](www.urantiachile.org), is valuable to us for contacts and coordination. We invite you to visit it.

Our goal, as an association, is the formation and consolidation of several groups in order to deepen the study of the Urantia Book, in Santiago as in the other provinces of Chile. We have distributed, with the support of the Urantia Foundation, more than 500 books both in institutions and universities, as well as in the 386 public libraries with Internet distributed throughout the country.

It was in Santiago, Chile that the 5 annual conferences of the AUCS took place as well as the 2 of the AUCH, including the visit of **Tamila Ragimov**, current president of the Urantia Association of Colombia, who spoke on the Universe of Universes and **Eduardo Quiroga** from Bolivia (deceased), who delighted us with his presentation on the Master Universe. We also participated in the recent launch of **Yolanda Silva**'s book “_Evolution through The Urantia Book_”.

On August 21st of each year we celebrate the birth of our Divine Master Jesus of Nazareth. Every Thursday our group meets to discuss a theme from the book, share something and fellowship. We are explorers who discover the truth of these writings, a sacred place that establishes new facts, new meanings, new values for the advancement of our spiritual growth after the completion of the 7 cosmic or psychic circles of personality development.

It is known that the revelators themselves advised from the beginning, for a fundamental orientation of the movement, to create thousands of study groups. They did not say entertainment or political groups, meeting, travel or business groups, but emphasized that these would be study groups of the Revelation, in order to broaden our vision and our cosmic spiritual perception. Studies are necessary in order not to distort it, to understand it, to live it in order to build the foundations of a new fraternity, on the basis of this formation of the spirit and the teaching of the spirit.

The members of the Contact Commission were prepared for nearly 20 years before they began to receive these writings. They, like many of those who later participated in the “forum” and the “seventy,” were ordinary people and not mystical at all, but they shone through their sensory perception. They knew how to commit themselves, had perseverance, fidelity, loyalty, as well as a determined state of mind to dedicate their human will to the Fifth Epochal Revelation. It was difficult, but they did it!

The publication of The Urantia Book was somewhat premature, for it was published long before humanity was ready to see it, recognize it, and follow its teachings. It was published well in advance in order to train leaders and teachers to bring into the movement generous people who could contribute to the fund for new editions and translations into all languages.

With Jesus Christ, Michael of Nebadon, the word of God was made flesh. With The Urantia Book, even if the Divine Master was crucified, this word is in the Book and we cannot keep silent or silence these written teachings.

The revelators, as evidenced on pages <a id="a61_38"></a>[UB 30:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/30#p0_2), and <a id="a61_85"></a>[UB 101:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p4_2), give a period of 1,000 years to this fifth historical revelation, which follows the bestowal of the sovereign creator of the local universe of Nebadon in the flesh of Jesus of Nazareth, his life and works (the Fourth Revelation).

Urantia was privileged to be chosen by Michael of Nebadon as the world of his seventh bestowal, that is, one of the 3,840,101 inhabited planets in all of Nebadon at the time of this Revelation (1934-1935). If we take into account the age after the bestowal of a Paradise Son, which may still extend from 10,000 to 100,000 Earth years before the next evolutionary step, that of the arrival of the Trinity Teacher Sons, in increments of 1,000 years and more to arrive at Light and Life, we understand that the time in which we find ourselves is only 54 years since the publication of The Urantia Book; This means that we are barely living the history of the construction of the first advances on the future avant-garde detachments of this Revelation.

Building a study group is an effort that can have significant results beyond this life. However many obstacles we encounter, we will overcome with the help of our Universal Father and our own decisions for survival. They apply the Nebadonic system of instruction to build character; we are assigned a task and instructed on how best to carry it out.

> “5. *Spiritual insight.* The brotherhood of man is, after all, predicated on the recognition of the fatherhood of God. The quickest way to realize the brotherhood of man on Urantia is to effect the spiritual transformation of present-day humanity. The only technique for accelerating the natural trend of social evolution is that of applying spiritual pressure from above, thus augmenting moral insight while enhancing the soul capacity of every mortal to understand and love every other mortal. Mutual understanding and fraternal love are transcendent civilizers and mighty factors in the world-wide realization of the brotherhood of man.” (<a id="a67_644"></a>[UB 52:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p6_7))
