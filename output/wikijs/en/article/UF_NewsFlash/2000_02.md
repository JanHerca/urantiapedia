_A monthly News Bulletin from Urantia Foundation to IUA Officers, Foundation Office Managers, Coordinating Committee members, Foundation Representatives, Translators, and other readers for the purpose of disseminating this information to readers in local areas._

The staff of Urantia Foundation hopes you all had a happy and safe holiday season and are now settled into the swing of the new year. We apologize for the absence of the Newsflash: the last few months have been very busy at the Foundation. The workload has been increasing, new staff members have been settling in, and the recent actions taken by Harry McMullan with the illegal publication of Part IV have been an unfortunate distraction. Nevertheless, we intend to continue regular publication of Newsflash to keep you abreast of Foundation news.

## Korean Translation Published

![유란시아 책](https://www.urantia.org/sites/default/files/u7/The_Urantia_Book_Korean_HC_2009_175.jpg "유란시아 책")

The long and painstaking effort of translating _The Urantia Book_ into the Korean language reached its fruition last December when the translators could finally hold in their hands fresh-from-the-printing press copies of the Korean book. It is bound in a hard cover in the same size and cover design as the latest English and Spanish books. Trustee Kwan Choi oversaw the printing in South Korea. We consider this first non-European language translation to be a significant milestone in the history of the revelation.

The Korean translation effort was initiated in 1993, thus taking six years to complete. In most cases it takes six years of dedicated work to translate _The Urantia Book_ into any language. Some of the published translations have taken considerably longer.

An agreement has been made with a Korean distributor who will be distributing the new book to bookstores and libraries throughout the country. We have also arranged for a distributor to make the book available in the U.S. Korean market. We pray that the revelation will find hungry souls among the Korean people, and that our Asian brothers and sisters will have the opportunity to experience, first hand, its supernal teachings.

We thank all of the translators for their tireless efforts in helping to make the dissemination of _The Urantia Book_ possible to a worldwide community.

The Korean language is spoken by some 76 million people: 45 million in the Republic of Korea, 24 million in the People's Republic of Korea, and the remainder in pockets of Japan and China. Moreover, there are over one million Korean-speaking persons in the United States and Canada. It is interesting to note that scholars have been unable to determine what relationship the Korean language has to other languages.

## Court of Appeals Affirms Copyright

The United States Court of Appeals has issued its decision in the case of Maaherra v. Urantia Foundation, once again affirming the validity of Urantia Foundation's copyright in _The Urantia Book_. In 1997 the Court of Appeals held Urantia Foundation had a valid and enforceable copyright in _The Urantia Book_ that was infringed by Maaherra's electronic version of _The Urantia Book_. The case was then returned to the Federal District Court which entered judgment in favor of Urantia Foundation. Maaherra appealed that judgment. In its latest decision, the appellate court held the district court correctly entered judgment in favor of Urantia Foundation based upon the earlier appellate opinion. Given the fact Urantia Foundation elected not to seek injunctive relief or monetary damages against Maaherra, there was nothing more for the Court to consider.

## Staff Changes - James Woodward, Lynn Prentice, Mindy Williams

There have been a few staff changes at Urantia Foundation. In our Reader Services Department, **Connie Greene** has been replaced by **James Woodward**. Connie has been commuting from Wisconsin on a weekly basis for the past two years and has decided to stay closer to home so she can spend more time with her family. She has been a great asset to the Foundation. James comes to us from California and brings with him extensive experience in writing and public relations, as well as being a devoted, long-time student of _The Urantia Book_.

**Kathleen Swadling** from Sydney, Australia, has been working for the Foundation as the Development Coordinator for the past three years. She has returned to Australia to join her husband Trevor in further developing the Austrialian Foundation office and other _Urantia Book-related_ activities throughout the Asia Pacific region. During Kathleen's stay Trevor devoted two years of full-time voluntary service to Urantia Foundation, but he returned to Australia last April to attend to the office there. Kathleen has been replaced by **Lynn Prentice** of Missouri. Lynn will be handling public relations, development and event planning. She is also a long-time reader of _The Urantia Book_ and brings with her extensive experience in communications and public relations.

**Mindy Williams** has replaced **Jay Peregrine** as our new office Manager. Jay is now working for the Foundation on a contract basis as the Web Master. Mindy has moved, with her husband Allen, from Florida to Chicago to take on her new position. She is another long-time reader of _The Urantia Book_ and brings with her extensive experience in administration and computer systems.

We welcome James, Lynn, and Mindy to the team and look forward to a fruitful working relationship. We are grateful to Connie, Kathleen, and Trevor for their dedication and tireless efforts in helping the Foundation through a challenging time of creating new strategies and growing in new directions. They all brought strength and talent to our work and will be greatly missed. We wish them well in their ongoing work for the revelation, and we will continue to call on them for their experience and expertise in the future.

## New Urantia Association in South America

_The following report was written by IUA Administrator, Cathy Jones, after the inauguration of a new Local Association of the IUA in South America:_

Dear Friends,

On November 14, in Santiago, Chile, the Asociación Urantia del Cono Sur was born. In English that is Urantia Association of the Southern Cone (S.A.) This group currently is composed of members from Chile and Argentina, but with the name "Southern Cone," it could expand to the adjoining South American countries.

It was early Spring in Chile and the nearby Catholic Retreat Center, with its profusion of roses and early-blooming flowers, made a perfect setting for readers from Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Finland, and the USA. We spent two days of study and fellowship. Language is never a barrier when spirits meet one on one. There are many new, enthusiastic Urantia Book readers who are eagerly embracing its enlightened, revealed message. [The total membership is 31. Eleven are full voting members—20 are in the process of completing the entire book.] All understand the mission of the IUA—that of service and the disseminating of the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. They consider it a privilege to work as partners with Urantia Foundation through a licensing agreement. The officers are:

- **President:** Mario Casassus Bulnes (Chile )
- **Vice President:** Carlos Rubinsky (Argentina )
- **Secretary/Treasurer:** Nadine Loubet (Chile )


## New National Urantia Association in Canada

_The following report was written by Cathy Jones after the inauguration of the National Association in Canada:_

Dear Friends,

The newest national association of the IUA, The Urantia Association of Canada, was licensed on Saturday, October 23, 1999, bringing the three existing local associations in Canada under the umbrella of a national body.

The inaugural meeting was held at the Silver Springs Retreat Center, Flesherton, Ontario, Canada. Silver Springs Retreat Center is located about 100 miles north of Ontario in an area of beautiful green, rolling meadows. As one approaches the center from the rural country road, the sprawling home of Derek and Sue Tennant suddenly appears at the top of the hill. This home provided an ideal meeting place for this historic event, and Derek and Sue were gracious and delightful hosts.

The voting Presidents and Vice Presidents of the three existing local associations in Canada, their spouses, Urantia Foundation Trustee President, and the IUA Administrator attended the weekend meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to get acquainted, approve the bylaws, and elect a governing board for the newly formed national association. From the time the participants started arriving Friday afternoon until the Sunday noon departure, there was a sense of oneness of spirit and commitment. Woven into the light-hearted fellowship one could feel a sincere devotion to a personal manifestation of the commonly-shared principles of _The Urantia Book_. As the concentric circle flag was raised and a shoulder-to-shoulder, hand-holding circle was formed on Sunday morning, the newly elected President led the group in a prayer of thanksgiving, with a pledge to loyal service.

In 1993 the IUA was formed for the purpose of fostering in-depth study of _The Urantia Book_ and the orderly dissemination of its teachings. That purpose has been, and continues to be, maintained as our organization matures into its full potential. The elected governing board is as follows:

- **President:** Gaetan Charland - L 'Association Urantia Quebec
- **Vice President:** Nathen Jansen - Urantia Association of the Cascades
- **Secretary:** Sue Tennant - Northern Light Urantia Association
- **Treasurer:** Brian King - Northern Light Urantia Association


## English, Korean, and Spanish Books Printed - New Size, New Cover Design

The most recent publications of _The Urantia Book_, El libro de Urantia, and the new Korean translation now come in new sizes with an elegant new cover design. The new editions all measure 8-7/16 inches long by 5-1/2 inches wide, just slightly larger than the previous soft cover editions. The English and Spanish books are both available in paperback and small hard cover, with the English also available in leather gift-boxed editions. The gift-boxed editions are bound in a soft royal blue or burgundy leather with gilded pages and are shipped in an embossed two-piece box.

All editions are now available from all of the Foundation offices worldwide. Their prices are as follows (in U.S. dollars):

- Paperback (English) — $24.95 
- Small hard cover (English) — $29.95 
- Gift-boxed leather (English) — $34.95 
- Paperback (Spanish) — $19.95 
- Small hard cover (Spanish) — $24.95 
- Korean Translation (hard cover) — $34.95

We hope that these editions will attract more attention on the bookstore shelves, giving new readers a better opportunity to discover the supernal teachings of _The Urantia Book_.


## Six New Translation Projects to be Launched

Urantia Foundation's ongoing translation projects are progressing and are at various stages of completion. The Italian translation is nearing completion. The Estonian, Swedish, Lithuanian, and Arabic translators have finished with their first drafts, and the many phases of copy-editing are either soon to be initiated or have already commenced.

Apart from these ongoing efforts, six new projects have recently been started or are about to be launched. These new initiatives include translations into Indonesian, Hindi, Farsi-Persian, Japanese, Bulgarian, and Greek.


## IUA Charter to be Revised

One indication of the progress of the International Urantia Association is the fact that the current statutory documents of the IUA have become outdated. Also the existing organizational arrangements between Urantia Foundation, the Urantia Brotherhood Association, and the IUA have been found to be confusing to many readers. Consequently the Charter Committee, formerly a subcommittee of the Coordinating Committee, has been working on an extensive revision of the nJA Charter and By-laws.

In March the Charter Committee will submit a draft Charter for the consideration and input of the Trustees of Urantia Foundation (as Members of the Board of Directors of the Urantia Brotherhood Association). It will also be submitted to the IUA Council of National Presidents and Vice Presidents (the CNP), and to all nJA members for their consideration. The Charter Committee wishes to involve all IUA members in these deliberations in an effort to ensure that they are included as a vital part of this decision making process.


## Spanish-Language IUA Journal Published

The Council of National Presidents and Vice Presidents decided, in June, to start publishing the IUA Journal in Spanish—in addition to the English, Finnish, and French versions.

The first Spanish Journal was recently mailed as a courtesy issue to all Spanish-speakers on the Foundation's mailing list. As with the English, French, and Finnish versions, future mailings of the Spanish IUA Journal will be mailed only to subscribers. The subscription charge is US$15 a year. Subscriptions should be mailed to the Foundation Head office in Chicago or to any of the overseas Foundation offices.


## New Foundation Representatives Appointed

Urantia Foundation now has 18 representatives including a "roving" representative, and representatives in Argentina, Uruguay, Russia, and Senegal.

These devoted, dedicated, and service oriented readers have accepted the invitation to represent U rantia Foundation in their countries and to assist the Foundation in establishing a focal point for reader inquiries and book trade business on their home turf. The current representatives are as follows:

- **Mark Bloomfield** (our "roving" representative);

## Herb Klemme Departs for the Mansion Worlds

Dr. Herbert L. Klemme, of Stillwater, Minnesota, a long-time student of _The Urantia Book_, died early January 13, at the age of 77, from complications of a stroke. Dr. Klemme was retired from the practice of psychiatry in the Twin Cities. After completing medical school at the University of Arkansas, he practiced general medicine in Iowa and Arkansas before entering psychiatry residency at the Menninger School of Psychiatry in Topeka, Kansas, in 1960. He remained as senior psychiatrist until 1975, responsible for continuing education for family practice physicians and clergy. He also directed the Center for Industrial Mental Health seminars, which were designed to give corporate executives an understanding of the psychological dimensions of management.

Herb was involved in the Urantia Book reader community for many years. He served on the Advisory Committee to the Trustees (ACT) subsequent to the break away of the foroler Urantia Brotherhood, and he contributed to the formation of the IVA. He served as the first President of the Minnesota Urantia Association. His wisdom and experience will be greatly missed.


## The Parliament of the World's Religions

![Gard Jameson](https://www.urantia.org/sites/default/files/imagecache/full_column/images/Gard_Jameson_7_80.jpg "Gard Jameson")

_Trustee Gard Jameson, Travis Binion, Moussa Ndiaye and Doudou from Senegal, and Michael Macisaac, along with other readers and some members of the Fellowship, attended the Parliament of the World's Religions in Capetown, South Africa, to display_ The Urantia Book. Following are some excerpts from a report by Gard Jameson:

My experience in Cape Town, and in other interfaith venues, convinces me that _The Urantia Book_ is to serve as a leaven to the great traditions of the world; and, so it is serving. As we are witnessing firsthand at events such as this, the power of its vision is so much greater as a leaven than as another religion among the family of religions. As a Methodist, I am able to share the great truths of the book so much more effectively by referring to its expression of spiritual value and not to any religious institution. As a Muslim, my brother, Moussa, from Senegal is able to share the great truths of the book so much more effectively, for Moussa as for myself. _The Urantia Book_ serves to enhance our experience within our chosen religious institution. Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, Indigenous Traditions, and many others here have been drawn to _The Urantia Book_ by understanding and appreciating that leavening vision.

Perhaps the most exciting aspect of the Parliament for me has not been so much the programs, nor the symposia, nor the plenary presentations, nor even the presence of Nelson Mandela—all wonderful—but the deep connection that I now have with two dear brothers from Senegal, Moussa and Doudou. We in America have much to learn from the deep wisdom of brothers such as Moussa and Doudou. Their gracious manner and their genuine excitement for _The Urantia Book_ was an inspiration to all of us in attendance. As the Master informs us, and as we know from our own experience, there is no greater joy in the universe than to get to know such brothers and sisters. What a joy and inspiration South Africa has been!
