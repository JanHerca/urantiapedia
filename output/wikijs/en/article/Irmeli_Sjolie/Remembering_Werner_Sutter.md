_By Irmeli Ivalo-Sjölie, Helsinki, Finland_

Werner Sutter was born in Germany, but he immigrated to Canada in 1954. He found _The Urantia Book_ in the early 1970s, and ever since, the teachings were the most important part of his life!

His dream was to have a translation of _The Urantia Book_ in German, which came true in 2005. After Das Urantia Buch was printed, Werner moved back to Germany and dedicated his time and efforts to disseminating _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings throughout Austria, Germany and Switzerland. And this he did very well!

Today there are active study groups in all of these countries, and the young readers are enthusiastically carrying on with his service. He will be missed by many!
