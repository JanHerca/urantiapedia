<p style="text-align:center;">
I can't perceive you<br>
but I know that you are in me<br>
because the Father sent you<br>
for you to be my guide<br>
on my long journey<br>
towards eternity.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
I thank you <br>
for keeping me company<br>
in my day to day struggle<br>
in the flesh of a mortal.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
I thank you <br>
because being your divine<br>
You have chosen to be with me. <br>
You are the light that shines<br>
my senses<br>
you are the light that shines<br>
my way.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
For you I perceive the beauty, <br>
because of you I know what is <br>
kindness,<br>
you have brought me love<br>
universal.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
Even though I can't see you<br>
with my mortal eyes<br>
I know that one day I will see you<br>
in the other reality.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
You and I will be one <br>
and your light will be my light<br>
and your light will illuminate my <br>
paths <br>
towards the Universal Father.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
I will not leave you <br>
because you are love, <br>
because you are the beauty, <br>
because you are the goodness, <br>
because you are the truth, <br>
I will be with you until the end.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
To Paradise I will go <br>
Cause you'll take me<br>
because you are part of the Heavenly Father, <br>
because you came out of it to teach a mortal. <br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
You made my soul,<br>
you made her immortal <br>
to accompany you <br>
towards eternity.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
Because you brought it to me<br>
I have been able to understand<br>
that LOVE is the greatest <br>
that a mortal can have.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
If you have LOVE <br>
inside your heart, <br>
Don't mind the money, <br>
Don't mind all the gold, <br>
don't care about poverty, <br>
take care only of your soul<br>
'Cause she's your wealth.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
Take good care of your treasure, <br>
Take good care of it, <br>
and don't sell it because <br>
the Father is in him.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
Although not now <br>
understand, other days <br>
they will come <br>
that you will understand<br>
that the Father is in you, <br>
that a little bit of him <br>
gave.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
It is your faithful Adjuster <br>
that inside you is <br>
even if you can't see it<br>
with your mortal eyes.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
It's a divine spark<br>
that the Father gave you<br>
so that you walk the path of LOVE.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
IF YOU HAVE LOVE<br>
INSIDE YOUR HEART<br>
YOU CAN'T KEEP IT. <br>
THAT LOVE COMES FROM THE FATHER <br>
AND IT IS FOR HUMANITY.<br>
</p>
