<p style="text-align:center;">
Friend, listen well to what I tell you: <br>
Love is invincible, truth is the winner, <br>
The lie always loses.<br>
<br>
In a world of lies, even if no one understands you. <br>
You always tell the truth, befriend love,<br>
Walk with him. Carry it in your heart, <br>
And he will lead you on the paths of happiness<br>
<br>
With him you will understand that outside of him there is nothing
That everything is vanity, envy and power;<br>
It is the ultimate destruction. <br>
<br>
He will tell you that there is another reality,<br>
What are the worlds of the heavenly Father.<br>
<br>
From there the Lord came to bring love and truth<br>
To this humanity that is blind, and deaf too, <br>
Who understands nothing, looks for the truth where it is not <br>
Because without love you won't find it.<br>
<br>
Look inside yourself, discover the love that He gave you <br>
And you will understand that in you there is a God, that for that love
He will lead you to perfection, <br>
Because he came out of there.<br>
</p>
