Today I want to share
A dream I had yesterday.
In my dream I saw
That the stars didn't shine
and the sun went dark
that the rivers dried up
and the fish died
for the waters so bitter.

In my dream I saw
big kids and older
who died of hunger and thirst
big kids and older
they didn't even have tears
only bones remained.

In my dream I saw
to all humanity
they were imploring heaven
that the Messiah would come;
why do you tell him to come
if he was already here?
He came to bring us truth
came to bring us love
and in return we killed him.

Why do you tell him to come
if there is no love.

He will not come because I tell you
that love is true
Two thousand years the Christians,
thousand five hundred those of Allah,
those of Buddha many more,
everyone seeks the truth.

put I tell you, brothers
that there is no greater religion
than earthly love
and that there is no greater truth
than universal love.

The truth is in the bowels
and the love in the hearts
let love out
and give it for nothing
and the father and the truth
it will enter you

The father in you is already
but you lack the truth
the truth is very simple
and at the same time very complicated,
where is the truth
I want to give you an example:

It's like a newborn
of laws I would like to know,
first you will have to grow
and then do homework
pass through several mansions
to be able to understand
and change your clothes
to be able to see the judge
that the suit does not serve to understand
the truth is with him.

The truth is in the bowels
and love in hearts.
Let love out
let it out
let love water the earth
and the truth flourish.
This dream that I share
with all mankind
It's not history, it's not song
because music does not have
Let the one who understands put it on
and turn it into a song
in universal song
that has no borders
and have no flags:
let it be the banner
of all humanity.

Let it be sung all over the world
all over the world at once.
let the universe know
and all who inhabit it
that on earth there is already love,
that darkness does not exist,
let those who are know
and understand those who come
that the only truth
it is universal love.

There I leave the words.
The words are not mine.
With my mouth I say them
and written I leave them.
They are words of love
They are real words
my heart tells me
for the humanity.

As they give them to me I give them,
in exchange for nothing.
May they serve you well,
because the heart tells me
that in the next abode
love is priceless.

There I leave the words,
do not forget them and
keep well in mind
that the earth is a living being
and wounded to death.

That the rivers are its veins,
that the forests his lungs,
that water is his blood
and that it is contaminated
by the greed of men.

Open your hearts
and to the earth give love.
Let your wounds heal
that we all go on the trip,
poor, rich and beggars,
all in the same sphere
In search of light.

Open your hearts
and give the earth love
and those with a hard heart
I want to give you some advice:
when you have a moment
big city man,
when you have a moment
go to the field to check.


That the dream is not a dream
that the dream is reality.
that the rivers are dry,
that the forests are no more.
Test the stream water
how bitter it really is.

When you have a moment,
man of great haste,
asphalt warrior,
hard hearted man,
hard as flint,
when you have a moment
Go to the field to observe.

You watch the ant
that she harvests in summer,
for the winter to rest.
watch the butterfly
how slow is his fly,
how beautiful is your clothing
from flower to flower it goes.

Then sit on the green grass
listen to the birds sing.
Take in your hand the fresh earth
then tell me if it's true
that the earth is alive
man from the big city

If you do these things
your heart will soften
the love of you will come out.
When you leave the field
you join the asphalt,
big city asphalt,
hear your brother say
with open arms
knees on the ground, tell you this way:

Give me a hand brother.
No longer avert your gaze
even if it is, give it a little
of the love that you have heard.

Here I leave the words
I tell you see you later
because you are going to give love
That's why I say “see you later”
because with the father and the truth
there we will meet.

Because the stars are burning bonfires
by heavenly father
so that in the universe there is no darkness,
to give light to men and all humanity
so that they understand the truth:

THAT THEY THEMSELVES ARE PART
OF THE UNIVERSAL ENERGY.
