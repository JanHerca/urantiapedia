<p style="text-align:center;">
A blessed path of knowledge <br>
beside the stream of life,<br>
A miracle I've come to know and trust. <br>
A vantage place, <br>
A work of grace,<br>
A song above the strife,<br>
A way at last to Know the things I must.<br>
The story of the ages,<br>
of God, the past, the plan,<br>
The picture from the highest point of view.<br>
The same loved trutfis,<br>
The light set loose,<br>
The better way for man,<br>
The love of God proclaimed on earth anew.<br>
My long awaited answer,<br>
My summons from on figh,<br>
My value spelled in wonds of destiny.<br>
My promise now,<br>
My faith shown how,<br>
My way beyond the sky,<br>
My invitation to eternity.<br>
</p>
