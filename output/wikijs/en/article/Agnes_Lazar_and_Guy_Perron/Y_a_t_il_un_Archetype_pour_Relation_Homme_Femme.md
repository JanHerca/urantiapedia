## 3rd Dakar Summit

From February 20 to February 27, 2020 In Dakar, Senegal at Moustapha's

**Main themes: DIVINITY AND HUMANITY**

In dedicated and selfless service for the welfare of humanity

In THE preceding LINK (June 15, 2020), we published a presentation made by Moustapha K. NDIAYE entitled “WHO AM I?” Here is now the presentation made by Agnès Lazare and Guy Perron during this summit on the theme of the Woman-Man relationship.

**Is there an archetype, an ideal model for the male-female relationship?**

- AN archetype can be projected under a material, spiritual or mental aspect, or as a combination of these energies. But an ARCHETYPE is an ARCHETYPE and remains an ARCHETYPE. <a id="a46_176"></a>[UB 0:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p6_10)
- An archetype can configure energy, but it does not control it. <a id="a47_65"></a>[UB 0:6.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p6_11)
- Space is neither an archetype nor a potential archetype.
- An archetype is a master model, of which copies are made. <a id="a49_60"></a>[UB 0:6.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p6_13)
- Paradise is the archetype of infinity; the God of Action is the animator of this archetype. <a id="a50_94"></a>[UB 9:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/9#p3_8)
- Life itself constitutes the animation of a system of energies — material, mental or spiritual — conforming to an archetype or selected in another way. <a id="a51_153"></a>[UB 36:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p6_7)

**The master archetype for all personalities**

The personality of the spirit Son is the master archetype for all personalities in all universes. The substance of the Paradise island is the master archetype, of which Havona is a perfected revelation and the superuniverses a perfecting revelation. (<a id="a55_251"></a>[UB 115:3.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_14))

**Every universe is supported by an archetype of sharing**

This archetype of sharing is the essential model to be followed by each of the Sons and

Daughters of God who go out into space to attempt to copy in time the central universe of eternal perfection. 54:2:1

**If there is a model, what is it for us, ascending mortals? Is the male-female relationship inspired by several models?**

**Descending influences**

1. Universal Father — Eternal Son
2. Eternal Son — Infinite Spirit
3. Creator Son — Divine Minister

**Ascending influences**

4\. Adam-Eve

- It was a stunning innovation to see Eve, a woman, share, with a man, the honors and responsibilities of worldly affairs. 74:3:5 (<a id="a75_131"></a>[UB 74:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p3_5))
- On the capital of each local system, the Material Sons and Daughters of God effectively depict the height of the ideals of the union of a man and a woman in the bonds of marriage when they have the purpose of procreating and raising offspring. <a id="a76_246"></a>[UB 83:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p8_5)

**Unifying influences**

5. Universal Father — God the Supreme Archetype of unification throughout the universe

- This unity must be a revelation of the undetected work of the original unity of the First Cause-Father and the first archetype-Source of all things and all beings. <a id="a82_166"></a>[UB 115:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p7_8)

**Some quotes:**

> The likening of human associations to divine associations is most unfortunate. The union of husband and wife in the marriage-home relationship is a material function of the mortals of the evolutionary worlds. True, indeed, much spiritual progress may accrue consequent upon the sincere human efforts of husband and wife to progress, but this does not mean that marriage is necessarily sacred. Spiritual progress is attendant upon sincere application to other avenues of human endeavor. (<a id="a86_489"></a>[UB 83:8.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p8_2))

> Neither can marriage be truly compared to the relation of the Adjuster to man nor to the fraternity of Christ Michael and his human brethren. At scarcely any point are such relationships comparable to the association of husband and wife. And it is most unfortunate that the human misconception of these relationships has produced so much confusion as to the status of marriage. (<a id="a88_381"></a>[UB 83:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p8_3))

> The ideals of marriage have made great progress in recent times; among some peoples woman enjoys practically equal rights with her consort. In concept, at least, the family is becoming a loyal partnership for rearing offspring, accompanied by sexual fidelity. But even this newer version of marriage need not presume to swing so far to the extreme as to confer mutual monopoly of all personality and individuality. Marriage is not just an individualistic ideal; it is the evolving social partnership of a man and a woman, existing and functioning under the current mores, restricted by the taboos, and enforced by the laws and regulations of society. (<a id="a90_654"></a>[UB 83:8.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/83#p8_8))

> Regardless of the antagonisms of these early pairs, notwithstanding the looseness of the association, the chances for survival were greatly improved by these male-female partnerships. A man and a woman, co-operating, even aside from family and offspring, are vastly superior in most ways to either two men or two women. This pairing of the sexes enhanced survival and was the very beginning of human society. The sex division of labor also made for comfort and increased happiness. (<a id="a92_485"></a>[UB 84:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p1_9))

> A good and noble man may be consummately in love with his wife but utterly unable to pass a satisfactory written examination on the psychology of marital love. Another man, having little or no love for his spouse, might pass such an examination most acceptably. The imperfection of the lover’s insight into the true nature of the beloved does not in the least invalidate either the reality or sincerity of his love. (<a id="a94_419"></a>[UB 103:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p8_3))

> 1. *Mutual self-expression and self-understanding.* Many noble human impulses die because there is no one to hear their expression. Truly, it is not good for man to be alone. Some degree of recognition and a certain amount of appreciation are essential to the development of human character. Without the genuine love of a home, no child can achieve the full development of normal character. Character is something more than mere mind and morals. Of all social relations calculated to develop character, the most effective and ideal is the affectionate and understanding friendship of man and woman in the mutual embrace of intelligent wedlock. Marriage, with its manifold relations, is best designed to draw forth those precious impulses and those higher motives which are indispensable to the development of a strong character. I do not hesitate thus to glorify family life, for your Master has wisely chosen the father-child relationship as the very cornerstone of this new gospel of the kingdom. And such a matchless community of relationship, man and woman in the fond embrace of the highest ideals of time, is so valuable and satisfying an experience that it is worth any price, any sacrifice, requisite for its possession. (<a id="a96_1232"></a>[UB 160:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p2_6))

> I repeat, such inspiring and ennobling association finds its ideal possibilities in the human marriage relation. True, much is attained out of marriage, and many, many marriages utterly fail to produce these moral and spiritual fruits. Too many times marriage is entered by those who seek other values which are lower than these superior accompaniments of human maturity. Ideal marriage must be founded on something more stable than the fluctuations of sentiment and the fickleness of mere sex attraction; it must be based on genuine and mutual personal devotion. And thus, if you can build up such trustworthy and effective small units of human association, when these are assembled in the aggregate, the world will behold a great and glorified social structure, the civilization of mortal maturity. Such a race might begin to realize something of your Master’s ideal of “peace on earth and good will among men.” While such a society would not be perfect or entirely free from evil, it would at least approach the stabilization of maturity. (<a id="a98_1045"></a>[UB 160:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p2_10))

**Do all of these pairs stimulate each other?**

> Male and female are, practically regarded, two distinct varieties of the same species living in close and intimate association. Their viewpoints and entire life reactions are essentially different; they are wholly incapable of full and real comprehension of each other. Complete understanding between the sexes is not attainable. (<a id="a102_333"></a>[UB 84:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p6_3))

**Their points of view and all their vital reactions are essentially different; they are entirely incapable of fully and truly understanding each other. Complete understanding between the sexes is impossible to attain.**

> Women seem to have more intuition than men, but they also appear to be somewhat less logical. Woman, however, has always been the moral standard-bearer and the spiritual leader of mankind. The hand that rocks the cradle still fraternizes with destiny. (<a id="a106_255"></a>[UB 84:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p6_4))

> The differences of nature, reaction, viewpoint, and thinking between men and women, far from occasioning concern, should be regarded as highly beneficial to mankind, both individually and collectively. Many orders of universe creatures are created in dual phases of personality manifestation. Among mortals, Material Sons, and midsoniters, this difference is described as male and female; among seraphim, cherubim, and Morontia Companions, it has been denominated positive or aggressive and negative or retiring. Such dual associations greatly multiply versatility and overcome inherent limitations, even as do certain triune associations in the Paradise-Havona system. (<a id="a108_673"></a>[UB 84:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p6_5))

> Men and women need each other in their morontial and spiritual as well as in their mortal careers. The differences in viewpoint between male and female persist even beyond the first life and throughout the local and superuniverse ascensions. And even in Havona, the pilgrims who were once men and women will still be aiding each other in the Paradise ascent. Never, even in the Corps of the Finality, will the creature metamorphose so far as to obliterate the personality trends that humans call male and female; always will these two basic variations of humankind continue to intrigue, stimulate, encourage, and assist each other; always will they be mutually dependent on co-operation in the solution of perplexing universe problems and in the overcoming of manifold cosmic difficulties. (<a id="a110_793"></a>[UB 84:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p6_6))

> While the sexes never can hope fully to understand each other, they are effectively complementary, and though co-operation is often more or less personally antagonistic, it is capable of maintaining and reproducing society. Marriage is an institution designed to compose sex differences, meanwhile effecting the continuation of civilization and insuring the reproduction of the race. (<a id="a112_387"></a>[UB 84:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p6_7))

> Marriage is the mother of all human institutions, for it leads directly to home founding and home maintenance, which is the structural basis of society. The family is vitally linked to the mechanism of self-maintenance; it is the sole hope of race perpetuation under the mores of civilization, while at the same time it most effectively provides certain highly satisfactory forms of self-gratification. The family is man’s greatest purely human achievement, combining as it does the evolution of the biologic relations of male and female with the social relations of husband and wife. (<a id="a114_588"></a>[UB 84:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p6_8))
