<p style="text-align:center;">
On the evening of the great feast, Jesus, in the midst of immense crowds, cried out:<br>
“Let him who is thirsty come to me, and I will give him living water.”<br>
<br>
So slaves, bare hands and feet<br>
Danced for joy on the ruins of the ancient fortress<br>
And yet, how many blue nights<br>
Had exercised their silence in this place.<br>
<br>
Radiant entities who had gone before us and read the book<br>
They came to contemplate the party and mingle with us,<br>
They agreed with the intention of persuading us:<br>
We felt their help, their fertile and proud presence.<br>
The time was dawn.<br>
<br>
The radiant entities reminded us of the meaning of our journey,<br>
They expressed themselves through their heavenly smile<br>
Who had morning coffee with a light heart<br>
With all our travel companions.<br>
<br>
Leave at dawn, now unique, go and tell them:<br>
<br>
Slaves are freed from fear,<br>
Their masters are confused in distant planets<br>
Where the eternal deceiver now resides, powerless.<br>
The space will soon be a curtain watching over the sleeping child.<br>
<br>
Tell them again:<br>
Space is paternal, spiritual lepers are healed,<br>
The celestial basilica is restored and enlarged,<br>
The crowds will go there in apotheosis.<br>
<br>
Tell them again:<br>
The heavenly basilica is in them, is in you.<br>
The spiritually lame walk,<br>
The spiritually blind see,<br>
The spiritually deaf hear.<br>
<br>
The Spiritual Kingdom of God<br>
Is not there, close, in the middle or next to you,<br>
The Spiritual Kingdom of God is within you.<br>
<br>
Go, be a perfect mirror of the Father and the Master Jesus.<br>
<br>
Even the servants with only one talent answered:<br>
We have not lived as if we saw the Invisible,<br>
We have erected a new Talmud,<br>
You left us a Living Truth,<br>
It has become marble after twenty centuries of trampling<br>
On a painful and contradictory path.<br>
We have praised prophets, useless heroes,<br>
We have confused sleep with peace,<br>
We have a few seconds left to live, abyss,<br>
Between betrayal and the tree where Judas' rope hangs.<br>
<br>
We must now be humble and teachable,<br>
The rich young man never became great in the kingdom,<br>
Let us be vigilant servants of the Master who will return,<br>
And let us live in fear that He will say to us:<br>
“You are strangers in spirit.”<br>
Every hour you told us “I’m thirsty”<br>
You left us the dawn,<br>
With half-words we created the night.<br>
Even every word is night for the Infinite,<br>
Only your face is a word, reflected there<br>
The incandescent clarity of the Spirit.<br>
<br>
From now on let us be watchmen overlooking the city<br>
Who sleeps in animal and happy peace.<br>
Let us realize this dawn of man<br>
Who suddenly takes his sickle and harvests,<br>
This interior harvest of tomorrows revealed by the Father.<br>
Let us announce the Truth multiplied like the loaves,<br>
Fear will become love, sorrow joy, fear confidence,<br>
This will be the finite comprising the Infinite.<br>
<br>
The man, who became Lazarus, spiritually resurrected,<br>
Will understand what You said to the Samaritan woman, what You traced in the sand, <br>
Will also include Your Look which frees the accused woman.<br>
We will enter into Your Community, poet of new parables.<br>
We will bear witness even in the face of overwhelming disappointments,<br>
Like at Emmaus two legendary brothers announced your resurrection,<br>
The Invisible Church is not a play on words by the Master,<br>
Through Faith and Love, She will raise us to the heights of Light.<br>
<br>
Then, You will give Peace to all forms of life,<br>
You will bring the triumph of knowledge to all our brothers in spirit.<br>
Father, from the source of your Son, we will drink to our fill,<br>
We will pray that everyone can one day join<br>
The joy of the mystics that illuminates Nebadon,<br>
Our prayers will mingle with the voice of the angels,<br>
The painful mystery of suffering flesh<br>
Will be marked with the seal of morontia rebirths.<br>
We will be, warriors of Your Peace,<br>
On Your path, among the fires of stars, To the perfections of Havona....and beyond...
