Priests and Levites harass John, asking him if he claimed to be the Messiah.
“Go and tell your leaders that you have heard 'the voice of one crying in the wilderness,' as the prophet expressed it, saying: Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight a path for our God” [UB 135:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p6_6) ([Jn. 1:23](/en/Bible/John/1#v23)) ([Mt. 3:11-12](/en/Bible/Matthew/3#v11)) ([Mk. 1:3](/en/Bible/Mark/1#v3)) ([Lk. 3:15-17](/en/Bible/Luke/3#v15))

### Solitary travels through Syria and Palestine (one year)

Year 25 of the calendar.
From June of that year until August of the year 26
This is the year of Jesus' solitary journeys through Palestine and
Syria. Throughout this year of travel, he was known by various names in different parts of the country: the carpenter of Nazareth, the boatbuilder of Capernaum, the scribe of Damascus, and the teacher of Alexandria. [UB 134:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p7_2)

### Year 32 of Jesus

year 26 of the calendar.
Last three weeks of August
Jesus spends them on Mount Hermon. This period of isolation on Mount Hermon marked the termination of his purely human career. Jesus attained absolute certainty about his nature and the truth of his triumph over the material levels of his personality in time and space. He fully believed in the predominance of his divine nature over his human nature [UB 134:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p8_5)

First three weeks of September
The great temptation occurs on Mount Hermon. Satan (representing Lucifer) and Caligastia, the rebel Planetary Prince, became fully visible to him. [UB 134:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p8_6) ([Lk. 4:1-13](/en/Bible/Luke/4#v1)) ([Mt. 4:1-11](/en/Bible/Matthew/4#v1)) ([Mk. 1:12-13](/en/Bible/Mark/1#v12))

That afternoon, Michael of Nebadon gained sovereignty over his universe. The Lucifer rebellion in Satania and the Caligastia secession on Urantia were practically settled. [UB 134:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p8_9)

Late September to early October
Jesus and John Zebedee leave for Jerusalem; John notes a great change in Jesus. [UB 134:9.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p9_1) Jesus and John in Jerusalem and Bethany. Jesus spent almost a week alone in the mountains near Bethany and then left for Capernaum; during the journey, he spent a day and a night on the slopes of Gilboa. [1495:1-2]

Early October to January 13
Jesus works these months in Zebedee's boat shop. [UB 134:9.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p9_7)
John the Baptist preaches and baptizes in the Jordan. “The kingdom of heaven is at hand; repent and be baptized.” [UB 134:9.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p9_8) ([Mt. 3:2](/en/Bible/Matthew/3#v2)) ([Mk. 1:4](/en/Bible/Mark/1#v4)) ([Lk. 3:3](/en/Bible/Luke/3#v3))

## THIRD STAGE. The Son of Man

Jesus began his public ministry when popular interest in John's preaching was at its height and at a time when the Jewish people of Palestine were anxiously awaiting the appearance of the Messiah. [UB 136:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p0_1)

### Year 32 of Jesus

Year 26 of the calendar
January 14, noon.
John baptizes Jesus and his brothers James and Judah in the Jordan. “_This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased._” [UB 135:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p8_6) ([Mt. 3:13-17](/en/Bible/Matthew/3#v13)) ([Lk. 3:21-22](/en/Bible/Luke/3#v21)) ([Mk. 1:9-11](/en/Bible/Mark/1#v9))

On that day, Jesus stood in the Jordan as a perfected mortal from the evolutionary worlds of time and space. A perfect synchronicity had been established between the mortal mind of Jesus and his Adjuster. As John laid his hands upon Jesus for baptism, the indwelling Adjuster bid farewell forever to the perfected human soul of Joshua ben Joseph. Jesus also witnessed his own divine spirit descend upon him and say: “_This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased._” [UB 136:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p2_3)

Immediately after the baptism, Jesus withdrew to the eastern mountains for 40 days. In the mountains, Jesus spoke with Gabriel and with the Constellation Father of Edentia, who appeared to them in person, saying, “_The records are completed. The sovereignty of Michael number 611,121 over his universe of Nebadon has been consummated at the right hand of the Universal Father…_” [UB 136:3.5-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p3_5)

Jesus planned the beginning of his public ministry with six “great decisions”:
1. Jesus decided to exclude all his universal hosts...from participating in his upcoming public ministry. ([Luke 4:10-11](/en/Bible/Luke/4#v10))
2. He decided to trust in the Father's provision for his human needs, teaching us to do the same. “_Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God._” ([Mt. 4:4](/en/Bible/Matthew/4#v4)) ([Lk. 4:4](/en/Bible/Luke/4#v4))
3. He decided to refrain from any superhuman intervention when the crisis of his life in the flesh arose. ([Mt. 4:6](/en/Bible/Matthew/4#v6))
4. He decided not to compromise with worldly wisdom and the influence of riches to establish the kingdom. ([Mt. 4:8-9](/en/Bible/Matthew/4#v8)) ([Lk. 4:6-7](/en/Bible/Luke/4#v6))
5. He decided that he would appear on Earth as the Prince of Peace to reveal a God of love.
6. He decided that he would return to Galilee and quietly begin the proclamation of the kingdom, trusting in his Father. [UB 136:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p5_1)

Later that same night, James and John Zebedee also declared themselves apostles. [UB 137:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p1_6) ([Mt. 4:21](/en/Bible/Matthew/4#v21))

At dusk, the seven arrived in Nazareth and spent the night at the house of Joseph, Jesus's brother. In this house, where he had spent his childhood, Jesus destroyed all his writings. [UB 137:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p2_9)

July 10th
Jesus and the apostles took a ship to Tarichea to call Thomas and Judas Iscariot. The apostles could not grasp the idea that Jesus had come to proclaim a new gospel of salvation and to establish a new way of encountering God; they did not perceive that he was a new revelation from the heavenly Father. [UB 138:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p5_2)

July 21st
Just as Jesus was about to send the Twelve on a missionary campaign, three of the apostles hounded him with questions that showed they had not yet grasped his message about the kingdom of heaven. [UB 138:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p7_1)

That same night in Capernaum, at the disciples' request, he imparted new teachings to them. “You find it difficult to receive my message because you would build the new teaching directly upon the old, but I affirm that you must be reborn.” [UB 140:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p6_2)

## FOURTH STAGE. The Son of God

_Jesus now begins the fourth and final stage of his human life in the flesh as the Son of God. The first stage was his infancy. The second stage encompasses the years of his youth, during which he understood his divine nature and human mission, and concludes with the experiences and revelations associated with his baptism. The third stage constitutes the years of his ministry as teacher and healer, up to the important moment of Peter's confession at Caesarea Philippi. In this stage, his apostles and disciples knew him as the Son of Man and regarded him as the Messiah. The fourth and final period of his earthly career began with the transfiguration on Mount Hermon and continued until the crucifixion. This stage of his ministry encompasses the works of his last year of life in the flesh._

When you speak this way, you are not on my side, but rather on the side of our enemy._” [UB 158:7.4-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p7_4) ([Mk. 8:31-38](/en/Bible/Mark/8#v31)) ([Mt. 16:21-28](/en/Bible/Matthew/16#v21)) ([Lk. 9:22-27](/en/Bible/Luke/9#v22))
Jesus and the Twelve arrive in Capernaum at dusk and eat at Simon Peter’s house.

At Hippos Jesus teaches the lesson on forgiveness, which included the parable of the lost sheep [UB 159:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p0_2) ([Lk. 15:1-7](/en/Bible/Luke/15#v1)) ([Mt. 18:10-14](/en/Bible/Matthew/18#v10))
Nathan’s confidential question to Jesus about the Hebrew Scriptures. “_The Father does not limit the revelation of truth to a particular generation or people._” “_Nothing that human nature has touched can be regarded as infallible._” “_Some of those who teach distort and twist the Scriptures, turning them into a guide for the menial details of daily life._” [UB 159:3.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p3_13)

September 16

The episode of the woman caught in adultery. “Woman, where are your accusers?” [1793:1-4] ([Jn. 8:1-11](/en/Bible/John/8#v1))
On the last day of the feast, Jesus proclaims: “If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink.” [UB 162:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p6_1) ([Jn. 7:37-39](/en/Bible/John/7#v37))
On the evening of that same day he declared: “If my words remain in you and you do the will of my Father, you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” [UB 162:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p7_2) ([Jn. 8:31-32](/en/Bible/John/8#v31))
Many of those who did not believe ran to look for stones to throw at him, and the spies of the Sanhedrin could not find a way to arrest him. [UB 162:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p7_6)
At Lazarus’s house, while Jesus is talking with the family: “Martha, Martha, why are you worried and upset about so many things?” [UB 162:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p8_3) ([Lk. 10:38-41](/en/Bible/Luke/10#v38))
The twelve apostles continued to instruct the people in the days after the feast; Jesus had already divided
His time between Bethany and Bethlehem during the feast, and then he went to Bethlehem to speak with and instruct Abner. Abner and the other apostles of John were to accompany him in the final labors before his death. [UB 162:9.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p9_5)

November 19
On this Sabbath, Jesus ordained the seventy gospel teachers and preachers; Abner was placed at their head. Also present were David Zebedee and most of the group of his messengers, more than four hundred believers, who witnessed the ordination. Kneeling in a circle around them, the Master laid his hands on the head of each of them. “I am sending you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves.” [UB 163:1.1-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p1_1) ([[Luke 10:1-12](/en/Bible/Luke/10#v1](/en/Bible/Luke/10#v1))
After speaking with Jesus, more than a dozen candidates no longer desired to become gospel messengers. The cost of following Jesus. The dialogue with the rich young ruler. “_If you wish to be my messenger, go, sell all that you possess; when you have given the proceeds to the poor…_” [UB 163:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p1_4) ([Lk. 18:18-29](/en/Bible/Luke/18#v18)) ([Mt. 19:16-30](/en/Bible/Matthew/19#v16)) ([Mk. 10:17-31](/en/Bible/Mark/10#v17))

November 20
Early in the morning Abner sent the seventy out to all the cities of Galilee, Samaria, and Judea. [UB 163:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p1_6) These 35 missionary pairs go out to preach for a period of 6 weeks. [UB 163:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p1_6) Jesus dismissed them with seven points to emphasize.
The gospel of the kingdom is to be proclaimed throughout the world, to Gentiles as well as to Jews. When caring for the sick, refrain from teaching them to expect miracles. Proclaim a spiritual brotherhood of the children of God. Avoid wasting time through excessive social calls. Remain in the house you have selected throughout your stay in the city. Indicate clearly that the time has come to break with the religious leaders in Jerusalem. And the last: Love the Lord your God with all your mind and with all your soul, and your neighbor as yourself. They were to teach that this last point represented the whole duty of man, instead of the 613 rules of life set forth by the Pharisees. [UB 163:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p3_4)

[UB 165:1.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p1_1) In a session where the Jewish leaders from Jerusalem and the apostles were present, Jesus taught the parable of the sheepfold. “_The true shepherd, when morning comes, enters the sheepfold by the door, and when he knocks, the sheep know his voice_” ([John 10:1-6](/en/Bible/John/10#v1))
“_The thief breaks into the sheepfold only to steal and kill and destroy; but I have come that you may all have life, and have it abundantly._” [UB 165:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p1_3) ([Jn. 10:10](/en/Bible/John/10#v10))

Other Pharisees come to the breakfast and are scandalized when they see that Jesus does not wash his hands. “_Woe to you, Pharisees, who have persisted in rejecting the light of life! You are particular in your tithing and give alms ostentatiously, yet you knowingly despise the visitation of God and reject the revelation of his love!_” _Woe to you! You find your greatest satisfaction in building tombs for the prophets your fathers killed!_ [UB 166:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p0_1) ([Mt. 23:1-36](/en/Bible/Matthew/23#v1)) ([Mk. 12:38-40](/en/Bible/Mark/12#v38)) ([Lk. 11:37-54](/en/Bible/Luke/11#v37))

In Gerasa, Jesus preaches a sermon on the interpretation of several Jewish proverbs. “_You have a teaching that the way to destruction is broad, and its entrance is wide, and many choose to follow that way. But I declare that salvation is, first of all, a matter of personal choice_.” [UB 166:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p3_6) ([Mt. 7:21-23](/en/Bible/Matthew/7#v21)) ([Lk. 13:22-30](/en/Bible/Luke/13#v22))

By the time the messenger arrived in Philadelphia, Lazarus had in fact been dead for several hours. Jesus decided to give the scribes and Pharisees one more opportunity to accept his teachings and do the most profound and astonishing work of his entire earthly career.

Wednesday morning. Jesus asks his apostles to prepare to return to Judea again; the apostles protest, fearing for their safety, but Thomas finally declares: “_Let us also go, that we may die with him._” [UB 167:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p4_7)
On the way to Bethany, Jesus spoke to about fifty followers, friends and enemies alike, about the “conditions of salvation” and told them the parable of the Pharisee and the publican. That same evening at Jericho, Jesus answered a question about marriage and divorce, exalting marriage as the most ideal and highest of human relationships. [UB 167:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p5_3)

March 2
Jesus blesses the children of Jericho. “_Let the little children come to me; do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these._”
([Mt. 19:13-15](/en/Bible/Matthew/19#v13)) ([Mk. 10:13-16](/en/Bible/Mark/10#v13)) ([Lk. 9:15-17](/en/Bible/Luke/9#v15))

Later, on the road to Bethany, Jesus spoke to his disciples about the angels. “_The angelic hosts are a distinct order of created beings; they are entirely different from the material order of mortal creatures, and they function as a distinct group of universe intelligences.... It is the ministry of angels that makes it possible for one world to maintain contact with other worlds._” [UB 167:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p6_2)

The group arrived in Bethany shortly after noon. Martha met them. “_Master, if you had been here, my brother would not have died._” Jesus and the heavenly host raised Lazarus to life in the presence of about 45 mortals. “_I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, even if they die, will live. Indeed, whoever lives and believes in me will never really die._” [1843:2-3] ([Jn. 11:1-44](/en/Bible/John/11#v1))
Unfortunately, the resurrection of Lazarus had little influence on the attitude of the religious leaders. [UB 168:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p0_1)

March 3
Friday. By noon, all of Jerusalem knew about the resurrection, and many went to Bethany to see Lazarus. The Sanhedrin met to deliberate on the question, “_What shall we do with Jesus of Nazareth?_” Nineteen members broke away from the Sanhedrin. The following week, Lazarus and his brothers were brought before the council and questioned. Caiaphas, the high priest, uttered the famous phrase: “_It is better for one man to die than for the whole community to perish_” ([Jn. 11:50](/en/Bible/John/11#v50)).
Jesus rests on Saturday at Bethphage. [1847:1-6]

March 5th
Sunday. Jesus and the apostles leave the Bethany family and begin their journey to Pella. [UB 168:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p3_7)
On the way, Jesus explained to the apostles the matter of answered prayer. “_Prayer is an expression of the finite mind, in its striving to approach the infinite._” [UB 168:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p4_1)

March 6 to 12
Jesus and the ten apostles arrived at the Pella camp on Monday afternoon, the 6th. It was a very active week, both teaching the crowds and instructing the apostles. On Thursday, to illustrate his teaching on “the grace of salvation,” Jesus told his favorite parable of the prodigal son. He also told the parable of the shrewd manager and the story of the rich man and the beggar. “_...the Father accepts you even before you have repented, and he sends the Son and his associates to find you and bring you back to the fold with joy..._” [UB 169:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/169#p1_3) ([John 15:11-31](/en/Bible/John/15#v11))
On Saturday afternoon, March 11, Jesus preached his last sermon at Pella, fully and thoroughly explaining the kingdom of heaven. “The kingdom of heaven is within you.” He taught that through faith, the believer immediately enters the kingdom. [UB 170:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p0_1) ([Luke 17:21](/en/Bible/Luke/17#v21))

March 12
Jesus announces that the next day, he and his apostles will leave for Jerusalem for Passover. His followers were once again mistaken in thinking he would go to Jerusalem to proclaim the reign of Jewish supremacy.
This Sunday afternoon, Salome, the mother of the apostles James and John, arrives, asking Jesus for honors for her sons in the coming kingdom. “_Woman, you do not know what you are asking for._” [UB 171:0.1-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p0_1) ([Mt. 20:20-28](/en/Bible/Matthew/20#v20)) ([Mk. 10:35-45](/en/Bible/Mark/10#v35))

March 13 to 31
On Monday afternoon, the 13th, Jesus and the twelve apostles finally left the camp at Pella. [UB 171:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p1_1) On the way to Jerusalem, they visited all the cities where the seventy were working and talked with them. The journey lasted two weeks. [UB 171:1.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p1_1)
At Bethabara beyond the Jordan, Jesus spoke to a crowd of nearly 1,000 followers about “_What It Costs to Follow Jesus._” “_From now on, those of you who would follow me must be willing to pay the price of total dedication to doing my Father’s will._” [UB 171:2.2-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p2_2)
Immediately afterward, Jesus and the twelve started on their way to Heshbon, followed by about five hundred; the other five hundred went straight on to Jerusalem. [UB 171:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p3_1)
On Wednesday the 29th, Jesus and his followers camped at Livias. Simon Zelotes and Simon Peter received over 100 swords, which they distributed to all who would accept them. [UB 171:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p4_1)
The next day, Jesus warns the apostles not to trust in the uncertainty of the flesh and warns them of their imminent death.
Friendly Pharisees come to Jesus and urge him to flee, as Herod is seeking to kill him. Jesus replies that Herod would rather see the Son of Man suffer and die at the hands of the chief priests. He told his apostles that it is fitting that the Son of Man be sacrificed as the price of human fanaticism and as a result of religious prejudice and spiritual blindness. “_O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone the teachers of the truth!_” [UB 171:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p3_4) ([Luke 13:34](/en/Bible/Luke/13#v34)) ([Mt. 23:37-39](/en/Bible/Matthew/23#v37))
Jesus and the apostles at Jericho. Blind Bartimaeus. [UB 171:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p5_3) ([Mk. 10:46-52](/en/Bible/Mark/10#v46)) ([Lk. 18:35-43](/en/Bible/Luke/18#v35))
At Jericho, Jesus said to Zacchaeus, who had climbed a tree to get a better look at the Master: “Hurry, Zacchaeus, and come down from the tree, for I must stay at your house tonight.” [UB 171:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p6_2) ([Luke 19:1-10](/en/Bible/Luke/19#v1))

The following day, Jesus and the apostles left Jericho, heading along the “thieves' road” toward Bethany.
During a lunch break, Jesus told the apostles the parable of the Mines. [UB 171:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p7_6) ([Luke 19:11-27](/en/Bible/Luke/19#v11))
On March 31, around 4:00 p.m., Jesus and the apostles arrived at Bethany, where Lazarus, Martha, and Mary were waiting. That afternoon, Jesus received many visitors from Bethany and Bethphage. [UB 172:0.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p0_1)

April 1st
Saturday night. People from Bethany and Bethphage gathered to celebrate Jesus’ arrival with a public banquet at Simon’s house. Near the end of the celebration, Mary, the sister of Lazarus, anointed the Master’s head and feet with precious oil. “This woman has kept up this ointment for a long time against the burial of my body; and since it seemed good to her to perform this anointing in anticipation of my death, this satisfaction will not be withheld from her.” [UB 172:1.5-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p1_5) ([Mt. 26:6-13](/en/Bible/Matthew/26#v6)) ([Mk. 14:3-9](/en/Bible/Mark/14#v3)) ([Jn. 12:1-8](/en/Bible/John/12#v1))

April 2
Sunday morning. Jesus gives the apostles final instructions before entering Jerusalem. After being warned by Jesus, Lazarus flees to Philadelphia a couple of days later to save his life. [UB 172:2.1-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p2_1)
Around 1:30 p.m. Jesus’ triumphal entry into Jerusalem begins. “Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.” [UB 172:3.8-14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p3_8) ([Mt. 21:1-11](/en/Bible/Matthew/21#v1)) ([Mk. 11:1-11](/en/Bible/Mark/11#v1)) ([Lk. 19:28-44](/en/Bible/Luke/19#v28)) ([Jn. 12:12-19](/en/Bible/John/12#v12)) While Jesus and the apostles are walking through the temple, the event of the offering of the poor widow, dressed in rags, occurs. »That poor widow has put in more than all the others, for... she has given all that she had, even her living. [UB 172:4.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p4_1) ([Mk. 12:41-43](/en/Bible/Mark/12#v41)) ([Lk. 21:1-4](/en/Bible/Luke/21#v1))

Jesus, Peter, and John stayed with Simon in Bethany, while the other apostles stayed with their friends. [UB 172:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p4_3)

April 3
On Monday, Jesus and the apostles arrived at the temple around 9:00 a.m. As he was about to begin his teaching, he saw the immense commercial trade in animals and the wealth it generated for the high priests. He also saw the humiliation many faithful suffered at the hands of the animal examiners and the deception they were subjected to. All of this leads to the event of the cleansing of the temple. [UB 173:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/173#p1_8) ([Mt. 21:12-13](/en/Bible/Matthew/21#v12)) ([Mk. 11:15-18](/en/Bible/Mark/11#v15)) ([Lk. 19:45-46](/en/Bible/Luke/19#v45)) ([Jn. 2:13-16](/en/Bible/John/2#v13))
The evening session of the Sanhedrin unanimously agrees that Jesus must be destroyed; they appoint five groups to go find Jesus and discredit him while he is teaching. Around 2:00 p.m., the first of these groups arrives and interrupts Jesus’ teachings. “_By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?_” [UB 173:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/173#p2_2) ([Mt. 21:23-27](/en/Bible/Matthew/21#v23)) ([Mk. 11:27-33](/en/Bible/Mark/11#v27)) ([Lk. 20:1-8](/en/Bible/Luke/20#v1))
Jesus and the Parables of the Two Disobedient Sons ([Mt. 21:28-32](/en/Bible/Matthew/21#v28))
“The wicked tenants” ([Mt. 21:33-46](/en/Bible/Matthew/21#v33)) ([Mk. 12:1-12](/en/Bible/Mark/12#v1)) ([Lk. 20:9-19](/en/Bible/Luke/20#v9))

About 4:00 p.m., Jesus and the apostles leave the temple and go to Bethany to dine and rest. [UB 173:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/173#p5_5)

April 4th
Tuesday, 7 a.m. Jesus meets with the apostles, the women's group, and some other disciples at Simon's house. He bids farewell to Lazarus. He greets each of the apostles with a personal message. Then he leaves with Andrew, Peter, James, and John for Jerusalem while the other apostles remain at the camp in Gethsemane. Jesus teaches the four apostles about “Divine Forgiveness.” “_In every son lives a fraction of his father. In the case of the earth son and the heavenly Father, the divine father possesses, in an infinite and divine way, compassion and the capacity for loving understanding. Divine forgiveness is inevitable..._” [UB 174:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p0_1)
As soon as Jesus began his teaching in the temple, a group of distractors tried to trap him with a question about paying taxes. “_Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s._” ([Mt. 22:15-22](/en/Bible/Matthew/22#v15)) ([Mk. 12:13-17](/en/Bible/Mark/12#v13)) ([Lk. 20:19-26](/en/Bible/Luke/20#v19))
Two more groups asked him “leading” questions. [UB 174:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p2_1)
A lawyer asks him: “Teacher, which is the first commandment?” [1901:2-3] ([Mt. 22:34-39](/en/Bible/Matthew/22#v34)) ([Mk. 12:28-34](/en/Bible/Mark/12#v28))
At noon, Philip was approached by a delegation of thirty Greek believers from Alexandria, Athens, and Rome. Jesus received them at the home of Joseph of Arimathea, where he and the apostles were having lunch. In the middle of Jesus’ discourse to the Greeks, his Personal Adjuster appeared, saying: “_I have glorified my name in thy bestowals many times, and I will glorify it once more._” [UB 174:5.10-11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p5_10) After the discourse, Jesus took the apostles and a number of the disciples back to the temple in Jerusalem. Also with him were Joseph of Arimathea and the thirty Greeks. They arrived shortly after 2:00 p.m. [UB 174:5.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p5_14)

The temple courtyard was quiet and orderly as Jesus gave his final speech to the crowd: “_I solemnly warn you in the name of the Father who sent me that you are about to lose your position in the world as standard-bearers of eternal truth and custodians of divine law._”… “_And now I call my disciples and the believers in the gospel of the kingdom, and the invisible messengers who stand with them, as witnesses, that I have once again offered Israel and its leaders deliverance and salvation._”… “_O Jerusalem and children of Abraham, you who stoned the prophets and killed the teachers who were sent to you—even now I would like to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you are unwilling._” ([Mt. 23:37-39](/en/Bible/Matthew/23#v37)) ([Lk. 13:34-35](/en/Bible/Luke/13#v34))
“ _Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! . . . You refuse to enter the kingdom, and at the same time you do everything you can to prevent everyone else from entering_” ([Mt. 23:1-36](/en/Bible/Matthew/23#v1)) ([Mk. 12:38-40](/en/Bible/Mark/12#v38)) ([Lk. 11:37-54](/en/Bible/Luke/11#v37)) [UB 175:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/175#p0_1)
On their return to Gethsemane, Jesus and his associates took the route through the Kidron Valley. By the faint light of the full moon, Jesus and the twelve sat down, and Jesus spoke to them about the time when “_this people shall have filled the cup of their iniquity,_” foretold the destruction of Jerusalem, again taught the twelve that his kingdom is not of this world, announced the outpouring of his spirit upon all flesh, and further promised his return to this world someday; “_but the time when the Son of Man shall appear is known only to the counselors in Paradise._” By the time they concluded their journey to the camp, Judas had finally confirmed his decision to abandon his associates. [UB 176:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p1_2)

Just before midnight, the Sanhedrin voted unanimously to sentence both Jesus and Lazarus to death. [UB 175:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/175#p3_1)
The Sanhedrin officers were instructed to arrest Jesus the next morning, but the arrest could not take place in public. The members of the Sanhedrin were to meet again at 10:00 a.m. the next day at the home of Caiaphas, the high priest, where they were to formulate charges against Jesus. [UB 175:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/175#p3_3)

April 5th
Nine-year-old John Mark spends “a day alone with God.” [UB 177:1.3-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/177#p1_3)
At 10:00 a.m. the Sanhedrin met at Caiaphas's house to formulate the charges for which Jesus would be called to trial.
Judas Iscariot disappears upon entering Jerusalem, where he, with a cousin as spokesman, conspires with Caiaphas and the Jewish officials to betray Jesus. [UB 177:4, 8-11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/177#p4_8)
The eleven apostles spend most of the day walking on the Mount of Olives and visiting with disciples. Shortly after noon, the Greeks arrive at the camp. [UB 177:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/177#p3_5)
In the afternoon, Judas Iscariot returns to the camp at Gethsemane, filled with thoughts of greatness and glory. David Zebedee's messenger arrives with news that Salome and Jesus' family were on their way to Jerusalem. [UB 177:3.1-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/177#p3_1)
At night Jesus conversed with the Greeks, and he would have ordained them had it not annoyed the apostles. [UB 177:3.5-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/177#p3_5)

April 6
Thursday. After breakfast, Jesus led the apostles (Judas was not with them) and about 40 others to a secluded place where he delivered his farewell message. This two-hour discourse dealt with “the kingdom of heaven and the kingdoms of this world.” It was nearly 1:00 p.m. when Jesus finished speaking, and everyone returned to camp for lunch. Few of the Master's listeners were able to understand even a part of his discourse. Of all who heard him, the group of Greeks among them understood him best. [UB 178:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p0_1)

After the meal, the messengers from Jerusalem and Philadelphia arrive. Jesus orders Philip, Peter, and John to prepare the apostolic supper to be held that evening in Jerusalem. Around 4:30 p.m., the three apostles return from Jerusalem, reporting that everything is ready for the supper. Jesus then departs with the apostles along the Bethany road toward Jerusalem. They enter Jerusalem after sunset, after spending some time on the Mount of Olives, where Jesus spoke to the Twelve.
“_It is essential that I go, but you must stay and bear witness to this gospel after I am gone._” “_Just as the Father sent me into this world, I am about to send you to represent me and finish the work I have begun._” [1934:3-6]

Then they went down from the Mount of Olives, entered the city, and walked through the streets toward the house of the family of young John Mark.
Celebration of the Last Supper. “_I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you._” [UB 179:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p2_1) ([Luke 22:15](/en/Bible/Luke/22#v15))
The washing of feet. Peter loved the Master. He was the first human being to wholeheartedly believe in Jesus' divinity and to fully and publicly confess this belief. Judas Iscariot leaves the table after Jesus tells him, “_What you have decided to do, do quickly_” ([Jn. 13:27](/en/Bible/John/13#v27)). Judas went and agreed with the Sanhedrin and then with the captain of the Roman guards about the details of Jesus' arrest.
Jesus institutes the Last Supper saying: “_Take this cup, all of you, and drink from it.” “Take this bread of remembrance and eat it._” “_As often as you do this, do it in remembrance of me._” ([Mt. 26:17-29](/en/Bible/Matthew/26#v17)) ([Mk. 14:12-25](/en/Bible/Mark/14#v12)) ([Lk. 22:7-23](/en/Bible/Luke/22#v7)) ([Jn. 13:21-30](/en/Bible/John/13#v21))
The supper of remembrance is the believer's symbolic encounter with Michael. When you thus become spirit-conscious, the Son is actually present, and his spirit fellowships with the inner fragment of his Father. [UB 179:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_2)
The Farewell Discourse. “_The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified, and the Father will be glorified in me. My friends, I will be with you only a little while longer._” ([Jn. 13:31-33](/en/Bible/John/13#v31))
The New Commandment: “_Love one another as I have loved you. If you have this love for one another, all men will know that you are my disciples_” ([Jn. 13:34-35](/en/Bible/John/13#v34))
The Vine and the Branches. _“If you remain in me and my words live in you, you will have the freedom to receive me by your fellowship, and whatever my spirit desires, you will be able to ask for all these things, knowing that the Father will grant us our request._” ([Jn. 15:1-16](/en/Bible/John/15#v1))
The enmity of the world. “_Whoever hates me hates my Father. It cannot be otherwise; the light that would save you if you accept it can condemn you only if you knowingly reject it._” ([John 15:18-27](/en/Bible/John/15#v18))
The promise of the Spirit of Truth. “_Since I have left my children alone on earth, it is in keeping with my promise that I will send them another instructor. And when the Father approves, I will pour out the Spirit of Truth on all mankind._” ([John 14:15-20](/en/Bible/John/14#v15))
The Need to Depart. “_It is indeed beneficial for you that I go away. If I do not go, the new teacher will not be able to come into your hearts._”… “_However, when the Spirit of Truth comes, he will eventually guide you into all truth._” [UB 180:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p0_1) ([John 16:1-15](/en/Bible/John/16#v1))

After expressing his last words of comfort, he personally addressed each of the apostles present and bade them farewell. [UB 181:1.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/181#p1_10)
About 10:00 p.m., after singing a hymn, they departed for the encampment on the Mount of Olives. [UB 181:2.31](/en/The_Urantia_Book/181#p2_31)
Jesus asked them to kneel in a circle around him as they had done on the day of his ordination; then he raised his eyes to heaven and prayed: “_Father, my hour has come; glorify now your Son that the Son may glorify you._” [UB 182:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p0_1) ([John 17:1-26](/en/Bible/John/17#v1))
They return to the camp. While Jesus tells the rest of the apostles to go to their tents to sleep, Jesus asks Peter, James, and John to stay with him a while longer. Jesus and the three apostles walked along a nearby path. Jesus prayed alone three times, deep in terrible tribulation; when he returned to the three, he found them fast asleep. [UB 182:2.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p2_13) ([Mt. 26:36-46](/en/Bible/Matthew/26#v36)) ([Mk. 14:32-42](/en/Bible/Mark/14#v32)) ([Lk. 22:39-46](/en/Bible/Luke/22#v39))

Then they returned to the camp, but the apostles could not sleep.

Jesus sat alone in the winepress, where he awaited the arrival of the traitor. [UB 183:0.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/183#p0_5)
At 11:30 p.m., Judas and about sixty people—guards, Roman soldiers, and curious servants of the high priests—left the temple for Gethsemane. The three apostles and about thirty of their followers hurried toward the olive press when the armed band arrived to arrest Jesus. “_Whom are you looking for?_” The captain replied, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Then Jesus immediately stood before the officer, and with the calm majesty of the God of all creation, he said, “_It is I._” ([Mt. 26:47-56](/en/Bible/Matthew/26#v47)) ([Mk. 14:43-50](/en/Bible/Mark/14#v43)) ([Lk. 22:47-53](/en/Bible/Luke/22#v47)) ([Jn. 18:2-11](/en/Bible/John/18#v2))
After Jesus was arrested, the eleven apostles met at the winepress to reflect on the situation. [UB 183:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/183#p3_8)

Because Roman law permitted every prisoner to have at least one friend with him before the tribunal, the apostle John was allowed to accompany Jesus when he was taken to the palace of Annas. Judas marched on one side, near the captains, and Peter was far behind. [UB 183:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/183#p5_1)
At midnight, the Sanhedrin tribunal, with about thirty members present, meets in the palace of Caiaphas, the high priest, waiting for the court session to begin. Meanwhile, Jesus is taken to the palace of Annas, the former high priest. [UB 184:0.1-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p0_1)

April 7
Jesus is interrogated by Annas. Annas’s chief servant strikes Jesus in the face. “My friend, if I have spoken evil, bear witness against the evil; but if I have spoken the truth, then why do you strike me?” [UB 184:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p1_6) ([Jn. 18:19-24](/en/Bible/John/18#v19))
Annas leaves Jesus at the mercy of his employees for almost an hour.
Meanwhile, Peter was in the courtyard of Caiaphas’s palace. Peter’s denial. “I am not a follower of that man; I do not even know him; I have never heard of him before.” [UB 184:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p1_9) ([Mt. 26:71-75](/en/Bible/Matthew/26#v71)) ([Mk. 14:66-72](/en/Bible/Mark/14#v66)) ([Lk. 22:54-62](/en/Bible/Luke/22#v54)) ([Jn. 18:25-27](/en/Bible/John/18#v25))
After further interrogations, Annas sent Jesus bound and guarded by the temple guards to Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin tribunal. At 3:30 a.m. on this Friday, Caiaphas called the court to order for Jesus's official trial. Annas arrived at the meeting place shortly after the false witnesses' testimony had begun. After Jesus declared his true identity, Caiaphas violently struck him in the face; many of those in the tribunal did the same and even spat on him. The first session of the trial ended in disorder. This was followed by the “hour of humiliation,” when Jesus was handed over to the temple guards and Caiaphas's servants. [UB 184:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p0_1) ([Mt. 26:57-68](/en/Bible/Matthew/26#v57)) ([Mk. 14:53-65](/en/Bible/Mark/14#v53)) ([Lk. 22:63-71](/en/Bible/Luke/22#v63)) ([Jn. 18:12-24](/en/Bible/John/18#v12))

At 5:30 a.m., the court resumes. At 6:00 a.m., they agree that Jesus deserves death and decide to take three accusations to Pilate to confirm his sentence.
Pilate, the Roman procurator and governor, receives Jesus accompanied by about 50 of his accusers; Judas Iscariot, Caiaphas, and the apostle John were present. Pilate takes Jesus and John Zebedee to a private room. After questioning the Master, Pilate returns to Jesus' accusers and says he finds no fault in him and decides to send him to Herod Antipas. Herod asks Jesus a few questions and requests that he perform a miracle. Finally, convinced that Jesus would not speak or perform a miracle for him, he placed an old royal purple robe on Jesus and sent him back to Pilate. [UB 185:4.1-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p4_1)
On the steps of the Praetorium, Pilate makes several attempts to convince the Jewish leaders of Jesus' innocence. A crowd had gathered outside the Praetorium, demanding the release of a prisoner. Pilate offered to release Jesus instead of Barabbas, a notorious political agitator and murderous robber, but the crowd shouted that they wanted Barabbas released. Pilate's question: “_What shall I do with him who is called the King of the Jews?” The crowd's response: “Crucify him! Crucify him._”
Pilate decides to interrogate Jesus again. Pilate washes his hands and hands Jesus over to the soldiers to be crucified. [UB 185:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p5_1)
([Mt. 27:1-2, 11-31](/en/Bible/Matthew/27#v1)) ([Mk. 15:1-20](/en/Bible/Mark/15#v1)) ([Lk. 23:1-5, 13-25](/en/Bible/Luke/23#v1)) ([Jn. 18:28-40, 19:1-16](/en/Bible/John/18#v28))

Around 8:30 a.m., the priests retired to a meeting with the full members of the Sanhedrin, where Judas soon appeared to claim his reward for his role in Jesus’ arrest. Humiliated by the payment of 30 pieces of silver, he began to repent. He had seen part of the crucifixion from afar; then he wandered through the city toward the Valley of Hinnom, where he committed suicide, overwhelmed by his sin. [UB 186:1.3-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/186#p1_3) ([Mt. 27:3-10](/en/Bible/Matthew/27#v3))

At the same time, David Zebedee dispatched several messengers to various centers of believers with the message that Jesus was about to be crucified. [UB 186:3.3-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/186#p3_3)
Shortly before 9:00 a.m., twelve Roman soldiers, led by a centurion, led Jesus and the two robbers toward Golgotha. As they passed by, many devout women wept and lamented. “_Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but rather for yourselves and for your children._” [UB 187:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p1_6) ([Luke 23:28](/en/Bible/Luke/23#v28))

**The crucifixion of Jesus.** The procession of death arrives at Golgotha shortly after 9 a.m. and the crucifixion occurs about half an hour later.
“_Father, forgive them for they know not what they do._” “_I am thirsty._”
“_Truly, truly, I say to you today, one day you will be with me in Paradise._”
“_Woman, here is your son. And he spoke to John and said, “My son, here is your mother.” «It is finished!_”
“_Father, into your hands I commend my spirit._”
([Mt. 27:32-50](/en/Bible/Matthew/27#v32)) ([Mk. 15:21-37](/en/Bible/Mark/15#v21)) ([Lk. 23:26-49](/en/Bible/Luke/23#v26)) ([Jn. 19:17-37](/en/Bible/John/19#v17))
During these frightful hours, the invisible hosts of a universe beheld this extraordinary phenomenon in which the Creator was experiencing the death of the creature.
The apostle John, Mary, Ruth and Judah arrive on the scene a few minutes later.
Shortly after 12 noon, a sandstorm begins to blow. Shortly after 1:00 p.m., Jesus begins to lose his human consciousness. The last conscious thought of the human Jesus was occupied with mentally repeating a portion of the Book of Psalms now known as Psalms 20, 21, and 22.
Just before 3:00 p.m., Jesus cried out, “It is finished.” [UB 187:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p5_5)
Witnesses at the scene of his death included John Zebedee, his brother Judah, his sister Ruth, Mary Magdalene, and Rebekah of Zipporah. Shortly afterward, a Roman soldier struck him in the left side. ([Jn. 19:34](/en/Bible/John/19#v34))
David Zebedee sends messengers with the news that the Master had died. [UB 187:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p6_1)

Jesus is buried, assisted by the Roman centurion, shortly after 4:00 P.M. in a new family tomb belonging to Joseph of Arimathea, after he and Nicodemus persuaded Pilate to issue a permit. [UB 188:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p0_1) ([Mt. 27:56-61](/en/Bible/Matthew/27#v56)) ([Mk. 15:42-47](/en/Bible/Mark/15#v42)) ([Lk. 23:50-56](/en/Bible/Luke/23#v50)) ([Jn. 19:42](/en/Bible/John/19#v42))

April 8
Saturday morning. A group of Jewish leaders had met the night before to discuss their fears about the Master's claims that he would rise from the dead on the third day. They decided to ask Pilate to post a guard of Roman soldiers at Jesus' tomb. That Saturday, Pilate offered the Jewish leaders a group of ten soldiers to guard Jesus' tomb. These soldiers, along with ten other Jewish soldiers, rolled another stone to seal the tomb and placed Pilate's seal on it. [UB 188:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p2_3)
That night, the eleven apostles met at the home of young John Mark, in the same upstairs room where the Last Supper had been held two nights earlier. [UB 188:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p3_2)

### The Resurrection

The chief Archangel of Nebadon convenes his council for the resurrection of will creatures. They follow the suggestion of Gabriel, who pointed out that since Michael had “_laid down his life of his own free will, he also had the power to recover it according to his own decision._” Shortly thereafter, the Personalized Adjuster of Jesus speaks to them: “_... What you behold is the human transition of Jesus of Nazareth from life in the flesh to life in morontia... Your Creator-Father has chosen to pass through the entire experience of his mortal creatures, from birth on the material worlds through natural death to the morontia resurrection to the state of true spirit existence...._” [UB 189:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p0_1)
After the Personal Adjuster speaks to them, all assume an attitude of anxious expectation. [UB 189:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p0_3)

April 9
Sunday. The Resurrection. At 2:45 a.m. the Paradise incarnation commission deploys around the tomb. At 2:50 a.m. intense vibrations of material and morontia activities begin to emanate from the sepulchre. At 3:02 a.m. the resurrected morontia personality of Jesus of Nazareth leaves the tomb; the material body remains intact in the grave. Soon afterward the commission of seven departed. Jesus enters his morontia career. [UB 189:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p0_1)
At 3:10 a.m., Jesus fellowships with the assembled morontia personalities of the seven mansion worlds of Satania; at the same time, the chief of archangels requests Gabriel's permission to dissolve Jesus' material body. Jesus' body is removed from the tomb and almost instantly dissolved. [UB 189:1.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p1_10)
The enormous tomb stone moves of its own accord before the guards' eyes. They become frightened and flee the scene. [UB 189:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p2_4) ([Mt. 28:4](/en/Bible/Matthew/28#v4))
Shortly after 4:30, Gabriel called the archangels to his side and prepared to inaugurate on Urantia the general resurrection of the close of the Adamic dispensation. Then Morontia Michael (Jesus) said: “_Just as my Father has life in himself, so he has given to the Son to have life in himself…_” [UB 189:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p3_1)

Simultaneously, shortly before 3:00 a.m., five of the believing women who had been staying at Joseph of Arimathea’s house went out to the tomb with embalming lotions and linen bandages, trying to give Jesus’ body a better burial. ([Luke 24:1](/en/Bible/Luke/24#v1)) ([Mk. 16:1](/en/Bible/Mark/16#v1))
Around 3:30 a.m., the five women arrived at the tomb and were shocked to find the stones had been rolled out of place. Only Mary Magdalene dared to enter the grave, and she discovered it was empty. [2025:6-7] ([Luke 24:2](/en/Bible/Luke/24#v2))

The morontia Jesus appeared to the five women at the tomb. Then to Mary. “_Touch me not, Mary... But go all of you now, and tell my apostles, and Peter, that I am risen, and that you have spoken with me._” [UB 189:4.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p4_12) ([Mt. 28:10](/en/Bible/Matthew/28#v10)) ([Jn. 20:17](/en/Bible/John/20#v17))
The women hurried to the home of Elijah Mark to pass on to the apostles the message Jesus had asked them to deliver. The apostles were not inclined to believe them. Peter and John rushed to the tomb and also found it empty. (John 20:3-6). Mary hurried back to Mark's home and told the seven assembled apostles that she had spoken with Jesus again; they did not believe her, but after Peter and John's return they were filled with fear and apprehension. LU 189:4.11
At 9:30 a.m., David Zebedee sent out his 26 messengers for the last time with the following message to the believers: “_Jesus has risen from the dead; the tomb is empty._” [UB 190:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p1_5)

About noon, Jesus made his third appearance, this time at Bethany to his brother James. James had difficulty, like everyone else, recognizing the Master's morontia form, but few of them had the slightest problem recognizing his voice as he began to communicate with them. “_James, I come to call you into kingdom service. Join your brethren wholeheartedly and follow me._” [UB 190:2.3-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p2_3)

Shortly before 2:00 p.m., at the Bethany home of Martha and Mary, Jesus appeared for the fourth time to 20 people, including his earthly family, friends, and Mary Magdalene. “... Enter therefore all into the fellowship of the Spirit of Truth into the kingdom of the Father.” [UB 190:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p2_6)

At about 4:15 p.m., Jesus’ fifth morontia appearance occurred in the presence of about 25 believing women, including Mary Magdalene, at the home of Joseph of Arimathea. “_Peace be with you. In the brotherhood of the kingdom there will be neither Jew nor Gentile, rich nor poor, free nor bond, male nor female…_” [UB 190:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p3_1)

At about 4:30 p.m. at Flavius's house, Jesus makes his sixth morontia appearance to about 40 Greek believers. “In my Father's kingdom there will be neither Jew nor Gentile; you will all be brothers—the sons of God.” [UB 190:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p4_1)

A few minutes before 5:00 p.m., about three miles outside Jerusalem, two brothers, Cleopas and Jacob, were walking toward Emmaus. Jesus accompanied them and talked with them. When they invited Jesus to stay with them, and as soon as they recognized him, the morontia Jesus vanished from their sight. Afterward, they remarked among themselves: “_No wonder our hearts burned within us while he talked to us as we walked along the highway, and while he opened our minds to the teachings of the Scriptures!_” [UB 190:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p5_6) ([Luke 24:32](/en/Bible/Luke/24#v32)) ([Mk. 16:12-13](/en/Bible/Mark/16#v12))
Cleopas and Jacob hurried back to Jerusalem to inform the apostles of their encounter with Jesus; they arrived in the Upper Room just before 9:00 p.m. [UB 190:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p4_2)

At about 8:30 p.m., Jesus appeared to Simon Peter in the garden of Mark's house. “_Peter, the enemy wanted to possess you, but I would not abandon you. I knew that you had not denied me from your heart; therefore, I forgave you even before you asked me..._” [UB 191:1.1-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/191#p1_1)

Shortly after 9 p.m., after Cleopas and Jacob had left, the Master, in morontia form, appears for the first time among the ten apostles who were present (Thomas was not in the upper room). “_Peace be with you. Why are you so frightened when I appear, as though you saw a spirit?_” “_I will remain with you in Jerusalem until you are ready to go into Galilee. My peace I leave with you._” [UB 191:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/191#p2_1) ([Luke 24:38-39](/en/Bible/Luke/24#v38)) ([John 20:19-23](/en/Bible/John/20#v19))

Blessed are those in the ages to come who will believe, without having seen with fleshly eyes or heard with mortal ears.” ([Luke 20:24-29](/en/Bible/Luke/20#v24)) ([John 20:24-29](/en/Bible/John/20#v24))
Jesus orders them to go to Galilee. [2043:1-4]

April 21st
Friday, from 6 to 10 in the morning. Jesus appears to the apostles for the third time, by the Lake of Bethsaida. “_Children, have you caught anything?” When they answered no, the man said again, “Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find some fish._” ([Jn. 21:6](/en/Bible/John/21#v6)) He was with them for about an hour and then talked with them two by two, walking along the beach. “_Peter, do you love me?” Peter answered, “Lord, you know that I love you with all my soul._” ([Jn. 21:15-18](/en/Bible/John/21#v15))

At that very moment Jesus appeared again, saying: “_Peace be with you, and my peace I leave with you._” This was the fifteenth morontia manifestation of the resurrected Jesus. [UB 192:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p3_1)

May 18
Early Thursday morning. Jesus makes his last appearance on earth as a morontia personality to the eleven apostles. “_Peace be with you. I have asked you to remain here in Jerusalem until I ascend to the Father, and even until I send upon you the Spirit of Truth, who is soon to be poured out upon all mankind…_” [UB 193:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p3_2) ([Luke 24:49](/en/Bible/Luke/24#v49)) ([Mk. 16:15](/en/Bible/Mark/16#v15))
When he had finished speaking, he called them to him and led them to the Mount of Olives. There, gathered together, the apostles knelt in a circle around him, and the Master said: “_Now I am about to take leave of you; I am about to ascend to my Father, and soon, very soon, we will send the Spirit of Truth into this world where I have sojourned. When he has come, you will begin the new proclamation of the gospel of the kingdom, first in Jerusalem, and then to the farthest parts of the world._” ([Mt. 28:16](/en/Bible/Matthew/28#v16)) Love men with the love with which I have loved you, and serve your fellow mortals as I have served you. By the spiritual fruits of your lives, inspire souls to believe the truth that man is a child of God, and that all men are brothers. Remember all I have taught you and the life I have lived among you. My love overshadows you, my spirit will dwell with you, and my peace will remain with you. Farewell. [UB 193:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p5_2)

The morontia Jesus disappeared from the field of observation of his eleven apostles to begin his ascent to his Father's right hand, there to receive official confirmation of his complete sovereignty over the universe of Nebadon. [UB 193:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p5_5)

### Pentecost

Thursday, around one in the afternoon.
One hundred and twenty believers were praying when they felt a strange presence in the room.
A new and profound feeling of joy, security and spiritual confidence invaded them.
Then they recognized that the Spirit of Truth had been poured out upon all flesh. [UB 194:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p0_1) ([Acts 2:1-4](/en/Bible/Acts_of_the_Apostles/2#v1))
The apostles had been in hiding for forty days. This day happened to be the Jewish Feast of Pentecost, and thousands of visitors from all over the world were in Jerusalem. (Acts 2:5) Peter delivered a passionate sermon that reached two thousand souls. (Acts 2:14-47)
Pentecost was the call to spiritual unity among believers in the gospel. When the Spirit descended upon the disciples in Jerusalem, the same thing happened in Philadelphia, Alexandria, and every other place where sincere believers lived.
When the joy of this outpouring of spirit is consciously experienced in human life, it is a tonic for health, a stimulus for the mind, and an inexhaustible energy for the soul. [UB 194:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p0_1)
