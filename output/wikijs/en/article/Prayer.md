As long as prayer is sincere and uttered in faith, no matter how ill-advised or impossible of a direct answer, all such prayer never fails to expand our spiritual receptivity. (from <a id="a36_182"></a>[UB 144:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p4_2))

Thus, anything that expands our spiritual receptivity must be for our good. It is our capacity for spiritual receptivity that determines the spiritual presence of Divinity in our lives, hence our potential for soul growth. The good news is that our receptivity can be increased.

It was an extraordinary capacity for prayer that permitted the human Jesus to achieve such remarkable supercommunion of his soul with the heavenly Father. Although it is apparently possible, the reality is that very few of us are ever likely to attain in our lives what the human Jesus attained in his. Nevertheless, prayer can and does help all of us to attain the communion of true worship.

Prayer can be, in fact should be, an ongoing and continuous sharing of our daily lives with our Thought Adjusters, an unbroken awareness of the Adjuster presence.

As prayer drifts into pure worship, it achieves a special function by detaching us from our daily worries, thereby becoming a period of restful resuscitation from which we can gather strength for our ongoing lives.

True prayer is a reflection of our sincere spiritual longing for awareness of the presence of our spirit Father. It is a psychological process of exchanging the human will for the Divine will. It is the central component for the Divine plan for converting that which is into the which ought to be.
