I am sharing with you today one of my life stories, related to forgiveness.

Despite a dramatic start in life, stemming from a violent, incestuous and loveless childhood, I had decided, even before knowing God, that this past would not determine the nature of the Woman that I wanted to become and that I became.

I have lived my entire life without ever taking on the role of victim. When I look back on my life as a whole, I consider that I have lived it happily. At a very young age, I learned to use the wonderful adjunct of courage which has been very useful to me in facing the challenges of my adult life.

In the past, when in my meetings with the Al Anon group, I met women who had suffered the same abuse as me, and I heard many of these sad testimonies, I then shared my experience by explaining to them that to know happiness, there was no other path to take than that of forgiveness. Then, I asked them how much they wanted to be happy.

I understood that some people simply could not or would not forgive. Often the role of victim attracts compassion, pity and love... it is a shame that some people live in the past and are unhappy to attract feelings that they could receive otherwise, by evolving spiritually.

And those who wanted to change and be happy asked me: “How can I forgive?”

I cited the advantages to them, telling them that forgiveness frees us and completely frees us from the influence of our attackers.

Our forgiveness takes away all their power to ruin our lives in the present and future. Thus, they cease to exist in our thoughts.

The proof? Today, if I talk about my childhood, it is as if I were telling the life of a stranger. I feel compassion for the child that I was, but no anger, resentment or sadness, because I have forgiven my tormentors. I learned many life lessons, very young, and I have benefited from them in my adult life.

Now that I have discovered God and am walking with my Divine Adjuster, I would tell them that prayer is the gateway to stirring up forgiveness.

When I think back, I tell myself that despite my ignorance about the real Good Lord, until the age of 50, He was still watching over me.

Have a happy holiday season and...

“_Let your spiritual work, in conjunction with the aid of your beloved Adjuster, continually grow in wisdom._

_In order to continue distributing your Love_

_To your brothers and sisters who find themselves on your path._

_May God bless your steps, at every moment of this new Year 2024 and every day of your Life._ ”

> “Your inability or unwillingness to forgive your fellows is the measure of your immaturity, your failure to attain adult sympathy, understanding, and love. You hold grudges and nurse vengefulness in direct proportion to your ignorance of the inner nature and true longings of your children and your fellow beings. Love is the outworking of the divine and inner urge of life. It is founded on understanding, nurtured by unselfish service, and perfected in wisdom.” (<a id="a52_467"></a>[UB 174:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p1_5))

Peace on Earth to women and men of good will.

With all my Love!
