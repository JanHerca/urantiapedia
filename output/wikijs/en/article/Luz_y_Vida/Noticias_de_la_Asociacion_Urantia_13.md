## Meeting at the “La Casa Verde” center in Barcelona

At 7 in the afternoon, Olga López and Ismael Gracia, former president and secretary of the association respectively, presented _The Urantia Book_ at the “Green House”, a meeting point for numerous initiatives related to spiritual progress and the change of consciousness of the Condal City. In this presentation, which lasted until late at night, and which was attended by other members of the Barcelona study group, we had the opportunity to talk with those responsible for Casa Verde about the initiatives carried out in said center, and they were willing to help us in our task of disseminating the book's teachings. They are even considering organizing a book study group to meet at the Casa Verde.
