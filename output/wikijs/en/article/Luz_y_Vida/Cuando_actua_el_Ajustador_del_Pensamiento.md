## Carmelo

In the last meeting of the study group, a topic arose that I have reflected on and I want to raise here as well, because I am not clear about it.

It was stated at said meeting that the Adjuster only works during sleep, when we are asleep. I thought and still think that it acts all the time, but reference was made to paragraphs that, on first reading, seem to say the opposite. These are paragraphs <a id="a49_254"></a>[UB 110:5.3-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p5_3). It is said in them that the Adjuster tries to achieve during sleep only what the human will has previously approved during wakefulness, that he tries to record “his creations” (??).

On the other hand, in <a id="a51_22"></a>[UB 108:5.1-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p5_1), The Mission of the Adjusters, what they do in human minds is defined. Apparently they receive messages from the “spiritual intelligences” and they dictate them to the minds, they translate them. Are these the creations mentioned before? It is claimed that if we give them permission, if we voluntarily decide, they can transform the material mind by injecting “the motivations and purposes of the emerging morontia soul.” And it is categorically affirmed that they are “thought adjusters”, not “thought helpers”, that is, they act by actually modifying thought, not helping to do so.

It is also true that the Solitary Messenger (not to be confused with Mighty Messenger, a being of mortal human origin) who writes the document acknowledges that he does not know how the Adjuster accomplishes these things.

I highlight another paragraph related to the topic: <a id="a55_52"></a>[UB 109:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p5_1)

I also emphasize that it is made clear that the Adjusters act on the supermind or the superconscious.

And now I pose the questions that raise what I would like to discuss: What exactly are the Adjusters doing in our minds? When do they do it? What is the supermind?

## Antonio

As I understand this matter, Adjusters try to ADJUST our thoughts to divine thoughts, hence their name. They do it day and night, that is, at all hours. And the supermind (superconsciousness rather) is the opposite of unconsciousness. The unconscious is below the conscious, and the superconscious above it.

Regarding the contact with the Adjuster, this paragraph is worth taking note of: _Although a fervent meditation often favors the contact of the mortal mind with its inner Adjuster, the sincere and loving service of a disinterested ministry towards your fellow men facilitates it more frequently ._ (<a id="a65_299"></a>[UB 91:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p7_1))

And another question: Do you know why the Universal Father is DIRECTLY our father?

## Santi

Antonio, I think that when you say “unconscious” you are trying to say “subconscious”... right?

I will try to give you my point of view about it:

We have already seen and commented on other occasions that the transitions that occur in the physical order (and I suppose also in the spiritual) are usually gradual, so that some start from the top of others, and reach the bottom of the following.

The fact of having a mind (even if it is a material mind) gives us consciousness, but consciousness rests in subconsciousness.

The mind is the standard gift, being a creature, when we yearn for survival and acquire the ability to worship, that is, when there is a spiritual response in the creature, the mind becomes “supermind”, it is no longer something merely material, it begins the process of becoming spiritualized (<a id="a79_295"></a>[UB 36:5.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5_15)), the possibility of transcending death begins (I understand that all this may be prior to the arrival of the Adjuster)

<figure id="Figure_1" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV27/06.jpg">
</figure>

From my point of view, the Adjuster works 24 hours a day every day. Another thing is that their task is easier during our sleep, because we interfere with them less, the fears and anxieties that hinder their work do not appear.

The primary task of the Adjuster is the development of the immortal soul in the mind of man, but for this we must provide him with the raw material, which is that our will aligns with that of the Father. (<a id="a87_205"></a>[UB 1:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p3_7)) I was always shocked and even annoyed by the Adjuster thing, because it seemed that he somehow forced me or shaped my mind, although I know he only does it with permission, but I found a quote that left me much more satisfied: <a id="a87_473"></a>[UB 3:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p2_5), where he comes to say (or so I understand) that our material mind, being neither morontia nor spiritual, cannot respond directly to the Father of Paradise, therefore God ADJUSTS Himself, to the mind mortal through Thought Adjusters.

## Antonio

Exactly, Santi, I meant “subconscious” and “superconscious.”

Very good paragraph that you have chosen. How true is it that each of us gets what we seek or need! That paragraph has gone totally unnoticed for me. And that I have reread that document only two or three days ago... Well, the paragraph in question is:

Since the creature's mind is neither the monota nor the spirit of Paradise, it does not respond directly to the Universal Father. God adjusts to imperfect mind - to Urantia mortals through Thought Adjusters. (<a id="a95_209"></a>[UB 3:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p2_5))

Your interpretation is the same as I do. As for the rest, I agree with what you say.

## Carmelo

Santi, your quote from <a id="a101_23"></a>[UB 36:5.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5_15) has clarified what the supermind is, and it also clarifies where the Adjuster's action is centered and what kind of actions they are.

However, reading the paragraph, another doubt arises: does the “spiritual response” that converts the human mind into supermind appear with the Adjuster or before? From <a id="a103_169"></a>[UB 62:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p6_5) and from the first two paragraphs of paper 63 (<a id="a103_258"></a>[UB 63:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p0_1)) the following can be deduced:

1. The sixth spirit-mind, the spirit of adoration, made its contact with Andón and Fonta when they were about ten years old.

2. The seventh, that of wisdom, made their contact about a year later, and it was at this time that it could be said that they became truly human. Shortly after that time, Urantia was recorded as an inhabited world.

3. However, they were not yet purple by Adjusters.

Contact with these last two spirits gives a material mind the aptitude to recognize divinity and to adore the Deity, and endows the creature with the yearning to be perfect, but is this aptitude already a spiritual response in itself or? Should we wait for an action or decision of this creature, which on the other hand causes the appearance of the Adjuster in his mind, to affirm that there is a proper answer?

Santi, you seem to lean towards the first option; I, for my part, for the second. And the quote from <a id="a113_101"></a>[UB 3:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p2_5) I think proves me right. It says that God adjusts (and the original text emphasizes this in italics) to the “mind of imperfection” through Thought Adjusters. The meaning of ‘adjust’ according to the DRAE in its pronominal use is (acceptance 16) “Said of a person: Accommodate yourself, conform your opinion, your will or your taste with that of another”. This meaning coincides with the intransitive use of ‘_to adjust_’ in English, the original expression, (according to M-W it means “_to adapt or conform oneself_”). This means to me that God makes himself accessible to the material mind through the Adjusters; that the material mind cannot access God, cannot “recognize divinity and worship Deity” without the Adjuster, although it does in fact have the aptitude (capacity) to do so. When the mind is human, it is capable of recognizing divinity, it has everything necessary to do so, but it still needs the path to arrive, and that path is the Adjuster. My conclusion: without Adjuster, God cannot be reached and therefore, although there is aptitude for such a response, there is in fact no spiritual response.

Another question: Santi, you and I agree in believing that the Adjuster acts continuously, but can we support the opinion in a quote from the UB? The quote from <a id="a115_161"></a>[UB 110:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p5_3) seems to indicate otherwise.

## Santi

About what comes first, in <a id="a119_27"></a>[UB 108:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p2_2): “_The Adjusters cannot invade until it has been duly prepared by the ministry...the creature's mind must exhibit...moral selection_”.

I understand that when the 7 adjutant mind-spirits prepare the mind and incorporate it into the circuit of the Holy Spirit, they are “inaugurating” the supermind. Once the creature decides morally, this decision settles in the supermind and is the call to the Adjuster. I have reread the paragraph <a id="a121_298"></a>[UB 36:5.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5_15) and I understand that it is clearly stated that the mind of the creature, before acquiring the aptitude to recognize the divinity and to adore the Deity, is the EXCUBSIVE domain of the helping spirits. To me, this means that afterward the domain is not exclusive, that it is shared with the Adjuster and with other influences (the Spirit of Truth). But in that period it is exclusive, that is, the Adjuster has not yet arrived. Therefore the arrival of the Adjuster supposes acquiring the aptitude to recognize the divinity and to worship the Deities which supposes the appearance of the spiritual response.

I thus rectify my statement in the previous message that the “last two mind-spirits provide a material mind with the aptitude to recognize divinity and to worship the Deity”; apparently and according to the previous paragraph it is not so. It is necessary, and here I reaffirm what I said, for the Adjuster to arrive for this aptitude to appear and for the spiritual response to be produced.

In any case, it is of little importance and we are not going to get involved in discussing such a detail either.

## Eduardo

What I am sure of is that what the Adjuster does does not even know God. That Solitary Messenger says it very clearly, not even he himself knows very well what he does and how he acts. We only know that it works in the “field” of the supermind with superconscious experiences, or something like that. If I have to be honest, I don't understand anything. But I do understand phrases as simple to understand and interpret as:

> _The Urantia races are so largely electrically and chemically controlled, so highly animallike in their common behavior, so emotional in their ordinary reactions, that ***it becomes exceedingly difficult for the Monitors to guide and direct them***. ***You are so devoid of courageous decisions and consecrated co-operation*** that your indwelling Adjusters find it next to impossible to communicate directly with the human mind. Even when they do find it possible to flash a gleam of new truth to the evolving mortal soul, this spiritual revelation often so ***blinds the creature as to precipitate a convulsion of fanaticism or to initiate some other intellectual upheaval which results disastrously***_. (<a id="a131_710"></a>[UB 110:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p4_5))

> _Do not confuse and confound the mission and influence of the Adjuster with what is commonly called conscience; ***they are not directly related***._ (<a id="a133_153"></a>[UB 110:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p5_1))

> _Man’s dream experiences, that disordered and disconnected parade of the un-co-ordinated sleeping mind, ***present adequate proof of the failure of the Adjusters to harmonize and associate the divergent factors of the mind of man***._
> 
> _The Adjusters simply ***cannot, in a single lifetime***, arbitrarily co-ordinate and synchronize two such unlike and diverse types of thinking as the human and the divine. When they do, as they sometimes have, such souls are translated directly to the mansion worlds without the necessity of passing through the experience of death._ (<a id="a137_338"></a>[UB 110:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p5_2))

> ***During the slumber season the Adjuster attempts to achieve only that which the will of the indwelt personality has previously fully approved by the decisions and choosings which were made during times of fully wakeful consciousness, and which have thereby become lodged in the realms of the supermind, the liaison domain of human and divine interrelationship***. (<a id="a139_369"></a>[UB 110:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p5_3))

Dear friends, this phrase and some others that make Carmelo think so much, are for Surely before Pentecost there were human beings who exhibited to some degree the capacity to worship, and made moral decisions, which included notations in their supermind, and possibly the Adjuster appeared considerably later. That is why I think that first the supermind is updated, and this is the task of the 7 helper mind-spirits, then the creature makes certain decisions and then the Adjuster arrives.

Regarding the second matter, for me <a id="a143_36"></a>[UB 110:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p5_3) only describes the Adjuster's task during sleep, in no case does it say that it only acts then, and there are numerous quotes that in my opinion corroborate it: (underlinings are mine" ):

“_The Adjuster is man's infallible cosmic compass, which constantly and infallibly points the soul towards God_”. <a id="a145_114"></a>[UB 107:0.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p0_6) If they do it constantly, they don't stop doing it.

“_The Thought Adjusters do not have rest from the moment of their endowment until the day of their liberation...._” <a id="a147_116"></a>[UB 107:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p6_7) If they do not have rest, they cannot stop at certain hours, right?

“_The Adjusters are.... the incessant impulse...._” <a id="a149_52"></a>[UB 108:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p6_7)

“_At such times, and sometimes during sleep, the Adjuster can,..._”.<a id="a151_68"></a>[UB 109:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p5_1) It is clear that it works even when you do not sleep.

“_It is sometimes possible that the mind is enlightened, that the divine voice that speaks continuously within you is heard..._” <a id="a153_129"></a>[UB 109:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p5_2)

“_And the Adjuster constantly communicates, indirectly, and without recognition with the human subject, especially during those sublime experiences of adoring contact of mind with spirit in superconsciousness_”.<a id="a155_211"></a>[UB 110:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p1_1) This also does not occur during sleep.

“_The Adjuster...is busy in a constant effort to spiritualize your mind..._” <a id="a157_77"></a>[UB 110:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p4_2)

Furthermore, if we take into account that it is a fragment of God and for all intents and purposes it is God, just as it is pure spirit, it is pure energy, it does not run out, it does not need to rest to replenish energy...they are “milk”, and we pay so little attention to them...

## Coll

One of the conclusions I have reached about the Adjuster is that it is the vital part, **the gift of the Universal Father** that connects us and drives us to search for God. Our mind can form ideas and it is also an impulse to somehow seek God and values, but the Adjuster is the vital part, “**the connection**” for this to happen. Without an Adjuster it would be even more difficult and confusing.

We could compare it with a radio emission: the Universal Father is always emitting his frequency, we are small radio receivers and the Adjuster is the wave or frequency that connects us. But that wave or frequency has already been given to us first by the Universal Father: “**the gift**”, that divine spark that lives within us.

That is why he says that the Adjusters never rest, they are always connected and doing their work. We only have to collaborate with the Adjuster so that there is a good connection between our material world and the spiritual world of the Universal Father.

This is one of my views on Adjusters and it is the vital part for us to somehow be aware and have the urge to seek God.

## Carmelo

[_Text is missing in the original article_] my “primordial keys” that help me to understand a little the “activities” of these prepersonalities. I understand that during the day, when we make fully conscious decisions, those responsible commitments that we want to carry out, those ideals with noble intentions, doing the will of the Father, etc. they are “filed” in some “place” that I don't really know where it is, they call it **supermental zones** (?), but I do understand that it is the “ground” where the human makes “contact” with the divine . Well, while we sleep without dreaming, that is, we rest electrically and chemically, he carries out some “action” and I dare to think by deduction that only in those moments and circumstances. Not in others. At other times he will do other things.

I continue with the quotes:

> _While their mortal hosts are asleep, ***the Adjusters try to register their creations*** in the higher levels of the material mind, ***and some of your grotesque dreams indicate their failure to make efficient contact***._ (<a id="a177_227"></a>[UB 110:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p5_4))

In the group meeting we said that while we sleep, in specific moments and circumstances, the Adjusters “write” something divine in those supermental zones so that together with what we have previously “written” (decisions, commitments, etc.) during our states awake and conscious, “sentences” are formed that write the “text” of the book (our soul). I believe that we will not carry a good text inside our book (soul) if throughout our lives we do not do things “as God commands” and we do not rest while we sleep in optimal conditions.

I continue with the quotes:

> _Your own passions, urges, and other innate tendencies translate themselves into the picture and substitute their unexpressed desires for ***the divine messages which the indwellers are endeavoring to put into the psychic records during unconscious sleep***._ (<a id="a183_263"></a>[UB 110:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p5_4))

These paragraphs reinforce my theory.

> _It is extremely dangerous to postulate as to ***the Adjuster content of the dream life. The Adjusters do work during sleep***, but your ordinary dream experiences are purely physiologic and psychologic phenomena. Likewise, ***it is hazardous to attempt the differentiation of the Adjusters’ concept registry from the more or less continuous and conscious reception of the dictations of mortal conscience***. . . .Remember, the influence of a Thought Adjuster is for the most part, though not wholly, ***a superconscious experience***._ (<a id="a187_540"></a>[UB 110:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p5_5))

> _This is dangerous ground, and every human being must settle ***these problems for himself in accordance with his natural human wisdom and superhuman insight***._ (<a id="a189_166"></a>[UB 110:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p5_6))

There it is. I believe that it has to make you think as it made me think of its day.
