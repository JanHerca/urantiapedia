## Antonio Moya

A large multinational company once set up a delegation in Seville, and they appointed a Delegate. After a certain time, said Delegate went over to the competition, and the bosses above, quite logically, fired him.

Later they sent another Delegate, who did not last long in the position either, since he did not strictly follow the orders he brought from the Central Directorate.

The question that I have been asking myself for some time, without an answer, is the following:

- Why was Caligastia never replaced by another Lanonandek Son?
- Why were Adam and Eve never replaced by another Adamic couple?
- Why, when a Son of this height fails in an evolutionary world, is he not replaced by another of his order, to continue his work for the benefit of the progress of that humanity? The terrible world we have inherited would have been **very different** had a Son from above been here, directing it.
- Why is it not foreseen in the Universe to replace those who fail in an evolutionary world, thereby condemning that humanity to manage as best it can for thousands of years?

I sincerely wish that if any of you know the answer, you would kindly tell me. Thanks in advance.

## Carmelo Martínez

I had never thought about that matter, so these days, between trouble and trouble, I've been thinking about it. And, honestly, I can't think of the reason.

It seems to be something general, at least in this universe of Nebadon, since in [paper 72](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#) “The Government of a Neighboring Planet” we are told that their prince also rebelled and his material children also failed , and it is implied (at least that's what I understood) that they have not been replaced.

On the other hand it also seems that there is a certain position or residential status of the prince on his planet of destiny, since Caligastia and Daligastia continue (even today) to reside with us on Urantia. I also remember that I have interpreted, reading the Book, that all the beings of creation (including the First Source and Center) always have their residence (their postal address) in some sphere, no matter how far they travel, and although the sphere is not always the same. Does this exclude the possibility of having a second prince with resident status? In fact Michael of Nebadon is the prince of Urantia, and Machiventa the vice-prince, but neither reside here. When the trial of “Gabriel against Lucifer” is over, and if the sentence for Caligastia and Daligastia is that it be “as if they had never been”, will Machiventa come to exercise the functions of prince, since Caligastia will not “be”?

With material children there may be some genetic reason: once they have mixed with the races of the planet, it may not be possible to introduce a different genetic makeup. On the other hand, the descendants of the pure lineage of our Adam and Eve that were taken from the planet (<a id="a64_280"></a>[UB 75:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p6_3)), are now in Edentia under the custody of the Most Highs. And I seem to remember reading somewhere in the Book that they may be destined to return to Urantia in the ages of light and life. All of this makes me think that these destination assignments are definitive and exclusive, although I couldn't say why.

“I am on tenterhooks” waiting for ideas from others.

P.S. That there are “hard worlds” (of course if there is a hell, we are in it) seems something also foreseen in the Big Chief's plan. It seems that beings with all kinds of experiential backgrounds are needed, and we (and many others) will contribute (?) in our next lives (if we have them, which I hope we do) that experience of living in the midst of problems, of believing without seeing, persevere in isolation and triumph in the face of insurmountable odds. (<a id="a68_464"></a>[UB 50:7.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p7_1)). Eduardo says that when we wake up after our first repersonalization, we future agondonteros will be waiting for us with the “music band” for those (supposed) merits. Ours a few less (as Eduardo continues to say), because after all we have read the Book.

## Olga López

To try to understand why the personalities who joined the rebellion were not replaced by other loyal ones of the same type of personalities, I have reread those documents that talk about the Lucifer rebellion and about the lack of Adam and Eve.

In [paper 53](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#) the revelators tell us that in Satania there were 37 Planetary Princes who joined the rebellion (<a id="a74_137"></a>[UB 53:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p7_1)). We do not know what happened to the other 36, but they do tell us that Caligastia was replaced, not by a secondary Lanonandek, but by Machiventa Melchizedek as Vicegerent Planetary Prince (<a id="a74_370"></a>[UB 53:9.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p9_4)). In paper 35, which is the one that deals most extensively with this order, it is already said that the Melchizedeks can perform multiple functions, they are the “all terrain” of the local universes (<a id="a74_613"></a>[UB 35:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p4_2)). As one would say vulgarly, “they are worth the same for a tear as for a ripped one.”

The rebellion is an exceptional event that requires exceptional measures. In <a id="a76_77"></a>[UB 53:9.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p9_4) he tells us: “_...the opening of Gabriel's case against Lucifer has signaled the beginning of temporary planetary regimes on all isolated worlds_”.

As I interpret from the reading of documents 53 and 54, the replacement of the fallen rulers by others of the same order and trying to return to normality as if nothing had happened, would have been falsely closing the rebellion, it would have gone against our free will. Not just “ordinary” mortals, but other superhuman beings. Each volitional being had to decide, exercising their free will, whether to join the rebellion or to reject it; no one could make that decision for him, whether he was a rebel or an ally. In addition, for those who joined the rebellion, mercy had to give a reasonable amount of time for them to reconsider their position and repent (<a id="a78_663"></a>[UB 54:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p4_3)).

Of course, it could also be said that Lucifer was replaced by Lanaforge, a primary Lanonandek of his own order. The first thing that occurs to me is that the System Sovereigns are a rung above, other than that Jerusem is neither physically nor functionally like an inhabited world, and the diversity of beings residing there is obviously much greater than on worlds like our.

Here it is worth mentioning that, in paper 35, where apart from the Melchizedeks, the Lanonandek Sons are also mentioned, it is said that the Sons of this order who go astray can be rehabilitated, but they never return to positions of responsibility. they had when they committed the offense (<a id="a82_293"></a>[UB 35:9.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p9_10)).

The first thing that may come to mind when we read about Lucifer's rebellion is to lament over our bad luck, since we “pay the price” for the faults committed by others. The sin here did not come from the poor and primitive human beings that populated the Earth at that time, but from the highest levels of the planet. So why does it seem like we have to pay the price with isolation? Why do we have to see ourselves deprived of the presence of a Material Son and Daughter?

In <a id="a86_3"></a>[UB 54:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p6_4) we are told in this regard that, whenever we suffer the consequences of the sins of others, those tribulations will be transitory. What's more: not only do they not jeopardize our eternal prospects of ascending, but they always have rewards, such as becoming Mighty Messengers.

It is clear that, at this point in our spiritual evolution, we are very far from understanding all the reasons, reasons that we will not fully understand until we have a greater experiential capacity and achieve greater spiritual insight, as the Mighty Messenger who is in charge of to reveal paper 54, in the last paragraph of <a id="a88_328"></a>[UB 54:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p6_10). In paper 67, where the Lucifer rebellion is treated as it was experienced on our planet, we are told that a Most High from Edentia arrived with the emergency Melchizedeks to assume authority on Urantia (<a id="a88_576"></a>[UB 67:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p3_10)). In <a id="a88_625"></a>[UB 67:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p4_7) it says that those beings who joined the rebellion but repented will be rehabilitated and reinstated to any phase of universe service, but I understand that they will not hold the same position or occupation.

In this paragraph it is very clear that the government of the planet after the fall of Caligastia was really atypical:

> _The affairs of Urantia were for a long time administered by a council of planetary receivers, twelve Melchizedeks, confirmed by the mandate of the senior constellation ruler, the Most High Father of Norlatiadek. Associated with the Melchizedek receivers was an advisory council consisting of: one of the loyal aids of the fallen Prince, the two resident Life Carriers, a Trinitized Son in apprenticeship training, a volunteer Teacher Son, a Brilliant Evening Star of Avalon (periodically), the chiefs of seraphim and cherubim, advisers from two neighboring planets, the director general of subordinate angelic life, and Van, the commander in chief of the midway creatures. And thus was Urantia governed and administered until the arrival of Adam. It is not strange that the courageous and loyal Van was assigned a place on the council of planetary receivers which for so long administered the affairs of Urantia._ (<a id="a92_918"></a>[UB 67:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p6_5))

After the chaos that engulfed Urantia after the fall of Caligastia, they could hardly have gone ahead with the plan envisioned for a normal planet ruled by a loyal Planetary Prince. It is clear that the government should be different.

In <a id="a96_3"></a>[UB 67:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p7_2) we are told that the internal consequences of sin are the responsibility of the sinner and the Father, but the external consequences concern all creatures that carry out their activity within the area affected by those events. The effects of sin are never purely local. We must understand the administration of the universe as an organism, where the condition of a personality must be shared to some extent by all. In other words, if one sneezes on Jerusem, on Edentia they catch a cold.

Let us now turn to consider our Adam and Eve, more specifically paper 75. After its absence, the Melchizedek trustees who had left the planet shortly after the arrival of Adam and Eve returned to take up the affairs of the world. Despite their wrongdoing, our Adam and Eve were not accused of rebellion, which meant that the path to survival was still open to them, albeit in a different way than one would expect from a “typical” Material Son. From then on they suffered the same fate as the mortals of the planet: that is, they went through physical death and the mortal upward race.

Also here, as in the case of the Planetary Prince, having brought another couple of Material Sons to right the wrongs caused by the previous ones would have gone against the evolutionary progress of the planet, against the free will of the volitional beings that inhabit it. The Adams come to an inhabited world with a very specific mission, which is to biologically elevate the races. I suppose that a task as delicate as this could not be resumed by another pair of Adams as if nothing had happened. You have to let events take their course.

In Paper 55, the one that deals with the spheres of light and life, it is said that on the (far away) day that Urantia reaches that state, two “misguided” descendant Sons of Adam and Eve will come to assume the role of Sons. Materials (<a id="a102_236"></a>[UB 55:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p7_3)). By then, Urantia humanity will have earned light and life without outside interventions, due to their own merits.

## Santiago Rodríguez

The development of worlds and systems is a long-term project, it begins with the premise of the free will of mortals and other beings.

When a being is wrong, it cannot be replaced without further ado, it would be equivalent to preventing us from making mistakes. Having free will implies making decisions and being consistent with them; the higher you are on the evolutionary “scale”, the more repercussions it will have on you and on those who depend on you, but perfection must be sought not by imposition of criteria, but by search and personal conviction (even if I'm wrong). If when one with great responsibility does it wrong, even if it becomes consciously (little), the only way to demonstrate his mistake is to allow events to take their course, so that he is aware of what is happening, it can even serve as learning for others.

What a priori would seem “unfair” for creatures under the responsibility of the wrong ones, we can realize that it only seems so when we measure it with the time scale during which the events happen, with the perspective of a sufficient amount of time , we can see that the tribulations taught you more than they harmed you, since on this side of the Universe everything has two faces. That is to say, what harms you on the one hand redounds to your own benefit on the other; what happens is that if you observe it immersed in the time in which you have tribulations, it seems very unfair and disproportionate.

What difference would there be between looking for a model without the possibility of sin, or error, or the fact of replacing a leader who turns against the interests of his employer?

If an immediate substitution had been made, how could the wrong ones have been shown to be wrong?

It would be a way to eradicate treason by force, it would go against the free will of many beings...

## Antonio Moya

Thank you very much for having squeezed your helmets well to try to give an answer to the question about “The Substitutes”. As I deduce, it does NOT seem to be planned, in the politics of the Universe, to replace the Personalities that fail in the inhabited worlds, by others of their same rank, in order to continue with the interrupted work for the benefit of primitive and ignorant humans. those worlds.

It seems that the universal rule is: “There is no evil that does not come for good”, then:

1. That everything is going well, well, phenomenal.
2. That one or all of them fail, since it is “_a unique opportunity for the exercise of faith and for the development of a peculiar quality of confidence in cosmic reliability which is not dependent on sight or any other material consideration_” (<a id="a125_247"></a>[UB 50:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p7_1) ), and the humans of that world thus (unintentionally) become “Agondontarians”, rare and exceptional birds that have a special position even in the Corps of the Finality.

(Comment to Carmelo): It is possible that with the Material Children there may be a genetic reason, once they have mixed with the races of the planet. **But here they had NOT mixed yet...**

On the other hand, the sons of Adam who went to Edentia and who could return to Urantia in the epoch of light and life, in that epoch “we shall no longer need them” (?) as we needed them 37,000 years ago, not only in the genetic level but in many other aspects of human development.

(Comment to Olga): I fully assume that the rebellion had to be given its time so that all the personalities involved could make their decisions. But once this was done, why couldn't another Lanonandek Son come along to continue the interrupted task of his predecessor, with another corporeal staff to continue to aid humanity?

I don't understand why, if another Adamic couple comes, that goes against evolutionary progress and the free will of human beings. Humans do not paint anything in the heavenly government of this world. “They” are the Masters, and we are the students. “They” bring their plans and their orders from above, and we are just ignoramuses to be directed. We do not poke or cut anything in the heavenly direction of this world. But in the absence of heavenly leaders, we have been left to fend for ourselves, and the most brutish and ambitious among us have always seized power in this world, resulting in our history being a pure bloody war.

(Comment for Santi): When a being makes a mistake, **but once the conflict is resolved**, why can't it be replaced by another similar one that continues the interrupted task? How can that affect our free will?

<ins>LET'S IMAGINE TWO FICTIONAL SCENARIOS:</ins>

### FIRST STAGE

Caligastia rebels, a part of his staff also rebels, others remain loyal, and everything is confusion between them and for the poor primitive human beings of that time (What could those ignorant wretches choose, if they didn't even know where they were standing? let alone universal issues?)

A long period of time is given so that everyone can decide which side they are on. Once the last cat has made its decision, Caligastia is arrested and another Lanonandek Son arrives on the planet, with his new staff of visible and invisible personalities. Van and company return to Jerusem, and the new corporeal 100 pick up where the previous 100 left off.

The only catastrophic period for human beings would have been between the outbreak of the rebellion and the arrival of the new Lanonandek Son. Once order was restored, humanity's progress would have gone forward as originally envisioned.

### SECOND SCENARIO

Adam and Eve fail in their mission, **BUT** their progeny have not yet begun to mix with humanity. The minor children are taken to Edentia, and the older ones decide whether or not to stay with their parents. Over time, everyone who stays on the planet ends up dying, including Adam and Eve.

Some time later, a new Adamic couple arrives, who resumes the interrupted work of their predecessors. This time they do not fail (remember that a loyal Lanonandek Son now rules), and years later the Adamic blood begins to spread through all the races of the Earth.

Why didn't things go like this?

If it is **NO** planned to replace those that fail, is it then estimated that the possibility of failure is minimal, or that they do not usually fail?...

Interestingly, when Michael of Nebadon donated himself as Lanonandek (his second in-universe bestowal), he did so to replace Lutentia, a Systemic Sovereign who had gone rogue (as Lucifer later did).

And even more curious, when Michael donated himself as a Material Son (his third donation), he did so as acting Planetary Prince of a planet whose Planetary Prince had rebelled and, consequently, they were in quarantine. From the text it is deduced that it **NOT** materialized, since a visible Material Son and Daughter were later sent to the planet.

Anyway, dear friends, I suppose that one day we will know the real reasons why things are like this, and not otherwise. Higher wisdom is not always understood by lower beings. As a Life Carrier says well: «_The universe of universes, including this little world called Urantia, is not governed simply to receive our approval or to adapt to our convenience, much less to please our whims and satisfy our curiosity. The wise and all-powerful beings who have the responsibility of managing the universe ***know***, without any doubt, ***exactly what to do***. Thus it behooves the Life Carriers and it behooves the mortal mind to ***ready, by patient waiting and sincere cooperation, with the rule of wisdom, the reign of power, and the march of progress***.” <a id="a161_757"></a>[UB 65:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p5_3)

I know that God the Father is in command of the Universe.

We are therefore safe in this Universe.

Let us quietly trust Him.

And that it makes us understand, one day, what today has no explanation for us.

## Carmelo Martínez

When our Adam and Eve “faulted” <ins>they had already mixed up</ins>. That was precisely Eva's fault; not the very fact of mixing, but the mistaken belief that they could accelerate the advance of the Urantia civilization by anticipating the moment of producing, even if limited, the first mixed beings (the first Andites). From there Cain and Sansa (<a id="a173_351"></a>[UB 76:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p0_2)) were born, truly the first Andites on Urantia. Adam's fault was apparently “in solidarity” with Eve. By the way, there is a paragraph (<a id="a173_529"></a>[UB 75:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p4_7)) that has always been shocking to me. The Revelators, I believe, did not bother to give us details that were not useful to us in any way. And this paragraph is all detail. He tells us that Eva had not known (in the Biblical sense) a Urantian male until she met Cano, that she liked him, and that she got from that relationship what Cano promised her, giving rise to “_new and increased knowledge of human affairs and quickened understanding of human nature as supplemental to the comprehension of the Adamic nature_”. Come on, that must have been a good fuck.

P.S. I forgot: what distinguishes a human being from an animal is the ability to know the Father and choose to do his will (voluntarily join his plan). Human beings (those who were really human beings) of 200,000 years ago, and those of a million years ago, had that ability, as we do now. I don't know how that ability is reflected in each historical era, but Amadon, Van's collaborator, the human hero of the rebellion, made headlines in those outer spheres for 7 years for his tenacity.
