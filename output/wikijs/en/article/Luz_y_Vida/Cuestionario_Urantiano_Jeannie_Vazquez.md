I am Jeannie Vázquez, I live in Montevideo, Uruguay. I dedicate myself to study and serve the revelation of _The Urantia Book_.

## 1. How did you get to “The Urantia Book” and why do you think you found it?

I found him reading a short article in a magazine published by a Uruguayan newspaper. There it was briefly mentioned that _The Urantia Book_ claimed to be a divine revelation presenting the complete life of Jesus of Nazareth. I had years of searching for information about Jesus and God, the soul, eternal life. I needed to know if all that really existed. My search had been almost harrowing; he had read numerous (supposedly) spiritual books and attended conferences dealing with such subjects.

Reading in that article “revelation of the complete life of Jesus” was like a trigger inside me. I ran outside (literally) and arrived out of breath at a bookstore that was seven blocks from my house. There it was, huge, with its rubberized blue lid. I was delighted to see that it was a big book because I was always an avid reader, and reading a good book that lasted a long time was, and still is, a pleasure for me.

## 2. What was your first impression when reading it?

The first thing I read was the index, while I was walking slowly back to my house. I was fascinated to see that he spoke of the Universal Father. Then I read loose parts. My first impression was that what I read was (is) true.

## 3. At what point in the reading (document, sentence, etc.) did you accept that “The Urantia Book” is really what it claims to be?

From the beginning I accepted it as true, I did not doubt that it is a real divine revelation. The revelation answered all my questions and doubts, it satisfied my hunger for truth.

## 4. How has “The Urantia Book” changed your life?

_The Urantia Book_ gave me peace regarding spiritual reality, quenched my thirst for knowledge and understanding of how soul survival really works, life after death, the truth about Jesus, the origin of life, reality universal. But what changed my life was deciding to do and live what the book teaches: consecrate myself to do the will of the Father, with all my heart, and strive to live it.

## 5. Has the faith you had after reading it changed? If so, in what way?

Yes, a lot. I did have faith, I can see that now, looking back. But it was a faith full of uncertainties, wavering as to the confident and serene direction that I have now. I did strive to live righteously, I had ideals, I sought to grow internally, but the objective of my efforts was not clear, my mind was submerged in a sea of doubts. I now know that God lives in me, and communing with him in daily prayer and worship and receiving his gifts has nurtured my faith in wonderful ways.

## 6. Are there any points (or points) of the revelation that you find difficult to accept?

Not anymore, but at first yes. When I read that reincarnation did not exist, I thought that the book was wrong, that the developer must have meant something else. I searched and searched for something in the book itself that would confirm my belief. I found nothing, of course. Until one day I read the story of how the book had been received. That information was decisive for me, because it showed me the divine method of doing things. So I fully accepted the revelation, discarded my beliefs and any teaching that contradicted the concepts contained in the book.

## 7. What is the part that has most deeply impressed you?

I can't say that one part impressed me more than another. The whole book impressed and moved me (and moves every day).

## 8. How do you understand “doing the will of the Father”?

First, it is a personal decision that must be total, profound, and unconditional. Then, it is a daily effort of adoring communion with the Father, which feeds the soul and sustains us in the service of others. It is a yearning that motivates, a communion that transforms, a life dedicated to showing divine love to all our brothers, to grow in fruits of the spirit, divine values, similarity with the Father, loving our brothers more every day, striving to be as Jesus was in his human life.

## 9. Have you become aware of the presence of your Adjuster?

Yeah.

## 10. Have you tried to put the Master's teachings into practice? What was the result?

Yes, every day for more than 20 years. The result has been love, peace, happiness, the desire to serve my brothers, the search for a greater understanding of divine truth, dedication to serving them, growth and maturity.

## 11. Do you think that “The Urantia Book” has something “mysterious” that makes not everyone decide to read it?

The truth is, I think that what makes people read it or not is not so much in the book as it is inside the people. Their hunger (or not) for divine truth and to know God, the state of their mind, their inner openness or the degree of attachment to their beliefs, will determine whether they read and accept the revelation or reject it.

## 12. Is there anything else you would like to say regarding “The Urantia Book”?

I would like many more of us who know and believe in the divine teachings of _The Urantia Book_ to dare to be and do the things that Jesus and the revelators teach us, and thus infect those who are open to spirituality, to also receive the treasure that we received when we knew this divine revelation.
