I am Mexican, I live in Mexico City. I work as a manager in a warehouse. I am married, I have a daughter and two grandchildren. I was president of Urantia Association Mexico and currently participate in various reading and study groups of _The Urantia Book_.

## 1. How did you get to “The Urantia Book” and why do you think you found it?

To understand how I came to _The Urantia Book_, I'll start by telling you that I was an atheist. I did not believe in the existence of a superior divine being, until my life changed the day my newborn daughter died in my arms.

I remember that, when I got back from the cemetery, I locked myself in my bedroom, went to the wall, closed my eyes and said: «God, if you exist, help me, I can't take it anymore. If you exist, I thank you for allowing me to meet my daughter, take care of her. Help me to know the truth, I feel very confused. Fifteen days after that event, something very strange happened to me that led me to discover _The Urantia Book_.

One day, while at my business, I suddenly began to feel a great concern about going outside. I don't know how to explain it, I just followed the impulse and went out. I didn't know where to go. I remember that I walked until I reached a traffic light and I approached a used magazine stand that was there. I began to look at them and took two, one was about UFOs and the other was a Spanish magazine that contained a report by a person who was dedicated to exposing charlatans. The article mentioned the content of _The Urantia Book_. What struck me was that the reporter was a skeptic who wanted to expose _The Urantia Book_, but unable to do so due to the veracity of the book, ended up recommending it. That caught my eye and I decided to buy it. Before starting to read it, I said to myself: “This book has to be like all of them, I'm going to catch it in some lie.” More than 30 years have passed and to date I have not been able to find any falsehood in it, rather the book caught me.

Thanks to the message of _The Urantia Book_, now I have faith in God and I know that He is my Father, if I persist in living faith, doing his will with all my heart, I know that one day I will meet him and see my daughter again.

## 2. What was your first impression when reading it?

When I started reading the book, I experienced many conflicts, as its content clashed with my beliefs. That made me very sick for several days, I even thought about burning it. But something inside me told me that this was the answer to my request to “know the truth.”

## 3. At what point in the reading (document, sentence, etc.) did you accept that “The Urantia Book” is really what it claims to be?

I accepted that the book's message is true when I began to experience divine truth in my soul. That experience gradually grew from the moment I accepted that God is my Father. As time went by, I realized that my relationship with him is the result of letting myself be led by his resident Spirit. At first, I began to follow the divine guidance (Truth, Beauty and Goodness) unconsciously, following the impulses of my Adjuster, which led me to make moral choices and actions in my search for God. After a while I made the supreme decision to do the will of the Father with all my heart. The curious thing is that, after not believing in Him, I now live in constant communion with Him, and I seek to grow in my living experience of His Divine truth and in loving service to my brothers.

## 4. How has “The Urantia Book” changed your life?

Reading and understanding the book's teachings has given my life a lot of meaning. Now I no longer make moral decisions at random, I already do it with a conscience of God. In my personal experience, I have discovered that loving service is in the likeness of and conscious of God's character.

## 5. Has the faith you had after reading it changed? If so, in what way?

I cannot say that my faith has changed after reading the book, because being an atheist I had no faith. My faith began and grew when I began to know and love the Father, in my personal experience with Him.

## 6. Are there any points (or points) of the revelation that you find difficult to accept?

None.

## 7. What is the part that has most deeply impressed you?

The life and teachings of Jesus!

## 8. How do you understand “doing the will of the Father”?

For me, doing the will of the Father is living in divine rectitude and with awareness of Him, since His will is that we be perfect in Divinity, just as He is perfect. Divinity is his character (his qualities), those qualities are truth, beauty and goodness. I live the will of the Father having communion with Him (prayer and adoration) and lovingly serving my brothers.

Having faith and doing good out of love for the Father, that is doing his Divine will.

When we are reborn from the spirit it is because we discover in the depths of our soul a law that comes from the Father. The moral law of the universe, whose principles urge us to love divinely, without conditions. When we begin to live in this way, our soul urges us to act correctly, always doing good out of love for the Father and our brothers, judging the concrete options, approving those that are good and rejecting those that are bad. Attesting to the authority of divine truth with reference to the Supreme Good to which she is attracted. The soul is capable of recognizing the moral quality of a concrete act that it intends to do, is doing or has done. In everything he says and does, he always knows what is just and right. It is through our relationship with God that we recognize the prescriptions of divine law: enthroning the moral law of the universe in our soul means having accepted the responsibility of freely living universal duty in each of our acts. It is necessary that we be reborn of the Spirit so that we can hear the voice of the Thought Adjuster in our soul. The integrity of a reborn person implies and demands the uprightness of the moral conscience of the universe. This new conscience includes the perception of the principles of divine morality, its application to concrete circumstances through a practical discernment of reasons and goods, and ultimately the judgment formed on the concrete acts that are going to be carried out. The truth about the moral good, declared in the law of the universe and recognized by the prudent opinion of a reborn, is called the will of the Father.

## 9. Have you become aware of the presence of your Adjuster?

I am aware of my Adjuster's presence from the moment I react to altruism in response to his divine guidance. I follow divine guidance when I choose truth, beauty, and goodness, which are the will of the Father.

## 10. Have you tried to put the Master's teachings into practice? What was the result?

I live the teachings with my family or with my cycling group. When I go down the street I like to help those in need, since it is a good opportunity to put the Master's teachings into practice. When I read the story of the young man who was afraid, the result is amazing.

## 11. Do you think that “The Urantia Book” has something “mysterious” that makes not everyone decide to read it?

I think that very few people are true thinkers, that is one of the reasons why many do not understand or accept the lofty truths of the book. For many it is very easy to follow customs or to think for them, they never question anything or seek the truth.

A true seeker of the truth must first have faith and know how to think about the action he wishes to carry out.

Second, ask yourself if the motivation that guides your behavior has moral content or not. This being the case, then you must look for the subjective and personal motive that guides your action.

## 12. Is there anything else you would like to say regarding “The Urantia Book”?

I am very grateful to my Heavenly Father, as _The Urantia Book_ was the answer to my plea when I was an atheist. Thanks to the teachings of the book I am learning to live the will of the Father. Its enlightening and transformative content has given hope and meaning to my life.

_The Urantia Book_ is a road map that teaches us where to find the sustenance that feeds our soul; the book is a stupendous banquet. Thanks to his beautiful teachings, I live satisfied, at peace with God and with all my brothers. Now my goal is to do the will of my beloved FATHER every day.
