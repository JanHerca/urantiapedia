Olga has been a reader of the book since 1996. Married with two daughters, she is a computer engineer and graduated in Philosophy. He lives in Vilanova i la Geltrú (Barcelona). She was president of the Urantia Association of Spain from 2004 to 2012. She is currently the director of the UBIS (School of _The Urantia Book_ on the Internet) for courses in Spanish.

## 1. How did you get to “The Urantia Book” and why do you think you found it?

Since I was little, I have always felt the irrepressible impulse to know the truth of everything that surrounds me. For me, one of the most powerful phrases that Jesus of Nazareth uttered is: “You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” So I've always been an avid reader and curious about everything around me. I have been and am a sponge obsessed with the why of things. In my case it was through reading certain books by Benítez; It was in “Dreams” that I first read some of the Urantia teachings, but the novels that led me decidedly to the book were the “Trojan Horses”. That was where I felt I had to go to the source of all this. .

As for why I think I found it... I guess it was because of that need to know the truth. As the Master also said, “seek and you will find.” And I searched and found at the right time in my life, when I was ready to reach the book.

## 2. What was your first impression when reading it?

Although the reading was not easy, my first impression was the feeling that I had found the answer to all the questions that I had asked myself. Everything seemed enormously coherent and harmonious to me, I could see that there was a great plan behind each description and each teaching.

## 3. At what point in the reading (document, sentence, etc.) did you accept that “The Urantia Book” is really what it claims to be?

I cannot point to a point of reading. Rather it was that, as he progressed, he found more reason to believe that it had to be true.

## 4. How has “The Urantia Book” changed your life?

I believe that applying the book's teachings to my life is making me smooth out all the rough edges of my character. I have learned to accept things as they come and people as they are. I have learned to enjoy the little things in life, and I always look forward to a new day. I have also seen what are the parts of me that I must change. But this is a work that is still in progress. I still have a long way to go, but I have the infallible guide that will make me improve because I want to.

## 5. Has the faith you had before reading it changed? In what way?

I think my faith has not changed but it has been strengthened. Fortunately, I have never had a crisis of faith, and I think it has never abandoned me for as long as I can remember.

## 6. Is there a point (or points) of the revelation that you find difficult to accept?

At first, there were some points in the reveal that I had a hard time accepting. The first and most important was that of reincarnation, since I was a convinced believer. The second was that of eugenics; Here my Catholic upbringing had a lot to do with it. I have to admit that I could accept it intellectually, but not emotionally. But, after much thought and talking to other people about these issues, I have accepted that 100% of the book is true and there is absolutely no teaching that I reject.

## 7. What is the part that has most deeply impressed you?

It's hard to say what has impressed me most deeply in the book... If I had to say what most, it would be the incredible ascension plan that awaits us. The truth is that I was not very excited about the prospect of going to heaven and doing nothing else. When I read in the book that a very long journey full of experiences and discoveries awaited us, I felt a tremendous illusion and thought that it was worth all the sorrows and troubles that I could have in this world. I was also impressed by reading the life of Jesus, and it reinforced how important Jesus is in my life as my “God-big brother-friend.”

## 8. How do you understand that of doing “the will of the Father”?

For me, doing the will of the Father is following the dictates of my interior, where my divine spark shows me the way. It is letting events flow without forcing them. It is accepting things as they come and reacting accordingly, without worrying about what might happen or what might suffer. Always, in every dilemma that is presented to us in life, there is a path that we intuit is the correct one. To follow him is to do the will of the Father.

## 9. Have you become aware of the presence of your Adjuster?

Sometimes I have felt a joy inside me or a restlessness that did not seem to come from me. On other occasions, ideas have come to my mind that seemed to come out of nowhere. But it would seem risky to say that they were manifestations of my Adjuster.

## 10. Have you tried to put the Master's teaching into practice? What was the result?

I try, I try, although many times I am surprised by attitudes that I don't know if the Master would have approved. Now I try to listen more to people, not judge them, not lose control, see others as my brothers... And when I realize that I haven't succeeded, the feeling of defeat is terrible. But I always recover. It is part of human nature!

## 11. Do you think that “The Urantia Book” has something “mysterious” that makes not everyone decide to read it?

I think the book is very challenging. It forces people to rethink their deepest beliefs and convictions, and that can be very scary. You have to be very open-minded and have the courage to consider your own beliefs. The comfortable thing for many is to put it aside and say that it is a fraud. The brave thing is to read it and wonder if what it says is not true. And if it is true, consider what to do accordingly.

## 12. Is there anything else you would like to say regarding “The Urantia Book”?

_The Urantia Book_ is a revelation for all humanity, but not everyone is ready to read it. This is not the time when your knowledge is going to be widely spread among the population; that will happen in the future, and we probably won't see it in the span of our lifetime here. But there are people, seekers of the Truth like us, who are prepared for his teachings and must serve as an outpost to encourage others. There are many people who are asleep and are waiting for us to wake them up. I believe that our living example is important, and so is service to others and sharing the teachings with those who are prepared to receive them. The success in disseminating the book depends on knowing how to transmit it to others, and the best argument for others is to live a life in accordance with its teachings.
