The hotel is located near Avenida del Puerto, which links the historic center with the port and the beaches. It is very close to the City of Arts and Sciences.

The theme of this Meeting is “**Discourses and parables of Jesus**”. Among all the speeches and parables that Jesus of Nazareth gave in his public life, we will work with two speeches and two parables. Attendees will form groups in which to consider what are the most important teachings of these speeches and parables, and then the results will be shared with all attendees. These are the texts that will be worked on in groups:

1. Discourse on true religion (Document 155, <a id="a55_45"></a>[UB 155:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p5_6) - <a id="a55_91"></a>[UB 155:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p5_13)).
2. The parable of the owner of the vineyards (Document 163, <a id="a56_60"></a>[UB 163:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p3_5) - <a id="a56_106"></a>[UB 163:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p3_7))
3. The parable of the mines (Document 171, <a id="a57_43"></a>[UB 171:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p8_3) - <a id="a57_89"></a>[UB 171:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p8_6))
4. The last speech in the temple (Document 175, <a id="a58_48"></a>[UB 175:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/175#p1_1) - <a id="a58_94"></a>[UB 175:1.24](/en/The_Urantia_Book/175#p1_24))

Given the success of the last meeting, on the last day there will be a session to answer questions that attendees want to ask to solve together. There will also be guided meditation in the evening after dinner, for those who wish to participate.
