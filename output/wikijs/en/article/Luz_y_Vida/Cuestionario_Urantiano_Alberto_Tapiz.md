My name is Alberto Tapiz Merino, I live in Miranda de Arga (Navarra). I am a cartographic engineer, single and childless. I have been reading _The Urantia Book_ for 12 years.

## 1. How did you get to “The Urantia Book” and why do you think you found it?

Through the _Trojan Horses_ of Juan José Benítez. After reading several books of the saga, it produced in me an interest in looking for the sources of the literary work, which led me to find _The Urantia Book_. For many years I have felt the need to seek answers to the eternal questions of the human being, such as where do we come from? Where we go? What are we doing here?, etc.

## 2. What was your first impression when reading it?

I started reading with the part about the history and evolution of the planet Urantia, as a geographer and engineer it was a very interesting part for me. Then came the part referring to the structure and organization of the universe, and finally the part referring to Jesus of Nazareth. After a first reading, the impression was that “this is what has best answered the questions sought for years”, despite not understanding many concepts and passages in the book.

## 3. At what point in the reading (document, sentence, etc.) did you accept that “The Urantia Book” is really what it claims to be?

When I saw that all the information in the book (or at least what I managed to understand up to that point) was logical and there were no apparent contradictions. And as I commented in the previous question, feeling that the questions sought were answered in the most extensive, logical and detailed way as ever. I felt it was the truth.

## 4. How has “The Urantia Book” changed your life?

A new perspective on life has invaded everything. _Everything_ has made sense and therefore the way to understand and accept what happens to us in this material life. Now I see people as “glimpses of God”, beings of love despite the fact that their attitude towards life is not shared. I enjoy God's material work more through, for example, the pleasure of sharing experiences in nature, of contemplating any small detail of daily life, etc.

## 5. Has the faith you had after reading it changed? If so, in what way?

I always had a fairly firm conviction within me that there was “something more” after the end of this material life, that it was illogical for the value of this material experience to end here forever, but by reading _The Urantia Book_ that conviction has been greatly expanded to become a true Faith.

## 6. Are there any points (or points) of the revelation that you find difficult to accept?

The one who says that we will only go through a material existence once, I think it is unfair to many people who, due to various inevitabilities, die and leave the planet early, without there being a “second chance” in the flesh for them. It is emphasized on several occasions how important the experience in the flesh is for our evolution, which is why I find it difficult to accept this fact.

## 7. What is the part that has most deeply impressed you?

The enormity of the universes and the great structure and number of celestial beings that work in them.

## 8. How do you understand “doing the will of the Father”?

Do good, listen to intuition (Adjuster), serve others, forgive.

## 9. Have you become aware of the presence of your Adjuster?

Yes (or I think so). On those occasions the feeling of fullness and of doing the most appropriate thing has been maximum.

## 10. Have you tried to put the Master's teachings into practice? What was the result?

Yes, in certain situations or moments. Developing unconditional love towards loved ones, adopting an understanding attitude towards the attitudes of others, etc. The result is great gratification and inner peace by accepting others and circumstances as they are.

## 11. Do you think that “The Urantia Book” has something “mysterious” that makes not everyone decide to read it?

I don't think the word is “mysterious” as it explains what it has to explain in a very detailed and concise way most of the time. What I do think is very revolutionary and to read it you need to have an open mind and be willing to accept new ideas and banish others while being prepared to make profound changes in the way you see life.

## 12. Is there anything else you would like to say regarding “The Urantia Book”?

I would like to express a wish about the book: I hope that its dissemination in the future is done in a controlled, unhurried and good manner, taking great care that it does not lead to the classic errors of traditional religions.
