José Luis Navarro was born in Vitoria in 1977 and currently resides in a town in Huesca located halfway between the capital Huesca and Zaragoza. He is a draftsman by profession and designs furniture for the trade. He is married and has an 8-year-old son. He is currently secretary of the board of directors of the Urantia Association of Spain.

## 1. How did you get to “The Urantia Book” and why do you think you found it?

I started reading the _Trojan Horses_ when I was eleven years old because my father passed them on to me. He was a great seeker of the truth, his library demonstrates this with titles such as _Lucifer's Rebellion_, _Looking into the distance of the universe_, _Life after life_, etc... Around the year 2000, after finishing reading one of the _Horses_ of J.J.Benitez, I wanted to find more and I started doing searches on the internet. In a forum someone answered with a very concise sentence: “_Trojan Horse_ is a plagiarism of _The Urantia Book_”. After that discovery I found the Urantia Foundation website and _The Urantia Book_ was right there to read. I studied it for years, because I did it very calmly. I'm still on it...

## 2. What was your first impression when reading it?

The first few days I looked at it by leaps and bounds. He was amazed at the amount of information he had and also a little scared, because it was clear that he did not understand a lot of the things on it. It had never happened to me before, so that even more motivated me to read it.

## 3. At what point in the reading (document, sentence, etc.) did you accept that “The Urantia Book” is really what it claims to be?

When I read about Adam and Eve something clicked in my brain and I realized that I was probably reading something very important. That chapter made a lot of pieces fit together. After reading it, I bought _The Urantia Book_ on paper and started reading it from the Foreword.

## 4. How has “The Urantia Book” changed your life?

Now it is the center of my life in one way or another, because in my decisions I always try to choose the path that represents something good for my spiritual future or that of others.

## 5. Has the faith you had after reading it changed? If so, in what way?

I now have unshakable faith in the Father's plan. I have more confidence and a very big ambition to be better every day. I am convinced that I am walking the right path, although obviously I do not always hit the right direction at every crossroads in my life.

## 6. Is there a point (or points) of the revelation that you find difficult to accept?

There have been moments of doubt regarding how the subject of races is treated, but now I have come to a better discernment regarding that subject. It is clear that the Father wants the best for us and of course the best is not our weakness against viruses, bacteria and other diseases. I now understand that _The Urantia Book_ talks about genetic enhancements and did so before it was fashionable among scientists.

## 7. What is the part that has most deeply impressed you?

The fourth part, after reading the previous ones, gives you a perspective of who Jesus really was. Seeing it from that much greater perspective makes what he did even more amazing. However, the third part I also like a lot, because it gives a lot of information about how we are and why we are like that.

## 8. How do you understand “doing the will of the Father”?

I see it easy to say and very difficult to carry out. Above all because of the difficulty of assuring what his will is. I think that much sooner it is necessary to improve communication with Him through the Adjuster, otherwise it is complex to discern if you are getting it right or not. The truth is that it is easier to know if you were right in the past than to know for sure in the present. If you look back you can see the fruits of your past decisions and there it is easier to see whether or not you were doing his will.

## 9. Have you become aware of the presence of your Adjuster?

I have had moments in my life when I have felt the Adjuster quite clearly, moments when I have perceived ideas and concepts that were not my own. Above all because on occasions they have led me to make decisions that I did not like, but that I felt were the right thing to do. However, I always question whether what I have perceived was the Adjuster or myself. The book rightly warns that it is preferable to believe that they are only our thoughts.

## 10. Have you tried to put the Master's teachings into practice? What was the result?

I try every day and it's definitely making me a better person, despite my stubbornness. I am so sorry, dear Adjuster, I try, but sometimes I am very animal.

## 11. Do you think that “The Urantia Book” has something “mysterious” that makes not everyone decide to read it?

I don't consider it to be a mystery, you just have to be at a specific moment in your life and have a very open attitude to be able to read the book and be touched by its words. At the slightest brush with our crystallized principles, beliefs or dogmas, all kinds of internal conflicts arise that make the majority flee.

## 12. Is there anything else you would like to say regarding “The Urantia Book”?

It is the most beautiful gift that has been given to the human being. All it takes is for it to be accepted by the majority of the people on the planet so that an explosion of truth, beauty and goodness floods everything and we walk, this time together, towards that unappealable, non-negotiable and impossible future that is called Light and Life.
