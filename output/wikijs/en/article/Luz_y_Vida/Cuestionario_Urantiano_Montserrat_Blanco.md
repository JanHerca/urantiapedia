## 1. How did you come across _The Urantia Book_ and why do you think you found it?

About 6 years ago I saw in some forum the discrepancies that existed between The Urantia Book and the Trojan Horse books, written by JJ Benitez, who considered these books a plagiarism of The Urantia Book. This caught my attention, because for me the Trojan Horses were a pearl, since they showed me a real and pure Jesus of Nazareth, outside of the interests and manipulations that I have always seen and felt in the different religions of our days. That is why I wanted to know more about the book.


## 2. What was your first impression when you read it?

At first I was disappointed, as I was expecting a more comfortable and understandable type of reading. But I did not give up and looked for a way to try to understand it.


## 3. At what point in the reading (document, sentence, etc.) did you accept that _The Urantia Book_ is really what it claims to be?

THE THOUGHT ADJUSTER for me was the key piece that makes everything fit and make sense. We were always taught that God was everywhere "omnipresent", that is how I discovered that the Father lives, experiences, travels... without moving!

What a wonderful contradiction! He was always there, silent. How moving and beautiful! Knowing that we are inhabited by a fragment of the Father is the greatest, most hopeful and gratifying thing that, in my opinion, we can discover in this life.


## 4. How has _The Urantia Book_ changed your life?

I started listening to myself more, being more patient and more aware of why we are here and above all wanting to know more and more about this fifth revelation. Just knowing everything I have left to learn motivates me more, in general I am a better person.

It is also very important for me to know that you have another family like the one formed by those of us who already live in faith. Everything that changes internally as a result of understanding this fifth revelation also makes you change externally.


## 5. Has your faith changed after reading it? If so, how?

I always had faith in someone great and powerful like God (our eternal Father), but the one who always took me by the hand since I was little was our Jesus of Nazareth. I always believed in Him, but now I understand many circumstances that I didn't know about before reading the book.


## 6. Is there any point (or points) of the revelation that you find difficult to accept?

The Trinity and some very specific points that still escape my understanding. But time will tell!


## 7. What is the part that has impressed you the most?

The number of creatures that work in our service, to help in our achievements and evolution. Their dedication and exclusive dedication to our service is admirable.


## 8. How do you understand “doing the will of the Father”?

Trying to be perfect as He is perfect, I know that here is something impossible to achieve, but I must try every step of my way. It is my will that His will be done and above all to trust. To trust and experience everything possible now in the flesh.


## 9. Have you become conscious of the presence of your Adjuster?

No, but I know he's there and I also know that he's very proud of me.


## 10. Have you tried to put the Master's teachings into practice? What has been the result?

I try to put them into practice every day. I believe that the big results are in the small details and I feel more fulfilled and satisfied every time. The results I receive are multiplied by 2.


## 11. Do you think that _The Urantia Book_ has something "mysterious" that makes not everyone decide to read it?

I think that each of us in this life has our priorities. We are at a stage in life where if you lift a stone a new religion appears and society in general is a bit saturated and right now prefers not to look beyond and focus on its “reality”.


## 12. Is there anything else you would like to say regarding _The Urantia Book_?

For me, The Urantia Book, although written years ago, is still too profound to require open minds that are willing to unlearn what they have learned in order to fill themselves with new concepts and ideas. We must be cautious and of course not succumb to old habits as other religions have done.
