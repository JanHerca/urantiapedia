**International Conference Organizing Committee**

Dear friends: time is passing inexorably and we have already begun to take the first steps in the organization of the UAI 2009 International Conference, which will be held at the **Hotel Vistamar in Benalmádena Costa (Málaga) from April 17 to 21, 2009. **. Please mark these dates in your diary, as this will be a unique opportunity to meet with readers of the Book from around the world.

In addition, this will be the first time that the international conference is held in a Spanish-speaking country, which also recognizes the enormous push that the dissemination of UB teachings is having in the Spanish-speaking world.

## Conference topic

After a “brainstorm”, the organizing committee has decided that the theme of this conference is the following:

**BUILDING BRIDGES: FROM DISHARMONY TOWARDS UNIVERSAL UNITY**

Below we include the development of the ideas that we would like to be the starting point for the talks and workshops that are held during the international conference.

Throughout history, the Iberian Peninsula has been a meeting point for many different peoples and cultures. Circumstances have made it a meeting point between:

- <ins>Africa and Europe</ins>: favored by its geographical location. Invasion of Arab peoples in the 8th century, fueled later by subsequent invasions of North African peoples.
- <ins>Islam and Christianity</ins>: from the 8th century to the end of the 15th century, the peninsula lived together (more or less peacefully) between the three main monotheistic religions: Christian, Jewish and Muslim.
- <ins>America and Europe</ins>: the discovery of Columbus gave rise to a long period of colonization, which gave rise to a common place, a common culture: Latin American culture.

These circumstances, which have largely determined Spanish culture and character, have suggested the idea of “building bridges” as a possible theme for the conference. But how can we relate all this to the teachings of the UB?

We, as UB readers, must take care of the dissemination of its teachings, and the best way to carry out this dissemination is precisely by building bridges with our fellow men, giving all possible opportunities to those who want to take advantage of it. On the other hand, dissemination also consists of building bridges to other cultures and religions, since in this way we promote the idea of our common filiation: we are all children of God and, therefore, brothers.

Everything that fosters understanding and mutual understanding leads to knowing each other a little more and, therefore, to loving each other a little more. Normally, what is not known is feared. Therefore, we should get to know each other better. It would be interesting for this conference to give presentations dealing with the different dissemination activities in different cultures of the world, on how relations with the different religions of the world are approached, on how to live with people of different cultures and religions in the light of the teachings of the UB.

Building bridges to universal brotherhood is part of applying the religion of Jesus. One could, for example, try to analyze throughout the documents of part four the main characteristics of the life and religion of Jesus (we have a Father, we are brothers) and his ability to transform society and lead us towards brotherhood. universal. Also its non-exclusion of anyone as the basis of the meeting point of all religions and ideologies. We could explore how Jesus lived his life and how he conveyed his message.

Another possible implication of this theme would be the discussion on general globalization (not only economic), on the global village seen from the point of view of the _Urantia Book_: building a bridge towards a better future, towards a higher civilization. Establish a meeting point for all races and cultures. It is necessary to establish a meeting point for all religions, based on a cordial climate that does not exclude anyone.

As for unity, it must be sought from our own diversity as an atypical planet and from a considerable variety of individuals, not from uniformity. Regarding its universal character, we would have to pay a certain tribute or recognition to those beings that we do not see, that we know are constantly offering us bridges and hands, trying to iron out rough edges and lean towards where it is best for us. We have to build a bridge towards them to make their work a little easier, which is ultimately for our benefit.

## Conference subthemes

Following the development of the ideas on the theme of the conference, in the organizing committee we have proposed these sub-themes or sections, so that volunteer speakers can present themselves to give us their vision on each of these aspects:

- I. Building bridges towards our fellow men: dissemination of the teachings.

- II. Building bridges to other cultures and religions: the idea of filiation as a meeting point.

- III. Jesus and his way of building bridges.

- IV. Building bridges to a better future and a higher civilization: the global village from the point of view of the UB.

- V. Building bridges towards the celestial beings that help us.

- SAW. The bridge to the Universal Father: self-realization or personal growth.

## Conference Logo

After a long period of suggestions and discussions, the following logo has been adopted to illustrate the theme of the international conference:

<figure id="Figure_1" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV11/05.jpg">
</figure>

The figures hold the outermost circle together and symbolize diversity (two groups of 7 people of different colors, which could be assimilated to the initial human races). If we consider that the three concentric circles represent the Deities of the Trinity, the sphere of light that it is in the center and radiates in all directions would represent universal unity. But the sphere of light has other meanings: it is the symbol of the future era of Light and Life for which all the races collaborate as a unitary objective, and it is also a nod to the place where the international conference is going to be held, located in the Costa del Sol.

## We are already a legally recognized association!

Since last October 29, the Urantia Association of Spain has been legally recognized in the Registry of Associations of the Ministry of the Interior, and is registered in Group 1, Section 1, national number 589678.
