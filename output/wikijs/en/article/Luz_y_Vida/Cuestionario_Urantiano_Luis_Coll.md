Luis Coll is a reader who lives in Planolas, province of Girona. He is 67, he worked as a gardener but he is already retired. He is the father of five grown children who live in Spain and Belgium.

## 1. How did you get to “The Urantia Book” and why do you think you found it?

I came to _The Urantia Book_ around the year 2000, through the novel _The Testament of Saint John_, by J.J. Benitez.

## 2. What was your first impression when reading it?

I found it interesting and with a lot of content, I was reading it little by little.

## 3. At what point in the reading (document, sentence, etc.) did you accept that “The Urantia Book” is really what it claims to be?

I especially liked the first part, the extensive description it gives about God, the Trinity and the universe. For me that part was very interesting. Some people say it's hard to understand, but it wasn't that hard for me.

## 4. How has “The Urantia Book” changed your life?

I have always believed in God and have been a seeker of truth. The most significant change for me was discovering how big God and Spirit is and how extensive the book makes on so many things in general.

## 5. Has the faith you had after reading it changed? If so, in what way?

I would say that more than changing my faith, it has increased it.

## 6. Are there any points (or points) of the revelation that you find difficult to accept?

It is not that there are points that I find difficult to accept, but it is necessary to recognize that the book requires in-depth and constant study in order to understand some things that are sometimes difficult to understand.

## 7. What is the part that has most deeply impressed you?

The first part is the one that has impressed me the most, because of the profound revelation it makes of God and the Deities of Paradise, and the description of the seven superuniverses, the place where we live in the great universal creation. Neither the Bible nor any other book that I know of makes such an extensive revelation. And the fourth part could not be missing, the life and teachings of Jesus, which is an excellent guide for our lives.

## 8. How do you understand “doing the will of the Father”?

I understand “doing the Father's will” as having a positive attitude towards life, and living day to day doing the best we can for ourselves and others.

## 9. Have you become aware of the presence of your Adjuster?

It is difficult to distinguish the presence of the Adjuster, because in our minds there are also many emotions and thoughts and many ideas mixed together, and it is a real puzzle to distinguish what could be the real “voice” of the Adjuster, but I would venture to say that most of Sometimes I do feel his presence.

## 10. Have you tried to put the Master's teachings into practice? What was the result?

When Jesus told his apostles and followers to “go into all the world to preach the gospel of good news,” every time we speak about Jesus and to ourselves, especially the readers of _The Urantia Book_, and convey those truths to the In addition, we are fulfilling that desire and mandate of the Creator Son, and the result is that this gives purpose and joy to our lives and to the lives of others.

## 11. Do you think that “The Urantia Book” has something “mysterious” that makes not everyone decide to read it?

I think the greatest mystery in the book is the mystery of God, which is going to take us all eternity to understand. I think many people do not want to penetrate _The Urantia Book_ because they do not dare to undertake that great adventure that is the discovery of God.

## 12. Is there anything else you would like to say regarding “The Urantia Book”?

What I want to say about _The Urantia Book_ is that it is a great revelation, and that I hope that we readers will always remain a group of good friends studying the book, without titles or pretensions, as a group of friends and seekers of the TRUE.
