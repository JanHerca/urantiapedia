Ana María García Simón, a native of Estepona (Málaga), by profession, administrative assistant in a public administration for 28 years now. Mother of two daughters from a first marriage and unfortunately recently widow of my second husband with whom I had the experience of sharing the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. I am the treasurer of the Urantia Association of Spain.

## 1. How did you get to “The Urantia Book” and why do you think you found it?

I have always been a seeker, I have always kept in communication with the Father. My husband had read the book in depth, he wanted to know my impression about these topics while we were getting to know each other and he left me clues to see where my curiosity would take me. Finally, he discovered that my interest was more common between us and I am still discovering his teachings.

## 2. What was your first impression when reading it?

There were parts of the book that came to impact me and I still have that feeling today. Although I still do not feel capable of transmitting what I know, when I read it it is a map, a guide, as if many theories and knowledge from within me were consolidated.

## 3. At what point in the reading (document, sentence, etc.) did you accept that “The Urantia Book” is really what it claims to be?

From the beginning, the part of the words of Jesus of Nazareth, “Michael of Nebadon”, were the ones that left the greatest impression on me. “Truly I tell you…”. I use many phrases in the colloquial language of my daily life.

## 4. How has “The Urantia Book” changed your life?

I cannot conceive of making a decision in my life without applying the knowledge that I have acquired in these years of _The Urantia Book_, making use of meditation above all, understanding that everything requires detailed attention, analysis, even knowing that the free decision is mine. and the consequences of the Father, still feeling much more responsible when deciding.

## 5. Has the faith you had after reading it changed? If so, in what way?

The knowledge that I am acquiring I do not understand that it has had an end, it is continuous, transforming and enriching. The word _fe_, made up of two letters, is too small for all that I really understand that my life has changed since that first time I was curious about this word. My faith today has nothing to do with that of my beginnings. My faith accompanies me by the hand daily, it is a friend and guide, although I believe that there is much more to discover.

## 6. Is there a point (or points) of the revelation that you find difficult to accept?

Accept would not be the word, there are many points that I still do not understand, I cannot place them in my real space-time, because I understand that the step towards the spiritual is out of my framework of knowledge.

## 7. What is the part that has most deeply impressed you?

Now that I have been reading continuously for several years, there is no doubt that trying to understand the Father's plan is a walk that invades me with enormous spiritual gratification, indeed always with new contributions that in previous readings went completely unnoticed.

## 8. How do you understand “doing the will of the Father”?

Well, every day that dawns we once again have that opportunity to offer Him our service and be attentive so that each step that is taken is the one that He would have wanted us to decide, while we at the same time feel satisfied with our choices.

## 9. Have you become aware of the presence of your Adjuster?

No, if there had been some connection between us like that, I at least have not recognized him.

## 10. Have you tried to put the Master's teachings into practice?

It is always what I try to do with all the performances of my life. What has been the result? Many times I have suffered reprisals by the society in which I live, but I have not regretted it despite suffering consequences because everything must be experienced and lived by and for the Father.

## 11. Do you think that “The Urantia Book” has something “mysterious” that makes not everyone decide to read it?

It has something special, I do not understand that it is mysterious. _The Urantia Book_ and its reading in our time is for people with a level of knowledge, studies, combined with the restlessness and curiosity of the person for something that is somewhat out of print in this society, such as talking about a heavenly Father God. It is not easy to understand with a light reading, so I understand that in these times of the need to acquire information in 20 seconds it is not compatible with the work to invest in reading it.

## 12. Is there anything else you would like to say regarding “The Urantia Book”?

I know several readers of _The Urantia Book_. I consider myself a daily work reader, who finds it very difficult to explain what I read, in my own words, although in my mind the pieces of this puzzle fit together, sometimes I manage to put a single piece after many turns. I have a lot of pieces mixed up and put together in a far away place because I don't even know where they can be placed yet. But I am completely sure that I am responsible that every word that could come out of my mouth in reference to this book must be beauty, goodness and truth.
