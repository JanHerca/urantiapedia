Francisco (Paco) lives in Seville. He is retired, previously he was an Administrative Function Management technician. He is married and he has two children. He has been a reader of the book since 1977.

## 1. How did you get to “The Urantia Book” and why do you think you found it?

Through the study of spiritualism, oriental religions, ufology, etc. In the bookstore where I usually bought books on these subjects, they told me about a person who was also on these subjects. I contacted him (Antonio Moya Cerpa) and on the first visit, talking about these issues, he told me that he had discovered an extraordinary book that had nothing to do with what he had seen before. I began to visit him regularly and we formed a reading group. Antonio read the book to us from French and each sentence he read left us absorbed and amazed.

## 2. What was your first impression when reading it?

My first impressions when reading it were of amazement when I observed that it made much more sense and much more coherence than anything I had previously read and researched. It left me impressed and above all wanting to read repeatedly.

## 3. At what point in the reading (document, sentence, etc.) did you accept that “The Urantia Book” is really what it claims to be?

I think I accepted it pretty much from the beginning. Since the readings we did at that time were not from the beginning of the book, but rather we chose what we wanted to read (listen to), as we progressed, more astonished believers converted.

## 4. How has “The Urantia Book” changed your life?

_The Urantia Book_ totally changed my way of living, thinking and acting. Within my absolute imperfection I abandoned egoism, most material desires, I thought more, better and higher, I stopped arguing because when comparing any subject that aroused controversy, the memory and conviction of paragraphs or themes of _The Urantia Book_ made me think otherwise; it made me more brotherly. Currently I only discuss trivial things with my wife.

## 5. Has the faith you had after reading it changed? If so, in what way?

My FAITH absolutely changed. Before, I “believed” that there was something superior, I had great doubts about reincarnation and other “pseudo-spiritual” teachings and practices. After reading _The Urantia Book_ my FAITH is unshakable, continually open to do the Will of the Father under one of my favorite mottos : IT IS MY WILL THAT YOUR WILL BE DONE.

## 6. Are there any points (or points) of the revelation that you find difficult to accept?

I currently unconditionally accept all of _The Urantia Book_.

## 7. What is the part that has most deeply impressed you?

Many parts have left me in a state of utter amazement, but the part that, let's say, impresses me most deeply is part IV, the life of Jesus (a way of living doing the Father's will perfectly and marvelously).

## 8. How do you understand “doing the will of the Father”?

“Doing the will of the Father” I think is following his indications to become like him: fraternity, sonship under his paternity; treat others as you would like to be treated; integrate with Him by fusing with the Adjuster; live each moment of your life intensely working to get closer and closer to the part of Him that is with you.

## 9. Have you become aware of the presence of your Adjuster?

I am not sure that I have become conscious of the presence of my Adjuster. Sometimes I think that I may have had some kind of communication with Him and other times I think the opposite.

## 10. Have you tried to put the Master's teachings into practice? What was the result?

Continuously, in my daily life I “try” to put the Master's teachings into practice (I am an unconditional fan of Him). The results are very diverse: sometimes very satisfactory, sometimes very unsatisfactory and with many doubts as to whether I have done it as I should (perhaps because of my way of thinking or doing at that moment); but whenever I have to make a decision, my first thought is: What would Michael of Nebadon do in this situation or at this moment? And as I answer, that's how I act.

## 11. Do you think that “The Urantia Book” has something “mysterious” that makes not everyone decide to read it?

I think that everything depends on the way people live; what did they teach them; how they were educated; what concerns assail them; what do they pursue in this life; what they think a religious life is like (most think of Church, Mass, etc.). Many who start reading it at the beginning leave it soon, they don't understand it and it sounds Chinese to them. To those who have asked me, I recommend that you read the fourth part first or read the index and alternately read what attracts you the most at those moments in your life; Later, they will complete the reading little by little and integrate into groups of readers (it gives a lot of encouragement and different visions).

## 12. Is there anything else you would like to say regarding “The Urantia Book”?

We are very at the beginning of this revelation, there are great cultural and belief differences in different parts of the world; Maslow's pyramid is also developed at different levels in each part of the world, the country, the city, the neighborhood and even the community of owners or building where one lives and inhabits. _The Urantia Book_ has come to do much good but evolutionarily, in due time.
