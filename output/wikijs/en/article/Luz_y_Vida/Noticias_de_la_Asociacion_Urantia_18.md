## European Readers Meeting in Berlin

Olga López

From August 21 to 24, a conference of European readers of _The Urantia Book_ was held in Berlin (Germany), organized by Urantia Dach, the association linked to Urantia Association International (UAI) that encompasses the three German-speaking European countries : Germany, Austria and Switzerland. This meeting was attended by 55 people from thirteen countries: Germany, Austria, Spain, the United States, Estonia, Finland, the Netherlands, Hungary, Norway, Poland, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Switzerland and Ukraine. Mention should be made of the presence at the event of UAI President Chris Wood, and Urantia Foundation Associate Trustees Richard Jernnigan (USA) and Sandra Burga-Cisneros (resident in Switzerland but originally from Peru).

The conference activities began on Thursday evening, August 21, when a pleasant evening was held to commemorate the birthday of Jesus. An informal dinner was held in which we had the opportunity to chat animatedly among ourselves, and where we also sang the unofficial hymn “Pray, tell me how” in various languages (including Spanish).

Friday and Saturday were the “strong” days of the conference, in which presentations were offered, interspersed with questions from the attendees. This is the list of presentations along with the readers who gave them:

- The composer Karlheinz Stockhausen and the UB (Christian Ruch, Switzerland)
- Famous UB Readers (Michael MacIsaac, Sweden)
- The four gospels and the UB (Doris Calmel, Switzerland)
- UB readers from Colombia and Peru (Libardo Antonio Schefer, Holland)
- Why study groups are important (Chris Wood, USA)
- Time and space, our universe and the universe of UB (Francisco M. Fuentes, Spain)
- The parables of Jesus (Chris Wood, USA)
- _The Urantia Book_ allows man to find the essence of himself, of life and of its transmission (Doris Calmel, Switzerland)
- The demand for quality of life (Irmeli Ivalo-Sjölie, Finland)
- Beyond the European Union and the blue planet (Ade Awoyinka, United Kingdom)
- UB and modern eugenics (Karmo Kalda, Estonia)
- Recharge spiritual batteries (Michael MacIsaac, Sweden)

On Sunday morning, the conference closed with a meeting of the open club of European readers “The Blue Club”, where it was decided that a readers' conference would be held every two years, and a vote was unanimously in favor of holding the next conference. in the beautiful Central European city of Budapest (Hungary), sometime in 2016. For its part, “The Blue Club” will meet again in Frankfurt (Germany) in April 2015.

From here I encourage all Spanish readers to attend this type of event. It does not matter if the level of English is not good; the atmosphere of fraternity that is breathed in this type of meeting goes far beyond the language barrier. In addition, you will always find someone to help you with the translation!
