_My name is Miguel Bustos and I live on a beautiful island called Majorca where I was born exactly 66 years ago. I have been a Social Security employee until they made me a pensioner due to an accident. Currently, I have already become part of that retirement money box that I hope will last beyond my time so that future generations have the same rights that I am enjoying._

_It is a pleasure for me to share my experiences of how events developed so that one day, unexpectedly and without looking for it, this blessed revelation of our Urantia Book came to me. My perspective on how to deal with my “ups, downs and downs” regarding my current life has totally changed._

_May our Universal Father guide us and the Spirit of Truth inspire us to complete your spiritual concerns... a big hug to all!_

## 1. How did you get to “The Urantia Book” and why do you think you found it?

My arrival or discovery of the book was through religions. Since childhood, the Catholic religion was already instilled in me by default or obligation, due to the Franco dictatorship; but that imposition had no effect on me for whatever reason. Over the years I got married and worked a lot with the intention of starting a home. Then came the divorce, which made me wake up and become aware of the nonsense of this consumer society. It was then that I began to worry about finding another meaning in life other than “working to have things.” Then, at that crucial-emotional moment in my life, Jehovah's Witnesses came across and I was with them for almost five years until I understood that it was not what I was looking for.

Later I met the Evangelical Christians, with whom I mixed for almost two years, reaching the same conclusion as in my previous experience. Immediately I became interested in the Mormon movement, but in 6-7 months I verified that they were more of the same. To make it a little short, I can say that I was interested in all kinds of Eastern philosophies, where I came to the same conclusion that where there are “leaders”, “elders”, “priests”, “pastors”, “gurus” or any kind of “enlightened” that tells you how to do things or how to interpret them, that's not my place. I continued searching the Internet until one day it occurred to me to put the word “Melchizedek” and I received a large amount of information from _The Urantia Book_, but the thing did not go any further until one day, in a paradisiacal place (Castillo de Bellver), one of my friends with whom we met there showed up with a book under his arm and it was our book; It was at that moment that I felt the need to have and read that book. It was not available in Mallorca and in a week they brought it to me from Madrid (in eight months I devoured it).

Sorry! I didn't find him, he found me!

## 2. What was your first impression when reading it?

I'm not exaggerating when I say it was amazing. I was perplexed and I couldn't believe that after so many years of searching I found that treasure, that jewel that suddenly cleared up the amount of unknowns that had been pounding my brain since I felt my first spiritual concerns. But it is also that, as I progress in the different study groups that I share, I feel a better understanding of all the information that our book reveals to us. It goes without saying when I verify the great coherence of everything exposed in it.

## 3. At what point in the reading (document, sentence, etc.) did you accept that “The Urantia Book” is really what it claims to be?

When I read it in its entirety for the first time, I already knew or intuited that I was facing information that had nothing to do with all the information that I had accumulated in my searches of previous years, but once I was introduced to the matter and understood more, there was some paragraphs from chapter 3 section five where there are nine points that totally caught me along with a lot of other information... to all this we add its great coherence, the four parts of the book, its sequential order, the life and evolution of the human being in Urantia, together with the wonderful account of the life of Jesus and the question is already answered.

## 4. How has “The Urantia Book” changed your life?

Completely. I feel more serene, more sure of myself, I know why I am here and where I want to go.

## 5. Has the faith you had before reading it changed? In what way?

Yes, my faith has changed because I understand and feel that my Universal Father is real, not a myth. Your immense organization I would say that “almost” and “exclusively” is designed for our spiritual-universal progress, together with the continuous evolution of other universes to be created where I intuit, believe and wish to have a role of service in other worlds to be created.

## 6. Is there a point (or points) of the revelation that you find difficult to accept?

None. What I understand, because I understand it and I believe in it. And what I do not understand, by faith and trust in our Universal Father, together with all the information that little by little is revealed with the Spirit of Truth.

## 7. What is the part that has most deeply impressed you?

Absolutely everything as a whole and its coherence.

## 8. How do you understand that of doing “the will of the Father”?

For me I understand it and I feel like a responsibility for having the privilege of enjoying little-known information, which leads me to make it known without conditioning or imposing it on anyone. Put into practice the message of love of our Universal Father, where he gives us some guidelines of love for HIM as our spiritual father, along with the message of brotherhood among all human beings on Urantia.

## 9. Have you become aware of the presence of your Adjuster?

No. If at any time in my life my Adjuster has given me a hand, I have not had the slightest feeling that such a thing is happening. Another thing is that, with the passing of the years, you are noticing changes that “perhaps” without their support and direction would be different.

## 10. Have you tried to put the Master's teaching into practice? What was the result?

Good question! I try to be coherent with what I learn and feel in my heart... but without trying to justify myself, I suppose that at some point I fall into weaknesses of my own ego, conditioned by this social system in which I live.

## 11. Do you think that “The Urantia Book” has something “mysterious” that makes not everyone decide to read it?

I think that there is nothing mysterious about it, but I also believe that this Revelation is too new to be widely known. Also, this information is a bit out-of-date for most people in the world. Information such that, in a society like today's, where the great god is money, consumerism, soccer, sex and other distractions, it is difficult for the vast majority to be interested in it.

## 12. Is there anything else you would like to say regarding “The Urantia Book”?

That it is the best gift that the Father has given us, and that I feel privileged to have the opportunity to enjoy his great love in the form of a Revelation.
