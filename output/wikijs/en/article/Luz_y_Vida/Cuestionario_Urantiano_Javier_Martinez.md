Javier officially lives in Madrid, although he resides in Almería for most of the year. He is a retired civil servant and technical telecommunications engineer. Divorced, he has been living with his current partner for more than 18 years. He has two children, and three from his current partner. He spends a lot of time collaborating with other groups reading the book (ICSS Group, Colombia, Toronto, Brazil and Spain). He also collaborates with the Ágora 2.0 group and manages a Facebook platform called “Deciphering Urantia.”

## 1. How did you get to “The Urantia Book” and why do you think you found it?

I came to the book through reading J.J.'s _Trojan Horses_. Benítez, through a small indication in the prologue of the book _El testamento de san Juan_.

After a permanent search to try to learn more about the life of Jesus of Nazareth, I came across this prodigious document that satisfied most of the existential questions that I had asked myself in my life. It was a turning point in relation to my search.

## 2. What was your first impression when reading it?

Initially I read it as if it were a fictional novel. I started with the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, later I began to read the Prologue and other documents. Something shot inside of me, since I could not stop reading until the end of the entire book. Initially I considered it more related to the theories of the New Age and of a sectarian nature. My appreciation was changing with the certainty of the reflections that were described there. I have read the entire book more than 5 times.

## 3. At what point in the reading (document, sentence, etc.) did you accept that “The Urantia Book” is really what it claims to be?

I seem to remember that, apart from the impression that reading it produced on me, the phrase that “light weighs” led me to the conviction that I had in my hands a true revelation that did not exist on this planet, or at least I did. I didn't know her

## 4. How has “The Urantia Book” changed your life?

Reading has produced a drastic change in my life and in my relationships with others, but above all the certainty of a reality very different from the one lived, as well as the loss of fear in relation to life and death and accidental events.

## 5. Has the faith you had after reading it changed? If so, in what way?

Starting from deep beliefs in Christianity-Catholicism, although not practicing, the basic faith remains the same, only some changes in the conception that Mary the mother of Jesus had about Mary, the theory of atonement, as well as the explanation of concepts such as the error and evil, the tasks of Adam and Eve, the concept of heaven and hell and the main task of Jesus, were the most significant themes in my interior reconversion.

## 6. Are there any points (or points) of the revelation that you find difficult to accept?

Some topics make me uncertain, such as the existence and functions of intermediate beings, and the intellectual conception of the Supreme Being. Although there are other controversial issues, I can accept them because I have to adapt my beliefs and desires to the information in the book.

## 7. What is the part that has most deeply impressed you?

There are many parts that initially stunned me, but the long journey to Heavenly Father makes me dizzy. And fundamentally all the philosophy and theology of the Prologue continues to impress me. The explanation of the Lucifer rebellion is exhaustive and clarifying to understand everything that has happened and is happening.

## 8. How do you understand “doing the will of the Father”?

In principle I assume it as a vital desire of the soul, not as a submission of a lackey to his master or king, but as the certainty that the option of doing or approaching the will of God is the most appropriate and the most convenient for personal and social level. It is almost a selfish desire and attitude to harmonize my will with the will of the Father as an act of security and certainty that is most convenient and productive.

## 9. Have you become aware of the presence of your Adjuster?

I am fully aware of the presence of the Divine Spark in my being. Before learning about the book, I was certain of the existence of a channel of communication with Jesus, which I opened or closed at will. Today I sense his presence in a conscious way and I know for sure that he communicates through facts, situations and above all personal reflections.

## 10. Have you tried to put the Master's teachings into practice? What was the result?

I try to put into practice all the teachings that are related to my life and to others. At least I am aware of many personal attitudes, words and deeds that I should have done differently if I had known _The Urantia Book_. In other extremely important aspects, teaching and results have been crucial. In the social sphere, I manage the FaceBook platform “Deciphering Urantia” and I collaborate with Ágora 2.0 as a different way of disseminating the values and pearls of the book.

## 11. Do you think that “The Urantia Book” has something “mysterious” that makes not everyone decide to read it?

I have come to the firm conclusion that it takes a basic preparation and desire to be able to accept it. Not everyone is prepared, it requires courage in their acceptance and change of some paradigms strongly rooted in the person. We all need our time, but fundamentally the sincere desire to seek the truth outside of ancestral and out-of-date rites, customs and rites is necessary. Critically and courageously questioning supposedly sacred texts requires courage and acceptance of a fresh and renewing faith.

## 12. Is there anything else you would like to say regarding “The Urantia Book”?

It is the most important document appeared in our era. It lacks many explanations of events that occurred in past human history, many answers remain hidden, although it is extremely concise in explanations of the cosmos and the heavenly hosts. I have a feeling that in the next revelation they will tell us many more things that we would currently be unable to understand. It is a revelation adapted to what we are capable of understanding and comprehending.

I also believe that this revelation is accompanied by personal revelations to people open to new technological, social, ethical and moral concepts, along the lines marked in _The Urantia Book_.

If we do not correctly apply the teachings of the book, these are the dangers that await us:

- Religious fundamentalism.
- Crystallization of beliefs without giving possibility to the opening of new ideas and knowledge.
- Criminalization and disagreements with other religious beliefs.
- Ruptures and confrontations between readers of the book for merely intellectual concepts.
- Creation of a normalized singular religion or sect, and constructions of physical temples of The Urantia Book.
- Appearance of charismatic leaders who control followers with economic impositions and power.
- Falling into the same errors of the current structural and pyramidal churches.
