## XIV Meeting of Readers of The Urantia Book — “Ágora Nostra”

**From April 30 to May 3, 2015**

**Hotel Los Habaneros, Cartagena, MURCIA**

Dear readers of _The Urantia Book_:

The title of Ágora Nostra has seemed very appropriate to us, being first of all a scenario as cosmopolitan and rooted in antiquity as Cartagena is; Greeks, Romans, Phoenicians and Carthaginians have passed through it, so in honor of them we make that mixture of Greek and Roman concepts. Secondly, an agora was a square where presentations were made, discussions were held and opinions were disseminated, in short knowledge was imparted, and the Nostra comes from Latin and refers to something of ours. With these premises, draw yourselves the meaning of the title of this meeting.

This year we wanted to vary the format a bit; We are going to do a single workshop with the format we have had so far, since you enjoy this activity a lot and it provides knowledge on the subject to be discussed in a very participatory way. The rest will be presentations.

We already made the call so that everyone who wanted to give a presentation related to _The Urantia Book_ and its concepts let us know. Today we have the program covered. Spaces have been assigned to presentations as they have been received. It is true that some have been left out due to the rigorous order that we have established, but there will always be an opportunity to expose them through our website.

We maintain the guided meditation spaces at night, the excursion, the free time and the evening debates. We also hold the Sunday question and answer session. For this we will give you a sheet on the first day so that you can ask the questions you want. They will be collected on Saturday evening and discussed in a joint session on Sunday morning. We also maintain the Ordinary Assembly of the Association.

Note: The organization reserves the right to alter the schedule and activities, depending on the development of the meeting.

### Place

The hotel is quite central (C/San Diego, 60) and is very strategically located. You can find information on the hotel's website: http://www.hotelhabaneros-cartagena.com/. The port is 10 minutes away and the historic center 5 minutes away. The bus station and the train station are 100 and 300 m respectively from the hotel. If someone uses the plane, we have the San Javier airport with bus service from/to Cartagena. If someone wants to come by boat or cruise, there is a port with a cruise terminal.

### Prices

The price of 4 days/3 nights in a double room, full board and meeting attendance fee is €199/person.

The price per person in a single room is €244.

The price for an adult companion who does not participate in the meeting is €189.

In the case of families with children, an extra bed/s will be required. Not all rooms allow an extra bed. Therefore, we ask those families who need it to notify us as soon as possible to reserve rooms with said service.

The hotel, in the case of children up to 12 years old, will not make an additional charge for the extra bed, we will only add the price of breakfasts and meals. In other words, €129 for children from 5 to 12 and half, €64.50, for children under 5 years of age.

People who attend the meeting but do not stay at the hotel must pay the amount of €10 as a meeting attendance fee. They can have lunch and dinner at the hotel at an agreed price of €18 per menu that they will pay directly to the hotel at the time of consumption. The menu includes a starter (to choose one of two dishes), a main course (to choose one of three dishes), dessert and three drinks (water, wine, beer, soft drink, coffee).

Children between 5 and 12 years old with parents who are not staying pay the same as their parents (€18 per menu); children under 5 years old, half the agreed price (€9).

### Assistance Scholarships

The Urantia Association of Spain, as usual in the celebration of national meetings, makes available to those who want to attend but cannot financially, three scholarships of €199 that cover accommodation, full board and registration fee. The scholarship holders will only have to cover the trip to Cartagena.

In order to grant these aids, you must request them by email from the Association, urantiaesp@gmail.com, before March 22, 2015. We will study all the requests and we will try, with God's help, to award them fairly and equitably. Obviously, it is understood that the people who can have access to these scholarships must be readers of The Urantia Book and be, in some way, involved in the Urantia movement (being members of the Association, belonging to a study group, conducting dissemination events, presentations, videos, attendance at fairs, etc.). Refrain, therefore, all those who only see this opportunity as a reason for tourism. Thank you.

### Registration Procedure

To register for the Meeting and make your reservation we attach a form that you can fill out and send to the email address of the asociaciónurantiaesp@gmail.com:

Direct link from where to download the form: http://urantia.es/sites/default/files/INSCRIPCION-XIV-ENCUENTRO.pdf

Next, you make the deposit corresponding to your modality of assistance by means of a transfer to the account of the Triodos Bank association:

IBAN: **ES8614910001252132065927/CC: 14910001252132065927**

It must be indicated in the concept “XIV Encounter: Your name”. Sending the form and entering confirms the reservation.

You will have all current and future information promptly on our website, http://www.urantia.es, in the “Meetings” section, in the link “XIVEncuentro - Cartagena, 2015”: http://www.urantia.es/node/365

Honestly, I think of the Meeting, in the month of May, in Cartagena, the Mediterranean pearl, four days, covered by the sun, surrounded by history and beauty, gathered around the truth and with the kind attitude and intention with which we attended , and we can only conclude that it has all the ingredients of the will of the Father.

We have worked and negotiated to be able to offer you this act, now you take the baton and enjoy it.
