Omar Delgado is a Colombian reader currently residing in Sweden. She is 34 years old, a nursing assistant by profession. Marital status: free union.

## 1. How did you get to “The Urantia Book” and why do you think you found it?

I found the book in a great search for the book itself, as a child I heard about it, in my adolescence I looked for it and found it next to the school where I studied. It was a great emotion because I knew and knew the meaning of the book for humanity.

## 2. What was your first impression when reading it?

I cried reading it, I was excited to have it.

## 3. At what point in the reading (document, sentence, etc.) did you accept that “The Urantia Book” is really what it claims to be?

The teachings of the book are not told by any other book, the spiritual hope of other worlds after this life convinced me that it is a revelation to humanity.

## 4. How has “The Urantia Book” changed your life?

My outlook on life has changed.

## 5. Has the faith you had after reading it changed? If so, in what way?

I grew up with the book as a child, I always knew that it is a revelation, I compared these teachings with other texts and saw the lack of information of many beliefs and the lack of spiritual sensitivity of humanity.

## 6. Are there any points (or points) of the revelation that you find difficult to accept?

It is difficult for me to understand certain important points of the Absolutes.

## 7. What is the part that has most deeply impressed you?

The whole book itself has impressed me, every time I read it I understand something new and it is deeper than we think of the book itself.

## 8. How do you understand “doing the will of the Father”?

Selfless service to my peers, abandoning everything to fate, every day with your concern, even if it is difficult to do so.

## 9. Have you become aware of the presence of your Adjuster?

At various times I have felt the presence of my Adjuster.

## 10. Have you tried to put the Master's teachings into practice? What was the result?

Taking this revelation to the world, showing it on my social networks is something gratifying and I would say that the result is consistent with the commitment we have to it. Humanity still lacks understanding and desire to seek God, which in my experience has been very sad and painful.

## 11. Do you think that “The Urantia Book” has something “mysterious” that makes not everyone decide to read it?

That's right, the book itself is the cornerstone of social and spiritual change in the world as long as we form that society separate and distinct from the world.

## 12. Is there anything else you would like to say regarding “The Urantia Book”?

Revelation is my master book of life and I will continue to share its message. I ask heaven to send spiritual emissaries to be better understood. We, as book activists, should love it even more and immerse ourselves in its teachings to find its priceless pearls of great value.
