## In Memoriam - Josefina Canseco

Josefina Canseco left for the mansion worlds on the morning of February 26. It had been some time not very well; on Wednesday the 20th she was admitted and finally on Tuesday the 26th she left us, although, as we all know, not forever.

Those of us who know her know that she is an exceptional woman. She had long been the “mother” of the Urantia movement in Spain and one of its key figures. He welcomed everyone who asked him into his house, a house that contemplated events of great importance for the movement and that was our first “headquarters.” He was filled with pride when he saw how our association grew and gained strength, the one that had seen it born.

We all know where he has gone, so there is no room for sadness; only the pity of not seeing her again until we also travel to those worlds of morontia.

A hug to everyone and especially to Esteban, his partner in this life of all those adventures.

Carmelo Martínez
President of the Urantia Association of Spain

## 25. Interview with Ismael Gracia in the Gelves Video Chain Program “Confidences in the Cabin” February 25, 2013

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV32/08.jpg">
</figure>

On February 25, the Urantia Association of Spain was invited to participate in the television program “Confidencias en el Camarote” on Radio Televisión Gelves (Seville). The director/presenter, Angel Oliveros, explained to us that the program would be recorded and later broadcast on various local television stations, on different radio stations and would even be posted on YouTube.

From the board of the association, we thought that it was a very good opportunity for a greater diffusion of our beloved book... and we accepted. The only one who could combine work to attend the recording was this server who, neither short nor lazy, showed up in Seville for it. I have to give special thanks to our friends Rita and Víctor, for hosting me at their house the night of the program and also for accompanying me to the Gelves studios.

The program was very enjoyable: the friendly and warm treatment during the two hours that I was there made me feel very comfortable and calm at the time of the interview itself, in which I tried to explain myself to the best of my ability and knowledge.

It was a very positive and enriching experience that I hope can be repeated in the future. I encourage all readers of _The Urantia Book_ to take the step of going to these types of programs, both on radio and television, if they ever have the opportunity. We can all “push”, thus helping to spread the teachings of the fifth revelation.

Finally, I want to send a very big thank you to our dear sister Josefina from Seville... Her memory will always remain with us. She was the one who, as so many times in her life, “pushed” and pulled the strings at her disposal so that this interview could take place. She on her own “approached” the director of the program and convinced him to interview us. She was the architect and, as if she somehow wanted to make sure the interview was done, she died the next morning... when the job was done.

Dear Josefina: I only spoke to you three times in this life, but it was enough to see that you were a very special lady and with a lot of “duendi”, as they say in your land.

IT'S GOING FOR YOU!

The Hotel Osuna is located in one of the busiest business areas of the Spanish capital, as it is close to the Juan Carlos I fairgrounds and the Barajas Airport, just 10 minutes from the center of Madrid.

Communications are excellent, regardless of the way you travel: the Chamartín and Atocha railway stations are 15 and 25 minutes away respectively; as well as the Canillejas metro (line 5-green), located 1 km away; and, for greater comfort, both to go to the airport and to IFEMA, the hotel offers you a free minibus service.

For more information about the hotel, you can visit the page http://www.hotelosuna.es The reception of attendees will take place on Friday, May 31 from 4:00 p.m., and we will say goodbye on Sunday, June 2 after lunch .

On this occasion, the title of the meeting is:

**«THE URANTIA BOOK: WHY? AS? THAT?".**

The price for one person sharing a double room with another, for the two nights, plus full board for the two days, and the proportional part of the room rental, would be 136 euros.

For a single person (although the room will be double because there are no singles), the price would be a total of 191 euros.

For people who only stay for lunch or dinner, the price of the menu is 16 euros (lunch or dinner). Regardless of this, the registration fee is 15 euros.

For those who bring a child under 12 years of age, without an extra bed, an additional 50 euros will be charged for the two days.

For people over 12 years old with an extra bed, called a triple room, it would be 88 euros more for the two days, following the previous criteria, only accommodation and PC.

For example, for a couple with their child older than 12 years, it would cost 360 euros for the three of them both nights = 136+136+88. In the event that he is under 12 years of age, the total would be 322=136+136+50.
