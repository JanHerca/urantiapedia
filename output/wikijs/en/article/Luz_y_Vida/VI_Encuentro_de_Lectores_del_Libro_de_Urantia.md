The Urantia Association of Spain has the pleasure of inviting you to the VI National Meeting of Readers of the _Urantia Book_, which will be held **from April 28 to May 1, 2006** at:

Saint John of the Cross Monastery
Alameda de la Fuencisla s/n
Segovia
Telephone: 921431961

This year we want to go one step further and discuss how to study, live and make the teachings known. For each of these aspects, a brief introduction will be made, followed by a free debate on the matter.

We remind you that _The Urantia Book_ is not related to the new age, nor to ufology, nor to parapsychology, nor to any type of established religious institution.

The reception will take place on Friday, April 28 from 5 in the afternoon, and we will say goodbye on Monday, May 1 after breakfast.

The total price per person in full board is **€93** in a double room and **€105** in a single room. This price includes lunch on Friday, as long as it is confirmed in advance. The registration period will end on **April 1, 2006**. If you wish to attend, you must deposit 50% of the total amount (approximate) as soon as possible (places are limited) into the current account of **La Caixa 21002348-67-0100530840**; the rest will be paid upon arrival. Please send us a copy of the entry, together with the registration form below, to the address of the AUE indicated below:
