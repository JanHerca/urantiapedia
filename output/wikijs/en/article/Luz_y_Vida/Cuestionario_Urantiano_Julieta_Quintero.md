My name is Julieta Quintero, I am Venezuelan and I have a 26-year-old son.

## 1. How did you come across _The Urantia Book_ and why do you think you found it?

I saw an interview with J.J. Benitez where he was asked if he thought _The Urantia Book_ was a true revelation, and he said yes it was. So I downloaded the PDF and started reading it.

Why did I find it? I want to believe it is part of my Adjuster's plan.

## 2. What was your first impression when reading it?

It was like putting on reality glasses, it impressed me and made me happy at the same time. The impression of knowing that you have before you a titanic and eternal task of growing towards reality and meeting our Father, and the joy of knowing that you have a great universal family that guides you and encourages you from the other side to help you on the eternal path.

## 3. At what point in the reading (document, sentence, etc.) did you accept that _The Urantia Book_ is really what it claims to be?

It was not a point or event; it has been a process of understanding its truths that has led me to accept it and continue understanding.

## 4. How has _The Urantia Book_ changed your life?

Although life is still full of conflict, in my mind there is no longer so much drama. I approach problems with more serenity. I took off my victim costume. I think it has put me on the beginning of the path to maturity.

## 5. Has your faith changed after reading it? If so, in what way?

My faith has been strengthened, because it confirms all the work of spiritual impulse that I felt within me and did not understand.

I knew that we were inhabited by a God, but I did not know his mechanism and much less that he worked as a team with the Spirit of Truth, the Holy Spirit and his seven assistants of the mind. That, apart from that internal team, he is complemented by other beings that work from outside such as angels, intermediate beings, etc., to guide you at all times. And that you only need to wake up, be attentive to your team. A dream team.

## 6. Is there any point (or points) of the revelation that you find difficult to accept?

More than accepting, it is not understanding some things, such as:

-The omniscience of God who sees past, present and future.
-The non-existence of time and space in Paradise.
- Why Jesus had to be killed so cruelly.
- Suffering in general.

But I no longer fight with them, I just ask the Spirit of Truth to help me understand them.

## 7. What is the part that has impressed you most deeply?

- How deeply asleep we humans are in the face of the immensity of the Universal Father, his family and his project.
- May our dear Jesus be the God of a universe and our Creator Father.

## 8. How do you understand “doing the will of the Father”?

For me, doing the Father's will is being attentive to everything that happens inside and outside of me. The Adjuster's plan is underway, everything that happens inside and outside of me is designed for my spiritual growth.

Every time I manage to stop my runaway mental flow and be present to what is happening, I can better respond to His plan, to His will.

I am aware that he wants me to share my inner life with him and he encourages me to do so.

It is also about being clear about what you are, your dual condition. Sometimes your materiality leans more, which leads you to make multiple mistakes, which is okay if you realize it and try to correct them. The documents say that the important thing is what you try to do.

## 9. Have you become conscious of the presence of your Adjuster?

Yes, the Father lives in me. He speaks with a mixture of feeling, peace and certainty.

## 10. Have you tried to put the Master's teachings into practice? What has been the result?

Yes, I try. I dream of having the self-control and faith that Jesus showed here. I don't always succeed, but I don't give up trying.

Always listen to and help others. Practice humor more often, smiling in stressful situations relieves tension.

Results? Most of the time I think I do well. Sometimes things go terribly for me, I suddenly become selfish and lose myself, so my material side still weighs heavily. It's a coming and going.

## 11. Do you think that _The Urantia Book_ has something “mysterious” that makes not everyone decide to read it?

I don't think there's anything mysterious about it that would prevent you from reading it, it's just that the book hasn't gone viral yet. It's new knowledge, and we know it takes time to displace old ideas in people's minds. Aside from that, the sheer size of the paper book is overwhelming for some people.

If a massive marketing campaign is carried out worldwide, with renowned athletes and very famous people, readers would surely multiply, but I understand that this is not the way to go.

What readers do today, dosing information on social networks with study groups, videos, audios, stories, infographics, newsletters, radio, images with quotes from documents, etc., are small winks that are made to people's minds. They aim to attract seekers and give support to what they sense and do not understand inside. It is a small bait to bring them closer to revelation, it goes step by step.

All without forgetting the example that all committed readers must give to their neighbors in their daily lives. I like the phrase: they are helping Jesus, the boss, to wake people up.

## 12. Is there anything else you would like to say regarding _The Urantia Book_?

It is an advantage to study _The Urantia Book_ and at the same time a great responsibility, with yourself and with the Father. It is all or nothing. It is going beyond knowing it, integrating its teachings, believing it, reviewing your mind and behavior daily, conquering yourself. It is knowing that every little thing that happens to you and that you share with God is communion with Him, the religion of personal experience.
