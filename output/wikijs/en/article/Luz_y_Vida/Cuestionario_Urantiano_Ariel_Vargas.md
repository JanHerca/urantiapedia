## 1. How did you come across _The Urantia Book_ and why do you think you found it?

I first came across The Urantia Book through the novels by JJ Benítez and Lucifer's Rebellion. After reading the latter, I was so impressed that I wanted to continue expanding my knowledge.

## 2. What was your first impression when you read it?

From the very beginning, I considered it a true revelation. I had already had an open mind because of *The Lucifer Rebellion*, and upon reading *The Urantia Book*, I was struck by the depth of its content.

## 3. At what point in your reading (document, sentence, etc.) did you accept that _The Urantia Book_ is really what it claims to be?

Since I read _The Lucifer Rebellion_, I was already willing to accept _The Urantia Book_ as a genuine revelation.

## 4. How has _The Urantia Book_ changed your life? 

It has changed me much more than The Trojan Horses, as it made me broaden my perspective and become a more analytical and rational person about life. 

## 5. Has your faith changed after reading this? If so, how?

Yes, my faith has evolved, becoming more analytical and rational over the years. Ironically, The Urantia Book has helped me maintain my faith, but it's also made me more skeptical of pseudoscience and superstitions.

## 6. Are there any points (or points) of the revelation that you find difficult to accept?

Yes, at first I struggled with the part about racial colors. It seemed like a fanciful concept, but later I realized that from a scientific point of view, it could be possible.

## 7. What part has impressed you the most?

Without a doubt, Lucifer's rebellion and all that it entails. I was also impressed by the stories about Paradise and the different celestial personalities that exist.

## 8. How do you understand this “doing the Father’s will”?

For me, doing the Father's will means having trust and faith that everything will turn out well. It means knowing that He accompanies us every day in the process of becoming better people.

## 9. Have you become aware of the presence of your Adjuster?

I'd love to say yes, but I can't say for sure. I think I've felt it at some point, but it seems very hidden. I hope one day to be fully aware of its presence and hear its voice.

## 10. Have you tried putting the Master's teachings into practice? What has been the result?

Yes, I've practiced them since my adolescence. It's not easy because the world we live in doesn't encourage that lifestyle. Sometimes acting like the Master makes us seem naive, but I think that's the real challenge.

## 11. Do you think that The Urantia Book has something “mysterious” about it that makes it difficult for everyone to read?

Yes, I think the book reaches people who can truly connect with the revelation. It's not a book for everyone, but for those who are ready to receive it.

## 12. Is there anything else you would like to say about _The Urantia Book_?

I think it's a great revelation for our times and can illuminate the lives of many people for generations. Although not everyone will accept it in this life, I believe they will eventually find their way to the truth.
