In our ongoing quest to disseminate The Urantia Book and foster interaction among readers, both in Spain and abroad, we are excited to launch the virtual forum "Comanche Territory." This space will be a forum for debate and discussion dedicated to the exchange of ideas related to this wonderful revelation.

The sole purpose of this forum is the growth of all who participate, through the exchange of ideas and opinions on any topic related to **_The Urantia Book_**. By sharing our concerns and reflections, we help others understand certain concepts more deeply. Furthermore, by listening to different perspectives, we avoid laziness or stagnation and stay on the path of personal growth. Expressing ourselves openly is a magnificent way to refine ourselves as the imperfect beings that we are.

The moderators of this space only ask for two essential ingredients: respect and good humor. Both attitudes will be essential for our conversations to flow in an enriching and harmonious manner.

It is our hope that every voice, from the most developed to the most humble, will find expression in this space. Therefore, we ask that comments and opinions be expressed in a manner that is accurate, simple, and easily understandable to all.

Although this forum is primarily dedicated to **_The Urantia Book_**, it does not exclude other interpretations of spirituality or truth. We recognize that all religions, to a greater or lesser extent, contain valuable pearls of wisdom, whether derived from the mental and spiritual efforts of great men of the past or from revelations received over the centuries. Therefore, all opinions expressed with respect and with the intention of contributing are welcome, even if they may initially seem different from our own.

We believe that debate with perspectives that differ from, or even oppose, our own is very healthy. It's a magnificent intellectual, emotional, and spiritual exercise. It allows us to examine our own "inner universe" and unleash the potential of our best thinking.

In a world as plural as ours, only through open and honest dialogue can we find the common ground capable of guiding humanity toward a better future: those transversal and universal values ​​that **_The Urantia Book_** speaks so much about.

We believe this forum will be a valuable space for sharing, learning, and growing together. In a world as diverse as ours, respectful and open dialogue is essential to discovering the universal values ​​that unite us. We look forward to your participation with an open mind and a critical spirit!
