When I accepted the position of Responsible for the study groups in Spain, which was offered to me by the Urantia Association in Spain, I decided first of all to find out about the current situation of the study groups in this country and then create a direct link, through a mailing group, with all the readers who coordinate said groups, so that we can all be in contact and know how many of us are and how each group operates; something that can serve us all.

Next, my work had to be channeled into trying to bring together readers from the different geographical areas of the country, where there is no study group, so that if they wish, they can form one.

The first area in which I got down to work, is the one that, to my surprise, did not have a formal group formed, although there were enough readers; I speak of Seville and its surroundings. The cradle of the birth of the Urantia movement in Spain did not have a group as such, and after the arduous work of translation, which took years, the working group dissipated.

After talking with some and others -some good friends-, and after sending letters and emails to all the contacts we had in the area, we agreed to hold a meeting on November 26 in Camas (Seville).

The objective of the meeting was to create, or rather reactivate, the study group in Seville. We were nine people at the meeting, and in it, after those present expressed their desire to meet regularly to discuss issues of _The Urantia Book_, the foundations for the functioning of the future group were laid, which will meet one Saturday a month.

For those of us who carry the fifth revelation in our _luggage_, on the “pass-through” through this evolutionary and complicated world in which we have had to begin our journey to Paradise, and we feel heartily committed to working for the expansion of Truth It gives us great satisfaction and joy that the study groups are growing, not only in number, but also in quality, and in the case of our brothers in Seville, they have plenty of the latter. As they are also in warmth, sympathy, affection... Thank you for your welcome and I wish you the best in this new beginning of the group, which, I am sure, will be joined by new readers eager to share the teachings of the Book and to get rich with the other reading friends.

The next objective is to create a study group in the Valencia area and surroundings; Let's hope there are enough readers for it.

Mariano Perez
