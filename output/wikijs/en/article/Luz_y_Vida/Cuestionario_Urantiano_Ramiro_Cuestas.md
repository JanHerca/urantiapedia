My name is Ramiro Cuestas, I am 54 years old, I live in the city of Comodoro Rivadavia, in Patagonia, Argentina, married to Andrea, we have two children, Thiago, 22 years old, and Ivo, 19 years old. I am a notary by profession and have been practicing the profession for 29 years in my parents' notary office.

## 1. How did you come across _The Urantia Book_ and why do you think you found it?

I was a practicing Catholic, so much so that I became the master of ceremonies for the bishop of my diocese, based in my city. However, over the years I realized that the relationship with God could not be through rituals such as the Mass, or that one can only access Him through an intermediary such as a priest. In other words, I had come to the conclusion that the Catholic Church did not allow me, through its rules, to evolve spiritually. I remember that, during the year 2019, during a Mass, I was so bored of always hearing the same thing in the sermons that I asked God to help me know what the true faith is. A few years before that episode, and thanks to the fact that I always had an open mind, I had begun to read some books “not authorized by the Catholic Church” that talked about who Jesus was and what he had said and done on our planet, but it was during that year 2019 that I first found J.J.'s _Trojan Horses_. Benítez, and it was finally through this novel that I came to _The Urantia Book_ during the year 2020, in the middle of the COVID pandemic. First I read it in digital format through the Urantia Foundation website, and finally, I contacted a reader of the book, Luis Miguel Morales Urrea, who provided me with a printed book. Today I participate in the Urantia Madrid and Descifrando Urantia reading groups, and I also collaborate in the Facebook group “Descifrando Urantia”, run by our dear friend Javier Martínez.

## 2. What was your first impression when reading it?

Well, fascination, I think is the word. I had such a need to find the TRUTH, that it was like discovering a new world, and I couldn't believe that _The Urantia Book_ gave me the answers to the questions that the Catholic Church couldn't, didn't want to, or didn't know how to answer.

## 3. At what point in the reading (document, sentence, etc.) did you accept that _The Urantia Book_ is really what it claims to be?

When I started reading the book I decided that I would not make an evaluation of it until I had finished it, and I think that method worked well, because otherwise I would have stopped reading it at the Prologue. So, when I finished reading it, I did not doubt what the book is, a new revelation of the truth to us human beings, since it gave me the answer, as I said before, to many questions about God, the universe, the life of Jesus on our planet, why we are here and what happens after our time in this world.

## 4. How has _The Urantia Book_ changed your life? Has your faith changed after reading it? If so, how?

_The Urantia Book_ changed my life, my faith, my religion, because, as I often say, for approximately 50 years of my life I was a slave from a spiritual point of view, a slave to an evolutionary or standardized religion that prevents you from developing a personal and intimate relationship with God. The fifth revelation broke those chains and allowed me to search for God within myself and thus begin that long journey that begins on our planet and ends on the Island of Paradise, residence of the originator of everything and everyone, the Universal Father.

## 5. Is there any point (or points) of the revelation that you find difficult to accept?

There are no points in the book that I find difficult to accept, the book is totally coherent from the Prologue to the end.

## 6. What is the part that has impressed you most deeply?

The book as a whole has made a great impression on me, but perhaps a little more so is everything related to the self-bestowal of our Creator Father Michael on our planet, from the reasons for this to the true sayings and deeds of Jesus.

## 7. How do you understand “doing the will of the Father”?

To do the will of the Father is to recognize him as the first Source and Center of all that is created, that is, as our Father and, as a consequence of this, to recognize the spiritual brotherhood of men; and all this is achieved through Faith and Love.

## 8. Have you become conscious of the presence of your Adjuster?

Since I went to catechism in the Catholic Church, I have been aware that there was something or someone inside me that guided me, or at least tried to do so, but I did not know who it was or that it was the classic guardian angel or custodian. _The Urantia Book_ gave a name to that someone, the Thought Adjuster, and I have no doubt that it was he who guided me from that day when I asked myself what the true faith is, until I found the fifth revelation.

## 9. Have you tried to put the Master's teachings into practice? What has been the result?

I believe I have tried to put the Master's teachings into practice since my time as a practicing Catholic, the difference is that I went from doing it mechanically or out of obligation to doing it consciously out of love for my neighbor.

## 10. Do you think that _The Urantia Book_ has something “mysterious” that makes not everyone decide to read it?

I don't think there's anything mysterious about _The Urantia Book_. People who don't decide to read it, in my opinion, don't do it because they're afraid of the unknown, afraid that their beliefs or convictions or the mental and spiritual structures of a lifetime will fall apart or not make sense.

## 11. Is there anything else you would like to say regarding _The Urantia Book_?

As a final reflection, I would like to tell my brother readers of _The Urantia Book_ that we must be patient regarding the dissemination and transmission of this fifth revelation, and I say this because some believe that we should be more aggressive and even confront the standardized religions (especially the Christian ones) to impose the religion of Jesus, the true religion. This is a long-term race, like a marathon that will probably last a thousand years, as the revelators said, and the fruits will surely not be seen by our generation. We are simply sowers and others will later reap the harvest.
