Dear readers:

I already gave you enough of the tostón with the presentation of Valencia. Well, now I want to inform you of the results, how it went.

The host readers, especially Guillermo, who was somewhat responsible, welcomed us affably, so that at no time did we feel like strangers. The FNAC was fantastic; They have high-quality facilities where it was very easy and pleasant for us to make the presentation.

Some 20 regular people attended and there were about seven or eight satellites, yes, the kind that come and go. Ismael, our secretary, who made the presentation, gave it a personal approach that attracted the interest of those present and paved the way for the question and answer session. This part was quite dynamic and sometimes deep, due to the topics that the readers addressed, among them, always the eternal recurring theme of reincarnation.

The readers of Valencia were invited to form a study group. Our group manager, Mariano, also informed them in detail about this, and Guillermo was in charge of formalizing it. We hope that the Valencia study group will be born very soon, that is our main objective.

The conclusion is that the need for the existence and development of study groups is absolute. The readers from Valencia who attended have read the book and have digested it from solitude and that is not entirely good. We found very bitter positions on some issues discussed. The perspective, the clarifications, the doubts, the point of view of the other is necessary so that our understanding and growth is real and that is offered by the study groups. In addition, by being part of the UAI study group network, we all benefit from the progress in methodology, material and perspectives worldwide, with which the enrichment is great.

I am attaching three photos corresponding to three moments, the presentation by Ismael, a moment of the question and answer phase with Mariano microphone in hand, Ismael and the one who writes to you and a third of the moment of leisure and relationship after the presentation where All of us who went there (Ismael, Mª Dolores, Jaime, Paco, Guillermo, Mariano and Olga) are together with Guillermo.

It has been a fascinating experience. Always contacting, interacting, relating with other human beings, with other people is the greatest opportunity that this life offers. If we are also going to take them and offer them good, beautiful and true things... well imagine!

A hug to all.

## Presentation at the “Art i Sentiment” Fair in L'Aldea (Tarragona)

by Ismael Gracia

On Saturday, October 20 at 6:30 pm, the Urantia Association of Spain gave a presentation talk on the Urantia Book in the assembly hall of the town hall of l'Aldea (Tarragona). This act was part of the “Art i Sentiment” (Art and Feeling) fair that took place throughout the weekend, a fair in which a multitude of events were organized: conferences, workshops, exchange markets, etc.

The president of the association, Carmelo Martínez, was in charge of directing the talk helped by Eduardo Altuzarra. A server also appeared to accompany them, and several UB readers also came by their own initiative: Paco, Lluis, Andrés, Jordi, Santiago and David.

The welcome and kindness with which we were received were exquisite, both by Fernando Rico (the organizer of the fair) and by the Councilor for Culture of the town hall... and, of course, by the nearly fifty people who, in front of our Perplexed, they came to listen to the talk despite the heavy rains that occurred that day.

The talk lasted about an hour, in which Carmelo described much of the information and data contained in _The Urantia Book_. Afterwards, the always exciting round of questions and answers began, in which many attendees participated. Carmelo almost always, helped at specific moments by one of those who attended, responded to all the concerns expressed... but with great regret, time finally limited us and we had to end the talk because we accidentally “ate” part of the session of yoga that came right after us.

It was a gratifying experience based on the radiant countenance that illuminated the faces of all of us who filled that room that afternoon. This talk, together with the previous ones in Valencia and Barcelona, reaffirm the importance of organizing presentations of this type in all corners of the peninsular geography... we will apply ourselves to it from the AUE board with enthusiasm.

Finally, after saying goodbye to the hosts, we took David to the train and the rest of us went to have dinner in Tortosa, where one of us tasted one of the typical dishes of the area three times: the “arrós a banda”... But that It's “another story.”

EUA Secretary
