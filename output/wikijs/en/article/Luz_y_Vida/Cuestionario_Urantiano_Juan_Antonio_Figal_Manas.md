## 1. How did you come across _The Urantia Book_ and why do you think you found it?

I don't remember how I arrived, but I do know that it was a very difficult time when I began to realize that my marriage was broken and that my life seemed to be too. During an emotional crisis I had, I spoke to the Father and asked him to help me to be able to find him and that I would do everything as far as my abilities allowed me. And shortly afterward he arrived and I continue with his studies until now.

## 2. What was your first impression when reading it?

I was stunned because many of the concepts I read and much of the information that was given once crossed my mind, but of course, since I had preconceived notions from my Catholic upbringing, I thought that those ideas were the result of my psyche; apparently not. I was so happy when I saw that those ideas were real. As I continued reading, everything began to make sense to me and I began to understand spiritual realities and the universe in a very different way. The first reading was wonderful and a gift from heaven.

## 3. At what point in the reading (document, sentence, etc.) did you accept that _The Urantia Book_ is really what it claims to be?

I don't know exactly when I knew it was a revelation. There were certain doubts, understandably, but what I do know is that as I read it, my level of consciousness changed and I began to see things differently. From the beginning, it was clear to me that there was something there and that the information given was very coherent and very much in line with my way of thinking. Today, it's not that I believe in the information given, it's that I know it.

## 4. How has _The Urantia Book_ changed your life? Has your faith changed after reading it? If so, how?

Well, it's simple: I do the will of the Father and I am in harmony with the beloved Creator of our local universe while facing the difficulties of life. I love you very much and I am happy to be able to carry you all day long in my heart, even though as an imperfect being I don't do many things well.

## 5. Is there any point (or points) of the revelation that you find difficult to accept?

There's one part I've never understood, like when a child or baby dies. The revelators tell us that the infant is repersonalized when one or both parents are also repersonalized, but if neither parent survives the death, what happens to the infant? I'm sure there will be a plan B, because I don't believe that the infant will be forgotten. This part has given me many, many headaches.

## 6. What is the part that has impressed you most deeply?

The entire book has impressed me from the first page to the last. Even the cover has impressed me.

## 7. How do you understand “doing the will of the Father”?

For me, doing the will of the invisible Father is learning to get into the habit of being in communication with him, sharing the good and not so good moments with him, and taking him with you in all the moments of your life. For me, my older Father and my father-brother Miguel are not incompatible with my life. When a ship is given a mast and a sail, it does not give the ship more weight but more speed. It is an honor and a pleasure to serve my parents.

## 8. Have you become conscious of the presence of your Adjuster?

I prefer to think no than yes, but I do feel comfort and guidance at certain moments in my life.

## 9. Have you tried to put the Master's teachings into practice? What has been the result?

Every day I try to lead a life similar to my beloved Master, but I am so far from doing what he did that I feel ridiculous. I am very far from following his teachings, but very close to him because I love him.

## 10. Do you think that _The Urantia Book_ has something “mysterious” that makes not everyone decide to read it?

Well, at this point in my study, I am clear that not everyone is capable of understanding it, and I do not mean to say that those of us who are gifted are super-gifted, far from it. There are simply some people who do better through other spiritual paths and other people through others. In the end, the right path is the one you identify with the most, but although it is wrong to say so, _The Urantia Book_ is not for everyone.

## 11. Is there anything else you would like to say regarding _The Urantia Book_?

I feel very proud that from above they have placed their trust in me regarding the endless teachings that the book has, they have trusted me and now I trust them.
