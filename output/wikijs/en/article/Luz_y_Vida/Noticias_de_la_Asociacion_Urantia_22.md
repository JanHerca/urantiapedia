Our warmest welcome to the members of the Zaragoza study group!

## Meeting of Readers of The Urantia Book in Spain

The Urantia Association of Spain has the pleasure to invite you to the XV Meeting of readers of _The Urantia Book_ in Spain, which will be held **from April 28 to May 1**, 2016 in Bilbao, at the Conde Duque Hotel (Paseo Campo Volantín, 22).

On this occasion, the theme of the Meeting is “The way home: the ascension race.”

The prices of the types of rooms available (include stay, full board and proportional part of use of the lounge) are:

1. Price per person in a double room: **250 €**, VAT included.
2. Price per person in a single room: **310 €**, VAT included.

Additional prices for other services:

1. Lunch and dinner for attendees who are not staying (the same as those who are staying): €33 per day.
2. Children's menu: €11 per day.
3. Extra bed for child €11 per day (we would need confirmation as soon as possible as the hotel has limited availability).

If it is necessary to offer special menus (vegetarians, vegans, celiacs, medically prescribed diets, in short, special diets), we are also looking at it with the hotel. Those participants who are going to bring children and/or have some kind of special diet can let us know so that, when the time comes, we can negotiate with the hotel.

### Stay scholarships

The Association, despite the precariousness of its economy, through the Board, is making efforts to offer two stay scholarships (does not include travel) for two really needy people who really want to attend. Scholarships must be requested from the Association stating their situation, information that will be strictly confidential.

We remind you that the Association's email address is urantiaesp@gmail.com.

The registration deadline for the Meeting is **March 31, 2016** for reasons of logistics and occupation. It is very important that you fill out your registration and pay for your stay before that date in order to meet the reservation and payment deadlines with the hotel.
