I was born in Leganés (Spain), in 1992, but at a very young age my parents moved to Navalmoral de la Sierra, a town in the province of Ávila where I fell in love with the landscape and the Alberche Valley. I am happily married and enjoy my two daughters.

At the age of 25, I opened my YouTube channel, [Mundo Azul](https://bit.ly/4hGME7a), to dedicate myself to my great passion, which is dissemination and research.

Now I am developing my writing side further, having written, so far, three books.
<br style="clear:both;"/>

## 1. How did you come across _The Urantia Book_ and why do you think you found it?

I came to him at a very particular moment in my life, in a difficult and crucial stage of loss and search for sincere answers. Maybe that's why I found him. I don't believe in chance, so I'm convinced that God did the rest.

## 2. What was your first impression when reading it?

I was attracted by its dynamism and its difficulty at the same time in transmuting concepts into “human” similarities, especially with regard to God. It was a challenge and a discovery to understand the information without getting lost in my own reflections.

## 3. At what point in the reading (document, sentence, etc.) did you accept that _The Urantia Book_ is really what it claims to be?

You could say that at the time I put into practice many of the things he says, especially regarding the Thought Adjuster.

## 4. How has _The Urantia Book_ changed your life?

In the way a caterpillar discovers that its destiny is to be a butterfly.

## 5. Has your faith changed after reading it? If so, in what way?

More than _faith_, I would like to say _trust_. Despite the emotional ups and downs of a normal human being, I believe that the trust I now have in God is inextinguishable.

## 6. Is there any point (or points) of the revelation that you find difficult to accept?

Perhaps, total annihilation.

## 7. What is the part that has impressed you most deeply?

Without a doubt, the revelation that God dwells within us as a little light, the Thought Adjuster, is, to me, the most important thing about _The Urantia Book_.

## 8. How do you understand “doing the will of the Father”?

I think it's a very personal decision. Mature, for lack of a better word. The full and sincere attitude of trusting without reservation. Indiana Jones' leap of faith in the Holy Grail movie.

## 9. Have you become conscious of the presence of your Adjuster?

Yes, and I say this not only with conviction, but also with gratitude. I cannot conceive of life without the presence that I feel inside me, without the intimate and personal relationship that I maintain with him every day.

## 10. Have you tried to put the Master's teachings into practice? What has been the result?

I think I'm more of a follower of what my Adjuster tells me. I guess it's all the same thing at the end of the day. Jesus was a God-man, a Creator Son; I have God within me.

## 11. Do you think that _The Urantia Book_ has something “mysterious” that makes not everyone decide to read it?

I guess as much as the person who decides to do it. It depends on where you are, your prejudices, what you are looking for, your beliefs, etc.

## 12. Is there anything else you would like to say regarding _The Urantia Book_?

I always encourage you to read it, I've already lost count.
