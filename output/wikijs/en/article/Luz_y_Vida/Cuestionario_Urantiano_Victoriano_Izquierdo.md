I am Victoriano Izquierdo Ramírez. I live in Seville and I am retired. My wife and I have three children and four grandchildren and have been reading The Urantia Book since 1992.

## 1. How did you get to “The Urantia Book” and why do you think you found it?

Since I was little I have had a great love of reading. It caught my attention that one day, discussing my interest in reading the Gospels with the Religion teacher, he tried to dissuade me because they did not want the faithful to read these texts if they were not commented on by the Church, because they could misrepresent their meaning.

Over the years I bought a MAS ALLA magazine dedicated to the life of Jesus. There was a very interesting article written by Antonio Moya that made reference to _The Urantia Book_. At that time the publication of the first _Trojan Horse_ was a publishing boom. A co-worker who was very impressed with his reading lent it to me to read. It didn't make such an impression on me because I knew the Gospels, something unusual then. My wife casually contacted Josefina, who lived in our neighborhood and held meetings for _The Urantia Book_ readers at her home. We still did not have the book translated into Spanish. When Esteban brought them from the United States, we realized that the translation was horrible.

## 2. What was your first impression when reading it?

The first impression was very impressive because its agenda was very broad and dealt with new and unknown concepts for most of the seekers, who had read esoteric, spiritual and self-help books that were very much in vogue at that time.

## 3. At what point in the reading (document, sentence, etc.) did you accept that “The Urantia Book” is really what it claims to be?

I was very struck by the concept of inevitabilities, which I had not read in any other book. Also that of the Adjuster, which was similar to the divine spark that he knew from other texts.

## 4. How has “The Urantia Book” changed your life?

The group of readers from Seville fought for a new Spanish translation of the book. it took us 8 years of meetings every Sunday. But previously we had to convince the Foundation of the need to do it. And then fight with the misunderstanding of Latin American readers. It was a very strong commitment and nothing now recognized by most readers.

## 5. Has the faith you had after reading it changed? If so, in what way?

The faith is basically the same as in the Christian religions: knowing and loving God, and considering our companions on the planet as brothers. But in such a competitive world, such a commitment is very difficult and unacceptable.

## 6. Are there any points (or points) of the revelation that you find difficult to accept?

The issue of races and their evolution for me is out of the current concepts of anthropology. In any case, _The Urantia Book_ warns that it cannot advance us concepts not reached at the time of its revelation.

## 7. What is the part that has most deeply impressed you?

What impresses me the most is the life of Jesus, which reveals his private life from birth to death.

## 8. How do you understand “doing the will of the Father”?

The will of the Father is that we know him and accept his divine plan, which consists of universal brotherhood and that we accept to enter the ascending race until we reach Him.

## 9. Have you become aware of the presence of your Adjuster?

The Spirit blows and inspires us in multiple ways and at various times, but generally we lack the sensitivity to identify it.

## 10. Have you tried to put the Master's teachings into practice? What was the result?

Through family and work life one tries to put his mark, sometimes more successfully than others. The result is irregular.

## 11. Do you think that “The Urantia Book” has something “mysterious” that makes not everyone decide to read it?

To read _The Urantia Book_ you must have a lot of motivation. As many texts say, when the student is ready, the teacher appears. And one way or another, the book falls into your hands.

## 12. Is there anything else you would like to say regarding “The Urantia Book”?

It has been a wonderful experience and it has led me to get to know and integrate with the brotherhood of book readers.
