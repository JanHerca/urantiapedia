## Meeting with Mallorca readers

On the weekend of November 1 and 2, the president of the association, Olga López, and the vice-president, Eduardo Altuzarra, attended a meeting with readers from the island at the “La Llave” bookstore in Palma de Mallorca, where they informed them about the existence of our association and the current situation of the Urantia movement in our country and in the rest of the world.

This event was attended by about 35 people, who had the opportunity to ask questions about _The Urantia Book_ and the most important projects of the association, such as the financing of the European edition and the organization of the conference of Urantia Association International next year. .

From here, we want to thank the owners of the “La llave” bookstore for offering us one of their rooms, and Cati Covas for her effort and dedication to the dissemination of the teachings of UB on that beautiful island. It was precisely she who proposed that there be a meeting of the Urantia Association of Spain with the Mallorcan readers. Given the success of the call, we are considering repeating the experience in other Spanish cities.

## The Urantia Book (European Edition)

Finally in November we managed to raise most of the money needed to finance the printing of the European edition of the _Urantia Book_. From here, and on behalf of the association's board of directors, we want to thank all the readers who have contributed to making this project a reality. As soon as we have more information about the arrival of this edition in our country, we will communicate it in a timely manner.
