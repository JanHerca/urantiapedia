**International Conference Organizing Committee**

## Conference attendance price

Finally we have closed the price per person for attendance at the International Conference. The price is **400 euros**, and it includes accommodation and full board for the four days that the conference lasts (from April 17 from dinner to lunch on the 21st), as well as the visit to the Picasso Museum in Malaga (or the visit that is decided instead)

Soon we will indicate what the payment methods and the reservation deadline will be.

## Assistance Sponsorship Request

A part of the price of attendance at the international conference will go to the attendance sponsorship fund. This fund will be used to totally or partially cover the attendance of those people who meet any of the following criteria:

- People whose economic situation would require them to make an exaggerated effort to attend the conference.
- Preferably people who have not attended previous international conferences.
- Preferably Spanish-speaking people, thus taking advantage of the first conference in a Spanish-speaking country to further promote the movement in this language.
- Preferably European or African people, thus taking advantage of the conference to further promote the movement in these continents.
- People noted for their career in disseminating the teachings of the Book or for special leadership or impact on their environment.
- People in a special social situation that makes it difficult for them to have fluid international contact and for whom the conference would mean contact with leaders and other members of this movement, which could, after the conference, promote and/or activate the movement in your local environment.
- People who are going to present any of the talks.

Those who want to request a total or partial aid to attend the conference, either for themselves or for other readers they know, should send a request to the email address urantiaesp@gmail.com, or to our postal address (Apdo. de correos 272, 08800 Vilanova i la Geltrú) briefly indicating their involvement in the dissemination of UB teachings and their personal circumstances. Requests will be reviewed by a small committee of people and will be handled with total discretion.

We will also answer any question or comment on the subject from the association's email address, urantiaesp@gmail.com, as well as from the post office box.
