**Carmelo:** We've all heard of alchemy at one time or another, that pseudoscience of some crazy people who thought they were capable of transmuting metals. Or at least this is the general idea that we have been given. I have read various things on alchemy, especially by Fulcanelli, but also by other followers such as Nicolás Flamel or El Cosmopolita. When you read these books, you are struck by their seemingly clear but nonetheless incomprehensible style. A key is needed to understand them, and this key does not seem to be available to most. For a time, alchemy was the paradigm of science with conscience, that is, of knowledge guided by morality. Alchemists speak of God as the origin of their transmutation capacity and as the authentic maker of the wonders they describe; they are mere instruments. His motto is to know, act and SHUT UP. Alchemy not only aims to transmute metals, but also to obtain the elixir of life that cures all diseases and ensures a long life. And deep down the true objective of alchemy is the transmutation of the adept himself. Apparently the alchemical manipulations reveal knowledge to the adept and put him in a position of observation that totally transforms his personality. The origin of alchemy is placed in ancient Egypt and in the figure of Hermes Trimegistro. After reading the Book I think otherwise, as I will say later.

My opinion is that alchemy contains really powerful knowledge that teaches how to manipulate matter and life, that knows how to manipulate the revolutions of matter and how to control the primordial forces that ultimately are capable of building and holding atoms together. . And you probably also know how to handle living plasma while it's alive. I am also of the opinion that this knowledge dates back to the Lucifer rebellion, and comes from the rebellious elements of the Caligastia 100. I explain. Members of Prince Caligastia's corporeal team were citizens of Jerusem. They had thus passed through the entire regime of the mansion worlds. It is to be hoped that they would have learned quite a bit of “celestial science,” among other things that knowledge which we on Urantia today know as alchemy. Of course, they knew better than to transmit them to the inhabitants of this planet. But when they joined the rebellion all these limitations were blown up, possibly used to make life easier for themselves and passed on to their children, the Nodites. Of course, with the indication of a very restricted use and dissemination because they were potentially very dangerous. They had rebelled, but they still had an “autonomist” plan of action for the planet and some rules of action. Over time this knowledge ended up in the hands of the Egyptian priests who guarded it and transmitted it with all kinds of precautions. And they continued through the wise Arabs to the Middle Ages and to the present day.

A rather long preamble; Excuse me if it has been heavy for you, but I found it necessary to continue with my exposition.

Someone once wondered if alchemy was some extraterrestrial superscience. For me the answer is a resounding yes. Reading the Book I have found without looking for it, that is, I have stumbled upon many clues about this science, especially in the descriptions of the different phases of energy-matter, and in the description of the formation of nebulae. Something that I call the alchemy of creation and that fascinates me. The texts that I am going to use are in paper 42, especially in [UB 42:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_8) and [UB 42:3.3-12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p3_3) , in paper 57 up to and including page 655 and in the Prologue, [UB 0:6.4-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p6_4).

Precisely in this last text, he classifies physical energy into three large groups:

1. The force, which is characterized by not responding even to the gravity of Paradise.

2. The energy, which responds to the gravity of Paradise but not to the linear one.

3. The power, which responds to both gravities (the one of Paradise and the linear one)

In reality the force is a pre-reality, a passive potential, a spatial manifestation of the Unqualified Absolute. Reality actually starts in energy.

The passage from pre-reality to reality is brought about by the mere presence of the Primary Master Organizers of the Force. Afterwards, it is their active manipulations that mature the energy from the potent stage to that of gravity and then give way to their secondary colleagues, the Deputy Master Organizers. This gravity energy is the precursor of power, and when it appears, the Master Organizers give way to the Power Directors (this is not currently the case in the outer universes).

A first characteristic to highlight: The evolution of matter-energy is not “spontaneous”; requires the intervention of the mind. Somewhere in the Book, I don't remember where now, it is said that the spirit through the mind is the one who controls matter.

There are ten different manifestations of power as described in [UB 42:3.3-12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p3_3). I want to focus on six that are, in my opinion, the different stages of construction of the building of matter (the others seem to me to be special or degraded states):

- Ultimatonic matter, the very first manifestation of matter, the unique and essential component of all particles.
- Subelectronic matter; apparently between the ultimatons and the (today called) fundamental particles there is another prior state.
- Electronic matter, the fundamental particles of our physics.
- Subatomic matter, groups of particles that are not yet atoms or parts of them.
- Atomic matter, the well-known atoms.
- Molecular matter, actually the matter we know and that makes up the things we see and touch.

There is a clear progression between these states from ultimaton to commonly known matter. And there are undoubtedly physical laws that regulate and control all these evolutions and combinations and that the creative minds, such as those of the Master Organizers or the Power Directors, know and use. That which I have called “celestial science” before. Let's go the Alchemy of Creation. And the gigantic atanor in which these fantastic operations are carried out is the nebula. In the nebula, the Master Organizers and the Directors of Power and other adjuncts act first to produce the matter that will be the base of action of the Creator Sons par excellence, the Michaels, who will culminate the previous works by integrating the nebula into a basic creative unit as the local universe, and stabilizing and organizing all matter in circuits and groups that will serve as the ground and as a constructive component of the material support of people's lives.

We know that the nebula has four stages. Each of them can be assigned a certain form and external manifestation and, I believe, a certain manifestation of matter-energy.

Apparently there are certain conditions in space (empty?) that indicate that it is ready to initiate the phenomena of materialization. When this occurs it is sent to a team of primary master organizers. Until then, in space there was only spatial power, the “nothing”, the manifestation of the Unconditioned Absolute. The mere presence of the master organizers transforms the spatial power into a primordial force in its potent energy phase. I suppose that it is necessary that the conditions of the space that I mentioned before exist; otherwise, the presence of the organizers has no effect. This is how the nebula is born in its circular and gaseous primary stage. Next, and still in its primary stage, the organizers act to transform the powerful energy into gravity energy and the assistant organizers transform it into power, in ultimatons. The nebula is becoming detectable “_through gravity estimates made on adjacent creations_” although it remains invisible. As gravity and powerful energy and ultimatons appear out of the “nothingness” of space power, the nebula assumes “gigantic proportions” and the disturbances it produces in adjacent creations necessitate the support of additional physical controllers to help the centers of power. There comes a moment of the “peak of the energy mobilization period”, the mass of the nebula is maximum. It now has the shape of a flattened sphere and is beginning to be visible.

And with visibility begins the secondary stage of the nebula that takes the spiral form. Now “gravity and other influences” begin their work of converting “space gases into organized matter.” Arms and knots are formed, there is an escape of gases and finally the first sun is born. Ultimaton, subelectronic, electronic and subatomic matter will have been created, but probably not yet atomic matter and certainly not molecular matter. The core of the nebula begins to contract and condense, but at the periphery there begins to be open space and the cooling is sufficient for the first planets to be born and matter to complete its creative cycle: the finished atoms have appeared and molecular matter already exists.

We now move on to the tertiary and quaternary stages, the construction stages, the stages of massive formation of suns and planets, and their dispersal. Matter has completed its creative cycle; Now it is about grouping it forming space bodies, suns and their planets, some prepared to sustain life.

By the way, the paragraphs [UB 57:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p4_6) and [UB 57:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p4_7) are somewhat of a mystery to me. Does the terminal disintegration of a nebula cause the destruction of already inhabited planets? We know that if this happens, all the inhabitants are dematerialized and transferred by seraphic transport to another planet where they are rematerialized.

As I said at the beginning, this is a part of the creative process that fascinates me. As with the rest of creative activities, the Father has delegated it to some of his children. And one day it seems that it will also delegate it to us in the worlds of outer space. I suppose that in this delegation there will be parts that have to do with material creation itself, and for that we will have to know “celestial science”, we will have to be alchemists. Is this what the followers discover and amaze them to extremes that are difficult to imagine? What totally transforms them?

They say that the adepts are capable of working true wonders; It does not surprise me if they have the key to the manipulation of the structure of atoms and of matter in general. But in any case they will be small, I'm sure, compared to what they are capable of out there, and what we will certainly be capable of. But it is such a powerful and deadly tool that it cannot be left in the hands of children like us; we will have to advance a lot in our ascent towards the spirit, in our way towards the Father, in our education in love, before we can use it for the good of others, for the good of all creation.

It has been long for me; I hope it's not heavy, but I apologize if it has been like that. The intention was to convey to you the point of view that I have obtained in the Book on matter and its creation. I hope I have achieved it and that it is useful to you.

Of course this is a study group, the objective is also to provoke you to tell your opinions about it.

**Santi:** I'm sorry for my lack of knowledge about it, but I understood that alchemy was the precursor of modern chemistry; that is to say, he understood that it was something superseded in terms of knowledge and “theories”, that is to say that it was something past and not currently active.

I suppose that part of the help that is required for the stabilization of the areas where something is materializing may be to “shield” harmful effects for the surrounding areas already inhabited. About the energies that operate outside of Paradise, I am giving you this diagram to try to locate them, I don't know if it will be enlightening or even more convoluted (see Fig.1 at the end)

**Carmelo:** Yes, Santi, according to my little knowledge, alchemy is currently active, has always been (since the rebellion?) and possibly will continue to be until the age of light and life.

And it has nothing to do with Chemistry; True alchemy, of course. There is another fair alchemy made by hucksters, and still another by serious people that some call archimists, since they are basically chemists. This archymy is the precursor of the current chemical science, since it was dedicated to doing all kinds of experiments, reactions and combinations looking for (by the wrong way) the philosopher's stone. From this multitude of experiments came some substances that are ultimately useful; I seem to remember that sulfuric acid is one of them.

But I insist: this is not true alchemy, which has other methods, although it is also experimental, contrary to what some people think. It's not a philosophy, it's a science, in my opinion.

It is a pity that he is so bad at drawing, because they help a lot to understand the matter.

**Eduardo:** These issues of matter, energy, power, force, etc. They have always been great for me, but with this extensive exposition with great detail, I am going to do the same, read those documents to see if I am a little closer to reality and I can contribute something to the subject. Thanks, Carmelo.

Santi, these schemes help the subject a lot, I consider that they bring light to the different energies and that you know that I also had an idea similar to Santi's about alchemy in my days as a “metaphysician”.

**Santi:** I understand that their activities must be more or less hidden, is there anything that is known about them?

**Carmelo:** Very little is known about them, and what is known is misleading. For example, their names (rather pseudonyms) are known, but their persons are not. His books can be read, but they are indecipherable, despite how apparently clear they seem. The true adepts hide, they do not make public demonstrations, they do not use science for their personal benefit, except, perhaps, the elixir of life that keeps them alive for centuries to continue with a work unknown to us, or so it is said. .

Alchemy is transmitted from mouth to ear. Each teacher chooses his disciples, and the first thing that is required of them is a high level of morality and conscience. If you are outside, you don't really know anything; You can only suspect what Alchemy is really about, since even the transmutation thing is a screen to confuse.

I understand it; Imagine that the princes of the Middle Ages or the politicians of today came to know that someone is capable of easily turning something of little value into gold, or that they master matter and its transformations in such a way as to make incredibly lethal weapons. That someone would have enormous power in their hands and for power they kill and do all kinds of atrocities (on Urantia today).

I began to suspect that there was something big under alchemy when I read, long ago, “The Return of the Sorcerers” (Le Matin des Magiciens) by Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier, in which the latter describes that a supposed alchemist gave him He recounted in the middle of the Second World War, when an impressive deployment of means (including vacuum machines) was still needed to produce a small nuclear reaction, how enormous amounts of energy could be produced “simply by arranging certain materials in a certain geometric configuration”. .

When years later Bergier learned what a nuclear reactor was like, he immediately identified what the supposed alchemist had described to him.

This alleged alchemist is believed to have been someone known to Fulcanelli, the most brilliant adept of modern times. He has written, among others, two essential books for anyone interested in delving deeper into Alchemy, “The Mystery of the Cathedrals” and “The Philosopher's Dwellings.” But there are other more classic ones like Philalèthe and his “l'Entrée Ouverte au Palais Fermé du Roi”, or the Cosmopolitan with his “New Chemical Light” that he subtitled “to serve as an clarification of the three principles of Nature”, or the Count of Saint Germain and his “Very Holy Trinosophy”, or also Limojon de Saint-Didier with his “Hermetic Triumph”. But the most suggestive is a book of figures (I think it is anonymous) called “Mutus Liber”. They are all decoys and they are all deceitful; they are full of traps; the clearer a text appears to you, the more confusing it really is. This is how they defend themselves from evil and can continue to attract the attention of possible future followers. Science is only for those who are prepared to receive it and make good use of it; apparently they know how to find such people. The rest of us are left with two candles.

**Eduardo:** After having read the corresponding documents, I have to say that my ideas are somewhat clearer. When I read this last comment from Carmelo, a lot about Saint Germain and his metaphysics came to my mind. When I began to read the UB, I placed all these “ascended masters”, alchemists and metaphysicians, between the intermediate beings and the components of the Reserve Corps of Destiny, something like a human being with certain “powers”. I “parked” that in the dreams of my illusions, but currently I wonder if that will not be so “unreal”. I don't know, time and your contributions will clarify my ideas more.
