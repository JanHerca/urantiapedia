**Carmelo:** Santi insists that not everyone survives, however his argument doesn't reinforce that idea, at least I haven't seen it.

For my part, I insist that <ins>theoretically</ins> not all survive, but in practice I think so, perhaps with few exceptions throughout all ages. I speak of all those who sooner or later receive Adjusters. Another very interesting question is knowing how many receive Adjusters and why. And I'm talking about that survival that is waking up on the mansion worlds after this first life. It is a different matter to know how many ultimately survive, how many refuse to survive on any of the mansion worlds, once repersonalized into morontia bodies, and once they make contact with the morontia mote and knowledge circuits of those worlds.

Santi has implied, in the thread about how many survive, that the soul is not born with the arrival of Adjuster. I, however, think so, that he was born right at that moment.

The first moral decision brings the Adjuster precisely to collect that universal value forever, and the spiritualization of the self begins. This spiritualization of the self gives birth to the soul. I copy two paragraphs from 111:2.

> “_This supernal transaction of evolving the immortal soul is made possible because the mortal mind is first personal and second is in contact with superanimal realities; it possesses a supermaterial endowment of cosmic ministry which insures the evolution of a moral nature capable of making moral decisions, thereby effecting a bona fide creative contact with the associated spiritual ministries and with the indwelling Thought Adjuster._” (<a id="a56_444"></a>[UB 111:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p2_9))

> “_The inevitable result of such a contactual spiritualization of the human mind is the gradual birth of a soul, the joint offspring of an adjutant mind dominated by a human will that craves to know God, working in liaison with the spiritual forces of the universe which are under the overcontrol of an actual fragment of the very God of all creation—the Mystery Monitor. And thus does the material and mortal reality of the self transcend the temporal limitations of the physical-life machine and attain a new expression and a new identification in the evolving vehicle for selfhood continuity, the morontia and immortal soul._” (<a id="a58_632"></a>[UB 111:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p2_10))

What do you think.

**Santiago:** I insist on abounding in the idea that the process of acceptance of some deity by the human being is critical for their future survival, and that is why I believe that the Gods have put “all the meat on the grill” . Being aware that our degree of racial development has not reached the expected level, they have allowed themselves to alter the normal course of the comings of the Descending Sons, granting us first the Bestower, in order to dispose of the Spirit of Truth, and thus dispose as much as possible. before more spiritual “help”, since our carnal receptacle is not “sensitive” enough to spiritual realities.

Carmelo, if the individual does not “crave” to know God, does not have the will or desire to know Him, the Adjuster cannot initiate the birth of the Soul. It takes two to agree: The Adjuster (who always wants to, of course) and the mortal, who doesn't need to know about these transactions, just NEEDS TO CRAVE GOD. If you don't crave it, there's nothing to do. If you do not crave it, you will not survive, because the soul will not have been able to originate despite all the efforts of the mind and the Adjuster.

As the paragraph itself indicates, the arrival of the Adjuster begins the spiritualization of the individual, and the soul will originate later. Forgive my insistence, but I can't help but interpret it that way.

And I insist again, one of the clearest passages is <a id="a68_52"></a>[UB 112:3.2-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p3_2), when they describe the three types of death (of personality survival). What sense would it make to provide us with information about theoretical possibilities, that if they never come to pass Would they cease to be possibilities?

If they occurred “anecdotally” sometime from very late to late, I think it would not be relevant to include it in a revelation, when on the other hand we are increasingly convinced that EVERYTHING that is written has a good reason. Don't you think?

**Olga:** Dear friends: I have the same impression as Santi. If the revelation talks so insistently about “real” death, it is because it is a real possibility, not something merely hypothetical that has never happened. Taking into account that all revelation is incomplete (something that they also take care of telling us more than once), why include something that has never happened? I don't think they wanted to scare us, they just want to give us all the evidence so that we understand that, if we don't want to survive, there is no divine help that can make us push forward.

I think that deep down we resist conceiving that someone could wish not to continue the ascension career (and thus cease to exist), because it is something that seems inconceivable to us and to those who are “of the same chord”. But not everyone has the same desire to know what will happen on the other side, not everyone looks up and wonders what else might be out there, not everyone wants to work on survival, not everyone is about to escape. of the chains of matter.

**Carmelo:** No, if I don't say that such spiritual death (that of the soul) is not a “real possibility”; I am not saying that it has never happened, or that it occurs rarely. What I am saying is that it seems difficult for it to happen in the first transition, the one that corresponds to the repersonalization after the first life, that of the flesh. Of course, and I said so in a previous message, it will certainly happen on the mansion worlds; there will be those who do not want to continue.

For these things I always make a comparison. Imagine a family; the father has a business and would like his children to take part in the business. But he does not impose anything on them, he wants them to decide freely. First, I don't think I expect a decision before they arrive at, say, 18 or 20 years of age.

He does not expect that when they are one year old they will understand what he is asking of them, nor that they will be able to decide for themselves. At one year old, when they are barely standing, they do not have enough maturity or information to make a decision. What idea can an Earth baby have of what a company is?

This is our case; we are still babies We do not have sufficient maturity or information to accept our Father's plan; not even to understand it enough. If the human father does not wait for a decision until a certain age and knows that his children are not capable of deciding until then, why do we think that our Father, infinitely wise, will act otherwise? He will let us grow; he will let us learn what reality is like, and only then will he wait for a final and final decision. The decision must be made by all of us, but I believe that in the first life it is too early, at least for the vast majority. There may always be someone who grows faster and gives time in the first life to approach a certain spiritual maturity. They can make the decision, but, at our age, they are a huge minority.

It is true that we know people like the ones Olga describes, with no apparent interest in the afterlife, with no desire to “work for survival”, attached to the “chains of matter”, but this does not mean that they have decided not to be part of it. their Father's business, they are simply babies spiritually speaking. They will have the opportunity to wake up, and then they will have to decide what they want, they will have to show how they really are. Now it simply happens that they do not feel the challenge, due to different circumstances. And the Father will judge them mercifully; yes, there is the law of compensation; they will have to make up for lost time on the mansion worlds.

Santi, you have made me doubt. I have to reflect more on the matter of the soul. I'll tell you.

**Antonio:** I found this paragraph in Doc.5, last paragraph of point 5. I don't know if it will clarify the debate.

> “_The ability of mortal parents to procreate is not predicated on their educational, cultural, social, or economic status. <ins>***The union of the parental factors***</ins> under natural conditions is quite sufficient to initiate offspring. A human mind discerning right and wrong and possessing the capacity to worship God, in union with a divine Adjuster, ***<ins>is all that is required in that mortal to initiate and foster the production of his immortal soul</ins>*** of survival qualities if such a spirit-endowed individual seeks God and sincerely desires to become like him, honestly elects to do the will of the Father in heaven._” (<a id="a90_645"></a>[UB 5:5.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p5_14))

Carmelo, what you expose seems perfectly reasonable to me, and I am with you.

I do not know what the truth is and, from what I see in the debate, it does not seem that it can be clearly deduced from the text of the UB. But you have put your finger on the sore with your example. Which, by the way, is very similar to what Jesus used when he tried to teach the apostles the relationship between man and God: He resorted to giving examples of ordinary family life. The merit is yours. And of course, it clarifies the matter enormously.

**Carmelo:** The appointment that Antonio has found is very opportune. But it doesn't seem as clear to me as a first reading suggests. The condition that is put at the end of the paragraph breaks the comparison with the “completely sufficient” of the “union of parental factors”. Something more is needed than the union of a human mind and an Adjuster.

All (normal) human minds have the capacity to worship God; that is precisely what makes them human and not animals. All (normal) human minds discern good and evil after a certain age, precisely the age at which they receive the Adjuster. And, since Pentecost, all (normal) human minds receive an Adjuster.

But although it seems that these two conditions are going to be sufficient to give birth and foster the immortal soul, in fact they are not: it is also necessary to wish “sincerely to become like him”, to choose “honestly to do the will of the Father who is in heaven”. ». Or as Santi said, quoting the paragraph from my previous message, “longing to know God.”

Being able to discern good and evil, is choosing to do good in itself doing the will of the Father? If the answer is yes, the soul is born with the arrival of the Adjuster prompted by the first moral decision (the first choice of good versus evil) of the human mind. Right now I see no reason why it shouldn't. But here was my doubt. Let's see what you think.

**Santiago:** Right, right, there is a conditional...

Bearing in mind that we are in a part of the universe in which causality occurs, I do not see the possibility that the first moral decision, which is the one that “opens the door for the Adjuster” so that it can be installed in the individual, and therefore is prior to upon its arrival, it can originate the soul, because at that moment of the moral decision, the Adjuster is not there, therefore it cannot originate the soul.

Forgive my stubbornness, but I keep saying that moral decisions that have to do with good/evil, the first thing they do is open the door to the Adjuster, and do we all understand that it is not enough to “be good” once in life? life? Undoubtedly, if we do good we will be doing the will of the Father, but remember that there are situations in which good is clear, but others perhaps not so much; We are all capable of understanding that there may be situations in which we will be doing with our best will what we understand to be good, but due to our short-sightedness “we will be screwing up for good”, obviously in this case our intention may be to the most noble (and this will make us grow spiritually), but we will not be doing the will of the Father.

That is why He was so great, and HE DID NOT SUBJECT OUR FUTURE EXISTENCE, to the fact of doing Good or Evil, because He knows of our Ignorance with capital letters, and it would be too much; that is why he settled for something simpler: we only have to want to get closer to HIM (and everything that this entails); obviously if we are good, and also we are not wrong, all this will make us grow and mature our soul, to face the final decision.

But, wow! we have to cover that minimum, which I repeat I do not see as related to Good/Evil.

**Antonio:** Here is another paragraph, this time from the life of Jesus (Doc. 133:6):

> “_The divine spirit arrives simultaneously with the first moral activity of the human mind, and that is the occasion of the birth of the soul._” (<a id="a116_148"></a>[UB 133:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p6_5))

Regarding the paragraph I sent earlier, here is the original in English:

> «_A human mind discerning right and wrong and possessing the capacity to worship God, in union with a divine Adjuster, is all that is required in that mortal to initiate and <ins>foster the production of his immortal soul</ins> of survival qualities <ins>if such a spirit-endowed individual seeks God and sincerely desires to become like him</ins>, honestly elects to do the will of the Father in heaven_.”

It could be that the condition of “seeking God” is needed to <ins>FOSTER</ins> the development of the soul, not its birth.

**Carmelo:** Well, this is definitive, the intermediate creatures tell us very clearly: the soul is born on the occasion of the arrival of the divine spirit, a fact that is simultaneous with the first moral activity of the human mind. And a little further up they assure us that “_Moral choice and spiritual achievement, the ability to know God and the impulse to be like him, are the characteristics of the soul_”. I take moral choice and spiritual achievement to be equal to the ability to know God and the drive to be like him. And that answers my question: to choose what is good is to do the will of our Father, which clears up my doubts.

**Santiago:** Antonio perfectly expresses what we are discussing, except that I would also underline where it says:

> “_. . .if such a spirit-endowed individual seeks God and sincerely desires to become like him, honestly elects to do the will of the Father in heaven._” (<a id="a128_156"></a>[UB 5:5.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p5_14))

Carmelo, it is true that doing good is doing the will of the Father, as long as that good is GOOD. The problem is that sometimes what seems good to us is not so much...

Many were confused in the rebellion of Lucifer, because following the instructions of their superiors they believed that they were doing good, but evidently they were not doing the will of the Father.

**Eduardo:** My friends, I am of the opinion of Santi, Olga and all those who think that if they mention certain things about the survival of mortal beings in this world, there must be something true. I believe that we have all reread many pages of the UB to better understand and interpret what the developers want to tell us about this topic and I think that we can comment on some things with a certain degree of security, except for the personal nuances that each one of us applies. , because we must keep in mind that the comments will always be relative.

It is my wish to let you know that all of us are interpreting and analyzing this issue because we think, feel and desire as fervent believers in God and in all of his existence. In other words, we have already decided to do the will of the Father. We have chosen. We are already engaged in trying to be ascending mortals. We are magnifying our soul. I have come to think that since I began to “look for him” I began to create my soul, not before, knowing today that I have an Adjuster.

Well, as Carmelo explains, every father wants the best for his son and throughout life tries to get him to do what, from that father's perspective, is the best for that son. If, to do so, he tries to guide him along the best paths and it happens that the boy does not want to follow them and chooses others that lead him wrong, the father becomes patient and advises him on other new paths to walk. The creature insists on directing its steps through different and different ones, resulting in another mistake at the end of the road. The father decides to stop advising him and in the end he observes how that son is living the wrong paths. If the father is wise, he will understand that despite having tried to guide his son on the right path, the son with his free will has decided to do what he wanted.

When Carmelo tells us that we are babies, I think he does it from a paternalistic perspective, we are not really babies. We could have been babies, today we are all mature and **of course most of us have been told that God exists** and I have commented more times that in the inner forum of each human being God has “manifested” more than once and I want to to think that even in the most “bad” mind. I'm going to be “bad and incisive.” In this fucking world, luckily, the majority of the more than 6,000,000,000 human beings have been given a mind and an Adjuster, they have been told about God, they have been told over and over again that you have to be good, just, tolerant, sympathetic etc Today, when communication is instantaneous worldwide, they are repeating the same thing over and over again from different “mottos”: Be good, get along, God sees everything! There are many human beings that we should imitate, because I consider that they are a good example of life since they alone represent kindness, tolerance and understanding, but hardly anyone pays attention to them. It is better and more beautiful to dedicate yourself to materialism and hide your head under the wing.

But at this point I am sincerely convinced that a great majority of them are trying, each one in their own way, to do the will of the Father. In a very slow and personal way, all right. Hitting “blind sticks”, all right. Suffering many vicissitudes, agreed. But they sure are trying. Hence, it is clear to me that some will survive and others will not, without the need to reach the mansion worlds. We started looking and found, we believed it and we have started working. We have all given a small “turn” to our way of thinking, feeling and wishing. We've all compromised a bit. Currently the best thing we can do is try to be an example of life and speak clearly and openly about the existence of God and how well we are doing, trying to do his will and with this it is possible that we can help someone to survive.

So make no mistake, let's try to interpret things as the UB tells us. Our parents “make” us, then they endow us with a mind and later the Adjuster comes and from that moment **“to grow which is two days”**. Some choose to grow and others to stay small. The Father helps everyone equally, but each one uses their free will and each one does as they do. In the end, some have their reward and others simply do not. Of course, all this must be interpreted from a relative perspective. It's like trying to see the glass half full or half empty. With what I am exposing I do not want to say that what Carmelo and Antonio agree is not true. No, don't get me wrong, it's the other way of looking at the glass.

**Santiago:** Dear friends, continuing with the fable:

The father wants his children to continue with his business, but obviously the business is complex and they are still young to understand it and be able to be part of it, but the children have to do something in their lives, earn it in some way, and the father excited to give him the chance to do so. But obviously the decision of the children can take time; No problem, the father is patient, and since he doesn't want to influence their decisions, he chooses not to directly ask them to be part of the business until they get older and understand a little more about everything and so they can make informed decisions themselves. if they really want to continue or quit.

To do this, it provides that each one can do with their youth whatever they want, it does not force them to choose any specific “career”, but it makes it a condition for them to have the option to be part of their business world, that they take some university study. It doesn't matter if it's medium or higher, and it doesn't matter what orientation it is, only that he considers that in order to open a gap in his company, he understands that this is the minimum effort that his children have to make in order not to be part of it permanently. of the business, but to be able to get to know him...

And knowing this, there is someone who, even hearing how interesting others tell him it is to work in his father's business, even he himself would like to, but it is not that he is not capable of studying and getting some studies, it is that he is lazy , start studying, and since he lacks nothing, he says that anyway, he is his father and despite everything he will not leave him out. Yes, you already know what the requirement is, but a father is a father, and it will be bad if he doesn't make an exception in the end.

How would the father manage to meet his own rule and not harm the rest of the brothers? (That is, be fair, merciful, good and not play favoritism to people)

I would like to know your opinion...

**Carmelo:** About how many survive we have already debated enough and each one has taken the position that seemed most true to them. I don't want to resume that debate, but I do want to clarify why he considered that we are babies.

Every personality has some characteristics; No two are the same. And every personality, which comes from the Deity Absolute, has certain capacities for relating to other personalities and acting on the inanimate, which comes from the Unqualified Absolute. Evolution consists, in my opinion, in being more similar to the Father, in having more knowledge of Reality and Divinity, and more ability to act on that Reality; in updating the potentials of the Universal Absolute. We are co-creators and therefore we act on creation to make it more perfect.

Let us now compare our current capacity for action (and our current mind) with those of a Melchizedek, with those of Gabriel or with those of Michael himself, not to mention the Ancients of Days or the finaliters. Let's compare the capacities of our mind, the knowledge we have of Reality or what we know of the Father, with those of these characters. Ridiculous, no. However we are destined for everything, we have no limits to our powers. If we compare this potential of ours, probably infinite, with what we are now and what we know now, we will undoubtedly conclude, I do, that we are very very very very at the beginning, that we are mere finaliter babies, let alone postfinaliter ( already overcome the limitations of time and space) And then there is still more.

These are my reasons.

**Eduardo:** Carmelo, I'm not talking about not being like a baby in our upward career. Of course we are newborns in our ascension, I don't even doubt that. I say that now, in our world during the period we live in, some may be spiritually babies due to specific circumstances and they will give them another chance, but most should already be spiritually adults in this time that they have to live and the that he does not want to be an adult, it is because he has positioned himself on the most comfortable rung of the ladder that he has to climb. It is not because he has not been able to know God and do his will, but because in a more or less deliberate way he does not want to know anything about those “stories” and I do not justify them as babies. I interpret that you do justify them, that's where my “shots” go, am I wrong?

**Santiago:** After all this exchange of ideas, I think that we must extract “the moral”, which is not to conclude whether or not we will all continue in the next stage, which, as Eduardo says, seems to be a glass half. In any case, in this particular case, in a matter of 50 or 60 years we will see it... I think.

The important thing (I speak from my point of view) is that since I believe that not all of us will/will survive, and since I know that from above they only push, they don't give in, I think that my particular moral is to try to make those around me understand ever raise the possibility of the existence of that Father, in whom we all believe, and knowing that example is the best school, I have to work hard, to file down everything that I think I have to touch up, to have a good surgery esthetic...

**Antonio:** Once again I agree with what Carmelo develops, more in accordance with his opinion than with the others (all respectable).

I believe that here we are all babies, without exception (remember that the UB says that the soul is really BORN in the morontia world, that it is here in embryo). I do not agree with Eduardo that there is an ADULT here, spiritually speaking. People who are not interested in these matters are justified because they have had to live in a world that “goes too far”: very far from the state of light and life, with a disordered society, and with a mortal nature that is not sensitive to the spirit. What the hell do you want those people to do? Follow the current of society, morally, economically and religiously speaking. They do not look for “something else” because their inner demands do not lead them there. His interests are others. They are not “peguijeras” like us, who are always putting our finger somewhere. They are not worried about the “beyond”, it is something they prefer not to think about. Who even knows if there is “beyond”? In short, they take care of their daily interests, and the spiritual issue is something that belongs to the priests, to those of the church. It is your profession.

ALL UB readers that you know, from all countries, are restless people, who do not settle for what society has bequeathed to us. Other people do NOT have that level of inner demand. People have (we have) VERY DIFFERENT levels of consciousness, and it is our levels of consciousness that lead us to search or not to search. As someone has said, since the personality is UNIQUE, no other personality can judge it. People who live “comfortably” are on that rung because that is as far as their level of consciousness goes. And they do not give for more. The rest are our opinions... seen from our point of view (but not from theirs)

In short, the Gods take good note of our place of birth (circumstances, environment, inheritance, etc.), and they will be merciful. So I don't think there is any spiritual adult here. Sadler Jr. says in his writings that when we are finaliters we will be spiritual adults. I think he's right. Not before then.

**Eduardo:** Well, in any case, tipping the balance to one side or the other is not going to make reality change. I have proposed to survive and I will survive, but I am also going to try to “drag” everyone I can with me, even if to do so I have to put some “fear” into the body.

Well, I think that at this point in the study, because for me things have been somewhat better “furnished” than before, I think that it has not been clear to us that there is a possibility that some mortals may not survive. Nor have we been able to discern who survives on the assumption that some do and others do not. In conclusion, I know more things but I am not very sure if I am right, therefore I suggest to myself to have patience to live with the commitment to try to do the will of the Father whenever possible. I'll expect results, as Santi says within... who knows how long.

**Antonio:** Dear Eduardo, dear friends: Reading your conclusions I was telling myself that with UB it is always like this: Since most things are beyond our power of demonstration, we can only speculate, imagine , give an opinion, but we cannot prove it. Consequently, all this helps us to exercise our mental faculties, perhaps to learn something more, but the definitive conclusions almost always remain in “tables”. So, once again, “give faith”, there is no other solution.

**Carmelo:** Regarding the birth of the soul, it is already clear to me when it is born. Antonio's quote of the interlude phrase is clear. We can discuss more about good and evil and their relationship with the Father's will. For my part, I believe that we should distinguish between the good and our perception of it. Doing good is following the will of the Father, even though sometimes we believe that we are doing it and it is not. As for the Caligastia rebels, they may have started out thinking they were doing good, but eventually they knew better. They will not be judged for being wrong, but for not rectifying when they learned of their mistake. Mercy has been offered to all; We will see if they finally accept it or not.

Eduardo, I don't justify them either; he who knows and does not want, has no justification. What I am saying is that we do not know, we cannot even imagine, the greatness and immensity of the Father's plan. How to judge the lazy baby who is unable to assess the objective and benefits of his father's company? How to condemn him because his ignorance discourages him from being diligent? We can suspect that its nature is like this, and that if that is confirmed, it is useless; but until we confirm it irrefutably, we cannot make the decision.

Antonio has already answered you about spiritual adulthood, and I agree with him. On this planet we are not even close to spiritual maturity; As I have already said, some may go further, but most do not. And none, neither one nor the other, have passed/we have passed the most tender spiritual infancy. We will reach maturity when we reach finalitaries.

Put to conclude something, I will say that we, the readers of the UB, know something more, and therefore we have more obligations and less justifications. Let's keep it in mind.

**Santiago:** Although it seems that I am straying from the thread of this discussion, I am not. And regarding these considerations that we are putting on the table, I have two questions, to which I would like to know your answer:

Could a person today on our Urantia, who remains outside of any approach to the existence of God, sin?

You could delve into what the phrase that appears on p. 382, the last paragraph:

> “_... The spirit of life of Christ Jesus has freed us from the law of animal life and from the temptations of evil and sin_”.

What does that mean of liberation from the law of animal life, if even though we are confused by our peculiar situation, we will already solve it in the next stage?

**Carmelo:** Can an atheist sin? Yes. Remember the difference between error, sin, and iniquity. To sin, you have to be aware of doing wrong. Not aware of the existence of God, but aware of the evil nature of our actions.

To interpret the phrase that Santi quotes, I have read the context from which it is extracted, section 7 of paper 34. It speaks of original animal nature and that to rise above it we have the help of the moral support of a society well ordered that the Planetary Prince provides us and of a superior physical nature more in consonance with the spiritual aspirations that the injection of Adamic blood provides us.

There is also talk of the misfortune of Urantia, which is practically lacking in both aids, which results in intense conflicts between the flesh (selfishness) and the spirit (delivery to others, doing the will of the Father).

But this problem has been alleviated by Jesus of Nazareth, who showed us the way: enthusiastic dedication to doing the will of the Father who is in heaven. The law of animal life is the egoism of following the dictates of the flesh, the desires for self-satisfaction in all aspects that animal meat presents us, going above others for this. We would have more facilities to free ourselves from this slavery of the flesh if Calisgastia and Adam had fulfilled their mission.

But we have the Spirit of Truth, the spirit of life of Christ Jesus who has freed us (if we want) from the law of animal living, has shown us the path of this liberation. The following paragraph that Santi quotes is clear:

> “_Those God-knowing men and women who have been born of the Spirit experience no more conflict with their mortal natures than do the inhabitants of the most normal of worlds, planets which have never been tainted with sin nor touched by rebellion. Faith sons work on intellectual levels and live on spiritual planes far above the conflicts produced by unrestrained or unnatural physical desires. The normal urges of animal beings and the natural appetites and impulses of the physical nature are not in conflict with even the highest spiritual attainment except in the minds of ignorant, mistaught, or unfortunately overconscientious persons._” (<a id="a214_648"></a>[UB 34:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p7_7))

The question now is: if we have the message of Jesus, is there an excuse for claiming ignorance? And I answer the Galician, do we all really have the message of Jesus?

All my reasoning throughout this thread is based on the ignorance that is the result of our condition as immature babies and also of our special situation on a special Urantia. If we knew more, perhaps some would choose not to continue, and that choice would be valid. Or to add another nuance, we Urantians know less than humans from other normal planets who receive information directly from their friends elsewhere. We have to rise with more effort and we can be more benevolent with those who do not; and this is not unfair, it is not unfair mercy, it is mercy and justice. Perhaps some Urantians who here seem not to want to know anything, placed on a normal planet, would react differently, or perhaps not. This doubt is the problem.

**Andrés:** I still think like my friend Carmelo. On this plane of existence, in my opinion, I don't think we can make that survival decision.

Reading your opinions, another way of thinking comes to mind that we may not “catch” in reading that “bill”, as Antonio says. In my opinion, I believe that God does not do things or move energies for nothing, everything contains meaning or utility for Him. Suppose that by creating all kinds of beings, celestial and evolutionary, each one is assigned a function, a purpose , some will be the “construction engineers”, but others will be in charge of carrying out the simplest tasks, such as planting the seeds, for example. That is to say that we all have a place in the creation of the universe, that is why I think that nothing is lost, that the one who does not want to continue as a builder, because the path may be very difficult for him, because perhaps he prefers to plant flowers the worlds.

That is why I think that God has nothing to spare or lacks, and with time and a cane we will see how even with Lucifer he makes sure that created energy is not lost along the way.
