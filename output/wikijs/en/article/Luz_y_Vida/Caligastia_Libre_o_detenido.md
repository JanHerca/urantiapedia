## Raphael

Dear friends: in the Urantia meeting that we celebrate monthly in Madrid, a doubt arose about the current condition of freedom or prison of Prince Caligastia. The person who exposed the issue affirmed that Caligastia was currently detained or imprisoned. Another person in attendance affirmed, on the contrary, that Caligastia was free.

Having expressed these conflicting statements, we wanted to make sure of what the current situation in Caligastia was. And, among other less emphatic paragraphs, we find the following regarding its current state of authority:

> **The Prince of Urantia** went into darkness at the time of the Lucifer rebellion, thus precipitating the long confusion of the planet. He **was subsequently deprived of sovereign authority** by the co-ordinate action of the constellation rulers and other universe authorities. He shared the inevitable vicissitudes of isolated Urantia down to the time of Adam’s sojourn on the planet and contributed something to the miscarriage of the plan to uplift the mortal races through the infusion of the lifeblood of the new violet race—the descendants of Adam and Eve. (<a id="a44_566"></a>[UB 66:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p8_4))

> The power of the fallen Prince to disturb human affairs was enormously curtailed by the mortal incarnation of Machiventa Melchizedek in the days of Abraham; and subsequently, during the life of Michael in the flesh, **this traitorous Prince was finally shorn of all authority on Urantia**. (<a id="a46_293"></a>[UB 66:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p8_5))

In the two preceding paragraphs and perhaps in others that I have not brought here it seems to be made clear that Caligastia is completely deprived or stripped of all authority. But this was not the question we were debating, but whether he is free or detained.

<figure id="Figure_1" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV34/05.jpg">
</figure>

And in this regard, we have found the three paragraphs that follow, in which contrary things seem to be affirmed. Are these:

> The last act of Michael before leaving Urantia was to offer mercy to Caligastia and Daligastia, but they spurned his tender proffer. Caligastia, **your apostate Planetary Prince, is still free on Urantia to prosecute his nefarious designs**, but he has absolutely no power to enter the minds of men, neither can he draw near to their souls to tempt or corrupt them unless they really desire to be cursed with his wicked presence. (<a id="a56_433"></a>[UB 53:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p8_6))

> The rebellion has ended on Jerusem. It ends on the fallen worlds as fast as divine Sons arrive. We believe that all rebels who will ever accept mercy have done so. We await the flashing broadcast that will deprive these traitors of personality existence. We anticipate the verdict of Uversa will be announced by the executionary broadcast which will effect the annihilation of **these interned rebels**. Then will you look for their places, but they shall not be found. “And they who know you among the worlds will be astonished at you; you have been a terror, but never shall you be any more.” And thus shall all of these unworthy traitors “become as though they had not been.” All await the Uversa decree. (<a id="a58_711"></a>[UB 53:9.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p9_7))

> Another problem somewhat difficult of explanation in the constellation of Norlatiadek pertains to **the reasons for permitting Lucifer, Satan, and the fallen princes to work mischief so long before being apprehended**, interned, and adjudicated. (<a id="a60_249"></a>[UB 54:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p4_1))

The first of these three paragraphs seems to indicate that it is **free**. Perhaps he does not say so exhaustively because he adds “*free to continue his infamous intentions*”, although he continues to say that he has no power to penetrate...

The second of these paragraphs states “**these interned rebels**”, and although in the paragraph itself it mentions “*all the rebels who have wanted to accept mercy have already done so*”, however, examining several preceding paragraphs, which I have not brought to this writing, but that you can examine, it is not perfectly clear to which rebels he is referring, if only the arch-rebels (who are supposed to be Lucifer and Satan mentioned in those paragraphs) or all the rebels who did not want to accept mercy.

Finally, from the third of these paragraphs it could be deduced that Caligastia, as the fallen prince that he is, would be detained or interned, running the same fate as the rest of the princes.

Well, as I tell you, after looking in some detail, we have not been able to reach a clear conclusion on the matter. For this reason, I raise the issue in this endearing forum so that if you think it's okay, you can address it and convey your conclusions to me.

## Anthony

I believe (I have always believed) that Caligastia is still free around here, roaming this world. But without any power to annoy us.

> _Caligastia, your apostate Planetary Prince, ***is still free*** on Urantia to prosecute his nefarious designs,_ (<a id="a74_116"></a>[UB 53:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p8_6))

This paragraph does NOT indicate that he has been detained, as does, for example, this other paragraph related to Satan:

> _Satan is now unqualifiedly ***detained*** on the Jerusem prison worlds._ (<a id="a78_77"></a>[UB 53:9.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p9_4))

Therefore, in my understanding, Caligastia is still free here on Earth, but...

> _Caligastia has been comparatively ***impotent*** since the cross of Christ._ (<a id="a82_81"></a>[UB 53:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p8_9))

And that he is still free around here is indirectly demonstrated by this other paragraph:

> _. . .but he has absolutely no power to enter the minds of men, neither can he draw near to their souls to tempt or corrupt them ***unless they really desire to be cursed with his wicked presence***._ (<a id="a86_204"></a>[UB 53:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p8_6))

“Be cursed” at this very moment. His “evil presence” is undoubtedly out there (or here).

## Eduardo

I can say that, when this topic has been dealt with in our group, we have always talked about Caligastia knowing that this personality is not imprisoned in any physical place, so we have always considered that it is free. We believe and think that the others responsible for the rebellion are in custody, but the planetary prince is free and we also know that he is “relatively” limited in his “powers”, hence what Antonio says and the book itself.

When we have talked about this topic, we have always referred to paper 53, I don't know if anywhere else in the book talks about this specific topic, the freedom or non-freedom of the prince, if any of those summoned know something else, they can contribute.

My personal opinion is that this character is the only one that is freely circulating on this planet. What I don't know is if he can come and go from one planet to another or if he is only “confined” on Urantia. I'm also not very clear about the type of “powers” he currently possesses, but it seems that if a human being wants and lets himself, he can manipulate the mind of that subject.

From here each one of us can imagine all kinds of disturbed minds that he sees fit.

I don't know if the world of “Satanism”, of the rituals in which animals are sacrificed, spikes are stuck in dolls, they become zombies, etc. etc it is _breeding ground_ for Caligastia. Nor do I know very well if the groups and sects of different beliefs, such as those believers who abandon everything to follow a / or supposed / or seer who is blatantly deceived or those who follow a “leader” who proclaims to the _four winds_ free love and the “coming” of the new Messiah, is _breeding ground_ for this apostate.

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV34/06.jpg">
</figure>

For me, what I believe is that he is free and with bad intentions and, of course, my way of interpreting the book makes it very clear, he is neither imprisoned nor detained.

## Carmelo

I agree with Antonio that <a id="a110_26"></a>[UB 53:8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p8) and <a id="a110_68"></a>[UB 53:9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p9) are keys to understanding the present state and location of the rebels. I believe that Caligastia is still on Urantia today, as it is said in <a id="a110_248"></a>[UB 53:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p8_6). If you allow me, I copy below my own translation of the sentence in which he says it: “Caligastia, your apostate Planetary Prince, continues to be free on Urantia to carry out his nefarious designs.”

The other rebels are explicitly stated to be being held on the prison worlds, suggesting that Caligastia is not.

The question that fits is why others do and Caligastia not? As Eduardo points out, we do not know if saying that Caligastia is free to continue with his designs means that he can move through the universe from one planet to another, or if rather, he is confined to Urantia. This abnormal situation with respect to the other rebels may be due to the fact that a Planetary Prince, even if he is already dismissed, cannot be removed from his planet for some reason that I cannot understand. I lean towards this opinion.

## Antonio

I believe, I don't know why, that Caligastia is confined to Urantia, and can NOT move through the universe from one planet to another.

And now that you say it, Carmelo (that a Planetary Prince cannot be removed from his planet --and we don't know why), the planetary Adams are indeed released from their functions, and they leave the planet, in the eras of light and of life, but the Princes are then elevated to the rank of Sovereigns. So they do NOT leave the planet, but seem to stay on it “forever” (at least during the present age of the universe. After that, I don't know). I have not read anywhere that they are ever scheduled to leave.

I don't know if that state has anything to do with “they can't be taken off their planet.”

## Rafael

I thank you for your conclusions on the question that I raised. From them I see that you think that Caligastia is free, as indicated in <a id="a126_136"></a>[UB 53:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p8_6)

As for what Antonio says in his first message on this matter, it is clear that there is no paragraph (at least I have not found it and it seems that neither have you) in which it is expressly stated that Caligastia is detained, as indicates regarding Satan and Lucifer.

More or less the same points Eduardo, although specifying that Caligastia is perhaps confined to Urantia, in the sense of not being able to leave the planet, although free to continue operating here, although with limited power that does not allow him to manipulate the mind of people, unless a subject in question wishes and allows it.

Carmelo coincides with Antonio and Eduardo basically. However, Carmelo raises a question: why others do (are detained) and Caligastia not? And, as a solution, he favors what Eduardo already pointed out that **Caligastia** may be **confined on Urantia**, unable to leave the planet. Antonio also adheres to this thesis in his second letter, not finding in the book any reference to the planetary princes leaving the planet, before or after achieving its Sovereignty.

So far what I have found to understand from your contributions. But after them, and after my repeated examination of the book regarding this matter, I have doubts that I believe are reasonable and that, consequently, I transfer to you.

If we examine in detail at the end (16 no less), we see that the words “arrested”, “confined”, “interned” and “imprisoned” are used interchangeably to refer to the same situation (see all paragraphs). In the strict sense, in the Spanish language, each of these words has a different meaning. However, as I say, in the book they have been used generally in the same sense, which can be seen, in a summarized way, as follows:

(<a id="a138_1"></a>[UB 53:9.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p9_4)) Satan is detained in the prison worlds

(<a id="a140_1"></a>[UB 45:1.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_11)) Satan and Lucifer are confined in the prison world

(<a id="a142_1"></a>[UB 53:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p9_2)) Lucifer was arrested and is imprisoned in the number one satellite of the spheres...

(<a id="a144_1"></a>[UB 45:1.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_10)) Seraphim and Cherubim are confined to the worlds of isolation...

(<a id="a146_1"></a>[UB 45:1.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_11)) Lucifer and most of the personalities... are confined to the prison worlds of...

(<a id="a148_1"></a>[UB 51:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p3_7)) Initial midwayers are interned, not indicated where

Members of the adamic group are interned, it is not indicated where

(<a id="a152_1"></a>[UB 53:9.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p9_3)) To all the personalities involved in the rebellion, Miguel requested to intern them

(<a id="a154_1"></a>[UB 53:9.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p9_5)) Rebels interned in prison worlds

(<a id="a156_1"></a>[UB 53:9.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p9_7)) Rebels, internees

(<a id="a158_1"></a>[UB 54:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p4_1)) Lucifer, Satan and the fallen princes were arrested and interned

(<a id="a160_1"></a>[UB 54:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p6_7)) The Satania rebels were interned

(<a id="a162_1"></a>[UB 77:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p7_2)) Secondary intermediates, were admitted

(<a id="a164_1"></a>[UB 77:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p7_3)) The two groups of rebel intermediates are detained

(<a id="a166_1"></a>[UB 77:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p7_8)) Entire group of rebel midwayers, imprisoned

(<a id="a168_1"></a>[UB 113:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p6_10)) Personal and collective guardians, detained

That is to say that, according to The Urantia Book or the Spanish translation that we have, to say that they have been detained or interned or confined or imprisoned is to say the same thing, namely, that they are deprived of liberty. And if you conclude that Caligastia is confined to Urantia, in reality you are using the same word that is used in the book to define the situation of the other rebels, who, as we have said, are deprived of liberty.

However, your first conclusion, in which you all agreed, is that Caligastia is free on Urantia, under the protection of what is said in <a id="a172_136"></a>[UB 53:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p8_6) ***“_Caligastia***, your Planetary Prince apostate, ***remains free*** to pursue his nefarious intentions on Urantia, but he has absolutely no power to penetrate the minds of men nor can he approach their souls to tempt or corrupt them, unless the men really want to be cursed by his evil presence _”.

Do both conclusions seem correct to you despite the fact that they apparently contradict each other? How do you make them compatible? Is it correct to say that Caligastia is detained or confined and that he is also free?

From my point of view, Caligastia is in the same situation as the other rebel princes; that is to say, that under the protection of he is detained and interned. I don't think it could be otherwise. It would not make sense that the Planetary Prince of Urantia had privileges that other princes do not have, and it would make even less sense that he was camping for his respects, while other creatures with less level of responsibility, such as some Angels, Material Sons and Midwayers, are detained or imprisoned or interned. In fact, according to him, even those repentant who accepted mercy are said to be technically held until the courts of Uversa decide the case. What reason would there be for both his bosses and his employees to be detained while he remains free?

But then what happens? Does the book contradict itself? From my point of view, there is no contradiction. Caligastia is detained or confined on Urantia, isolated in a kind of “house arrest” (I owe the quotation marks to Nana, my wife), in which he can open the door if someone knocks, he can hug whoever asks for a hug. , but can neither go out nor call anyone; that is to say, he is stripped of his authority and deprived of liberty, although with the possibility of acting if any man is attracted to his cause, if any man wishes to count on him or “be cursed by his evil presence.” That is the only freedom Caligastia enjoys, I think. Therefore, I understand that it is correct to say, if you like, that you are free, with the deep limitation of not doing what you want, but only responding to the call of whoever voluntarily invokes or requires you, but it is more correct say you are arrested.

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV34/07.jpg">
</figure>

The freedom that Caligastia has to respond to whoever comes to him should be similar to the freedom that other interned rebels may also have, which is the freedom to receive the help that someone could give him in his case, although in fact no one would give it to him. provided to date, as indicated in .

For all these reasons, I conclude that Caligastia is basically in the same conditions as the rest of the detainees, awaiting the decision made by the Ancients of Days of Uversa.

## Antonio

Your conclusions, with the data we have, seem very accurate to me, and I can't think of anything I can add to them. There must be some good reason (which they do not state) for not taking Caligastia off this planet, to the prison worlds of Jerusem. But your argument is most logical: His bosses from above (Lucifer, Satan) and his subordinates from below (angels, etc.) are not going to be detained AND HE IS NOT. I think the expression “house arrest” is most accurate.

## Santiago

I agree with your reasoning Rafa, in fact one of the things that I wonder is how this contact can occur (and if it does occur) between a Man and the deposed Planetary Prince; since you should not have any kind of intermediary to help you.
