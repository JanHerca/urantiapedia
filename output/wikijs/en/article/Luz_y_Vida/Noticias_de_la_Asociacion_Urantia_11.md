## Interview on the radio program “Lights in the dark”

Olga López

In the early hours of Saturday, January 28, in the “Luces en la oscuridad” program of the Punto Radio station, nationwide, we were given an interview lasting about forty minutes, in which we tried to give an overview and the most accurate possible source of _The Urantia Book_ and the information contained in its pages.

Two weeks earlier, the show's production manager contacted us as an association to ask if we would be interested in coming to the station to answer questions related to _The Urantia Book_. Obviously we said yes, because it represents a great opportunity to really make known what the book is about.

The interview had two different parts. In the first part we were asked about the origins of the documents and the way in which they were transmitted. In the second part we gave some brushstrokes on the cosmology described in the book, as well as on topics such as the true identity of Jesus of Nazareth, life after death, levels of reality, etc.

In summary, it was a very interesting experience in which we tried to answer in the clearest, simplest and most schematic way possible about a book as voluminous and rich in content as _The Urantia Book_, in order to attract the attention of the seekers of Truth. that they might be listening on the other end.

The interview can be heard in its entirety on the program's website, more specifically at this link:
