I am from Madrid, but I have been living in Murcia for 3 years now and the truth is that I am delighted with the change. I have gone from living in a big city to a small fishing village. This change has brought me a lot of peace and tranquility.

I am married and have 3 beautiful children, who are my life. I studied social work, although at the moment I am not exercising my profession since I dedicate myself to taking care of my children and doing some work on the radio to collaborate with the dissemination of the teachings that I have acquired by reading _The Urantia Book_, and both things bring me much happiness.

## 1. How did you get to “The Urantia Book” and why do you think you found it?

The truth is that the first time I found a reference to _The Urantia Book_ searching the internet, I didn't pay attention to it. At that moment, skimming a little over what the comments I read said about it, I thought it was a very fantastic book and I didn't stop to investigate further. Years later, when I found myself in a very difficult time in my life, I felt like I was drowning, I was not able to find a way out of the situation I was in and suddenly, one day, the book came to mind. that he had been eyeing for years. I looked it up again and automatically started reading it online

I am convinced that _The Urantia Book_ came to me at the moment when I most needed it.

## 2. What was your first impression when reading it?

At first my first reaction when I started reading the prologue was a little frustrated, since I saw that all this information was beyond me, I did not feel intellectually capable of understanding it. But I didn't give up, I kept moving forward and little by little that feeling of initial frustration dissipated, giving way to a great feeling of astonishment and a certain nervousness when I realized that the book couldn't really have been written by human beings.

## 3. At what point in the reading (document, sentence, etc.) did you accept that “The Urantia Book” is really what it claims to be?

In my case it happened quite quickly; He was reading the first part, when he tells us about the facets of God. I felt inside that everything I was discovering through reading was true and that I had privileged information in my hands that described a reality that I had not even been able to imagine until then.

## 4. How has “The Urantia Book” changed your life?

_The Urantia Book_ has changed my life in so many ways. I lost the fear of death and life too! I see things differently and I am able to face life's difficulties with more strength.

## 5. Has the faith you had after reading it changed? If so, in what way?

It has completely changed! Before discovering _The Urantia Book,_ although I was a spiritually restless person and a seeker, I did not have a clear idea about God, I even doubted his existence. Now I know that the Father exists and that a part of him is in me and in each one of us.

## 6. Are there any points (or points) of the revelation that you find difficult to accept?

The only point of the revelation that I have a little trouble accepting is the one that tells us that animals do not have souls. When you live with animals, you love them so much that it is hard to accept that they will not accompany you after death.

## 7. What is the part that has most deeply impressed you?

Discover the immense creation of which we are part and the perfect plan that exists for our evolution. Knowing that there are so many beings that work to help us evolve as individuals and as a planet, and being aware that a piece of the Father is inside each one of us to help us in all this wonderful adventure.

In short, knowing that we are not alone!

## 8. How do you understand “doing the will of the Father”?

For me, doing the will of the Father is putting myself in his hands, trying to let ourselves be guided in our day-to-day life and in all the decisions we make through our Thought Adjuster. But putting ourselves in their hands and letting the Adjuster be the one who directs our course, not as an act of renouncing to make our own decisions, but because it is our will that his will be done.

## 9. Have you become aware of the presence of your Adjuster?

On a couple of occasions I believe that I have come to perceive the presence of my Adjuster. I have felt it in the form of ideas or some higher thought that I think did not come from me. But it has been barely on a couple of occasions.

## 10. Have you tried to put the Master's teachings into practice? What was the result?

I try every day to put the Master's teachings into practice; being able to apply it to day-to-day practice is not easy and takes time. Little by little putting some of his teachings into practice brings me peace and happiness.

## 11. Do you think that “The Urantia Book” has something “mysterious” that makes not everyone decide to read it?

I don't think there is any mystery in that some people read it and others don't, I think it depends more on the degree of spiritual restlessness and the need to find the truth of each one of us.

## 12. Is there anything else you would like to say regarding “The Urantia Book”?

_The Urantia Book_ for me is a gift that has been given to us, so that we obtain a broader vision of the reality that surrounds us and of which we are a part. It totally changed my way of understanding life, it gave me answers to many of the questions that I had asked myself throughout my life and it has brought me a lot of peace, strength and happiness.
