## Urantia Study Aid Booklet

Hara Davis, an English reader currently residing in Tenerife, is the author of an interesting “Urantia Study Aid” notebook, which summarizes in a very schematic way the most important parts of _The Urantia Book_. Its version in Spanish has been available for a few months, thanks to the work of Carmelo Martínez.

The price of the notebook is 20 euros (which includes cash on delivery shipping costs for Spanish territory). If you are interested, please contact us.

We are preparing our attendance as exhibitors at the EcoAltea fair, which is held on the weekend of October 2 to 3 in the Alicante town of Altea. There we will have for sale not only copies of the book, but also other secondary works.
