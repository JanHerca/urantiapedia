Esteban Cotán lives in Olivares (Seville). He is retired, he worked in the hospitality industry and as an insurance broker. He is a widower and has had four children and ten grandchildren.

## 1. How did you get to “The Urantia Book” and why do you think you found it?

The book found me in the field of ufology through a fellow ufologist, specifically Antonio Moya Cerpa, and it was not the book but photocopies translated from French.

## 2. What was your first impression when reading it?

When I started reading it, I said to myself: I think I have found what I have been looking for all my life, and as I read on, I became convinced of it.

## 3. At what point in the reading (document, sentence, etc.) did you accept that “The Urantia Book” is really what it claims to be?

All the text of the book tells me what it claims to be, since I started reading it; whenever I repeat I get new nuances.

## 4. How has “The Urantia Book” changed your life?

When I was reading it for the second time, I realized that I had changed a lot in my way of proceeding. Today I live more aware of the existence of God and his commandments, which the blue book tells us about.

## 5. Has the faith you had after reading it changed? If so, in what way?

My faith in God is firmer, more robust and I think I know God better than ever and I have all my trust in Him.

## 6. Are there any points (or points) of the revelation that you find difficult to accept?

Yes, that of those born with psychic, mental and other deficiencies. I've been reading this book for forty years trying to understand it and I still can't get it, I hope I get it before I leave.

## 7. What is the part that has most deeply impressed you?

Definitely the fourth part. The teachings of Jesus are undoubtedly those that transform us and make us another person more worthy of Him and of God the Father.

## 8. How do you understand “doing the will of the Father”?

The will of the Father is that we become like Him. For this I ask your help.

## 9. Have you become aware of the presence of your Adjuster?

No, even knowing that it dwells within me. I wish I was aware of it in this world.

## 10. Have you tried to put the Master's teachings into practice? What was the result?

I try to make it so. When I have to do something committed, before doing it I ask myself: how would Jesus do it? and I try to emulate him.

## 11. Do you think that “The Urantia Book” has something “mysterious” that makes not everyone decide to read it?

I don't see anything mysterious about him nor does he have it; What happens is that when some people see two thousand and ninety-seven pages they get overwhelmed. If they pick it up again they will say: why didn't I read it before?

## 12. Is there anything else you would like to say regarding “The Urantia Book”?

I am completely sure that this book will give another turn to this world, because its teachings will have positive effects and it will put us on the path to reach the age of light and life.
