## Meeting of The Blue Club Frankfurt (Germany), April 27 and 28, 2013

On the weekend of April 27 and 28, 2013, the third meeting of the European reader group called “The Blue Club” took place at the Monopol Hotel in Frankfurt. This group has been conceived as a space to share dissemination activities aimed at European societies, in which secularization is the dominant element, in order to promote the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. This meeting was attended by more than twenty readers from 10 different countries: Germany, Austria, Hungary, Spain, Estonia, Finland, Norway, United Kingdom, Sweden and Switzerland. The new president of Urantia Association International, Mike Wood, also attended to support the book dissemination initiatives in Europe.

During the meeting, apart from sharing the dissemination experiences in each country, more details of the next conference of European readers were specified, which will be held in Berlin from August 21 to 24, 2014. The aim is to involve as many readers as possible, to make this conference a success of participation and give it an international dimension. The language barrier is not such when it is the hearts that communicate. Those attending this meeting attested to this in the ample moments that there were to talk and socialize.

On behalf of the association, we encourage all Spanish readers to attend. We will keep reporting!

## Activities in cyberspace

### .GEV (VIRTUAL STUDY GROUP)

Thanks to the support of the Urantia Association of Brazil, which generously gave us the use of its chat room, in January the virtual study group (GEV) was created sponsored by the Urantia Association of Spain, which meets every Sunday from 7 to 9 pm (summer time) in the virtual room to study the book sequentially.

Although the site is primarily intended for “lone” readers, anyone who wants to, as well as from other parts of the world, can participate.

They will always be welcome. Currently, the group brings together between ten and fifteen people every Sunday, coming not only from Spain but also from Latin American countries. Mariano Pérez, the person in charge of study groups of the Urantia Association of Spain, is in charge of moderating the session, in which half of a document is usually studied. Participation is carried out by voice and written text, although we encourage the use of voice to make conversations more fluid.

If you are interested in participating, all you have to do is show up in the room every Sunday at the indicated time (7 pm, Spanish peninsular time, UTC + 2). The room URL is http://login.meetcheap.com/conference,26522696/ . You only have to put the name in the User field (the password is not necessary), although it is advisable to also include the town of residence. In the media used by the association (AIU-ES list and Facebook) a notice is sent at the beginning of the week where the document to be studied is recalled.

## The Urantia Corner

Last April, Urantia Corner, a new discussion list about _The Urantia Book_, began its journey. This list, moderated by Ismael Gracia and Santiago Rodríguez, is conceived as a “space for dialogue.” The list currently has about 90 members, and in its short life it has already addressed such interesting topics as personality, ego, race, the legitimate use of force and divine forgiveness, among many others.

So far, the assessment is very positive, since the conversations are at all times governed by mutual respect and the contrast of points of view is proving to be enormously enriching.

If you are interested in participating in this mailing list, you just have to send an email to urantiaesp@gmail.com, indicating that you want to subscribe. Your petition will be attended as soon as possible.
