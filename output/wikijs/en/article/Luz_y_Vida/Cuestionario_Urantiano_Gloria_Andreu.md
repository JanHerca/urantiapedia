Gloria Andreu de los Santos was born in Seville and lives in Castilleja de la Cuesta (Seville). She has worked as an administrator in a private company and is currently retired. She is the mother of two children, a boy and a girl, aged 36 and 34. She has been a reader of _The Urantia Book_ since the 1980s.

## 1. How did you get to “The Urantia Book” and why do you think you found it?

I came to _The Urantia Book_ because of ufology, from a very young age, when I was 13 or 14 years old, I remember that I was always looking at the stars and thinking that in something so immense it was impossible for there to be only life on Earth, but it was a little later , at the age of 20, when I was lucky enough to meet my friends Antonio and Patri, who along with other colleagues belonged to a ufology group of which I became a part. It was a beautiful stage in my life, because I learned a lot and we had a great time doing field work. We never saw anything. A little later we started reading philosophy and any other book that fell into our hands, and that's when Antonio was told about a book that they said was a revelation, but it only existed in English and had been translated into French. Luckily Antonio knows French very well and through a friend he got the book in photocopies and that's how we started reading it. Well, Antonio read and we listened. We would meet every Thursday as a group of six or seven, sometimes eight people, and that is how The Urantia Book came into my hands. I think I found it because from a very young age I was looking for answers and I am convinced that whoever searches from the heart always finds.

## 2. What was your first impression when reading it?

My first impression was that something inside me told me that what I was hearing had to be the truth, because I felt that for the first time I had answers to so many gaps that I had in my mind and that until now nobody and nothing knew how to answer.

## 3. At what point in the reading (document, sentence, etc.) did you accept that “The Urantia Book” is really what it claims to be?

As I have said before, from the first moment of reading something inside me made me feel that what I was hearing was true due to its logic and coherence and because it gave answers to so many questions that I asked myself and which until then I had not found. answers, and although it seems like a weirdo, I never doubted its veracity. I say this because some of my colleagues were hesitant at first and put a lot of things in quarantine. I never doubted and I cannot say a paragraph or a sentence, because I accepted it from the Prologue.

## 4. How has “The Urantia Book” changed your life?

I would say that it has totally changed it, although in a progressive way; I have noticed it in that I no longer judge people or rather I prejudge. I never dared to judge anyone, I empathize more and try to put myself in their place and think about that person's circumstances. I think I'm more sensitive, injustices affect me a lot, I give importance to what I really believe has it. Although if I have to choose one thing, I would say that from the first time we read about the mansion worlds, my fear of death disappeared.

## 5. Has the faith you had after reading it changed? If so, in what way?

I have always had faith, I have never doubted the existence of something superior, that is why I believe that when I found _The Urantia Book_ I did not doubt its veracity, because it confirmed the existence of life after death and what it was like. until that moment he called heaven, which is something I always wondered, but could not imagine.

## 6. Are there any points (or points) of the revelation that you find difficult to accept?

At first it seemed hard to me when he talked about the neighboring planet, the way to separate people with some type of disability, but seen with perspective I agree that it is good for the planet's evolution to avoid procreation. The rest has not cost me anything to accept.

## 7. What is the part that has most deeply impressed you?

I could not choose just one thing, because there are many that have impressed me; one of them is to realize the infinity and greatness of the Universal Father, within my finite and relative mind, of course. Another is the perfection of the administration of the universes, of the buildings, etc. I was also impressed when I first read the inevitabilities, but if I have to stick with one it's very difficult, I was impressed when we read the Thought Adjusters, and I was not only impressed, but I loved it, the whole fourth part, the life of Jesus year by year.

## 8. How do you understand “doing the will of the Father”?

For me, doing the will of the Father is to be perfect as He is perfect, and to achieve this he has given us the wonderful ascending path in which we evolve with our experiences until we become like Him. Recognize the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of all his creatures .

## 9. Have you become aware of the presence of your Adjuster?

I believe I have a long way to go before I can become aware of my Adjuster's presence. I am convinced that very few people here, if not any, get it. Until we reach the mansion worlds, where we will reach the third cosmic level, we will not achieve it.

## 10. Have you tried to put the Master's teachings into practice? What was the result?

For me, putting the Master's teachings into practice means loving my neighbor as myself, wanting for others what I want for myself, doing good and helping those in need to the best of my ability, being tolerant and not prejudging others. nobody. The result is feeling good about myself for doing what I have to do.

## 11. Do you think that “The Urantia Book” has something “mysterious” that makes not everyone decide to read it?

I don't think it's mysterious at all; For me it is the most important book that exists, has existed and will exist in the world, and whoever does not read it is that they are not looking for the truth, because as I said before, to those who search from the heart, the Father gives them the answers.

## 12. Is there anything else you would like to say regarding “The Urantia Book”?

What I can say is that thanks to _The Urantia Book_ I wake up every day with an inner joy that I cannot explain. I look at the world and at people in a different way, I give importance to what I think really has it, I live life without fear because I believe that they help us when we really need it. I am convinced that death is only the first step to an infinitely better world, and the only thing that makes me very sad is that only a small group of people know about this marvel that is _The Urantia Book_.
