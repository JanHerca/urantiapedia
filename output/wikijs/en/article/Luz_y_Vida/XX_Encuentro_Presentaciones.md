[**Technological future (Olga López)**](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/07/FUTURO-TECNOLOGICO-Olga-Lopez.pdf)

The development of technologies has experienced exponential growth in recent years, but are humans up to the changes that their widespread use is producing in all areas? There are studies that say that the progress of the human mind has been linear, while technology has experienced exponential advancement. Faced with this situation, what can _The Urantia Book_ offer as an instruction manual to navigate these times of accelerated development, in which we are even questioning the boundaries of the human being?

In this presentation, we see what _The Urantia Book_ tells us regarding the challenges of modern society (taking into account that its content is on its way to turning one hundred years old), first mentioning what have been the most notable technological advances in recent years.

[Ethics and morals (José Manuel Díaz)](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/07/ETICA-Y-MORAL-Jose-Manuel-Diaz.pdf)**

This presentation is divided into four parts or questions:

1. What is ethics and what is moral?
2. Are new moral and ethical rules needed?
3. Where does morality come from, according to _The Urantia Book_?
4. What is the meaning of existing as believers?

From the initial definitions, both according to the dictionary and the book, José Manuel separates ethics (more related to the social aspect and standards of behavior) from morality (linked to the individual aspect, with personal duty). The changes experienced in the third millennium lead us to consider whether new ethical and moral rules are needed, which leads us to look in the pages of the book for the answers to these questions.

The presentation begins by defining what an interpersonal relationship is and the types. Next, Paula explains the current situation of interpersonal relationships and how technology is generating new ways of interacting. But are these new relationships of better quality, or do they lead us to unwanted loneliness?

It also addresses new gender identities and the very definition of that word, and then considers what the immediate future holds for us in terms of interpersonal relationships, in light of the teachings of _The Urantia Book_.

Positioning oneself in an ideal situation in the face of the new changes that are coming and acquiring the knowledge provided for the times to come is something that society has to consider in the short and medium term in order to be able to face future challenges and contradictions, while taking advantage of the opportunities that usually arise in a changing world. This presentation is based on four scenarios: _The Urantia Book_, understanding and comprehension, future education and the ability of human beings to be wiser. In the end, it would be about helping as much as possible for humanity to move from the third era (that of material comfort) to the fourth (the search for knowledge and wisdom).
