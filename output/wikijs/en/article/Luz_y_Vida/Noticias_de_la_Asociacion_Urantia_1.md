## The Urantia Book — European Edition

We continue to raise money for the printing of the European edition of the _Urantia Book_, whose translation was reviewed by a team of Spanish readers, and which will be marketed solely and exclusively in our country.

If you wish to collaborate with this project, please make a deposit in the “La Caixa” account number **2100-2348-67-0100530840**, indicating as reference “UB-EDICION EUROPEA.” Any contribution, no matter how small Whatever it is, it will be well received!

## AUI International Conference - April 2009 - Spain

Building bridges: From diversity to universal unity.

We remind you that the registration period for the International Conference of Urantia International Association is still open, which will be held **from April 17 to 21 in Benalmádena Costa** (Málaga). The price per person in full board is $400 €$, which must be deposited in the “La Caixa” account number 2100-2348-68-0100703086.

The registration period will end on **December 15** of this year, so don't leave your registration until the last day! After that date, we do not guarantee that there will be places available.

We also want to inform you that we already have a list of people from all over the world (mainly from Latin America and Africa) who have applied for financial assistance to attend the conference. Since your attendance depends on donations from selfless readers, I appeal to your generosity in helping these people to attend the international conference. We are sure that many of them will boost the Urantia movement when they return to their countries, so this is a way to help spread the UB teachings. Sponsorship donations must be made to the account indicated above (that is, where the registration amount is entered)
