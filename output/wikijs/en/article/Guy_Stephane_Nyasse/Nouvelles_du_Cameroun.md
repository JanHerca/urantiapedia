Guy Stéphane NYASSÉ (Douala, Cameroon)

We received a wonderful package at the beginning of the year from AFFUB and it was with great enthusiasm that I went to the shipping company to collect it. That day I was accompanied by my younger brother Bilong Junior. We were happy to carry this large bag, filled with 50 books! We brought this package back to Deido in our neighborhood. Our objectives were simple, to share all these books, create more study groups and a local association of affiliated readers and ultimately organize a first international conference in Cameroon.

We have shared 35 books so far. Carlos, Thierry, Jean and myself. We are running into a cultural problem. People are reluctant to have their addresses published, for fear of witchcraft, fear of joining a sect. We have to be patient, to go about it delicately. We know at least all the people to whom we have distributed them. Our study group is still constituted, and we hope with the addition of Jean to give it a new boost.

When we thought about the conference we said to ourselves it would be an opportunity to bring together in the same room all the readers, because Jean was able to offer books to people from other cities in the country, couples sometimes. Let us remember that the economic situation in the country remains very delicate, material difficulties are a great concern for young people, and it is not easy to have a constant spiritual interest on their part.

We can still prepare a report with the names of the people who received the Book, however it should not be used by AFFUB at first, for fear of discouraging these people. A conference remains a good outcome for the movement in Cameroon. Jean MASSOMA is in France at the moment, and I pray that he will return with good news.
