Hello dear readers of the _Urantia Book_, It is the twentieth anniversary of the AFLUB and the results are not very brilliant. We live in a country whose inhabitants have many ideas but with great difficulty in giving them validity. They would like a brotherhood but do not ask themselves the question of what that implies. Likewise, many speak of their one God without thinking about what this concept really implies. This is the whole difference between a seeker of Truth and a simple believer.

It seems extremely difficult for a person drowned in a materialistic reality to understand how to adapt higher realities and values to their life, especially when seeing the examples that we are shown of those who have “succeeded”. This is why, in this economic and social context, it is rare to see new readers come. However, as in other European and neighboring countries there is a clear increase in readers, there is a good chance that this will also come back to us in one way or another. So, even with a limited number of people, we will continue to maintain a welcome for new readers and to study together this work which opens up such great perspectives for us. There will be errors, unacceptable shortcuts, but nothing is definitive and everything is correctable even for the most narrow-minded.

Finally, I wish you a good read and do not hesitate to react to certain texts.

Brotherly friendships ***Ivan Stol***
