Dear readers,

First of all, I wish you all lots of Love and Brotherhood and a happy new year.

It's decided, the 2025 European meeting will take place in PARIS at the CIS Maurice Ravel hotel, in June, from Friday 6 at 4 p.m. to Monday 9 at 1 p.m.

A press release with a link to a site will be sent to you by email and by post for those who are not computerized.

As for our 2024 national meeting, we will return to Neylière, probably from Thursday June 13 to Sunday June 16. Registration requests will arrive soon.

Otherwise, continue to have your experiences, in joy and good humor, with a positive consideration for the trials to come and a constructive discernment.

Some more good reading and thoughts on these pages from our readers.

Brotherly friendships
