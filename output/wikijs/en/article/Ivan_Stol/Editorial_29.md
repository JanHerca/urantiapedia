As you have noticed, this Link that you have in your hands or in front of your screen bears the number 100. It is, of course, a special issue in which we wanted to relate the events of the life of the French-speaking movement, published the articles that you were kind enough to send us, but not only that. We also wanted it to be historical by relating certain events from the past so that older readers can remember with perhaps a little nostalgia and that younger readers can learn with interest. It is a bit of a duty of remembrance that we are transmitting in this issue.

So, this Link No. 100 has existed since 1996. At the rate of four annual publications, this represents 25 years or &frac14; of a century or a generation. In addition to the usual articles from readers, we wanted to bear witness, in a "Supplement to LINK No. 100, to the few adventurers and courageous people who have invested in the publication of periodicals with the aim of connecting French-speaking readers with each other and giving them a voice through articles, news, testimonies and letters. We also reported on the revision of the Urantia Cosmogony which became The Urantia Book, begun in 1980 and completed in 1992 and laid out and printed in 1994.
