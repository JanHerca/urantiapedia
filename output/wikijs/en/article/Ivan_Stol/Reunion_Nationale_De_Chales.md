**Theme: Spiritual influences.**
_June 2 to 5, 2016_

The study of these influences on our life, here limited at first to that of the Adjuster and the angels, leads us to work on understanding the higher functions of our mind and all that contributes to it. The creation of the soul with the help of the Adjuster is done at a morontia level but the last two adjutant mental spirits work at levels which allow our personality, using the super-consciousness of the mind to perceive the boundaries of these levels where spirituality is more able to express itself. The soul is the reference which allows us to perceive the directives of the Adjuster. The more our soul grows, the more our communication with the Adjuster is real.

The Adjuster works internally and deals only with the higher mechanisms of our mind. He is also our direct link with God.

But the external universe sends us a large number of spiritual messages that are difficult for us to perceive. This is where the angels come into play. They cannot influence our decisions, but are able to stimulate our minds to make them sensitive to these messages. Oddly enough, although there does not seem to be a link between the work of the angels and that of the Adjuster, all of this is coordinated under the probable influence of the Supreme. If the guardian angel takes care of an individual more particularly, groups of angels take care of more general influences in areas specific to them (progress, churches, social,) by transforming these influences to make them accessible to the understanding of mortals. It is difficult to imagine the extent of their work in the midst of spiritual directives from all sides and all levels.

It still requires the good cooperation of man who, still very close to the animal, often only listens to its needs. This is why family life is necessary. It quite surely gives rise to the essential notions of values and the reflections necessary for understanding the moral behaviors to adopt for a just life. Everything is experienced there, altruism, justice, love, with the failures, the successes of the experiences carried out. The notion of family expands as our views broaden, gradually bringing the notion of Universal Father and brotherhood. But if we do not remain attentive to the subtle messages of those who try to help us, the path is long and tedious, errors and clumsiness accumulating on our way.

Here in a few words is the path of our discussions during this meeting and, although we are former readers and old students, we always manage to find anecdotes about ways of understanding things that allow us to move forward by correcting errors. In groups or in meetings, there is always progress in the discussions.

Next time, I hope we will address the influences of the Spirit of Truth of Jesus and the Holy Spirit of the Divine Minister, in us and around us.

Looking forward to seeing you again
**Ivan**
