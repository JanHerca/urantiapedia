There is a little theory of my own about the proof of God's existence that I would like to share.

Indeed it is often said that it is impossible for scientists to prove the existence of GOD.

However, there is no need to prove it scientifically because simple reasoning allows it to be done.

The scientist looks at the world in the wrong way, which prevents him from seeing what is obvious.

The world is made up of many movements which attract our attention and particularly that of scientists who see only disorder and probability equations giving matter a spontaneous self-generation due to chance.

But in fact, they most often forget to notice that what surrounds them is governed by laws that they themselves have stated and which seem immutable in the midst of this same chance.

In fact, it's what allows you to get up in the morning with the assurance that everything won't collapse due to a fortuitous accident.

So, despite all these changing and unpredictable movements, there is a real stability and an undeniable underlying order that no scientist can deny. From this I draw several very simple and logical truths:

- On the one hand, as nothing can be ordered without a will, there is necessarily someone who is at the origin of what surrounds us, which is very ordered and even super ordered because no one has been able to bring lasting disorder to it, which is contrary to all the laws of probability and chance.
- On the other hand, this will is unique because order and laws do not change, as far as scientists are able to investigate.
- Finally, and this follows from observations of unpredictable movements considered random, this person is capable of maintaining this order in the midst of so many movement phenomena considered random by scientists. If all these phenomena were truly random, then this person has infinite potential to predict all possible scenarios from everywhere at the same time. If these phenomena are not random then it takes a person with infinite potential to generate so many events whose character seems so unpredictable.

I think this is more than enough to demonstrate the existence of GOD.

If there are still skeptics GOD will take care of them
