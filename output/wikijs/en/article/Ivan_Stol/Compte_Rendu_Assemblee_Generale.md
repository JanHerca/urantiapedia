**1: OPENING OF THE ASSEMBLY**

The general meeting began on 10/29/2022 at 3:00 p.m.

The members present at this meeting were as follows:

- Stol Ivan, DUVEAU Jean, PERIER Lucas, CROISE André, MORELLI Patrick, LA SCALA Danielle, MALICOT Sophie, VIRET Marie-José, MAUROY Gilles Patrick, DONNADIEU Georges

With the following powers:

- Stol Ivan had the power of Gallo Robert, Guillot-Goguet Yves, Pierre-Joseph BRILLON
- MORELLI Patrick had the power of MAJOR José
- MALICOT Sophie had the power of COZETTE CYRIL, WINUM José

That is, 10 people +6 delegations of power which makes this general assembly valid according to our Statutes.

**2: PRESENTATION OF THE TREASURY**

Our treasurer Jean Duveau presented the three documents located at the end of this report in APPENDICES.

The accounts were approved unanimously.

**3: CHOICE OF OFFICE MEMBERS**

As every year, it is possible for volunteers to come forward to take on one of the administrative tasks of the association, namely, president (currently Ivan Stol), vice-president (currently Lucas PERIER), treasurer (currently Jean DUVEAU), secretary (currently Georges Michelson-Dupont).

No candidates came forward and the current positions were unanimously renewed.

**4: FUTURE OF THE ASSOCIATION**

There is not much member renewal but we do not have a solution currently.

Conference and exhibition initiatives have not been followed by any support, but it takes some time to read this book.

The economic situation of bookstores and the few people who read a lot in France do not help.

**5: PRESENTATION OF THE EUROPEAN MEETING IN MALAGA**

Not having had time to prepare this presentation, I will do it in another document so as not to overload this report.

**6: NEXT MEETINGS**

We have decided to prepare our next national meeting for the beginning of June 2023 and its implementation will begin this November 2022

We were asked to organize the next European meeting in 2025 in FRANCE and I took it upon myself to accept this challenge despite the small number of participants. But I think that with the help of all the goodwill in Europe we will get there. During the assembly, we thought that an unusual and humorous theme on trinities, deities, triodity and their distributivities would really be something new and in line with the UB.

**7: CLOSING OF THE ASSEMBLY**

The meeting closed around 6:00 p.m.
