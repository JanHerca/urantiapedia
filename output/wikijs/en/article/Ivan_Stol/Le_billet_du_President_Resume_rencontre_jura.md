Hello dear Urantian Brothers,

Drawn together by the influences of the Adjuster of God, the Spirit of Truth of Jesus representing the Eternal Son, and the adjutant mind spirits of the Divine Minister representing the Infinite Spirit, and aided by the Angels, three types of minds function within our personality.

The **first**, as it comes from God, should speak to us of Love.

The **second**, linked to the soul, seems to be the light which guides us in righteousness, truth and justice (righteous things).

The **third**, in the awakening of wisdom and worship, would push us to **mercy**.

Perhaps this is how we will recognize these influences and dialogue will begin.

In the meantime, enjoy reading.

With my friendship.

Ivan Stol
