Dear friends and readers,

The current situation can be a godsend for us, because many people who find it difficult to communicate may need to understand that this necessity is essential for a personality, but this notion of personality must still be well acquired.

If our association has put in its statutes that we should not look into religious, political or social trends, it is so that we can look into research aimed at finding what will allow us to find what we must bring to our neighbor so that he avoids stagnating and can open up to new horizons. As an example, Jesus spoke about everything but only to encourage his listeners to glimpse new paths through questioning and suggestions.

Unless you are an actor within official institutions, talking about religions, politics or social phenomena is the same as talking about the weather, therefore, apart from the possibility of acquiring knowledge, a waste of time (even with quotes from our beautiful book).

These texts are the results of research and reflections on certain questions from our readers and I invite you to immerse yourself in them with your critical mind. So, enjoy reading.

Brotherly friendships.

Ivan
