Dear Urantians,

Society is crumbling...

Life gets complicated...

Everyone clings to their power or privileges, thinking they have built on a rock.

But the time of every man for himself has passed and only God will offer comfort tomorrow.

You will be surprised to see how many people are searching but don't really know where to turn.
and we have in our hands and in our hearts part of what they are waiting for, so let us show them by our firm positions in openness, discernment and righteousness, that they can have the same thing as us if they ask for it.

It's time to wake up
and to come out of our cocoons to gently shine the brilliance of the true light which alone will soothe and
will give the courage to face these uncertain times with determination.

And, it's up to everyone to do it with their creativity, but without forgetting that the group is a superior driving force when everyone has their place in it.

Give your hand to God or to his older children, He will guide you.

In the meantime, enjoy reading.

Friendships

Ivan Stol
