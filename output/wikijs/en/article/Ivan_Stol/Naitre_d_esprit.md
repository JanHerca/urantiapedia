It may seem difficult for us poor mortals living in this purely physical context to be reborn in spirit when our minds operate on such a material level.

However, this is not really the case because this transition takes place continuously without us noticing (often because we do not understand how it is really achieved).

We must first keep in mind all of man's relationships with the different celestial divinities as shown in the attached diagram.

We are told that the mind is material and has no spirit. It is the seven adjutant mental spirits that enable it to function in the first place. The last two functions, worship and wisdom, enable us to discern, with the help of the personality and through experiences, qualities and values by analyzing truths, beauties and goodness. On the other hand, the faculty of awareness of facts, meanings and values allows us to understand how we function and we seek to control and master this functioning.

This need to control and master what happens within us is a search to become independent of adjunct mental spirits by replacing them with something else.

This is where our Adjuster comes in. He makes our soul with the pattern we build from our discerned experiences and values and lends us His Spirit (which has a mind like any spirit) to replace our material mind. When it says, “Do the will of God,” it means that we must use the mind of the Spirit within us to make our choices and decisions.

So, being reborn in spirit actually means using the mind of the Spirit that dwells within us and the evolving model of the soul that we build with the stones of our life experiences and anyone who believes in God (whatever their personal conception) and lives trying to hold on to the values that he has built, begins to live in spirit and will reap the fruits of the spirit.

So, do not think that it is so difficult to be born with spirit, we simply have to cling to true values and the spirit of truth helps us a lot to reassure ourselves in our doubts.

Of course, other influences and aids are present, I think, but what is closer than this transformation deep within us that we can feel if we understand it?
