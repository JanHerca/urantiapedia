Dear Readers,

You often wonder what to do with all the new things that this Urantia Book brings you every time you open it. Should you leave everything and take your bag to go preach? As much as the UB teaches you a reality more adapted to our socioeconomic level, some passages remain out of reach of the majority of people we meet. So, put away your bag, and carefully observe the attitude of Jesus.

First of all, he “taught” others only what he had understood and himself undoubtedly admitted. He did not quote other texts except to comment on them in his own way.

Secondly, he managed material affairs seriously but without giving them more importance than was necessary for the realization of his spiritual ambitions. He nevertheless brought to them novelty and a human dimension capable of generating great motivation.

Then, we must seriously find the answer to his attitude in forcing the Apostles not to deal with the social, economic and political affairs of the planet. There is a reason and a purpose for this and it is also valid today.

Finally, he encouraged people to act like a father rather than a brother towards their neighbor and unconditionally.

If you can understand these concepts, then you are ready to help others and the UB will go where it is useful. Helping people open up to a richer life requires significant motivation and these few texts will, I think, provide it to you.

It is not for tomorrow, it is now and always that revelations spread in the hearts of human beings.

_Happy reading_

_Ivan_
