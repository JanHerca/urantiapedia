Dear Urantian readers,

This link almost didn't appear, but a tenacious will ensures it.

In recent times, controversies over the use of mailing lists have arisen, more or less valid.

The UB contains information on various subjects which, I understand, do not interest everyone. But should we therefore prevent people from expressing themselves?

Personally, I believe that the UB was presented in this form to reach the majority of intellectuals on our planet to bring them back to spirituality (and I am a part of it), and not to bring much to the minority of truly spiritual beings who still resist materialism.

Also, although you don't like your inbox filling up with “futile!?!?!” conversations, I think it's nice to see that the French Urantian Brotherhood is expressing itself. I will say that the “delete” button is easy to use, but not too quickly because in the middle of this prose, communications from the association are circulating, which are easy to spot because the sender is “president_aflu” or “lectorat_aflu” most of the time.

And if you definitely no longer want to hear about AFLUB or Urantia, just ask me to no longer receive these letters, but on a whim, that's not reasonable.

For those who remain, enjoy reading these few pages.

Brotherly friendships.

Ivan.
