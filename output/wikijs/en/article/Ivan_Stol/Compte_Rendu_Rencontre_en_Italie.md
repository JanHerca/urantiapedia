In a quiet hotel on the shores of Lake Garda which was our panorama during the meetings, we met for the second time our Italian Urantian neighbors on the initiative of our dynamic Danielle LA SCALA whose translation skills are breathtaking. Without mentioning Danièle, and two non-Urantians, we were four French (Georges, Marlène, Doris and Ivan), five Italians (Nirvana, Serena, Deanna, Dolores and Alberto), two Swiss, Guy and Danielle and the European coordinator Antonio.

The discussions on “the survival of the human self” helped to clarify many questions on the existential issues of “who will survive” and “the true choice of survival”. Likewise, “how to live with others”, “what is love”, “doing the will of God” and “improving oneself” are themes that were addressed with the invaluable help of Georges, who has a great habit of guiding these discussions in the best possible way.

The discussions were recorded but I don't know if it can be easily used to create a report or provide audio support.

Of course, the question of what to do next for the Italians, of their willingness to maintain one or more permanent groups, arose and the recurring problem of proximity returned as it exists for some readers in France. The solution is once again either video conferencing or the Foundation's UBIS school. On the other hand, it seems that creating an association in this country is not simple (as in Germany it seems to me) and some will create their association in Switzerland (in France you must be French and be domiciled in France).

But also, we will provide them with a list of Italian readers and an Italian language forum to initiate a minimum of exchanges between readers of the Italian speaking book.

What more can we say except that these charming people are potentially capable of bringing this revelation to life in their country by themselves once our little help has allowed them to organize themselves as best as possible.

And thank you to everyone who made this event possible. Oh yes, the lake water was still good, but I could only put my feet and fingers in it. Ivan
