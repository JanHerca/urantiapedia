Dear readers,

The AFLUB is running out of steam. Although the four members of the BUREAU and the helpers for the editions (proofreaders, translators) and the site are persevering, their long mandate is becoming routine and few innovations and changes are seeing the light of day. Young people are needed to restore some dynamism, but the average age is too high and little by little people are moving away and disappearing. Even the forum on the internet will end up disappearing, due to a lack of administration, since the site itself has already been stagnant for five or six years. Our close neighbors are more dynamic although sometimes, as in Italy, there are directions that leave something to be desired, but overall the readers are younger and are establishing a dynamic that we are struggling to follow for multiple reasons.

But we are nonetheless sitting on our hands. After the FOUNDATION which works for translations, the AUI which brings together associations of reader groups, we are trying to find a method to make our passion and fraternity known to the world. This is not only a French question but the other associations are also racking their brains to get out of the rather closed community of UB student readers. It seems to me that a third organization should be set up to offer this good news to the world and break away from the operating charters which characterize the first two.

We will still have time to talk about it. In the meantime, there are still readers who write down their progress and these few pages allow them to be disseminated. So, enjoy reading. Brotherly friendships, Ivan
