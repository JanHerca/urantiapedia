Dear readers of the Link, dear Urantians, the editorial team of the Link hopes that the end of year 2015 celebrations went well and that good resolutions for the start of the year have been made, such as actively participating in your Link by sending your thoughts and/or your articles relating to your study of the _Urantia Book_.

- Number 73 of The Link deals with the study of certain superhuman endowments and aids which ascending creatures receive on Urantia.
- From the Universal Father we receive The Personality. What is its purpose? When does it become functional? What role does it play in the Personality-Power synthesis? The authors will attempt to provide their answers to these questions.
- The Mother Spirit of the local universe is the source of the circuit of adjutant mind spirits, explains The Urantia Book. They play a primary role in the functioning of the minds of animal creatures and in the phenomenon of evolution. How do certain experiments tend to demonstrate this?
- The authors of The Urantia Book have the mission “to expand our cosmic consciousness and heighten our spiritual perception” by introducing us to new concepts. Doctor Sadler has made a list of them which you will find in this issue.
- A reader sent us a moving testimony which we reproduce here.
- A little poetry has been included in your link from the pen of a reader under the title **UBMEN**.
- A communication from the **AFLUB** office: We are looking for documents that can trace the history of our association for its twentieth anniversary.
- News from **BUBE CUBB** and an invitation to Budapest.
- At the end of the issue you will find the third part of the study on “the inevitable injunction”.
- A presentation of the **UBIS** school
- The list of courses that will be offered for the April quarter: participate in large numbers because it is a wonderful experience to share the teachings of the Urantia Book with readers from all corners of the French-speaking world.

Don't forget to send us your articles and essays to the following address: georges.michelson-dupont@wanadoo.fr. **The whole team wishes you a good and informative read.**
