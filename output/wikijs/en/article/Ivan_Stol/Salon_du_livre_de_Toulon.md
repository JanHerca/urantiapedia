Hello everyone. I again held a UB presentation stand in Toulon.

I met a few people who were surprised to discover a book that many volunteers were making known through their translation work, their donations and their rationality.

There were people there, but only the curious and intrigued stopped to ask what it was about because as you can see in the photos, there was little information. Some even found that the stand had a more scientific than spiritual aspect.

Despite this, I had the joy of being able to speak about this book to several entire families, young people who were very alert and already on a personal path identical to that recommended in the book, and many others.

The fact of presenting this book as information by revelation and not as “the revelation” greatly impressed the listeners who liked the open-mindedness that this book gives, this possibility of discussing as equals and not with a master of all subjects and different points of view.

I even met a Peruvian who, in telling me about the philosophy of life of his people, almost seemed to me to be talking about the read and describing the supreme even though he did not know this book, surprising, isn't it?

I also saw grimaces, fear, disdain, indifference and mockery on people's faces, but little hostility.

A trade show is more passive than active, and sometimes seems long, but it's a good experience.

Kind regards, Ivan
