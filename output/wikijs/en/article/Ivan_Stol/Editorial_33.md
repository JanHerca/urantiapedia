## Happy New Year 2024

Dear readers,

Here comes the end of the year with its celebrations of all kinds. I wish you all lots of Love and Brotherhood, a happy end of the year and a happy new year to come.

Another cycle completed, life and energies are cyclical, from the smallest to the largest everything turns, breathes and surrounds us with vibrations of all kinds to which we must react and adapt.

Within the AFLUB, things are moving for the preparation of “Europe 2025”, the teams, even small ones, are mobilized for the best.

We will also have to decide whether we will hold a national meeting in 2024.

Waiting for… :

Enjoy your escape in these readings of our readers’ reflections.

Brotherly friendships

Ivan
