Hello dear readers,

One person made the following comment (which everyone must have seen, thank you Pascal), I quote:
“And yes, AFFUB is a readers' association. We are students. Shy, daring, daredevils, reckless, thoughtful, vindictive, optimistic, poets.”

And everyone should feel good with us because we are able to understand and discern each person's goal and therefore accommodate it. For my part, I must ensure that the actions of some do not overshadow the rules of others and that the association remains a neutral ground where everyone can express themselves without feeling in danger or rejected.

Now, in a spirit of openness, nothing should prevent an adventurous spirit from asking for help. So, it is brotherhood that must respond, and by BROTHERHOOD, I mean the critical and frank side existing between brothers and sisters which allows for reflection even if it is sometimes a little too direct.

We need everyone, so everyone needs to know what's going on and give their opinion.

With these words, I leave you to your reading while thanking those who make this LINK rich.

My regards, Ivan
