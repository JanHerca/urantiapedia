Dear friends and readers, our world is in turmoil. But it is time to be positive and to experiment in order to understand the will of God. Between the efforts of heavenly helpers and the free will of human beings, there are distortions. But are we really capable of discerning right and wrong, evolution or regression? Staying positive seems the best solution to help according to one's abilities without trying to do the impossible that only a majority can do together.

In this LINK No. 102 you will find the report of the annual meeting of our association which took place in La Neylière, in the Monts du Lyonnais as well as testimonials from participants and, of course, some photos which will bring back good memories.

The big news is that the association will organize the European UAI conference which will be held in 2025. We are appealing to people of good will to best prepare for this event. Let us recall that the association organized an international conference in 2002 in Dourdan which brought together more than 150 readers from five continents.

Happy reading. Brotherly friendships Ivan
