Hello everyone, wishing you a happy end of the year and a happy new year to come!

Europeans are wary of spirituality because they confuse it with religion.

However, the very principle of spirituality is the elevation of each person in tolerance through the recognition of each person's reality and openness by considering that God is infinite in possibilities of manifestations.

Any positive and constructive act is in itself an act of faith which contributes to elevating a being through experience towards greater understanding.

So, look at the people who are moving forward and encourage them!

And maybe you will have the opportunity to contribute a few stones to the building, you never know!

In the meantime, please study this link carefully and do not hesitate to obtain further information.

There you go, continued in the next issue.

Friendships.

Ivan Stol
