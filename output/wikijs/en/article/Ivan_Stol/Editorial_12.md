Dear readers, seekers of truth, here are new readings and opinions from some of you. This summer, after our instructive national meeting on our relationship with the Supreme which I will tell you about later, there were interesting Zoom discussions on “the example of Jesus” as the type of man able to teach what he himself had learned and above all understood, then other equally captivating subjects. Through the exchange, we better perceive what tolerance, justice, doing the will of God implies.

It is a fact that certain discussions can only take place between readers of the _Urantia Book_ because of concepts unknown to others, so how should we act with other seekers of truth? In fact, we must ask questions, on the one hand to know the level of reality and openness of our interlocutor, and on the other hand to make him think about new approaches opening up new perspectives of investigation. Prayers? Meditations? Yes, this is how we prepare ourselves to refine our perceptions and to develop our actions, mixing experiences and prospects.

Happy reading and see you soon on the airwaves!

Fraternally
Ivan
