Dear readers,

Questions:
- God has given a lot to man: what does he do with it?
- Wisdom and worship are essential to a personality: what does it do with them?
- All our cells were for evolution ([UB 65:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p6_2)): are we helping them?

Young people are looking for work, but when they find it, they leave after a few months. The bosses don't understand. We are incapable of offering these young people the new society that we have promised would come. We have the potential to make them aware of the end of an age, let's help them to innovate!

Otherwise, 'Urantian Europe is trying to build itself, but we are only at the mobilization of the swirling energies from which the suns will appear.

I'm also trying to restart the national meetings, but my emails seem to get lost in a dense fog with no response, just a few echoes!!!...

Happy reading.

Brotherly friendships
