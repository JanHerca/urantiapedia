Hello dear readers of The Urantia Book

FROM TIME TO TIME, some leave us and go to other skies. The tributes that follow are sufficiently eloquent not to add to them, otherwise, Thank you, Jean, for your constant participation.

Have you considered that one or more replacements will be needed to continue the work he was providing?

Otherwise, this year we have an international conference in the Netherlands in Amsterdam from April 12 to 15 whose theme is “Jesus the teacher” and a national meeting in Neylière from May 31 to June 3 where the AFLUB awaits you with a theme proposed by Georges on “Personality-Power Synthesis”. More opportunities for exchanges for those who find the time (and the means) to participate. There will certainly be videos for Amsterdam.

Speaking of videos, we must also talk about zoom conferences. Tuesday evenings for “light” and less prepared sharing, the first Sunday afternoon of each month for better prepared topics. Some people we don't see often are starting to participate, but it's not enough, we need more, and I thank the old ones (not days) for their instructive participation. People need to understand that it's a much simpler way to meet in a group (no transportation, we don't disturb anyone, it's flexible and scalable) and in addition, we can record and broadcast. Of course, those who are resistant to modern means of communication exclude themselves from these facilities (however, a simple modern phone or tablet is enough). And if you want to talk for a few minutes at any time, don't hesitate, Zoom is always available to everyone $24 h / 24 h$ (yes, you can always come across a discussion in progress, but for now, it's not too risky, and a little hello doesn't hurt).

And then, the AFLUB is still there!! The number of members is stagnant but there are a few new ones, and the youth having lost their way has not yet found us. We must not plant trees but sow seeds that will adapt much better. Spirituality is like a treasure hunt, we must put indicators on the course. Happy reading, all my friendship and see you soon.
