Dear Urantians,

The world is in the midst of social and economic upheaval. Some are in a warlike revolution, others are prey to a breathless and poorly managed economy. Many hope without knowing what exactly, having lost their reference values.

Through The Urantia Book, we have gained invaluable knowledge that can enable us to light the way for others through our wise service, social, material, intellectual or spiritual.

To be of service is to be attentive and provident to everything around us. If you imagine life as a garden where you are the gardener of your relationships with people, then you will have to prepare the soil, remove weeds and pests, make groups according to affinities, put fertilizers at the right times and water, without forgetting the beauty and respect of other gardens, because everything is linked.

The world needs us, slowly, and it is by forging that we become a blacksmith, by gardening that we become a gardener, by serving that we become a servant.

May God and all his servants help us learn!

Ivan Stol
