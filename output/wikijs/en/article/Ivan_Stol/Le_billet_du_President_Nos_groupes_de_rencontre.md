Meeting groups are formed and transformed according to people, new or old. It is remarkable that most of the new readers who make themselves known are in lost regions of France and despite their desire to join a group, the distances are sometimes blocking, although some are really motivated.

Also, regional groups must be aware of the presence of these newcomers and organize trips to allow these people to have exchange contacts.

On the other hand, in big cities where exchange and culture should be a driving force for new readers to appear, there is absolute silence!! Is the “metro-work-sleep” in the process of killing evolution?

Are we responsible for this fact? In any case, websites do not seem to provide a valid engine. It would seem that only direct contact and word of mouth are capable of increasing the troops.

And make no mistake, people are eagerly awaiting us with our book!
