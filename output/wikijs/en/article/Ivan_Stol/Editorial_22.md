Dear Urantians, lately, the topics of discussion seem to revolve around the virus which is causing a lot of problems. But when an apostle asked Jesus what to do about wars and rumors of wars, he replied that it was better to take care of one's salvation and the kingdom of heaven. Moreover, all this chatter about the virus is practically the same as talking about the weather, “I like it, I don't like it,” but no one can do anything about it because no one seems to have control over it.

So let's prepare ourselves to live it with GOD and comfort those who are afraid with the Spiritual Brotherhood. In the AFLUB, not much seems to be happening, but some physical groups seem to be braving the confinements and the ZOOMs are multiplying. It seems that this year again, our general assembly will be held through ZOOM. Even so, our website and its forum, courageously supported and energized by our dear TOR for 10 years, will end up getting a facelift but there is work and research to improve it. Your opinions will be valuable when it goes online.

These few texts should put you back on the right path to deep reflection.

Happy reading everyone!!

Fraternally yours

Ivan
