Definitions first (personal feeling):

**Prepersonal**: who has an ability to receive or merge with a personality, therefore who can recognize and communicate with a personality.

**Superpersonal**: That which goes beyond the threshold of understanding the personality realms in a person, such as pure Spirit, high spirituality, absonite levels and I think also, faith. One must use super consciousness to access this level.

Now, let's look at this problem of **Deity**. I will try to proceed by comparisons. In a company, there are different departments:

Accounting — Commercial — Management — Study- Production — ...

Each entity has a function, but as each is made up of people, each has an aura of personality, its own character. The company itself has its own character which is its signature, its personality.

Each service is a function.

Likewise, each association of the Trinity is an office which is called Deity. Depending on whether we look at the office or the persons composing it, we see a service or a unique character of behavior giving a personality to the service or office.

And **DELITY** is the sum of all the Deities, the enterprise in a way.

This is why it is said that the Deity is **personalizable**, depending on how it is perceived, as a function or as a group of people (whose association generates a unique character).

And when we want to speak about the personal aspect of the Deity, we use the word GOD (God the Ultimate, God the Supreme...)

I'll continue with **DIVINITY** while we're at it:

In every group or service there is a “group spirit” that unites the personalities in their functions. Well, every group spirit is a Divinity at the Deity level. This is why the Revelators say that the Divinities are unifying functions.

This is how I see these things basically, then you have to understand each service, their levels of functionality and the associated capabilities.
