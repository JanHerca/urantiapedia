Dear Readers of the Book of Uranria, the latest virus has caused quite a bit of disruption across the planet. Once again, fear and not reason have been the driving force behind decisions, compounded by a lack of organization and anti-humanism. However, for some, isolation has allowed for awareness and brought up a host of existential questions thanks to the openness of mind during these times.

As a result, more people should be ready to receive the message of _The Urantia Book_ and we, with a few volunteers, are going to get to work on it.

Some think that to do this, we must work in social institutions, others that it is better to follow the example of Jesus, that is to say, to elevate the ideals of men. But we are neither Jesus nor apostles and must do what we can, where we are.

But let's not kid ourselves, the world will go where the majority of Urantians decide to let it go. It is not the fault of the minority who lead, but that of the majority who let them do it. This majority is made up of 6 to 7 billion individuals. However, the truth always triumphs, so let's find the truth or rather the truths that will motivate Humans.

Hoping that you overcome this crisis, I wish you good health and good reading. Ivan
