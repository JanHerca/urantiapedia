Hello dear seekers of the right way to be,

People in the world throw themselves at sales, the latest inventions, promotions without much discernment. Among them, a small number of people try to warn them that it is their way of being that is causing the planetary damage that some, but not so many, constantly complain about. Jesus told his apostles and disciples not to worry about the misfortunes of the planet but rather about their spirituality individually.

It is obvious that there is no point in fighting against people's material aspirations if they do not see a higher reason to channel them and have the deep conviction that their right choices will put an end to all this chaos from which only a minority benefits.

Recent international conferences clearly show the universal difficulty in making ourselves understood, even in countries of the same type as those of Latin America where the tendency to draw closer to GOD is stronger. We will have to be gentle, tolerant and persevering and calmly prepare for a perhaps distant future, looking for young people to hold the torch.

Our strength is not in action but in the intentions of achievements which will inevitably end up bearing fruit.

With these words, I invite you to immerse yourself in your reading of this new LINK.

Fraternally

Ivan
