Hello everyone,

The need to find a means of communication in the AFLUB that is lively, simple and fast takes up a lot of time.

It must be usable by everyone and selectable by everyone.

It must remain discreet, but people must be able to know who receives the information (list not distributed but accessible to subscribers).

There are members who must participate in the life of the AFLUB and others who must not be forgotten if they wish to be informed.

This is not a new forum, it is just the life of the AFLUB and what happens there (groups, meetings, exhibitions, conferences, international...).

All suggestions on our services and operations will be welcome.

So see you soon (but I won't tell you how today)

Ivan Stol
