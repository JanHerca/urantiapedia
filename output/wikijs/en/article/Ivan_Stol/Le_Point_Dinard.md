The study of personality in a friendly and well-organized setting (thank you Claire).

This mysterious and elusive personality, presented by Anne-Marie under the gaze of solitude and associativity, by Claire through what she is not and what she is, and by Chris in long commented definitions extracted from the UB, will remain difficult to discern from the identity in others. Normal because it lurks in the middle of the different parts of our WHOLE and tirelessly weaves the fabric of the functional links of our elements in order to give them a reasonable coherence. However, it is more felt in ourselves revealing its prerogatives (choice, decision, discernment ...) and this exciting faculty of having the consciousness of our consciousness. GOD has offered to myriads of varied living energetic forms this personality, associated with a free will which provokes endless changes in all universes which it must compensate for at all times by the infinite reactions of the absolutes. And to top it all off, it is this same personality which offers us the splendid possibility of having a true relationship with GOD. It is invariant, but as it unifies and organizes the scattered elements, it reveals and asserts itself, radiating with all its divine brilliance.

The subject is long, the stay seemed short. Especially since, to come back to earth, it was necessary to report on the current affairs of the AFLUB, elect the new representatives of our organization (President: Dominique Ronfet, Vice-president: Ivan Stol and the treasurer: Robert Gallo to name only the main ones); which was followed by a motivating speech from the President of the AUI Mr Gaétan Charland who congratulated us for the organization that our outgoing president has built for us (thank you very much Michel).
