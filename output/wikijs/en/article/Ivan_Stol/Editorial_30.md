Dear readers, Here we are in 2023 in an unstable world in turmoil. Aside from the fact that this year seems to be number 7, a year of truth, it is no less true that the Beings without faith or law, through their exaggerations and also their fears, reveal themselves in spite of themselves. And people like us are able to bring to the world our superior points of view capable of guiding populations in the right choice of future leaders in charge of the management of our Country. No, nothing very complicated, just throwing seeds into the fertile pots.

At the last European meeting in MALAGA in SPAIN we agreed to take care of the European CONFERENCE of 2025 which will take place in FRANCE. There should be Russians, Poles, Estonians, Romanians, Georgians, Germans, Spaniards, English, in short many Europeans. And

The theme of this meeting will be GOD, what He is and does for us, directly and indirectly (this will also be the theme of our national meetings to prepare).

You can help with ideas, presentations, preparations, translations... and we also have the support of Europeans. The language barrier would have to fall, which implies multilingual means of diffusion (which are starting to be developed today). I know, there are not many of us, but I thought it would be possible.

Happy reading. Brotherly friendships Ivan
