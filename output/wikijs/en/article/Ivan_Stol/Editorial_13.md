My very dear sisters, my very dear brothers

(REPEAT WITH ME ALL IN HEART...)

THESE TIMES, and following my many years at the head of our association and participation in the numerous conferences in which I have participated (but always in a discreet and passive way), numerous reflections have led me to glimpse certain evidence on the fact of the rapid diffusion of the _Urantia Book_.

The book was entrusted to people who were not only open and cultured, but also who traveled a lot around the world and who therefore had ease of contact and therefore a significant potential for distribution. Even today, if the book reaches such diverse places, it is still thanks to this kind of people.

Then, each group that receives this work tries to do everything possible to make it known around them and to translate it to make it more accessible. The solutions for doing this are multiple, individual (people to people, conferences), collective (presentations, fairs, meetings) or communicative (internet, reports). There are therefore still methods unexplored among us, but this is mainly due to our prudence and our desire for discretion. That said, if we are to believe the studies carried out on populations and their beliefs, only 10% are part of religious groups or sects while among the remaining 90%, at least 70% have a belief in a God or in higher causes but not really clearly defined in their thoughts. Perhaps our “shyness” ultimately prevents us from bringing these people this clarification that we could provide them. The problem is how to do it without being intrusive by triggering in these people a free motivation to want to know more and, personally, I think that we have to show ourselves and arouse interest in us, while remaining within certain limits so as not to attract “undesirables”.

Some will say that the internet is a good solution. I answer that the internet is like God but less good, that is to say that if we do not ask, nothing comes but it is worse because God works in us and not the internet.

I think it is necessary to reach people personally to awaken what is dormant in them, and then, when the engine has started, the other means put in place will serve to support their thirst.

There is work awaiting us, in all areas, and even constructive criticism is a source of ideas to mature, so everyone's participation is welcome and don't think you are less good than anyone else, we cannot know where the idea that is missing to move forward will come from.

On that note, I wish you a good read. Ivan
