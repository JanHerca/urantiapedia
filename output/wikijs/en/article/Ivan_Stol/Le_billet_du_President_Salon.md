Hello dear friends,

In these troubled times, we do not forget those who seek relative inner peace. Also, we have launched a series of exhibition trials in wellness fairs in order to experiment with a way of making the existence of this book known to as many people as possible.

I hope that such initiatives will flourish in different regions with of course the support of the association. It is a very instructive group work which includes a questioning of our intentions and the type of service and message that we are supposed to transmit in a positive way (to the greatest number in a limited time).

It remains to prepare conferences in cities across the country in order to better understand how this book can help change this world.

Don't be shy, the world (your brothers) needs your contribution, active or passive.

In the meantime, enjoy reading.

Friendships

Ivan Stol
