Hello Dear Readers,

We tried to communicate via the internet with ZOOM and it was not a success. I thought I would have more participants, but apparently hardware problems were the cause. Even if the image is not an important factor, the sound was sometimes disappointing. On the other hand, getting started is simple and quick.

It's a shame, because not having many accessible groups means some people remain frustrated at not being able to exchange and learn.

Otherwise, nothing new. I compared the small handful of 50 members of the association to more than 60 million French people, which makes us one part per million, and if we were poisons, we would have no effect on the body. So you can scream, struggle, shine, a drop of water has never made an ocean overflow. I say this not to be negative, but to face reality. Our role today is to keep this spark so that more awakened generations can find the path to light. In my drowsiness, I look for the lever to press to raise awareness, but have not found anything yet. Perhaps several levers and several actors are needed.

In the meantime, I wish you a pleasant read.

Fraternally.

My regards, Ivan
