Dear Readers,

With a certain stagnation, in France, of the fruit of this revelation, Europe is trying to show solidarity, bringing out isolated people (GEORGIA) and groups (POLAND, among others).

There are language difficulties, but we are trying to make do with English. A European study group and a European Urantian action group have been formed under the direction of Karmo Kalda. The AFLUB has decided to contribute by providing a basic WEB site to Karmo (https://europe.urantia.fr) under construction with features for broadcasting events and News to subscribers.

A new French FORUM is active and instructions will soon be provided to you (if they have not already been provided when reading these lines). This will slightly modify the way in which exchanges between readers and the dissemination of Urantian information operate.

The new AFLUB website is being actively prepared. We will keep you informed.

Enjoy reading these texts and don't hesitate to write comments to put in the next LINK.

Fraternally

Ivan
