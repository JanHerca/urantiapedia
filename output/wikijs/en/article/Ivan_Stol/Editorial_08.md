Dear readers,

The Urantia Book gives us some adjustments to our concepts of God. But, the infinity of manifestations can never be contained in a book, at most it will provide some advice adapted to a specific environment for a time.

Also, any action aimed at setting up teachers for this book will automatically be limited by constraints linked to this book which advocates a complete and dynamic opening. In particular and as an example, it praises Hindu philosophy with regard to the advancement of the concepts of deities and therefore invites to study it.

Likewise, our association is locked into constraints linked to this book (see the statutes), but perhaps they should be formulated differently, because our last national meeting highlighted some misunderstandings regarding the goals and expectations that everyone should hope for as an active participant.

Indeed, our constraint is linked to our dear “Urantia Book” but only by the concepts that it tries to make us discover rather than by the literature of its content.

We put in the statutes that we should not talk about religions and politics, and in fact this is not the right wording because the fear is to create a new religion or a fixed idealistic movement and not to talk about it effectively as the book does throughout its pages.

Then, we are not an ordinary association. Most associations bring people together so that the strength of these groups gives them some privileges that they can only obtain in this way, thus creating a closed community. For our part, we try rather to group together to increase our capacity to communicate and share with others by all means, so the spirit of community is replaced by a spirit of brotherhood and service without borders which can destabilize a person looking for a more restricted family. This is the beginning of the cosmic consciousness of the family.

And as such, borders no longer exist either, hence this “small” aid in Africa. However, our limits are real and that is why we need an association to manage the possibilities, priorities and above all the initiatives of each person.

On this subject, some are afraid of giving conferences. Let me tell you that it is not the crowd that is frightening, but their self-esteem of not being master of their subject. And that is why, you should not speak of the _Urantia Book_ but of what you have learned and discovered for sure by yourself and that you can confirm by a passage from the book. Thus, as you cannot make a mistake, you can speak about it freely, regardless of the number of people listening who will moreover willingly drink in your “living” words.

Finally, this last national meeting was eventful in many ways, with some drawbacks, and I thank everyone for their patience and respect for everyone's choices. I still think that the discussions were enriching.

Enjoy reading the rest.

Brotherly friendships
Ivan.
