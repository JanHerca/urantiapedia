Hello Dear UB readers, Many people ask questions about the weather (when it's not about meteorology) and I would like to present some of its particularities to you.

First of all, can you own time? It is said that some people have time and others never have time. On the other hand, some people waste their time while others take their time (whose?).

But those who have the time, generally take the time and ultimately end up running out of time because it's a waste of time.

Then, all those who waste their time end up either chasing after this lost time or having time catch up with them.

And I'm not talking about those who spend their time watching you go by!!!

And do you know bad weather? It's when the weather breaks (well sorry, it's weather).

Finally, time becomes mathematical because it often transforms into pi time!!

Which proves that time is cyclical because it is highlighted by cyclical movements.

So, don't delay in reading this Deep Link.

Yours faithfully, Ivan.
