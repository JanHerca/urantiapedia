Dear Urantians of France,

It was at La Neylière that some of you did me the honor of placing me at the head of this organization that is the AFLUB. I regret a little that this meeting did not bring together more people on this site because it was the occasion for a very interesting exchange on truth, beauty and goodness.

I have been given the opportunity to help you, the readers of this exceptional book, with the help of all the members of the board of directors, to carry out your meetings and your projects to make those around you aware of the reality of this cosmic plan of God for men. The goal is to put on sweet music to wake people up pleasantly in a world of hope and warm brotherhood.

The board of directors has also changed a lot. Four new volunteers, CASTELLI Joseph, GROSSET-MAGAGNE Élisabeth, MichelsonDupont Georges and a courageous Vice-president in the person of Lucas Perrier have come forward to form an active team.

And finally, a big thank you to Dominique Ronfet and Anne Marie for their work and their involvement.

Ivan Stol
