Dear friends and readers, the same question keeps running through our heads: where am I in my evolution?

The answer is not obvious, but objectively and with the help of certain passages from Lu it is possible to answer it partially. I say partially because we are only at the beginning before eternity and the clarification of our cosmic consciousness reveals little by little obscure passages of our favorite book.

So let's continue, in groups, meetings, ZOOM and UBIS to share with others and find the right way of being.

Happy reading.

Brotherly friendships

Ivan
