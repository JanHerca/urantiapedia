Dear friends and readers, The URANTIAN world continues to slowly evolve, but it seems more quickly in certain countries. It is true that countries without social structure or technological advancement are more willing to hear the great message of hope that The Urantia Book brings, but this does not seem to be a generality. There is more movement in Africa and northern South America than in India or China where the majority of the world's population is gathered.

That said, it is by referring to the existence of associations which disclose information, and not to a reality not very known or disclosed of the number of readers of this book in the different Countries, which is quite surprising given the fact that the publications are controlled by the Foundation which should have a certain estimate of the number of books sold, in which language and in which Country. There must surely be a lack of staff to carry out this kind of task.

In our so-called industrialized countries, the need for a spiritual reality is no less great, especially among young people, but it seems less simple to approach them because here we need proof and justifications (intellectual materialism requires it) which are difficult to provide (like the existence of GOD). But our social mode leaves so many philosophical gaps that it should not be too complicated to sow seeds of healthy reflections in minds in order to awaken listening to the higher injunctions of the Spirit that inhabits us.

To do this, I suggest increasing contacts with people. These people must of course be willing to listen, and the best method, in my opinion, is to attract them to suitable conferences. All that remains is to develop these conferences.

In the meantime, enjoy reading.

Brotherly friendships
Ivan
