Dear Urantian readers,

Although our Dear Max has left us, life continues on Urantia as in Heaven.

The captivating and controversial topics that you are going to read are current. The directions and choices of humanity really depend on the majority and not on a minority who believe they are leading in the illusion of their pride.

But as long as, despite the potential transformations of its animal support, personalities and adjusters can be attributed to these physical forms, there is hope in evolution.

After all, it is experiences that make the planet evolve, and we have a celestial army that watches over us effectively even if we do not always understand their actions.

Happy reading to all

With you fraternally

Ivan
