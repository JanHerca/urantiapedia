Dear Urantians,

“Help yourself and heaven will help you!”

I often heard this phrase from my parents and grandparents. So I got into the habit of not expecting anything and doing what I can. However, living in a society, we all talk about our achievements and projects which sometimes leads to gracious and welcome help at the right times. Helping and being helped, without asking and without expecting anything, is the beginning of brotherhood. But knowing how to discern whether help is appropriate (competence, efficiency, etc.) is also necessary if we do not want to either do too much or cause negative effects.

When everyone has found the right balance, then order will reign.

Ivan
