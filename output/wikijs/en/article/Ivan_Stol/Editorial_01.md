Dear readers, seekers of truth, Dear members of AFLUB, after this eventful summer, the people of Toulon have decided to end this year by once again exhibiting The Urantia Book in the Toulon wellness fair, at the ZÉNITH next to the station.

During this show, three small conferences will take place for people who want to know more than our time allows on the stand and we plan to invite in small information groups people who wish to discuss it at greater length during additional group meetings in Toulon.

Our goal is to make the existence of this book known, but we have realized that a few seconds spent on a stand do not count for much. In addition, another experience that is taking place in Switzerland (Geneva and border) shows us that repeated conferences of 10 to 15 people (initiated on social networks like “ovs”) bring more new readers than several hundred contacts during these shows (the assessment is difficult to make because we have no feedback and have not taken any means of contact, email or telephone).

We will therefore try to be more present and more visible while seeking continuity of relationships.

Otherwise, in Europe there is also movement, a big meeting in Budapest in 2016 of which you will have all the information in time and an international meeting in 2018 in Amsterdam. And don't forget that we can still finance some projects to help the dissemination of UB, so any well-developed idea is welcome.

Moreover, some people contact us to be part of groups but there are problems of isolation or the lack of a regular group member to start one in complete “safety”. We must also promote “UBIS” and other means of courses or conferences.

My regards and thoughts especially to those who are still a little isolated.
