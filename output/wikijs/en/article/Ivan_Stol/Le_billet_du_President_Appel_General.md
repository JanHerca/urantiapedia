Hello everyone,

To be in line with the ethics that the AFLUB has imposed on itself, it is **ABSOUBTELY** necessary that the following positions not be held for long: **Secretary, Treasurer, President and Vice-President**.

Indeed, being a member of an association means participating in its life and therefore occupying key positions. **Our Secretary**, after eight years of service, wishes to retire for a while and this position is therefore vacant (and it will remain so until someone comes forward to take it). This involves a lot of things in the administration of the association (monitoring contributions, updating members' situations, knowing who does what and where).

**The CA** should also take care of lots of small details like managing editions (corrections and sending), monitoring groups... which only the current secretary takes care of, which is rather heavy.

**Personally**, I would like to be able to devote myself to setting up a new management tool for our association, ours being obsolete, and therefore take the position of treasurer. The position of president is therefore also vacant.

Finally, the members of the Board of Directors are rather silent, which indicates low involvement.

I feel that the AFLUB is dying out due to aging and disinterest. The number of members is decreasing regularly and non-participation in assemblies puts the AFLUB outside the law before the legislation established by my predecessors.

**Introduce yourself!!!** Your life will not be turned upside down and there are still people of good will ready to support you to make the task easier, so don't hesitate!!!

“There are always thankless tasks that must nevertheless be accomplished without putting them off until tomorrow.”

Friendships and brotherhood.

Ivan Stol
