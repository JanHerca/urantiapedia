In Rimini, on the shores of the Adriatic and opposite Croatia, kilometers of beaches hosted this third Franco-Italian meeting.

They are now in the list of ectors_urantians_italians@urantia.fr.

Unlike other times, the subject was decided by the Italians, and as a result we let them manage this meeting, which allowed them to understand that they could get through it properly. Of course, with five French students who were long-time readers, we were able to provide satisfactory support for their questions, but we instead oriented the subject by asking basic questions to get them to look for:

Who is God for us

What does he do for us (directly and indirectly)

Who are other humans for us?

So what should we do for others? Italians have big hearts, hot blood and raw emotion. Discussions sometimes drifted to topics like “how to make The Urantia Book known or how to approach people.”

I regret a little that Danielle La Scala Martinet does not have more opportunity to express herself, spending her time translating everyone's words. Her determination, supported by the Italians, to develop groups in Italy is remarkable.

Two and a half days is short for a national meeting. It's a pleasure to see new faces and our enthusiasm convinced another person to read The Urantia Book.

What more can I say, except that I suppose you can imagine the atmosphere that is created during such meetings.
