Dear French-speaking readers, for the twentieth anniversary of our association, the AFLUB office wishes to compile the main events that have made its history to reconstruct the chronology as faithfully as possible and present them in a synthetic manner following a historical methodology.

To do this we need your testimonies, your documents, your photos and more generally any document presenting content or historical value.

Since we are reconstructing the past, we might as well go back as far as possible and also compile all the memories and documents from the very beginning, namely 1961 until 1995, the date of the end of the CERDH. What we are sorely lacking in the archives are documents from the very first period, from 1961 to 1981, including photos of meetings, reports, detailed events. If you have such documents in your possession or if you know people among your relatives who have them, we ask you to send them to us. We will return them to you after scanning them.

A summary of this historical compilation will be presented in the Link of December 15, 2016. For the AFLLU office

The President
