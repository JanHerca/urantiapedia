Dear fraternity of readers, each crisis brings new experiences, and if they are global, their results are even more profound. Faced with the difficulties they bring, we must evaluate failures, errors and priorities. Some people are in disarray because, having no ideal, do not really understand the situation and are lost and helpless. Others try to take advantage of the situation to obtain more privileges. The wisest will use their discernment to improve their perceptions and their cosmic consciousness.

Most people know that they are missing something but wait for someone to come out of the shadows to bring it to them instead of looking for it themselves. Today, even religious institutions, confusing rigor and righteousness, morality and justice, society and fraternity, have not been able to understand these constantly evolving needs. Humanist materialism itself is not the consequence of the attitude of scholars but of the use of this knowledge by incompetent or ill-intentioned people.

Has Man remained cloistered in fear and ignorance? Has he tried to understand the flaws of the system to develop more viable models? Will he have the courage to respond to the spirit of truth and its adjuster? The future will tell us. In the meantime, here are some poetic research and/or understandings carried out by our friends. So, enjoy reading.

Friendships — Ivan.
