## Introduction

This 2017 meeting took place during the election period, so attendance was lower and people a little tense.

The general topic was “the influence of THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH on each person’s spirituality” but plenty of free time was left for individual discussions.

A general assembly took place, with, on the agenda, the situation of the association, aid to French-speaking people in Africa, and the renewal of executive members.
Present were 16 members (out of 41) and 8 sympathetic readers.

## The Spirit of Truth

The areas of his influence are poorly perceived by readers because they are difficult to differentiate from those of the angels and the adjuster. The term “comforter” is not sufficient and the example of the apostles finding new energy to courageously launch themselves into the battle of the annunciation of the kingdom of God does not shed much light on what this outpouring really brings.

The fact that since that day social and technological evolution has been accelerated seems to show that this influence is found above all in the greater courage to fight for valid and sure values and discoveries. But these values and discoveries are apparently due to other influences inciting more discernment and a greater use of our intellectual faculties (Adjusters, Angels).

It emerges from this study that a person who truly desires to evolve must use as a priority his total intellectual capacities (the seven adjutant spirits-minds) and discernment (personality) in order to access the highest level of perception (cosmic consciousness and super-consciousness). Then the various spiritual aids can effectively add their influences to direct (Angels), actualize (Adjuster) and confirm (Spirit of Truth).

It should be noted, however, that since it is the Divine Minister who is responsible for the diffusion of this Spirit of Truth, the direct relationship with the higher adjutant mental spirits is beyond doubt.

## General Assembly

The situation of the French association is worrying for several reasons:

- The members are getting old.
- There are no young workers (they prefer to take care of their family exclusively).
- There are no new young people.
- No one is coming forward to renew the leadership.
- Members are leaving.

In France, nothing has been put in place to make The Urantia Book known. It has disappeared from bookstores and the internet does not help to find Urantia if you have not heard of it at least once in a serious way.

Readers don't talk about it too much for fear of being labeled a member of a sect, sects of all kinds having done a lot of harm to us and in spectacular ways, not to mention the dark past of the Catholic Church and the current scandals which are still too numerous.

The terms leader and leadership scare away members who fear dogmatization and the appearance of a new religion. All authority is rejected by readers and only the concept of groups without “learned” is accepted, which is in line with the philosophy of the book.

But today's young people clearly need new, open and evolving ideals, except that, educated in materialistic concepts, invisible realities do not reach them.

So, on the one hand, Europe is waking up, French-speaking Africa is waking up and in the middle, France is struggling to keep up.

However, we remain very attentive to any opportunity that will allow us to catch the wave effectively, having concluded that the trough in which we find ourselves will not last long given the agitation of today's world.

The executive members remain in place until the arrival of a possible renewal. It is necessary to underline a great effort on the part of each in consideration of the various health problems which have prevailed.

## Africa

The African Francophonie was abandoned by a former president, but despite the situation of the association, we want to renew ties with this part of the world. The difficulties are numerous and the means of communication are still weak today, but a good
study of the problem should bring out healthy solutions to help these people find a spiritual renewal adapted to their aspirations.

It is a long-term job that must not be rushed (for translators, this term means throwing into a precipice).

To begin with, we provided a Cameroonian, named Guy Stéphane, with a PC and an internet connection to help him and those around him improve communications.

But material help is not what matters most. All over the world, people do not think deeply enough and nothing really moves forward. We are often criticized for being too intellectual, but this is how evolution will be most effective.

## Conclusion

This meeting was lively, and some key points were updated.

Europe is not America and a heavy past that must be taken into account delays our actions. The exaltation is not openly felt but something powerful is felt deep within those who have discovered this book suggesting a calmer but more rooted awakening if people are given time to take the measure of this revelation.
