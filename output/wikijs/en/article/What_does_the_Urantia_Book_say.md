All universe mind is derived initially from the third person of the Trinity--the Infinite Spirit. The general distribution of mind to the universes is as Cosmic Mind, but to an individual universe it is via the Universe Mother Spirit.

The exception is for non-teachable mechanical mind present in the most primitive forms of material life--which is ministered to by the Master Physical Controllers. This mind-level may also be functional at some level, even among the most advanced forms of animal life.

Animal life, including human beings, is ministered to by the seven Adjutant Mind Spirits which are non-personal derivatives of the  Universe Mother Spirit. These are known by names that reflect their functionality--the adjutants of intuition, understanding, courage, knowledge, counsel, worship, wisdom.

Mortal man first experiences the ministry of  spirit in conjunction with mind when the purely animal mind of evolutionary creatures develops reception capacity for the adjutants of worship and of wisdom. This ministry of the sixth and seventh adjutants indicates mind evolution crossing the threshold of spiritual ministry.

But for the reception of a so-called Thought Adjuster, the indwelling Spirit of God, creature mind must exhibit worship outreach and indicate wisdom function by exhibiting the ability to choose between the emerging values of good and evil--moral choice.

Since the feast of Pentecost following Jesus' resurrection, all normal-minded individuals have been recipients of an indwelling Spirit of the Father. Most commonly this has occurred following the individual's first moral decision--presently averaging at around 6 years of age.

This indwelling Spirit obviously forms a direct bond linking both the mind and the consciousness of each individual with the consciousness of God. This Spirit of God, because it occupies a central place in the brain-mind of the individual, forms a link by which the Spirit of Truth and other spirit forces can gain access to the human brain-mind.

Thus we conclude that the concepts of monistic  idealism and the thoughts presented to us in the Urantia revelation are complementary.
