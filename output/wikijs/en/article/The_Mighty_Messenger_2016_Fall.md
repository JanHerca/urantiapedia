## Fellowship/UAI Unity Meeting

On October 3 – 5, 2016, representatives from the Association and the Fellowship met in Chicago to consider organizational unity. An atmosphere of goodwill prevailed throughout our time together. All of us wholeheartedly agreed that we desire unity. A unity proposal was drafted and will shortly be submitted to both organisations. Further information will be shared as available. 

We thank Urantia Foundation for hosting our unity meeting. As always we felt so welcome, well fed, and looked after in mind, body and spirit. 

And finally, our heartfelt appreciation goes to all for your prayers and support.

## IC 2017 Denver, Colorado

> **“Spreading Our Wings”**
> 5-day Urantia Conference
> with International Good Works Day, Interfaith Festival, Jesus Paintings and Visionary Arts Gallery
> July 19 – 23, 2017 (Pre-conference, July 17 – July 19)
{.is-info}

**Save the dates!** We would like to help you plan for the upcoming International Conference, whether as an attendee, workshop host, or exhibitor. The conference is planned with a full roster of all the usual things we have come to enjoy and expect—plenary speakers with experience and deep insight into the Revelation, workshop presenters on a variety of Urantia Book topics of interest, music, and art. We want you to be assured of that. Some of the fragrant souls now scheduled include familiar names: Angie Thurston, Judy Langston, Gard Jameson, Pato Banton, Nadi Burton, Cristina Seaborn, Ben Bowler, Betina Gray, Derek Samaras, and Patrick Yesh. There is much more to come in the program under the direction of Peter Laurence, Tim Hobbs, and Miranda Clendening, Program Co-Chairs.

Those wishing to submit a proposal to speak or to present a workshop may do so, by December 31, 2016, here: www.ic17.org/workshop-proposals/

As speakers and workshop leaders make proposals over the next three months and are selected, you will be informed as it happens, both in the monthly mini Messenger and at the website, www.ic17.org. Also, if you would like to see a current overview of the conference schedule, you may go to: www.ic17.org/save-the-date/ 

A few additional events will happen in various areas of the Denver University campus that are optional for Urantia Book readers to attend. These are organized as a culmination of ideas largely from the Youth and Young Adult Committee, the International Committee, Interfaith Committee, Outreach Committee, and co-chairs Miranda Clendening and Tim Hobbs who have done a lot of work disseminating The Urantia Book teachings in businesses, the Interfaith world, and education and values systems. These are creative concepts for how we may draw people to discover the book in new and different ways.

The three areas for both seasoned readers and for people most ripe for discovery of the teachings are addressed throughout the conference under the headings of Truth, Beauty and Goodness as follows:
- Emerging Spirituality Day (Truth Discovery) July 20
- International Goodworks Day (Goodness Discovery) July 21
- Inter-Spirituality Day (Truth/Spiritual Unity Discovery) July 22
- Visionary Arts Day (Beauty discovery) July 23

### A special note about the YaYAs

YaYA Multimedia Presentation Night – Thursday July 20

Young Urantian luminaries such as Angie Thurston, Mae Thompson, Geoff Theiss, Teuvo Orjala, and Liz Craig, who established the original Urantia Youth and Young Adult group, together with other young Urantian leaders from around the world, will present their work and visions for the future of the Urantia movement. This will include a multimedia presentation on the many ways the Urantia teachings are being disseminated around the planet by and to young people. (Specific speaker announcements and bios will be announced.)

Some highlights to look for:
- Interfaith Festival (Truth/Spiritual Unity Discovery)
- A large nighttime speaking event focused on drawing millennials and youth, centered on International Good Works (Goodness Discovery)
- Visionary Arts Gallery (Beauty Discovery) which includes mostly Urantia artists’ works, and will also have some artists displaying their works inspired by the cosmic concepts of The Urantia Book 

Some non–Urantia book readers will speak at selected events; they have been especially hand-picked because they are good friends of many people in the Urantia community, are familiar with the book, and have a lot of respect for us. Many are even longtime readers though just not very public about it, who want to share how they beautifully disseminate the teachings. We would love many of you to join these extra events—only if you feel comfortable—and share your beautiful living examples of loving spiritual unity, sharing, brotherhood, and fellowship with our brothers and sisters as The Urantia Book describes in so many places.

It should be noted that the two new evening events were created simply to provide an opportunity where the greater community could participate. This, of course is an experiment, and has not been attempted on such a large scale before. But we feel that now the time is ripe to start “Spreading our Wings,” since we had such a large presence at the Parliament of the World’s Religions and were welcomed with open arms. Many hands and volunteers are working tirelessly to help bring this event to life. We hope you will join us for the familiar, triedand-tested Urantia Conference events, and any of the extra events that appeal to you as well.

“What can I do for the Revelation today?” There is much work to be done—informing and inviting friends, family, and readers; arranging volunteer help; rehearsing music; creating and mounting artwork; preparing workshops; and prayerful logistics. Now, let’s get to work!

Much love,
Miranda Clendening and Tim Hobbs

## Summer Studies in San Antonio

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2016_Fall/005897.jpg">
</figure>

The spirit of the combined Urantia Association United States Summer Conference and The Urantia Book Fellowship Summer Study Session lives on three months after it occurred. A feeling of good will between the readers of the two organizations emerged from the event, held June 9 – 12 in San Antonio. As a consequence, meetings between leaders of the two organizations to discuss future cooperation and unity of purposes are being held.

More than a year ago, Chris Wood, president of the UAI, approached David Kulieke, chair of the Fellowship Education Committee. Since the theme of the UAUS conference was to be “Jesus, the Master Teacher,” Chris felt that its educational theme would make it the perfect opportunity for a joint conference by combining it with the Education’s 2016 Summer Study Sessions for indepth study of The Urantia Book, a two out every three year event.

Once the leadership of the Fellowship agreed, the joint conference was on.

The planning was the charge of the UAUS with Katrina Glavan-Heise, of San Antonio, doing much of the day to day work. Katrina’s herculean efforts paid off with a fine attendance of about 200 people, with healthy representations of many organizations as well as unaffiliated individuals. There were people from all over the world, including a strong representation of young people, who both presented and met together.

The Fellowship Education Committee was given responsibility for the program, and the Program Committee consisted both of members of Education and others. It was ably chaired by Sherry Layton, an adjunct member of the Education Committee. Sherry said, “We were blessed to have the time and talents of our workshop presenters, plenary speakers, and conference organizers, and youth volunteers. Those talents were put to good use for the greatest good.”

There were four main plenary speakers: Mo Siegel, Carolyn Prentice, Jeffrey Wattles, and David Kulieke. Their presentations can be seen at: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQYC6XW8Ev1dVcV1kTXosnJ4CpMU0dbWI.

</figure>

As to be expected in a first-time, joint event such as the San Antonio conference, there was plenty to be learned. David Kulieke stated, “In the end it was extremely valuable to have had this joint event. While it became clear to many of us that such combined efforts in the future will work better if both groups are involved at the beginning, it was also clear that many individuals made new friends with other readers of The Urantia Book and that we liked being with each other. The Fellowship Education Committee was pleased that the conference met expectations for a worthwhile educational experience.”

The desire of leaders to continue work together in the two organizations also reflected the value of this conference.

## Why I Support The Urantia Book Fellowship

by _David Glass_

<figure id="Figure_4" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2016_Fall/005899.jpg">
</figure>

I could hardly remain inactive having read of the Fellowship’s impassioned advocacy for the relief of those souls among us who go un-nourished by the Living Water of truth. (I refer to the brief article in the Summer Fellowship Herald). 

I formerly also knew that craven, directionless restlessness of un-peace back in the early 70s, just before I was helped to launch out on my spiritual venture in quest of truth, no matter what. We DO hold the panacea to the tragic loneliness of the “lives of quiet desperation” all around us. How could we not respond? 

Each of us is called to service in proportion to our endowments and in accordance with the talents given into our stewardship. There is limitless need for ministry to man on our world. We can each do our part. This is our once-in-eternity opportunity to serve as a mortal on our nativity sphere by acting ourselves and by supporting the groups of team-working souls represented by our now-existent and futuristically open-ended service corps. If you feel you lack front-line missionary capacity or are still working on developing it, consider supporting those who are doing more explicit outreach to our world on behalf of the authors of our glorious revelation, replete with its promising future millennia of potential for human good. We have been assured that “religious revelation is essential to the realization of brotherhood on Urantia.” ([UB 52:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p6_2))

Consider the needless anxiety and angst of those without the reassurances of God’s love, the knowledge of man’s spiritual security in a friendly universe, and the awareness of the eager readiness of the Father to make contact with each of his children, to penetrate the veils of isolation and mists of doubt which assail too many earnest truth-seekers today on our gradually awakening planet. Reflect on the satisfactions of the peace of mind you have acquired from perusing the radiant pages of this revelation. It is the intended heritage of every mortal to know of his or her relationship to the Paradise Parent who seeks contact and communion with his confused but infinitely loved planetary progeny.

Please consider joining me in supporting The Urantia Book Fellowship as a means of promoting the Father’s will in a local and much needed manner.

## Happy Birthday

All that night Mary was restless so that neither of them slept much. By the break of day the pangs of childbirth were well in evidence, and at noon, August 21, 7 B.C., with the help and kind ministrations of women fellow travelers, Mary was delivered of a male child. Jesus of Nazareth was born into the world, was wrapped in the clothes which Mary had brought along for such a possible contingency, and laid in a near-by manger. [UB 122:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p8_1)

**Michael Challis**

_Fellowship President_

Michael is from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and a long time reader of The Urantia Book. He was elected in July of 2015 and we all look forward to his leadership and direction.

**John Hales**

_Fellowship Vice-President_

John was introduced to the revelation long before the book was published because both his parents and grandparents were members of the Forum, the group that helped bring the book into existence. In high school he met Dr. Sadler and began attending the meetings. Since there was no published book, you had to visit 533, check out one paper, and read it there.

He began Brotherhood service as a field representative, corresponding with readers and attending new study groups. In 1974 he became resident director in Chicago, and continued this exhilarating service until retiring in 2006. Without fanfare or zealous appeal from his caring forbears, he grew into his deep belief in a heavenly Father who loves each of us and has come to view every person he meets as a spiritual brother or sister.

**Steve Dreier**

_Secretary_

Steve Dreier has studied the teachings of The Urantia Book for more than 40 years. He has served the Fellowship in a variety of capacities, and is currently the Fellowship Secretary. Over the years Steve and his wife Barbara have hosted study groups, attended many conferences, and most important of all, have experienced the life changing consequences resulting from the attempt to follow the teachings of The Urantia Book.

**Emilio Coppola**

_Treasurer_

Emilio started reading The Urantia Book in April 1996, and has attended study groups in several cities throughout the United States. He has served many roles as a member of The Urantia Book Society of Greater New York, and has also been a member of the New England Urantia Book Group (UAI) since 2007. Emilio serves as Treasurer for the Fellowship, as well as for UrantiaUniversity. He has been a member of The Urantia Book Foundation IT Round Table meetings over several different years, and is strongly motivated to disseminate the teachings of The Urantia Book and to serve his brothers and sisters in any way he is able. Where does his energy come from? He says: “The more I read The Urantia Book, the more I want to tell people about it!”

**Lara Amyx**

_Finance Chair_

Lara Amyx has been involved in the Urantia Community for over 25 years. She has been Conference Chair for the Florida annual gatherings, and also Secretary for FSUB previously. She was Chair of the Fellowship’s Membership Committee, and is currently the Chair of Finance. Lara is married to Daniel Amyx, another active Urantia Book reader, and GC member of the Membership Committee. The two of them own and operate two optical shops on the Treasure Coast of Florida, and they use their businesses in personal ministry.

**Dana Bredemeyer**

_Judicial Committee Chair_

He runs a consulting business in system and enterprise architecture, and in addition to study grouping, has served Orvonton Society as T.D.A. delegate, vice president, and currently president.

Dana lives in Southern Indiana with his wife Ruth and their teenage son and daughter. Elected to the General Council in 2012, he is the chairman of the Judicial Committee. Dana is honored, humbled and thrilled to have this opportunity to begin his cosmic citizenship training in this way.

**Geoffrey Theiss**

_Secretary General_

Geoff is a self-discovered, second generation reader. He was born, raised, schooled, and is comfortably settled in the San Francisco Bay Area where he works as a chemical engineer (He makes memory foam!). If you happen to see him during a weekday morning, you may confuse him with a mad scientist. As for his general character, he is two parts enthusiasm junkie, two parts jack-of-all-trades, and one part global adventurer. Mixed into all that and instilled by the teachings of The Urantia Book has been a real, vibrant, and ennobling personal relationship with God that he has been continuously searching to better understand and strengthen. Having found this vibrant Urantia Book community, he has fallen in love—with them and with an emboldened sense of self (and cosmic)-purpose. He is eternally grateful to be alive. And part of being in this new community and part of showing that gratitude is to help enable other people to find the same. (geoff.theiss@gmail.com)

**Janet Graham**

_Membership Committee Chair_

Janet returned for a second term on the General Council after raising three children in a log cabin on the edge of the Oregon wilderness. Her focus on the council is community building between members of the Fellowship and all communities of readers, especially young adults who represent our future leadership. In addition, she serves on the Family Life committee, an adjunct of the Youth and Young Adult committee. The goal is to archive family materials developed during the past 40 years, then add new materials as they are developed.

**Tony Finstad**

_Youth and Young Adult Chair_

Tony was born and raised in Seattle and is currently living in Eastern Oregon. He found the book at 19 and has been involved with the Brotherhood/Fellowship ever since. He feels so blessed to be a part of this beautiful and diverse family of believers. It’s an exciting time in the Urantia community and he is honored to be serving on the GC.

## Two General Council Positions Open

Two seats have become vacant on the General Council (GC) for an 18 month term ending in the summer of 2018.

<figure id="Figure_7" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2016_Fall/005902.jpg">
</figure>

There are 2 prerequisites for eligibility:
1. A candidate must be a member of the Fellowship, either a Member at Large or a Society Member.
2. A candidate must have read The Urantia Book in its entirety, at least once.

This is a special election to fill vacant seats. General Councilors are typically elected by the Triennial Delegate Assembly (TDA). Every three years representatives from regional Urantia societies come together with the task of electing or reelecting 12 full term Councilors. A full term lasts for nine years. Occasionally someone resigns before their term has expired, as in this case. The General Council must then elect someone to fill such seats temporarily until the TDA reconvenes.

The General Council is a deliberative body which guides the overall direction of The Urantia Book Fellowship. The GC elects the Fellowship’s 5 officers as well as the chairmen/women who head up our 9 standing committees. These 14 people are called the Executive Committee. The GC also has the power to create by-laws and change the Fellowship’s constitution. You can read more about the General Council from our constitution by going to our site, www.urantiabook.org, and looking under “About Us” on the main menu.

Membership on the GC involves attending just two meetings per year. Meetings are held over a weekend and in a variety of locations across North America. Meetings typically occur in February (in a warm climate) and again at the close of, and in conjunction with, the Fellowship’s summer conference. General Council meetings begin on Friday evening for about 4 hours, then resume on Saturday morning for 8 hours and again on Sunday morning, ending at noon. Saturday night is usually held open for a social with readers from the area where the meeting is held. We vary the location of meetings to allow for this fellowship and to facilitate local readers getting to know the leaders of the Fellowship. This event is often a highlight at Council meetings. Sometimes another day may be added to the GC meeting for a retreat.

Meeting agendas typically consist of reports by the officers, and standing committee chairs, discussion of policy, and proposals for new arenas of service and dissemination. Meetings are presided over by the Fellowship’s President and are run according to Roberts Rules of Order.

It’s important to note that Councilors must be able to cover their own costs to attend meetings. This includes travel to the meeting, hotel room, and meals. Occasional financial assistance may be available to Councilors if circumstances leave them unable to meet these expenses.

Being on the Fellowship’s General Council is an amazing experience. Some General Councilors have served for 2, 3 and 4 9-year terms. Lifelong friendships are established and the beauty of deliberation, group wisdom and teamwork is illuminated in remarkable and inspiring ways.

If you feel you would like to join the long list of General Councilors who have served the Urantia movement faithfully for 60 years, you can find and fill out our “Application for Organizational Service” again found on the “About Us” page. Scroll down the page to find the application links. Please call the office at 303-467-7858 if you need help with this.

If you are not elected at our upcoming meeting in February, your application will be held over for future consideration. If you have already sent us an application in the past and would like to be considered again, let the office know. You don’t need to apply twice. 

## Education Committee Expands Its Endeavors

By _David Kulieke_, Chair

The members of The Urantia Book Fellowship Education Committee are dedicated to enhancing the quality of education and study of The Urantia Book within the community of readers as well as devising means to bring the teachings and spiritual beauties of the book to the world. We pursue these goals by applying principles and pedagogies drawn from the wisdom of human educators throughout history and using lessons about education from The Urantia Book itself.

2016 was an exciting year because of the joint conference in which we participated with Urantia Association United States. Because of the educational theme, “Jesus the Master Teacher,” the UAUS asked us to combine our normal Summer Study Session with their annual conference, which was already scheduled for June 2016 in San Antonio. Sherry Layton, who is an adjunct member of the Education Committee, chaired the Program Committee for the conference. In addition to the wealth of plenaries and workshops, the conference proved to be a crucible in which new friendships and a stronger feeling of unity between the two organizations was forged.

In addition, the committee has been looking for ways to bring its efforts into the field. This year the committee scheduled its annual weekend meeting in Fort Wayne, Indiana. On Saturday afternoon and evening, members of the committee presented a workshop and dinner for local readers, including members of the Fort Wayne Society. The workshop, “The 12 Apostles,” was an opportunity take materials that the committee is developing and practice its principles.

This workshop, together with many other education materials, can be procured on the Education Committee’s webpage, which can found under the tab “Study” on The Urantia Book Fellowship website. Among the free materials are the “12 Apostles” and other study and workshop materials to be downloaded and used by any group or individual. One can find these workshops under “Resources.” Other valuable resources are a multiple page “Prime Education References from The Urantia Book by Category” and a colorful “Community: Beginning and Organizing Effective Study Groups.” The committee is working hard to enhance its website, add to the resources readers can use, and to develop more services useful to the Urantia community.

During a weekend meeting of the Education Committee in Ft. Wayne, IN October 7 – 9, we invited members or attendees of the Ft. Wayne Society to come to a two hour afternoon workshop. We used our first Study Group Lesson Plan, which is on the website, “The 12 Apostles,” complete with color handout. After an introduction and a full group analysis of Thomas, we broke the group into five, with one of our Education Committee people in each group (the Alphaeus twins were treated together.) Then we all reported back and looked for patterns.

After the workshop we provided a dinner through the hotel catering (the Holiday Inn at which we stayed and met was excellent). Both the workshop and dinner were a great success. There was a great deal of warmth and camaraderie, as well as good study.

This was the first in a long-planned experiment to bring a workshop founded in educational principles to the field as opposed to doing so in a summer study session, seminar, or conference. I have budgeted for a trip to a second group this spring to continue experimenting with in the field events, probably either in Ann Arbor or Cincinnati. The ancillary objective was to support the local group. After we’ve done this a few times, we intend to broaden the scope of where we will go or send people.

The Oklahoma Urantia Society will be celebrating Jesus’ birthday with a scientific symposium, August 18-21, 2017 which will include viewing a rare solar eclipse.

This scientific symposium is our fourth. It’s a little different in that each talk will be relatively short and condensed in understandable language. We will have the Kansas City astronomy club with us with their scopes as well as our own learned UB astronomers. 

We want you to be engaged, be enlightened, touched spiritually, and bond with those of us attending—we will be intimately together for an entire weekend.

This is a bunk house retreat center. There are 5 rooms that will house couples and the rest are bunk beds with many to a room.

The registration link will be sent out via many methods but if you don’t see it, please email one of us and we will send it to you.

## Urantia Conference in Russia

Lila and I and our friend, Dan Amyx, returned home this Monday from what was the “First Urantia Conference in Russia” held over the weekend beginning Friday, September 9th in a hotel/spa just outside of Moscow. A total of twenty three participants attended, most of them from Moscow, a few from other parts of Russia (including one from as far as Vladivostok), three from Ukraine, one from Finland, one from Colombia, and three of us from the U.S.

The conference had been organized by Tamila Ragimova, a native of Baku, Azerbaijan, who now resides in Medellin, Colombia. Lila had gotten wind of the conference less than three months ago and soon thereafter we decided to give it a go. Dan, who had lived and studied in Russia some twenty years ago, enthusiastically joined us. Tamila had indicated clearly at the outset that the entire conference would be conducted in Russian only and that no plans had been made for interpretation into other languages. That and the experimental nature of the first such attempt in Russia, were the primary reasons why the conference had not been widely publicized.

As it turned out, there were a few bilingual (Russian – English) speakers in the crowd, notably Tamila, Eija Seppanen-Bolotinski from Finland, Anton Miroshnichenko from Ukraine, and, of course, Lila; so Dan and I, whose Russian language skills are limited, received a little – perhaps more than expected – help from our friends. In fact, Eija, who is fluent in both Russian and English in addition to her native Finnish, veered from her original plan and conducted an interactive workshop for English speakers on John the Baptist.

A wide range of topics were touched upon in plenaries and workshops, including cosmology and science, religious and spiritual growth, the life and teachings of Jesus, and the meaning of life. Most of the participants seemed to know the book quite well. Discussions were sometimes spirited—even heated—when it came to interpretations of some UB concepts. Yet, despite these intellectual differences, the pervasive feel of the gathering—at least from my perspective—was one of comradery and unity of spirit. Informal social gatherings in the evenings included story-telling, poetry reading, and music—classical and folk—supplied by some of the highly talented attendees.

The highlight of Saturday evening was a gala event in an ornate dining room at the hotel. There was great food, a series of champagne toasts by the participants, music and dance. It was a blast!

The group does not appear (so far) to identify itself with any formal Urantia organization and the conference was not sponsored by any organization. Toward the end of the conference, Anton, a UAI representative in Ukraine, gave a detailed power-point presentation on the structure and function of that organization.

There was talk in the group about planning the next Russian conference and beginning to look at potential sites. The possibility of simultaneous interpretation that would allow for greater participation of English speakers was also discussed.

## Books To Nigeria

By _Buck Weimer_

It all began in 2011. The International Fellowship Committee assembled a most joyous team of diverse believers for the Ghana Book Fair in Africa (Charlene Morrow, Joan Evans, Arlene Weimer, Ed Harrigan, Tim Hobbs, and myself).

On the second day of the Fair, and to our great amazement, Emeka Anazodo presented himself at our hotel ready to work with us at the booth. Emeka, an engineer from Lagos, Nigeria, traveled by bus the 336 miles to Ghana and somehow located us at our hotel. Having found The Urantia Book on the internet, and after just a few corresponding emails about the Ghana Book Fair, said he would be there.

He seamlessly fit into the unity of our team and was very instrumental in explaining the Revelation to visitors coming to our booth. He also was a great help in the follow-up conference, and was influential during the leadership meeting, As we separated, he said: “Why not have a Urantia Book booth at the Nigerian Book Fair next year?”

In May of 2012, another fantastic team of believers set up a booth at the Nigerian International Book Fair at the University of Lagos. Ed Harrigan arrived a week early. Also from Alaska, Barbara Maier and Marilyn Cooner arrived near the same time as Charlene Morrow, Arlene Weimer, and myself. Additionally, we had the assistance of another local reader—Patrick Foh, two new readers from Ghana; and later by Julius Taiwo, the local Urantia Foundation representative.

This may have been our most successful book fair in all of Africa. All of our books were sold, the University of Lagos radio station gave free air-time, the campus facilities were open and available, and a study group got started and still meets to this day.

Historically, the major problem we’ve encountered when trying to ship large quantities of Urantia Books overseas has been identifying a customs broker who would get the books off the boat, through the legal process, and into the hands of our contact reader(s). This problem was solved when Patrick Foh, a businessman, introduced us to Muvi Brown-Ogha, a Nigerian businessman in the import/export business out of Miami, FL. Muvi agreed to ship the books by boat to Lagos, Nigeria, and facilitate the customs process.

On June 23, 2016 Paula Thompson and Joann Wiedman accessed the Pipeline of Light to facilitate the transportation by truck of one pallet of Urantia Books in English (thirty-three cases, 198 books in all) to ATI Container Service in Miami, FL. For a total cost of $400.00 Muvi placed them on a boat for Nigeria on June 23, 2016. 

Then, on September 24, this email was received from Emeka: “It is with great pleasure that I announce that we have received the books. Please find attached pictures we took at the ware house of the logistics company that shipped the books.” 

What a thrill it was to receive this message; as it was for the Fellowship Office Managers, the Pipeline of Light, the Northern Light Society, and the past and present members of the International Fellowship Committee.

These books were sent to the leaders in Nigeria free of cost. Our agreement with them is that, when they are ready for a second shipment of Urantia Books, the cost to them will be half. 

It is our fervent hope that this method of getting large quantities of books into the hands of our international brothers and sisters will become the model for delivery of Urantia Books wherever the need exists.
