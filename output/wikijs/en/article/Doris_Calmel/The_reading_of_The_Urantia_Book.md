(Presentation given at the Urantia Book European Readers Conference held in Berlin, Germany in August 2014)

> _True religion must ever be, at one and the same time, the eternal foundation and the guiding star of all enduring civilizations._ (<a id="a40_134"></a>[UB 92:7.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p7_15))

Reading _The Urantia Book_ allows man to find his essence, live it and transmit it. As?

I received the book as a gift in 1993 and, seeing its thickness, I put it aside for a long time. Later, by recommendation, I began reading the life of Jesus, but in a homeopathic way. Finally, the content fascinated me. The group readings encouraged me to continue, but I was looking for more and above all I was looking for how to integrate, apply and live these values in daily life. Well, if we only read the book, we stay in the intellectual, which can also be interesting but the event of a revelation will not be experienced. The relationship with God is possible if we want to know him, but for this it is necessary to know oneself.

Since there is only one way to answer this, authenticity, I will talk about my experience since I got to know the book and my search.

Thanks to my diverse background, I have been able to specialize in psychoanalysis, an extremely sweet approach that invites the client to get in touch with their deepest part. People of all ages, origins and confessions are freed from memories submerged in the depths of themselves and of which they were not fully aware. Naturally, I will not reveal these contents and will only cite the most outstanding data related to _The Urantia Book_.

It is above all the contribution received through these psychoanalysis sessions that has prompted me to delve into the analogies of the book in relation to human psychology. The people under analysis did not know _The Urantia Book_ at all, and yet they gave me indications that could only refer to _The Urantia Book_.

Everything fit in order to be able to study in the company of various people, including philosophers and psychologists, all for years. We have reflected on the indications of _The Urantia Book_ about the human being and, above all, about its concordance in our lives.

Already in <a id="a58_11"></a>[UB 0:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p5_11), in the Prologue of the book, we have this magnificent phrase:

> _The personality is the unique bestowal which the Universal Father makes upon the living and associated energies of matter, mind, and spirit, and which survives with the survival of the morontial soul._ (<a id="a60_206"></a>[UB 0:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p5_11))

Which means:

> _The love of the Father absolutely individualizes each personality as a unique child of the Universal Father, a child without duplicate in infinity, a will creature irreplaceable in all eternity._ (<a id="a64_200"></a>[UB 12:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p7_9))

The importance of the beginning of the sentence appeared before me especially during psychoanalysis sessions that included the conception of the human being. Analysis performed during those sessions was linked to his cellular memory. That moment gives them a unique happiness of love.

According to his explanations, they said: he was in a state of extraordinary love. I would love to find a love like that again.

This love that is felt again allows us to understand all its development from the embryonic stage until its birth. This personality to come carries choices and decisions solely out of love. And it is the functioning of the powers of the personality that allows a goal to be achieved, even when it is not favorable for the future being.

In the psychoanalysis sessions, I did not understand that the embryo or the fetus made a choice for its own survival. That choice of love mainly concerns his mom, his twin or another member of his future family. An embryo is a sponge of feelings and emotions of its mother and of the people around her. His desire is to love them. The fetus adapts in the best way to its mother's life, and is even capable of starting her premature birth. In any case, it is by his will that birth is set in motion. Any medical intervention to cause the birth is an act against her will that often entails complications for her life.

Each human is endowed with a unique, real, invariable personality (not to be confused with character), which gathers the whole in itself.

And what is this personality made of? Of the individual will that involves powers: emergency, choice, judgment, power, decision, cooperation, love.

Emergence of ideas that become ideals, since the idea itself is somewhat ephemeral, but making it an ideal leads it to go further.

It is at this moment that we can make a choice, whether to continue moving forward with this ideal or not; this is also called free will.

In this way, we judge the feasibility of the ideal, whatever it may be.

Next, we decide to experience the accessibility of the ideal and even go further and make it a reality.

We have reached a stage where we can assess the progression of this ideal.

Finally, we like to share our ideal and we find people around us who collaborate to make it come true. In the Foreword to _The Urantia Book_, on page 9, we also find this phrase:

> _Personality is the one changeless reality in an otherwise ever-changing creature experience; and it unifies all other associated factors of individuality._ (<a id="a90_160"></a>[UB 0:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p5_11))

The personality that God gives to every man is destined to be eternal, but man must want it and ask for it! The personality is endowed with powers adapted to the framework of life in which man lives. The powers of the personality are not static; They evolve according to the needs for the survival of the human being.

What I have also learned from psychoanalysis sessions are the descriptions of light rays that went inside and that caused the effect of a pleasant awakening.

From then on, the person would tell me that she was pushing forward, from time to time, which made her feel lifted, even weightless, very nice and confident as she moved forward.

Is it the advice and intuition helpers that are working?

Then come the questions: who am I, what am I doing here, hence the search for understanding.

The helper of understanding allows the fetus to memorize and begin to structure its being. It is a moment of understanding that allows you to start the birth.

To do this, you need the helper of courage and action; In any case, he needs courage to let himself fall into the womb, to dare to react or to be completely calm if the circumstances of his mother's life demand it.

Naturally, the helper of curiosity and adventure is an important engine in your intrauterine life. The fetus explores the world in which it lives, and the same with its own body.

The assistant of the association makes him demand first of all his mother. Is she aware that he is there, that she wants him, is he in agreement with her desire?

Regardless, all his emotions are focused on her, he will do everything in his power to satisfy even the smallest of desires he feels inside the womb.

After birth, the baby leaves a world that was doing well for him. There is a whole structure already built that you will have to adapt to your new framework of life.

I even affirm that the Thought Adjuster has already performed its service during the development of the fetus, from the fact that the fetus is capable of making admirable and loving choices for the benefit of its mother or a twin.

I know that what I affirm is not very scientific.

With the teachings of _The Urantia Book_, we also learn that each human being has an individual relationship with God thanks to his Adjuster. When speaking of the Adjuster, I will also develop in a simple way its magnificent contribution to the human being:

> _The Adjusters are the actuality of the Father’s love incarnate in the souls of men; they are the veritable promise of man’s eternal career imprisoned within the mortal mind;_ (<a id="a124_179"></a>[UB 107:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p0_2))

This sentence contains three very important phases:

The love of the Father found in this fragment constitutes our soul and the mission of the fragment is to make the soul grow without imposing its will in any way. There, I speak of the divine will; the will of the human being always prevails (through his personality). Which also means that it is the human being who surrenders his will, so that the will of God can prevail. The fragment, also called Mystery Monitor, Consciousness Adjuster, is essentially in charge of making the human being evolve, but it does not interfere in their life in any way, except if the human being requests it, and even then... the answer is not necessarily what we expect.

Locked up in the minds of mortals, with so much time without the human being being interested in God or seeking to get closer to him, the fragment hopes to manifest itself. When the human conscience opens, it becomes aware of what this means: God is in you. There is like an extension of life itself. There is inner peace, serenity settles. At that moment we live fully and we mean that every moment is a blessing. I even affirm that it is about that love memorized in our first cells that returns, our own “soul mate”.

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV39/03.jpg">
</figure>

The true promise of the eternal career of men is that fragment that accompanies us after material death to send us through multiple spiritual careers towards eternity, towards divine perfection. But, there is a but: you have to ask for it!

> _Can you really realize the true significance of the Adjuster’s indwelling? Do you really fathom what it means to have an absolute fragment of the absolute and infinite Deity, the Universal Father, indwelling and fusing with your finite mortal natures?_ (<a id="a138_257"></a>[UB 107:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p4_7))

You have understood it well; the goal of the Adjuster, who represents God himself, is to merge with us in order to take us to HIM, but HE must wait for us to want!

The fact is that _The Urantia Book_ is not easy to read and even intimidating, its writing is too complicated and it becomes incomprehensible, too intellectual. These are reproaches that we often hear.

For this reason, I sought to find a means to be able to assimilate it in another way, and that was offered to me by this reflection group. We have produced texts, and this reasoning has inspired me to the point of completing a first paper received in 2008 from the former president of Urantia Association International. This is how I have developed presentations for the Internet in French and German.

It is about explaining to seekers our human functioning in relation to the explanations of _The Urantia Book_. How can we live it and develop it in the here and now. The human being asks for explanations that concern him about his life and his future. How you will increase your understanding of life, how to better live in harmony with yourself and with others. Well, precisely we have to develop fraternity. We are all equal before God, regardless of the religion in which we live. Each one is endowed with his own personality, has access to 7 helpers and possesses a Thought Adjuster. Only fraternity can bring us equality and finally freedom.

During a meeting at the European level, I had the opportunity to meet readers prepared to develop the presentation work. Finally, these pages have been translated into English, Dutch, Spanish, Hungarian and other languages will follow. You can read them on the Urantia Association International website, [www.urantia-uai.org](https://urantia-association.org/), after choosing your preferred language. You can also invite people from your environment to consult these presentations.

These readings will allow you to verify for yourselves the data issued; Only in this way will you arrive at your own revelation, which will unite you with God according to your desires.

An elderly reader friend has summarized the essentials in a poem and, with her permission, I am going to read it to you:

## The Designs of God

Shouldn't God's designs come true?
It is important that I know them in order to collaborate.
He has given me qualities:

<p style="text-align:center;">
Thought and personality<br>
So that He can reach me,<br>
And I even Him.<br>
It is something that is done discreetly and without noise<br>
Well, it is an experience of faith...<br>
<br>
From all eternity, I was a potential<br>
Destined to become actual.<br>
<br>
When the earth welcomed me<br>
The Father settled in me through his Spirit<br>
That illuminates me and guides me to Paradise.<br>
Leaving this world, Jesus left<br>
To the Spirit of Truth to be with each one.<br>
Reveals their common love<br>
In order that, in our turn,<br>
Like a channel we let it through<br>
Towards our brothers and that can also be revealed.<br>
<br>
Thus, divine wisdom works in the universe and in humanity<br>
What are frameworks that allow us to grow and evolve<br>
To perfection, look like him to manifest it.<br>
<br>
He is everything, he is in everything and everywhere.<br>
Every creature has its existence in Him.<br>
It is our light and our life<br>
In order for us all to be together...<br>
</p>
