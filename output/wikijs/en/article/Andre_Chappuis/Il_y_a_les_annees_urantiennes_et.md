Mr Royer's article on Anova in Link No. 9 is interesting, because it allows us to realize the antiquity of the presence of human beings in our cosmic region.

There are, however, more than two ways of estimating the age of humanity from Anova. I indicate here two others whose results are quite far from what Mr. Royer found.

1. At the time of the rebellion 200,000 years ago (<a id="a41_51"></a>[UB 61:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p7_4)), Lucifer was the administrator of 607 inhabited worlds (<a id="a41_150"></a>[UB 53:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p1_1)). Since Urantia was assigned No. 606 a million years ago, for the next 800,000 years there was only one new inhabited world. Assuming that the rebellion took place shortly before the recognition of world 608, it might be said that there is a new planet every 800,000: 2 = 400,000 years. According to this calculation system, Anova would be 400,000 years old x 608 = 243,200,000 years old, plus the 200,000 years that have passed since the rebellion = 243,400,000 years old, which is 5.5 times more than the highest age found by Mr. Royer.
2. We know, however, that this calculation is not correct since it is contradicted by the fact that in the 200,000 years preceding us, there have been 12 new planets: Nos. 608 to 619. Taking only this data into account, we would have a new planet every 200,000 years: 12 = 16,666 years. The age of Anova would then be 16,666 x 619 = 3,650,000 years; it would thus take on a real “facelift”. This would be 8.83 times less than the lowest age found by Mr. Royer. None of these calculation systems are exact since they only take into account one piece of data. They simply allow us to say that the time when Anova was recognized as an inhabited sphere can be located between 3.65 and 243.4 million years.

To make a similar calculation, we would have to take into account all the data, but we do not know them, and it is likely that the unpredictable accidents of evolution do not allow it (see bottom 705 and top 706). From the above, it emerges that the recognition of human presence is rather done in waves since we had one for 800,000 years then 12 over the following 200,000 years.

The time it takes from the dawn of life until the first man and woman appear is not necessarily the same for all types of humanity (see bottom 560 and top 564). There may also be a difference between normal and decimal planets.

Urantia (decimal planet) does not have the number 600 or 610. This possibly means that if these planets are systematically designated after 9 other normal ones, more time elapses between the appearance of life and the arrival of man. Urantia was perhaps the 600th planet of Satania to receive life, but the tests made by the Life Carriers took so long that the 6 normal planets where life was implanted later saw the appearance of man before Urantia.

In conclusion, we can say that there is no fixed number of years between the successive recognitions of inhabited worlds, and that the same is true for the time that elapses between the implantation of life and the appearance of man; it depends too much on local conditions. Even the Universal Censor who transmitted to us Paper 15 is unaware of it, since in <a id="a50_359"></a>[UB 15:14.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p14_5) we read: “_More than 200 other planets of this system are evolving favorably to become inhabited worlds <ins>in a still undetermined future</ins>.” The Melchizedek who presents Paper 49 to us specifies in 559:26 that this will be within a few million years. Since he is addressing the readers of The Urantia Book, he speaks to us of our years of 365 1⁄4 days. This is not necessarily the case every time the word “year” is used in the 5th Revelation (see <a id="a50_858"></a>[UB 15:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p7_2) and <a id="a50_904"></a>[UB 33:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p7_3)).

In my text, it is not a question of Uversian or Nebadonian years, but of those which are specific to each of the inhabited spheres. On the neighboring planet described in booklet 72 (pp. <a id="a52_187"></a>[UB 72:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p0_1) to <a id="a52_232"></a>[UB 72:12.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p12_5)), the local year is considerably longer than on Urantia (<a id="a52_333"></a>[UB 72:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p3_9)). If up there the years are worth, for example, 3 of ours, the earliest marriages would take place when 60 of our years have passed (see <a id="a52_512"></a>[UB 72:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p4_5)). On an inhabited world, the course of life would therefore be according to the length of the year on the world in question, which from one planet to another, would modify the real time elapsed between the appearance of life and that of man.

Regarding the numbers that Mr. Royer took to make his addition, there is a mix between the Urantian years (numbers 1 and 4) and the planetary years (number 6) (<a id="a54_160"></a>[UB 52:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p7_2)). It would seem that we have planetary years for the numbers 2 and 3, and Urantian years for the number 5. But, because of the large approximations that are given, we can still use, for lack of anything better, these two kinds of years to make an evaluation.

Anova belongs to a complex astronomical system (see <a id="a56_52"></a>[UB 49:0.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p0_5)). What do the Anovians call a year? The circuit of their sphere around the enormous dark planet? The duration of its orbit? Or the time it takes for the three suns to revolve around their center of gravity? I suppose they take into account the year of the dark planet.

Being part of a triple system, Anova is perhaps the planet with the longest year in all of Satania. Given the above, I think that it reached the 7th stage less than 30 million years ago, but that it has been there for several million years. The mixture of year types and the approximations given do not allow us to be more precise.
