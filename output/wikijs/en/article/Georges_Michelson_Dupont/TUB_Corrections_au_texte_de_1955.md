## A Little History

The first three parts of _The Urantia Book_ were completed and certified by the Revelation Commission in 1934 A.D. The papers on the life of Jesus were not issued until 1935. The Revelation Commission then asked the members of the Forum to look again at the text and ask any questions that might “clarify concepts” and “remove all ambiguities.” Questions were accepted until 1942.

On November 1, 1941, Donnelly began the process of composing the Introduction. The text was now in typewritten form. By the end of 1942, the text was completely typeset. Proofing could then begin. This took place over a period of more than 10 years (between 1942 and 1950). Each page was typeset by a typographer at Donnelly's press in order to produce a proof. It was carefully checked and compared to the corresponding page typed by Emma Christensen (one of the four people making up the Human Contact Committee) in order to detect and correct typos, punctuation errors, and typographical and/or grammatical errors. It was a monk's work, some pages were retyped up to five times. During this entire period of control it is interesting to note that the developers informed the contact committee that six significant errors remained. Three or four were found, approved by the developers and corrected.

The text published in September 1955 is unique because it was the first printing. Only 10,000 copies were printed. Typographical errors existed in the first printing, this fact was known at the time of its publication. The correction process continued and the most obvious errors were corrected in the first printings that followed.

In 1981, before his death, Christy wrote a response to a reader who was looking for errors:

“I know you have worked hard to flush out these errors, but we have strict guidelines to keep the text as it is. Therefore, we do not correct any errors unless they are typographical, spelling, or punctuation errors. You and I cannot rewrite the Urantia revelation. The text is as close a copy as we can make of the work of the midwayers.”

## Standard Reference text

Finally, in 2007, a committee was formed to conduct a systematic analysis of the text, search for errors, and identify their nature according to a list of defined criteria. The Standard Reference Text (SRT) is the result of this committee's extensive efforts and is the most error-free text we can produce to date. This is why it was adopted by Urantia Foundation and Urantia Book Fellowship after its availability in 2010.

Urantia Foundation still has the original 1955 text and intends to republish it to provide scholars and students with the opportunity to make comparisons.

## List of Corrections

Below we list the number of corrections made during the various printings, classifying them by nature.

Using a methodical process and presenting the results on an Excel spreadsheet, the SRT committee reviewed over 350 items, adopting only 142 minor corrections related to the 1955 printing.

These corrections, some with multiple occurrences, are found in 176 paragraphs. The vast majority of these corrections were already included in previous printings; nevertheless, each item has been confirmed for the sake of simplicity and consistency. A classification of the nature of these errors includes:

1. “**Spelling**” includes misspelled words, incomplete words, divisions, spacing, and singular, plural, or possessive word forms.
2. “**Commas and punctuation**” includes adding, removing, or moving a comma; correcting the use of quotation marks and brackets; and some periods, semicolons, and other associated typographical marks.
3. “**Format**” includes capitalization, italics, writing a word or number, and position in the table of contents.
4. “**Grammar**” includes the use of pronouns, prepositions and articles.
5. “**Factual consistency**” mainly takes into account elements whose correction was made necessary by a digital shortcut used in the transcription process.

A general summary of these 142 articles is as follows:

- _Spelling_: 72 corrections
- _Commas and various punctuation_: 25 corrections
- _Format_: 25 corrections
- _Grammar_: 10 corrections
- _Factual consistency_: 10 corrections

For the sake of transparency, the work of the committee has been placed on the Urantia Foundation website at the following address:

which allows everyone to examine this process and draw their own conclusions about the work carried out.
