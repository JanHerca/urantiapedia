We all know that a planetary diffusion of the Fifth Revelation will only take place if the original text _The URANTIA Book_ is translated into the languages of the races and peoples of Urantia. This obligation is included in the “Declaration of Trust” governing the URANTIA Foundation and this is why, given the importance of the task, it seemed necessary to bring together in one place, not only the Trustees of the Foundation (thus emphasizing the interest they had in this mission) but also all the people of good will who, directly or indirectly, have been or are involved in a translation process.

URANTIA Foundation, with the help of passionate and dedicated readers, has undertaken seven translations and one correction, and continues to actively seek talented and willing individuals who might join in this unprecedented effort to extend the reach of the 5th Revelation to every continent.

Translators from **Estonia**, **Italy**, **German-speaking Switzerland**, **Spain**, **Sweden**, **Russia**, **Holland**, **Korea** but also former translators from Finland and France came together to compare ideas and share each other's experiences with the aim of enriching the group.

Thus, from the sharing of these multiple and enriching experiences, guidelines have emerged, conditions which ensure optimal quality for future translations.

Here are some conclusions drawn from this conference which was fascinating in more ways than one.

***<ins>The translator must believe in the teachings of the Book:</ins>***

This 2196-page book is not an easy text to translate for multiple reasons. Not only are the concepts presented of a very high intellectual level, requiring from translators an understanding that can only be acquired with time and meditation, but it also contains a message of a spiritual level that requires translators to believe in its teachings and be sensitive to the spirit of Truth to render its spiritual fragrance.

This is why it is impossible to use professional translators unless they are, themselves, convinced readers.

***<ins>The need for teamwork:</ins>***

“Traduttore tradittore” (to translate is to betray) said an Italian author and this is the dilemma we are faced with. We must find the right balance between essential fidelity to the original text and the fluidity of a literary translation.

Avoid personal interpretation at all costs. The translator must remain transparent. The most effective way is therefore to work as a team. The confrontation of multiple interpretations leads to greater objectivity.

> This dilemma was expressed by a famous formula that dates back to the Renaissance: “Translations are like women: if they are beautiful, they are not faithful, and if they are faithful, they are not beautiful.” In this regard, Rénato Paggioli rightly noted that, in any artistic work, beauty is the highest degree of fidelity, while ugliness is synonymous with infidelity and betrayal. (J.C. Margot: Traduire sans trahir -p.31)

***<ins>Qualities required of the translation team:</ins>***

The team must include a minimum of two people and a maximum of five, the ideal number being three. Among them we must find a perfect bilingual, a long-time reader, a good linguist in love with his language, all of whom are committed to living a shared experience, requiring patience, understanding, tolerance, a lot of love and the desire to serve humbly and anonymously.

***<ins>Organization and procedures:</ins>***

The team must include a chief translator and teammates. The first draft, produced by the chief translator, is then given to teammates for correction. The use of modern computer resources is strongly recommended at this stage because a good word processor incorporates the partners' suggestions without modifying the original text. Once accepted, the changes are imported into the text. Each team must find its own rhythm and organization.

***<ins>Financing:</ins>***

The URANTIA Foundation, to finance the translations, operates with the help of donations because the sale of the books, given their public price, is in deficit. It is therefore necessary to appeal to the generosity and commitment of readers to help finance the translations. This is how the Finnish Urantia Society has financed half of the cost of the Estonian translation for more than two years. The reader should know that translating the _URANTIA Book_ represents a financial effort of 1,000,000 French francs per language, spread over an average of six years. Faced with the enormity of these sums, we are all challenged and invited to participate, according to our means, in this effort of cosmic scope. The Paris office of the Foundation is authorized to receive your donations.

***<ins>Conclusion</ins>***

The URANTIA Foundation needs the help and support of the entire Urantia readership to successfully carry out this historic planetary mission. With the imminent publication of the Russian, Dutch and Korean translations, we will be faced with a new challenge, that of internationalization. The different components of our movement have a great need to reconcile and not to export their divisions like cancer in a healthy organism.

> Then said Jesus: “How can Satan cast out Satan? A kingdom divided against itself cannot stand; if a house be divided against itself, it is soon brought to desolation. Can a city withstand a siege if it is not united? If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand? But you should know that no one can enter into the house of a strong man and despoil his goods except he first overpower and bind that strong man. And so, if I by the power of Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore shall they be your judges. But if I, by the spirit of God, cast out devils, then has the kingdom of God truly come upon you. If you were not blinded by prejudice and misled by fear and pride, you would easily perceive that one who is greater than devils stands in your midst. You compel me to declare that he who is not with me is against me, while he who gathers not with me scatters abroad. Let me utter a solemn warning to you who would presume, with your eyes open and with premeditated malice, knowingly to ascribe the works of God to the doings of devils! Verily, verily, I say to you, all your sins shall be forgiven, even all of your blasphemies, but whosoever shall blaspheme against God with deliberation and wicked intention shall never obtain forgiveness. Since such persistent workers of iniquity will never seek nor receive forgiveness, they are guilty of the sin of eternally rejecting divine forgiveness. (<a id="a78_1481"></a>[UB 153:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p4_3))

And, at the farewell supper he gave the following exhortation:

> “_After a few moments of informal conversation, Jesus stood up and said: “When I enacted for you a parable indicating how you should be willing to serve one another, I said that I desired to give you a new commandment; and I would do this now as I am about to leave you. You well know the commandment which directs that you love one another; that you love your neighbor even as yourself. But I am not wholly satisfied with even that sincere devotion on the part of my children. I would have you perform still greater acts of love in the kingdom of the believing brotherhood. And so I give you this new commandment: That you love one another even as I have loved you. And by this will all men know that you are my disciples if you thus love one another._” (<a id="a82_758"></a>[UB 180:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p1_1))
