ADE AWOYINKA is an English-speaking Nigerian (from Nigeria, not the Republic of Niger) who has been living in the United Kingdom for a long time. The short biography she provided before her presentation in Budapest tells us that “she received The Urantia Book on July 1, 1996; she has been reading it ever since and, as her clairvoyance grows, she continues to find truths every day.” She is a civil servant and lives in London.

A few years earlier, I had met her at a short readers' meeting in Ireland but I hadn't had time to really fraternize with her.

I saw Ade again at the Budapest conference last September where she gave a presentation entitled “The Life and Times of Jesus.”

So I sat down with him and we shared some choice pieces from our lives. I was deeply moved and spiritually inspired by the story of his spiritual quest for God, from the debilitating and paralyzing fear of believing in evil spirits to spiritual liberation through faith in a loving God.

I felt for this beautiful person a powerful feeling of brotherhood coupled with admiration for the courage she showed in questioning her old beliefs.

His account is also proof that the expansion of cosmic consciousness and the enhancement of spiritual perception are at work in the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ and enable the Spirit of Truth and the Thought Adjusters to work more effectively in the spiritualization of the human mind.

> “Anxiety was a natural state of the savage mind. When men and women fall victims to excessive anxiety, they are simply reverting to the natural estate of their far-distant ancestors; and when anxiety becomes actually painful, it inhibits activity and unfailingly institutes evolutionary changes and biologic adaptations. Pain and suffering are essential to progressive evolution.” (<a id="a49_384"></a>[UB 86:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p2_1))

### Other AFRICAN Testimonies

Other edifying and similar testimonies show that the teachings of the _Urantia Book_ are beginning to produce the good fruits of spiritual freedom in Sub-Saharan Africa. For a year now, we have had within the UBIS school two French-speaking facilitators-animators from black Africa, the first, Guy Stéphane Nyasse is a Cameroonian living in Douala and the other, Moustapha N'Dyaie is a Senegalese from Dakar.

Guy Stéphane leads a course on booklet 83: “Primitive religion” and we present with his permission and after the testimonies of Ade, Arnaud and Guy Stépahane on their respective countries some questions and answers which illustrate once again this hold of fear on the African mind but also the superstitions which are still current in our Western world.

> “2. Few persons live up to the faith which they really have. Unreasoned fear is a master intellectual fraud practiced upon the evolving mortal soul.” (<a id="a59_153"></a>[UB 48:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_4))
