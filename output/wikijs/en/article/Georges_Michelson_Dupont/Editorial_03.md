**Dear** readers, in this issue 107 of September 2025,

**Sophie** stages, in the manner of a play, the meeting of Jesus with Nalda, the woman of loose morals, near Jacob's Well, followed by a personal reflection on the relationships between women and men.

**Robert** then asks us the question: What is behind the I AM?

**Georges** attempts to answer this in a two-part study entitled THE I AM and the principle of causality in which he explores its diversification, its deitization and the chain of events in eternity which leads to the promulgation of reality.

**Dominique**, under the title “Lost Tradition” leads us into a reflection on the present, affliction and its acceptance by sharing a traditional tale from the Sufi Imam El-Ghazali.

**Jean-Claude**, in his inimitable style, wonders if “the seeds he sowed along the Alameda” in the hearts of his contacts will flower and flood Paradise with their perfumes.

**A complete report** on the A.F.L.L.U. annual meeting is available at the end of this issue.
