Very often we read that our Thought Adjuster works to spiritualize us without our being aware of it.

> “When it comes to the sharp and well-defined conflicts between the higher and lower tendencies of the races, between what *really is* right or wrong (not merely what you may call right and wrong), you can depend upon it that the Adjuster will always participate in some definite and active manner in such experiences. The fact that such Adjuster activity may be unconscious to the human partner does not in the least detract from its value and reality.” (<a id="a36_457"></a>[UB 108:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p5_9))

> “Religious perplexities are inevitable; there can be no growth without psychic conflict and spiritual agitation. The organization of a philosophic standard of living entails considerable commotion in the philosophic realms of the mind. Loyalties are not exercised in behalf of the great, the good, the true, and the noble without a struggle. Effort is attendant upon clarification of spiritual vision and enhancement of cosmic insight. And the human intellect protests against being weaned from subsisting upon the nonspiritual energies of temporal existence. The slothful animal mind rebels at the effort required to wrestle with cosmic problem solving.” (<a id="a38_659"></a>[UB 100:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p4_2))

### But is it really the only one to work like this?

> “The twelve groups of Urantia destiny reservists are composed of mortal inhabitants of the sphere who have been rehearsed for numerous crucial positions on earth and are held in readiness to act in possible planetary emergencies. This combined corps now consists of 962 persons. The smallest corps numbers 41 and the largest 172. With the exception of less than a score of contact personalities, the members of this unique group are wholly unconscious of their preparation for possible function in certain planetary crises. These mortal reservists are chosen by the corps to which they are respectively attached and are likewise trained and rehearsed in the deep mind by the combined technique of Thought Adjuster and seraphic guardian ministry. Many times numerous other celestial personalities participate in this unconscious training, and in all this special preparation the midwayers perform valuable and indispensable services.” (<a id="a42_937"></a>[UB 114:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_8))

> “We know that the Trinity Teacher Sons are devoted to the *conscious* enlightenment of universe creatures. I have arrived at the settled conclusion that the Inspired Trinity Spirits, by *superconscious* techniques, are also functioning as teachers of the realms. I am persuaded that there is a vast body of essential spiritual knowledge, truth indispensable to high spiritual attainment, which cannot be consciously received; self-consciousness would effectively jeopardize the certainty of reception. If we are right in this concept, and my entire order of being shares it, it may be the mission of these Inspired Spirits to overcome this difficulty, to bridge this gap in the universal scheme of moral enlightenment and spiritual advancement. We think that these two types of Trinity-origin teachers effect some kind of liaison in their activities, but we do not really know.” (<a id="a44_882"></a>[UB 19:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/19#p5_9))

> On the superuniverse training worlds and on the eternal circuits of Havona, I have fraternized with the perfecting mortals—spiritualized and ascendant souls from the evolutionary realms—but never have they been aware of the Inspired Spirits, which ever and anon the powers of detection resident in the Solitary Messengers would indicate were very near us. I have freely conversed with all orders of the Sons of God, high and low, and they likewise are unconscious of the admonitions of the Inspired Trinity Spirits. They can and do look back in their experiences and recount happenings which are difficult to explain if the action of such Spirits is not taken into account. But excepting Solitary Messengers, and sometimes Trinity-origin beings, none of the celestial family have ever been conscious of the nearness of the Inspired Spirits. (<a id="a46_844"></a>[UB 19:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/19#p5_10))

Thus, we are educated, both through experience **consciously**, and we progress spiritually through the choices of our personality responsive to the Spirit of Truth and the guidance of our Thought Adjuster, but also through a “conspiracy” of highly spiritual beings who instill in us, **unconsciously**, a vast amount of essential spiritual knowledge, truths indispensable to high spiritual attainment, which we cannot receive consciously.

On the educational worlds of the superuniverses and on Havona, there is therefore manifested a quadruple aid granted to ascenders progressing towards Paradise.

### Helps we are aware of

**The Universal Father** bestows personality and its associated free will together with a fragment of himself upon evolutionary creatures.

> “2. It may be bestowed upon any living energy system which includes mind or spirit.” (<a id="a56_88"></a>[UB 112:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_4))

**The Eternal Son and the Creator Sons** minister to the ascending creatures as absolute love. The Eternal Son's spirit gravity circuit is the fundamental channel for transmitting their heartfelt prayers. The Creator Sons personalize and factualize, to incarnate and make real to the creatures of all universes the love of the Father and the mercy of the Son. “The Word was made flesh.”

> “The spiritual-gravity pull of the Eternal Son constitutes the inherent secret of the Paradise ascension of surviving human souls. All genuine spirit values and all bona fide spiritualized individuals are held within the unfailing grasp of the spiritual gravity of the Eternal Son. The mortal mind, for example, initiates its career as a material mechanism and is eventually mustered into the Corps of the Finality as a well-nigh perfected spirit existence, becoming progressively less subject to material gravity and correspondingly more responsive to the inward pulling urge of spirit gravity during this entire experience. The spirit-gravity circuit literally pulls the soul of man Paradiseward.” (<a id="a60_703"></a>[UB 7:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/7#p3_2))

**The Infinite Spirit and the creative daughters** minister in multiple ways through the gift of mind, through the ministering spirits who are in charge of the progression of evolutionary creatures, and through the Holy Spirit.

> Paralleling the physical universe wherein Paradise gravity holds all things together is the spiritual universe wherein the word of the Son interprets the thought of God and, when “made flesh,” demonstrates the loving mercy of the combined nature of the associated Creators. But in and through all this material and spiritual creation there is a vast stage whereon the Infinite Spirit and his spirit offspring show forth the combined mercy, patience, and everlasting affection of the divine parents towards the intelligent children of their co-operative devising and making. Everlasting ministry to mind is the essence of the Spirit’s divine character. And all the spirit offspring of the Conjoint Actor partake of this desire to minister, this divine urge to service. (<a id="a64_771"></a>[UB 8:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/8#p4_1))

**The Paradise Trinity**. We have seen that the Inspired Spirits come from the Trinity. They are part of the Coordinated Beings of trinitarian origin in the same way as the Instructor Sons of the Trinity. The latter come to the evolutionary worlds to educate.

> “The Daynal order of sonship is not an organic part of the local or superuniverse administrations. Its members are neither creators nor retrievers, neither judges nor rulers. They are not so much concerned with universe administration as with moral enlightenment and spiritual development. They are the universal educators, being dedicated to the spiritual awakening and moral guidance of all realms. Their ministry is intimately interrelated with that of the personalities of the Infinite Spirit and is closely associated with the Paradise ascension of creature beings.” (<a id="a68_575"></a>[UB 20:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p7_3))

### Helps we are not aware of

**The Thought Adjusters**

> “Thought Adjuster fusion imparts eternal actualities to personality which were previously only potential. Among these new endowments may be mentioned: fixation of divinity quality, past-eternity experience and memory, immortality, and a phase of qualified potential absoluteness.” (<a id="a74_284"></a>[UB 112:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p7_1))

**The Inspired Spirits of the Trinity**

> “The Inspired Spirits do not apparently belong to the evolutionary scheme of the individual planets or universes, and yet they seem to be almost everywhere. Even as I am engaged in the formulation of this statement, my associated Solitary Messenger’s personal sensitivity to the presence of this order of Spirit indicates that there is with us at this very moment, not over twenty-five feet away, a Spirit of the Inspired order and of the third volume of power presence. The third volume of power presence suggests to us the probability that three Inspired Spirits are functioning in liaison.” (<a id="a78_597"></a>[UB 19:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/19#p5_7))

**Association of Thought Adjusters and Inspired Spirits**

> “I may relate a further interesting fact: When a Solitary Messenger is on a planet whose inhabitants are indwelt by Thought Adjusters, as on Urantia, he is aware of a qualitative excitation in his detection-sensitivity to spirit presence. In such instances there is no quantitative excitation, only a qualitative agitation. When on a planet to which Adjusters do not come, contact with the natives does not produce any such reaction. This suggests that Thought Adjusters are in some manner related to, or are connected with, the Inspired Spirits of the Paradise Trinity. In some way they may possibly be associated in certain phases of their work; but we do not really know. They both originate near the center and source of all things, but they are not the same order of being. Thought Adjusters spring from the Father alone; Inspired Spirits are the offspring of the Paradise Trinity.” (<a id="a82_891"></a>[UB 19:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/19#p5_6))
