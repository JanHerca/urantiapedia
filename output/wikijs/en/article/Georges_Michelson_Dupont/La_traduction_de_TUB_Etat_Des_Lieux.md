Disseminating the teachings of The Urantia Book on the planet involves translating it as faithfully as possible and making these translations available. As you can imagine, this represents a considerable amount of work given the complexity of certain concepts and the importance of the work, which includes no fewer than 18,902 paragraphs spread over 2,196 pages.

In order to define a strategy and procedures for organizing and coordinating the work of the translation and revision teams, two meetings bringing together more than 12 translators as well as the trustees were organized in the Paris region in 1996 and 1997.

During these meetings, a plan for the production of quality translations was developed covering the period from 1996 to 2030 with the goal of providing access to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ to 70% of the world's population in their native language.

We provide the progress of this plan in the table below.

## Some Statistics provided by the Urantia Foundation

_Below is a summary table of the translations published by the Foundation and the number of potential speakers who can read the revelation in their language._

The second column is the year of publication, the third column indicates the number of speakers speaking the language whose countries have only one official language, for example Germany, the fourth column indicates the number of speakers whose countries have two official languages, for example Senegal, the fifth column indicates the percentage of potential speakers who can read the revelation in their language compared to the world population of 7.4 billion human beings.
