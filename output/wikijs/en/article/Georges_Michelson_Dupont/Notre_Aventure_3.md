***Journey through the ages of the master universe***

_Georges Michelson-Dupont_

(Continuation of the article started in LE LIEN of December 2018)

In The Previous Link, our adventure stopped at the inspection of the 7 triunities, these triune associations of the Seven Absolutes of Infinity including the presence of the Universal Father to ensure the functions necessary for the realization of his divine plan and which, functioning in a total manner, functionally unifies infinity. If just one were missing, the unit of functioning would be broken a bit like in the human body, if one of the functions (for example the nervous system) was missing, we simply could not live. Let us recall here that the absoluteness and infinity of the first Source Center prevent it from acting on subinfinite levels. This is why by associating in a triune manner, the 7 Absolutes of Infinity become functional.

## Triodities.

The next step is the association of the 7 Absolutes into triodities, _trinary associations no longer including the Universal Father as an associate_. We saw in the previous chapter that there were 20 of them but only two were revealed to us. With the triodities, all possible triune associations of the 7 absolutes of Infinity are exhausted. The absence of the Universal Father as an associate suggests that the triodities would function on a lower level than the triunities. Would the absolute have several levels as the following statement suggests?

> “Prior to the deitization of the finite, it would appear that all reality diversification took place on absolute levels; but the volitional act promulgating finite reality connotes a qualification of absoluteness and implies the appearance of relativities.” (<a id="a46_261"></a>[UB 105:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/105#p5_2))

This supposition, seen from this spatiotemporal side, is corroborated by a Melchizedek in the introduction to booklet 106 in which he mentions the existence of a co-absolute and absolute level of reality. <a id="a48_205"></a>[UB 106:7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/106#p7), <a id="a48_246"></a>[UB 106:8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/106#p8). To take up the analogy with the human body, the triunities would be for the triodities what the central brain controlling our entire being would be for the cerebellum, ensuring the functioning of the body's automatisms.

Furthermore, we are informed that the triodities are “consequences of the existence of the triunities.” The Universal Father having withdrawn from these triune associations, with them we approach the lower limit of the absolute, if one can say so, towards the subabsolute, domain of the experiential Deities, Supreme, Ultimate and Absolute.

> “As the triunities are primarily concerned with the functional unification of infinity, so are triodities involved in the cosmic appearance of experiential Deities. The triunities are indirectly concerned, but the triodities are directly concerned, in the experiential Deities—Supreme, Ultimate, and Absolute. They appear in the emerging power-personality synthesis of the Supreme Being. And to the time creatures of space the Supreme Being is a revelation of the unity of the I AM.” (<a id="a52_487"></a>[UB 104:5.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p5_12))

We saw previously that there are 20 of these triodities but that only 2 are revealed to us:

***The Triodity of Actuality*** composed of the association of the Eternal Son, the Isle of Paradise and the Infinite Spirit, ***the Triodity of Potentiality*** composed of the Absolute of Deity, the Unqualified Absolute and the Universal Absolute.

First, from a human point of view they represent the limits of infinity: $-\infty$ for the Triodity of Potentiality (what will be) and $+\infty$ for the Triodity of Actuality (what is and has been)

_We read for the Trinity of Current Affairs:_

> The Eternal Son is the absolute of spirit reality, the absolute personality. The Paradise Isle is the absolute of cosmic reality, the absolute pattern. The Conjoint Actor is the absolute of mind reality, the co-ordinate of absolute spirit reality, and the existential Deity synthesis of personality and power. This triune association eventuates the co-ordination of the sum total of actualized reality—spirit, cosmic, or mindal. It is unqualified in actuality. (<a id="a62_464"></a>[UB 104:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p5_6))

For the Triunity of Potentiality:

> Thus are interassociated the infinity reservoirs of all latent energy reality—spirit, mindal, or cosmic. This association yields the integration of all latent energy reality. It is infinite in potential. (<a id="a66_207"></a>[UB 104:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p5_11))

In a certain way, and considered from space-time, the Triodities of Potentiality and Actuality represent “absolute limits” framing past as well as future eternity. In this “interval” of space-time, the Power-Personality synthesis must operate successively on the subinfinite levels and in the successive ages of the master universe.

**To summarize:**

> Pre-existentials become existential in the seven Absolutes, and existentials become functional in the triunities, the basic association of Absolutes. And concomitant with the eternalization of the triunities the universe stage is set—the potentials are existent and the actuals are present—and the fullness of eternity witnesses the diversification of cosmic energy, the outspreading of Paradise spirit, and the endowment of mind together with the bestowal of personality, by virtue of which all of these Deity and Paradise derivatives are unified in experience on the creature level and by other techniques on the supercreature level. (<a id="a72_639"></a>[UB 105:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/105#p4_9))

Thus, the authors of the _Urantia Book_ give us the story of the genesis of reality from the unfathomed unity of the infinite I AM, its diversification into the Seven Absolutes of Infinity by dual associations then their functional qualifications by triune associations in the form of triunities and triodities.

Do we measure the chance to receive, through revelation, the missing information filling the scientific factual void allowing us now to understand somewhat the operations taking place in the infinity of the past, even before the arrival of time and space? Understanding the teleological plan of the Great First Central Source is simply fabulous and gives us a completely different perspective on human life by placing it in the context of the divine plan. I remain amazed and pensive before the grandeur, the power, the immensity of this plan that the I AM has conceived with a love that can only be infinite and unconditional in eternity for us, for the universal brotherhood and for the universe.

Naturally, faith in God is essential for our mind to intellectually validate the revelatory data even if the authors tell us that “the cosmology revealed here is not inspired”. <a id="a78_177"></a>[UB 102:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p4_2)

> “Reason, through the study of science, may lead back through nature to a First Cause, but it requires religious faith to transform the First Cause of science into a God of salvation; and revelation is further required for the validation of such a faith, such spiritual insight.” (<a id="a80_282"></a>[UB 101:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p2_3))

It is true that science, philosophy and religion are united by revelation. Revelation reconciles science with religion.

> “Science ends its reason-search in the hypothesis of a First Cause. Religion does not stop in its flight of faith until it is sure of a God of salvation. The discriminating study of science logically suggests the reality and existence of an Absolute. Religion believes unreservedly in the existence and reality of a God who fosters personality survival. What metaphysics fails utterly in doing, and what even philosophy fails partially in doing, revelation does; that is, affirms that this First Cause of science and religion’s God of salvation are *one and the same Deity.*” (<a id="a84_579"></a>[UB 101:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p2_7))

Among the contributions of the revelation of the time such as the fifth, we will note that:

> Revelation is a technique whereby ages upon ages of time are saved in the necessary work of sorting and sifting the errors of evolution from the truths of spirit acquirement. (<a id="a88_178"></a>[UB 101:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p5_1))

Thus ends the story of the genesis of all reality. These inconceivable operations take place in past eternity, even before the first age of the universe. From a temporal point of view, history or rather prehistory would take place in two distinct “epochs”: firstly that of ***Infinity***, in which the solitary I AM IS; secondly that of ***the absolute*** in which by inherent volition the I AM is segmented into seven primary relationships eternalizing in the form of the Seven Absolutes of Infinity. Then, only afterwards can the triune associations of the 7 absolutes of Infinity take place. ***Let us simply recall that from the point of view of eternity, this segmentation of infinity and these sequences are only scaffolding to explain to the finite mind realities that never had a beginning. In eternity everything IS***.

In the next LINK, we will discuss what the authors of the book call “the promulgation of finite reality” and its consequences. We will see by what mechanism we move from existential realities to experiential realities via transcendentals.

## Chronological Genesis of Reality

### Unit Relationship

I AM static, hypothetical, unqualified

I AM Infinite differentiating myself from Infinity

The 7 primordial relationships within the I AM

> The universe philosophers postulate the eternity existence of the I AM as the primal source of all reality. And concomitant therewith they postulate the self-segmentation of the I AM into the primary self-relationships—the seven phases of infinity. And simultaneous with this assumption is the third postulate—the eternity appearance of the Seven Absolutes of Infinity and the eternalization of the duality association of the seven phases of the I AM and these seven Absolutes. (<a id="a108_481"></a>[UB 105:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/105#p4_1))

> The self-revelation of the I AM thus proceeds from static self through self-segmentation and self-relationship to absolute relationships, relationships with self-derived Absolutes. Duality becomes thus existent in the eternal association of the Seven Absolutes of Infinity with the sevenfold infinity of the self-segmented phases of the self-revealing I AM. These dual relationships, eternalizing to the universes as the seven Absolutes, eternalize the basic foundations for all universe reality. (<a id="a110_500"></a>[UB 105:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/105#p4_2))

### Triunity relationship
