## The Future of Urantia — Food for Thought

Georges Michelson Dupont (Reclosed -France)

The recent past of our planet has witnessed numerous confrontations, racial wars, religious conflicts and all kinds of atrocities perpetrated in the name of principles of life based on self-centered materialism or secular totalitarianism. Civilizations based on other principles of human relations have appeared, they have evolved and then disappeared but humanity has continued on its path. The question is whether our current civilization will continue on these foundations of selfishness and power struggle and finally disappear or will it evolve positively and gradually towards more justice, equity and fraternity?

The law of men, as it currently manifests itself, is based on selfishness (the search for ego satisfaction) and its corollary, the balance of power (the search for power and domination over others). Today, the confrontation between peoples and races is leading to a worrying deterioration in relations between states and a large-scale military confrontation seems to be looming and, in fact, we can say that it has already begun in several places on our beautiful blue planet. Unlike previous conflicts, nuclear weapons spread across the continents represent a new factor in the balance of power to the extent that their use can make all or part of Urantia uninhabitable by humanity for centuries.

In this hypothesis, will the planetary authorities let the madness of men destroy it? Will providence play its role? Will humanity emerge unscathed or, on the contrary, will it sink at the conclusion of the present ideological struggle?

We live on a world where spiritual confusion and iniquity are wreaking havoc on human and social life. We are still far from achieving the conditions that should normally prevail on Urantia. (52:2 and 3) But today, although a major crisis seems imminent to threaten the delicate balance of the forces of destruction present, humanity is on the verge of a spiritual renewal.

Religionists and truth seekers of all stripes should see, beyond the immediate difficulties and current and future conflicts, the divine plan unfolding and the divine will manifesting itself. At the end of the present ideological struggle the triumph of truth, beauty and goodness will become manifest in the course of this millennium and the beginnings of a better world will appear in the 21st century. For my part, a nuclear holocaust destroying all or part of Urantia seems totally excluded.

This statement is based on the following elements which we will briefly develop:

1. The nature of the present ideological struggle;
2. Michael promised to return to Urantia, he is our Planetary Prince;
3. The timing of the 5th epochal revelation;
4. The reconnection of Urantia with the communication circuits of the local universe;
5. The transfer of power between the angels of the churches and the angels of progress.

## 1: Nature of the present ideological struggle

Let us make no mistake, the present ideological struggle that we are witnessing is only the extension, the consequences of Caligastia's adherence to the “Lucifer manifesto”. (53.3) The conflict between truth and untruth leads to confusion and error. The deliberate choice of evil constitutes sin; the willful rejection of truth is error. The persistent pursuit of sin and error constitutes iniquity. It is this fatal spiral that Caligastia has bequeathed to us. True freedom is manifested in selfless service, false freedom is the selfish satisfaction of the self and the enslavement of other egos.

> “_There is no error greater than that species of self-deception which leads intelligent beings to crave the exercise of power over other beings for the purpose of depriving these persons of their natural liberties. The golden rule of human fairness cries out against all such fraud, unfairness, selfishness, and unrighteousness. Only true and genuine liberty is compatible with the reign of love and the ministry of mercy._” (<a id="a82_428"></a>[UB 54:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p1_8))

Although democracy as experienced on Urantia is far from ideal, it at least preserves basic freedoms.

> “_4. *Political wisdom.* Emotional maturity is essential to self-control. Only emotional maturity will insure the substitution of international techniques of civilized adjudication for the barbarous arbitrament of war. Wise statesmen will sometime work for the welfare of humanity even while they strive to promote the interest of their national or racial groups. Selfish political sagacity is ultimately suicidal—destructive of all those enduring qualities which insure planetary group survival._” (<a id="a86_502"></a>[UB 52:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p6_6))

Here are some quotes from the book that will help us understand the nature of the present conflict:

> “_For ages the inhabitants of Urantia have misunderstood the providence of God. There is a providence of divine outworking on your world, but it is not the childish, arbitrary, and material ministry many mortals have conceived it to be. The providence of God consists in the interlocking activities of the celestial beings and the divine spirits who, in accordance with cosmic law, unceasingly labor for the honor of God and for the spiritual advancement of his universe children._” (<a id="a90_486"></a>[UB 4:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p1_1))

**True freedom:**

> “_True liberty is the quest of the ages and the reward of evolutionary progress. False liberty is the subtle deception of the error of time and the evil of space. Enduring liberty is predicated on the reality of justice—intelligence, maturity, fraternity, and equity._”
> 
> “_Liberty is a self-destroying technique of cosmic existence when its motivation is unintelligent, unconditioned, and uncontrolled. True liberty is progressively related to reality and is ever regardful of social equity, cosmic fairness, universe fraternity, and divine obligations._” (<a id="a96_288"></a>[UB 54:1.2-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p1_2))

**False freedom:**

> “_True liberty is the quest of the ages and the reward of evolutionary progress. False liberty is the subtle deception of the error of time and the evil of space. Enduring liberty is predicated on the reality of justice—intelligence, maturity, fraternity, and equity._”
> 
> “_Liberty is a self-destroying technique of cosmic existence when its motivation is unintelligent, unconditioned, and uncontrolled. True liberty is progressively related to reality and is ever regardful of social equity, cosmic fairness, universe fraternity, and divine obligations._”
> 
> “_Liberty is suicidal when divorced from material justice, intellectual fairness, social forbearance, moral duty, and spiritual values. Liberty is nonexistent apart from cosmic reality, and all personality reality is proportional to its divinity relationships._” (<a id="a104_266"></a>[UB 54:1.2-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p1_2))

**Why we got here:**

As much on a personal level, the human being has the free will to choose between good and evil and no external being can interfere, as much the consequences of his choices become social and determine the progression or regression of the community. We all bear this responsibility and more particularly our political and economic leaders.

For me, there is no doubt about the outcome of the present ideological struggle. It will end with the victory of good over evil, of truth over untruth, and of true over false freedom $(54.1) because perfection is found in the divine teleological design.

## 2: Michaël promised he would come back

“_Urantia is the sentimental sanctuary of all Nebadon; the most important of ten million inhabited planets, the human home of Christ Michael, sovereign of all Nebadon, Melchizedek minister to the realms, system savior, Adamic redeemer, seraphic companion, associate of ascending spirits, morontia progressor, Son of Man in the likeness of mortal flesh, and Planetary Prince of Urantia. And your Scriptures speak the truth in affirming that this same Jesus has promised to return, one day, to the world of his terminal bestowal, the World of the Cross._” (<a id="a114_555"></a>[UB 119:8.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p8_8))

Our Sovereign Creator Son has fulfilled his promise to bestow himself 6 times in the likeness of his Ministering Spirits and has completed the seventh as the Son of Man on Urantia. This affirmation in and of itself is proof and also assurance that Urantia, an experimental planet on which iniquity and rebellion have flourished, is destined to become a model of rehabilitation for the Local Universe of Nebadon, it is proof that “The Plans of Divine Perfection” set forth by the Universal Father, the Eternal Son and the Infinite Spirit are working.

> “_2. *The Bestowal Plan.* The next universal plan is the great Father-revelation enterprise of the Eternal Son and his co-ordinate Sons. This is the proposal of the Eternal Son and consists of his bestowal of the Sons of God upon the evolutionary creations, there to personalize and factualize, to incarnate and make real, the love of the Father and the mercy of the Son to the creatures of all universes. Inherent in the bestowal plan, and as a provisional feature of this ministration of love, the Paradise Sons act as rehabilitators of that which misguided creature will has placed in spiritual jeopardy. Whenever and wherever there occurs a delay in the functioning of the attainment plan, if rebellion, perchance, should mar or complicate this enterprise, then do the emergency provisions of the bestowal plan become active forthwith. The Paradise Sons stand pledged and ready to function as retrievers, to go into the very realms of rebellion and there restore the spiritual status of the spheres. And such a heroic service a co-ordinate Creator Son did perform on Urantia in connection with his experiential bestowal career of sovereignty acquirement._” (<a id="a118_1164"></a>[UB 7:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/7#p4_5))

A unique future awaits Urantia for the love of God the Father and the mercy of the Son have been manifested through the bestowal of Christ Michael to demonstrate to the universe, if need be, that the entire universe is friendly and perfectly administered in justice and equity.

As our Son Michael puts an end to the system rebellion, his accomplishments enable the Supremacy to be exercised, the Almighty Supreme to extend his power, and God the Supreme to further unify his personality. As Urantia moves one step closer to its destiny of perfection, the Supreme gains in actualization.

## 3: The timing of the fifth revelation

Many of us have found revelation following legitimate existential questioning, a stubborn quest for truth or acute personal difficulties. The spiritual evolution of our soul depends only on our choices even if the environment in which we live plays a certain role. On the scale of our societies it is different, evolution is very slow and generally produces its fruits at the end of global crises, civilizations appear and disappear but humanity subsists and progresses. Perhaps there is a link between the revelations of the time (the dispensations) and these civilizational changes? Clearly, the 5th revelation arrives at one of these pivotal turning points in the history of humanity.

This statement is based on [publication mandate](/en/article/The_Publication_Mandate). (https://urlz.fr/idIA)

> “The Book belongs to the time which will immediately follow the conclusion of the present ideological struggle. That will be the day when men will be disposed to seek truth and righteousness. When the chaos of the present confusion has dissipated, it will be more easily possible to conceive the universe of a new and improved era of human relations. It is for this better order of things on earth that the Book has been made available.”

The giving of the Urantia Papers represents the effort of the supermortal authorities to expand cosmic consciousness and enhance the spiritual perception of Urantians. Improving the quality of thought of humanity as a whole is essential if truth is to be untwisted. A better knowledge of the **facts** (the facts of God), the experiential **meanings** of these facts (the law of God) and the resulting enhancement of the **values** (the truth, beauty, goodness and love of God) must lead humanity, beyond differences of opinion and religious cultures, to conceive of Him as the creator, the controller and the infinite sustainer, a Universal Father attentive to the needs of the universal cosmic brotherhood.

With the Internet and the instant availability of information, we have an increasingly acute awareness of the injustice and economic, social, political and cultural inequalities that are rife on our beautiful blue planet. This situation that we see growing leads us to the current ideological confrontation.

At the end of this, the physically, mentally and psychologically exhausted Urantians will have no other choice but to turn towards the search for the true meaning of their life, their origin, their history and their destiny. The paradigms on which our current civilizations are based will have to evolve in such a way that the search for truth will become the goal of the times to come.

The Universal Father is the creator; the Eternal Son is the Word of the Father; the Sons of the Father and the Son (the Michael Sons) bring the Word adapted to the children of their local universes.

The inspiring re-enactment of the Master's life and teaching contained in the fifth revelation shows the true way. The revelation will soothe their anxieties like balm on a gaping wound. If every human being desires it, if humanity wills and decides it, if leaders seek the welfare of their people, together they can build a new civilization based on the gospel and build the kingdom of God on Urantia. (See 170:4—Jesus' Teaching on the Kingdom.) The plan is there, the kingdom is at hand, and

> “_That which comes from the Father is like the Father eternal, and this is just as true of personality, which God gives by his own freewill choice, as it is of the divine Thought Adjuster, an actual fragment of God. Man’s personality is eternal but with regard to identity a conditioned eternal reality. Having appeared in response to the Father’s will, personality will attain Deity destiny, but man must choose whether or not he will be present at the attainment of such destiny. In default of such choice, personality attains experiential Deity directly, becoming a part of the Supreme Being. The cycle is foreordained, but man’s participation therein is optional, personal, and experiential._” (<a id="a142_701"></a>[UB 112:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_2))

## 4. The reconnection of Urantia with the communication circuits of the local universe;

Each inhabited planet is connected to its system by different channels that serve to gather intelligence and disseminate information and all these spiritual mechanisms and communication channels are at the disposal of the Most Highs of the constellations and planetary governments. Immediately after the declaration of the Lucifer manifesto most of these channels were cut off and this was a little over 200,000 years ago plunging the Satania system into relative isolation.

> “_Meantime the system circuits had been severed; Urantia was isolated. Every group of celestial life on the planet found itself suddenly and without warning isolated, utterly cut off from all outside counsel and advice._” (<a id="a148_225"></a>[UB 67:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p2_3))

Revelation tells us that Urantia will be reconnected when the rebels have been judged. By coming to incarnate as the Son of Man, a little over 2000 years ago, Jesus technically put an end to the rebellion ( <a id="a150_207"></a>[UB 120:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p2_2) ). Furthermore, an archangel of Nebadon informs us that:

> “_But ere long, the adjudication of Lucifer and his associates will restore the Satania system to the Norlatiadek constellation, and subsequently, Urantia and the other isolated spheres will be restored to the Satania circuits, and again will such worlds enjoy the privileges of interplanetary communication and intersystem communion._” (<a id="a152_340"></a>[UB 46:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p8_3))

There is therefore only one step to take to associate the end of the present ideological struggle with the completion of the judgment of

Lucifer and the reconnection of Urantia's communications with the local universe and this step, I take without hesitation. Certainly, we must still wait for the annihilation of the rebels but this event is imminent on the universal scale of time.

Let us not be mistaken about the nature of these information channels. At the individual level, they are not accessible to us:

> “_This rather loosely organized and somewhat personally administered planetary government is more than expectedly effective because of the timesaving assistance of the archangels and their ever-ready circuit, which is so frequently utilized in planetary emergencies and administrative difficulties. Technically, the planet is still spiritually isolated in the Norlatiadek circuits, but in an emergency this handicap can now be circumvented through utilization of the archangels’ circuit. Planetary isolation is, of course, of little concern to individual mortals since the pouring out of the Spirit of Truth upon all flesh nineteen hundred years ago._” (<a id="a160_656"></a>[UB 114:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p5_4))

Every person has the opportunity to decide for themselves about their future.

At the collective level of nations and Urantian humanity it is not the same. The divine plan must be executed on Urantia and collective evolution must advance because it is the will of the Universal Father.

It was the responsibility of Caligastia and the Adamic couple to organize human societies to evolve primitive men into the era of light and life. They were in constant contact with higher authorities who could advise them. Their failures had the effect of isolating Urantia from the circuits of communication, leaving it orphaned and thus deprived of planetary supervision from above. To remedy the difficulties which resulted, the Melchizedeks set up a special government “with the means at hand.”

The future reconnection will therefore facilitate the work of supervision of this government in place thanks in part to the personalities of the Infinite Spirit but not only. For me, there is no doubt that the 5th revelation is part of the reconnection process because the information it delivers to us is unusual in the normal framework of planetary evolution. It is as if the Most Highs had decided to associate mortals with the dynamics of evolution by providing them with an understanding of the origin, history and planetary destiny. It is one of the missions of the revelation to prepare the minds of Urantians to lift the veil on this universe that our materialistic science refuses to believe is inhabited, organized and divinely directed, locked as it is in its refusal to consider science, philosophy and religion as being the facts of God, the law of God and the love of God. Already, our means of astronomical observations reveal the possibility of exoplanets similar to Urantia and possibly habitable. The revelators send us the following message:

> “Your planet is a member of an immense cosmos. You belong to an almost infinite family of worlds, but your sphere is administered with just as much precision and maintained with just as much love as if it were the only inhabited world in existence._” 15:14.9

It is high time that the law of men becomes, crisis after crisis, the law of God and I remain convinced that with the help of revelation associated with human good will it manifests itself more and more. The triumph of the true, the beautiful and the good will become manifest in the course of this millennium and the beginnings of a better world will appear from the 21st century.

## 5: The planetary government of the seraphim

The seraphim have multiple functions.

**1. Individually or collectively:**

Seraphim are the guardians of destiny. They are used to accompany ascending mortals throughout their careers.

> “_Originally, the seraphim were definitely assigned to the separate Urantia races. But since the bestowal of Michael, they are assigned in accordance with human intelligence, spirituality, and destiny. Intellectually, mankind is divided into three classes:_” (<a id="a182_262"></a>[UB 113:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p1_2))

> “_One of the most important things a destiny guardian does for her mortal subject is to effect a personal co-ordination of the numerous impersonal spirit influences which indwell, surround, and impinge upon the mind and soul of the evolving material creature. Human beings are personalities, and it is exceedingly difficult for nonpersonal spirits and prepersonal entities to make direct contact with such highly material and discretely personal minds. In the ministry of the guarding angel all of these influences are more or less unified and made more nearly appreciable by the expanding moral nature of the evolving human personality._” (<a id="a184_643"></a>[UB 113:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p3_1))

> _The guardian seraphim are not mind, though they do spring from the same source that also gives origin to mortal mind, the Creative Spirit. Seraphim are mind stimulators; they continually seek to promote circle-making decisions in human mind. They do this, not as does the Adjuster, operating from within and through the soul, but rather from the outside inward, working through the social, ethical, and moral environment of human beings. Seraphim are not the divine Adjuster lure of the Universal Father, but they do function as the personal agency of the ministry of the Infinite Spirit._ (<a id="a186_594"></a>[UB 113:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p4_1))

> “_In the life of the flesh the intelligence of angels is not directly available to mortal men. They are not overlords or directors; they are simply guardians. The seraphim *guard* you; they do not seek directly to influence you; you must chart your own course, but these angels then act to make the best possible use of the course you have chosen. They do not (ordinarily) arbitrarily intervene in the routine affairs of human life. But when they receive instructions from their superiors to perform some unusual exploit, you may rest assured that these guardians will find some means of carrying out these mandates. They do not, therefore, intrude into the picture of human drama except in emergencies and then usually on the direct orders of their superiors. They are the beings who are going to follow you for many an age, and they are thus receiving an introduction to their future work and personality association._” (<a id="a188_925"></a>[UB 113:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p5_4))

**2. In the planetary government of Urantia.**

> “_THE Most Highs rule in the kingdoms of men through many celestial forces and agencies but chiefly through the ministry of seraphim._” (<a id="a192_139"></a>[UB 114:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p0_1))

It is legitimate to try to understand by what means the Most Highs put their decisions into execution and how they use the seraphim to intervene in the planetary life of mortals?

The planetary government of the seraphim has functioned on Urantia since the outpouring of the Spirit of Truth. (<a id="a196_113"></a>[UB 114:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p6_1)) It is organized into 12 corps of special seraphim, graduates of Seraphington assigned to certain particular planetary services. I invite you to reread sections 6 and 7 of Paper 114 which describe the functions of each corps as well as those of the reserve corps of destiny which plays an important role in times of planetary crisis.

Two groups are of particular interest to us in this study:

**The angels of the churches:**

> “_3. *The religious guardians.* These are the “angels of the churches,” the earnest contenders for that which is and has been. They endeavor to maintain the ideals of that which has survived for the sake of the safe transit of moral values from one epoch to another. They are the checkmates of the angels of progress, all the while seeking to translate from one generation to another the imperishable values of the old and passing forms into the new and therefore less stabilized patterns of thought and conduct. These angels do contend for spiritual forms, but they are not the source of ultrasectarianism and meaningless controversial divisions of professed religionists. The corps now functioning on Urantia is the fifth thus to serve._” (<a id="a202_744"></a>[UB 114:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p6_7))

These angels are responsible for the revelation for the first 100 years, from 1955 to 2055, taking the year of publication as the starting point. [^1]

**The angels of progress:**

> “2. *The progress angels.* These seraphim are intrusted with the task of initiating the evolutionary progress of the successive social ages. They foster the development of the inherent progressive trend of evolutionary creatures; they labor incessantly to make things what they ought to be. The group now on duty is the second to be assigned to the planet.” (<a id="a208_361"></a>[UB 114:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p6_6))

These angels are responsible for revelation for 500 years, from 2055 to 2555.

From 2055, we can expect a new dynamic in the spiritual and social evolution of humanity, which seems to correspond well to the end of the present ideological struggle mentioned in the “Publication Mandate”.

## In conclusion.

This is how the Chief Seraphim stationed on Urantia addresses us:

> “_Your isolated world is not forgotten in the counsels of the universe. Urantia is not a cosmic orphan stigmatized by sin and shut away from divine watchcare by rebellion. From Uversa to Salvington and on down to Jerusem, even in Havona and on Paradise, they all know we are here; and you mortals now dwelling on Urantia are just as lovingly cherished and just as faithfully watched over as if the sphere had never been betrayed by a faithless Planetary Prince, even more so. It is eternally true, “the Father himself loves you.”_” (<a id="a218_535"></a>[UB 114:7.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_17))

If by chance an extraordinary situation were to arise threatening the existence of Urantia, such as, for example, a climatic disruption such that human life would become impossible, or a threatening nuclear holocaust would wipe out the human species making the planet uninhabitable for centuries, then arrangements would be made through the united midwayers and/or the Destiny Reserve Corps.

Urantia is a decimal planet on which experiments have been undertaken, which may partly explain its present difficulties, but it is nonetheless the site of Michael's 7th bestowal, at the end of which he became the Planetary Prince. As such, it has been and remains the object of all the attention of the authorities of the local universe and beyond.

Undoubtedly, Urantia will become the typical example, the effective proof of divine mercy and the effective functioning of the divine plan of perfection. Even plunged into the deepest spiritual darkness because of the misguidedness of its leaders, Urantia will be rehabilitated, reconnected and humanity will await in its time the era of light and life.
