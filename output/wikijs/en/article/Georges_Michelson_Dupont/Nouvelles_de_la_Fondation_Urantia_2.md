The translation of _The Urantia Book_ into the languages of Urantia is part of the planetary mission of Urantia Foundation, which is described in the <Declaration of Trust,> the document creating the Foundation in 1950 and available at: [urantia.org/en/la-fondation-urantia/declaration-de-fiducie?term=déclaration#arV](urantia.org/fr/la-fondation-urantia/declaration-de-fiducie?term=déclaration#arV)

The Urantia Revelation is now available in 27 languages for direct reading on the Foundation website urantia.org with a search engine allowing students to locate paragraphs easily. All of these translations, the latest being the Chinese translation, are also downloadable from the Foundation website for free in several formats, Word, PDF, and others.

Thus, nearly 75% of the world's population can have access to these teachings, one of the ultimate goals of which is to raise human consciousness to prepare the planet for reconnection with the spiritual circuits of the constellation on which it depends: Norlatiadek.

Africa is a major continent whose population will reach 2 billion by the 2050s. (Source UN). Due to the colonial past, African governments have adopted English, French, Portuguese and Arabic as official languages. However, there are hundreds of languages spoken by the populations, some have only a few thousand speakers but others have several tens of millions such as Kiswahili spoken by more than 80 million speakers spread over 7 countries in South-West Africa, [Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Zanzibar and Comoros].

We have recently been contacted by readers from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. In partnership with the Foundation they will form a small team with the aim of translating the revelation into Kiswahili. We will provide them with all our logistical and financial support and help them in this very demanding but oh so rewarding task.
