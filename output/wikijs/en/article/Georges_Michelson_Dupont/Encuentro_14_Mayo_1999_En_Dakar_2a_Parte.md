## Minutes of the Meeting of May 16, 1999

**TOPICS :**

- Cooperation with the Inner Adjuster - **Karim Diallo**
- The Fellowship - **Assane Diagne**

_The different participants_

<ins>Abdoulaye Koitté</ins>: All the exhibitions are imbued with the same value and tinged with the same truth. Mr. Ndiaye's educational work has really paid off. I pray that God grant him a long life and keep him long with us.

The previous 31 years of searching do not equate to the few light-months this group has given me. These 2 expositions make me appreciate again the pedagogical axis that has led us to understand what the Adjuster who lives in our mind and who tries to lead us towards perfection expects of us. In this group I have discovered discipline, that is, respect for progress in personal experience, in the image of my ancestors, to reach the knowledge of God. My desire to be like God has increased thanks to this fellowship.

<ins>Ndèye Khady Diagne</ins>: My spiritual career began in this group. Now I perceive the importance of my being and the obligation to perfect myself to resemble God. My life has changed thanks to the coordinated effort of my Adjuster and my spiritual educator.

The spiritual brotherhood has brought great stability to our family, where polygamy prevails. We have been able to avoid many conflicts both in our family and in the environment that surrounds us.

Fraternally sharing the exhibitions is very enriching, we understand it as a cross-fertilization of our souls.

<ins>Isseu Cissé Diagne</ins>: The first concern that led me to this group was not the search for God. But his welcome and the secular framework induced me to stay. Later, the content of the teaching convinced me more. The results obtained later appeared as answers to all the questions I asked myself.

Cooperation with God is not always easy because of the weight of our materiality, but my spiritual educators, Ndèye Fatou and Doudou, my husband, are a real support. My marriage has been perfected by the cooperative effort with my spouse.

<ins>Khatab Ndiaye</ins>: Micael was moved by the wealth of the Adjuster that inhabits the poor thought of his human host. The difference in nature, added to the misconceptions make it more difficult for the Adjuster to access the mind. However, man always faces 2 realities: God and his own being. God presents himself to us as a Father and it is in this group that our souls have reached the certainty of our filiation with God. Applied pedagogy allows us to reach a satisfactory conception of God, to overcome our selfishness and to live fraternity and confraternity.

In a short time, our personality has known how to change. We perceive equality between all men, and all racial complexes have disappeared. We have also understood the possibility of integrating our work into a universal unity. We perceive to be a part of the Supreme. The effects of fraternity are immeasurable, whether they come from M. Ndiaye, our spiritual educator, or from our spiritual brothers. The work of this group accelerates the clarification processes, even encourages them. God foresaw a contact with the different statuses in the ascension to Paradise. The person who discovers God and spiritual brotherhood in this group can no longer reject this discovery. The fraternal effort of this group is humanly incalculable, it can only be understood in spirituality.

<ins>Moustapha Ndiaye</ins>: The discovery of these teachings constitutes a blessing for us, just as the problems of the world on which God has enlightened us are occasions for him to manifest his infinite mercy. In our progression, God strives to coordinate us with Him. He gives us the opportunity to associate with Him and with other beings in social relationships, and this within the widest diversity. The evolution of the planes of existence allows God to advance the plan of progression of all his creation.

We have prayed a lot and have extensively developed the wisdom to relate effectively with other brothers. Therefore, we must be ready for when God makes our prayers about these encounters come true. Our responsibility is double, because of our affiliation with God the Father and with God the Supreme.

<ins>Georges Dupont</ins>: Twenty years ago we traveled the world to meet with different groups of Urantia Book readers. I confess that I am impressed by the profound pedagogy pioneered by M. Ndiaye. Under his guidance, and with the educators he has trained, we can say that Africa is saved.

I had misgivings about the book's teachings in the Muslim milieu, but they have ceased to make sense because of what I have seen in this group. Moussa has known how to adapt the teachings of the book to Muslim culture with extraordinary wisdom.

The midwayers who participated in the writing of the book made three recommendations:

1. Protect, preserve the integrity of the book and translate it into different languages;
2. Form thousands and thousands of study groups from which one day spiritual educators, leaders will emerge;
3. Find men with means to help spread the book.

Now we can appreciate the wisdom of these intermediate beings, because until now, it is through these study groups that it has been disseminated. My trip to Senegal makes me happy. I feel very honored and grateful to count among your friends and brothers.

<ins>Marlène Dupont</ins>: I support Georges and thank you for all your efforts.

<ins>Moussa Ndiaye</ins>: “Knock and it will be opened to you”, said Jesus. Effort is required of us in the search to find God, but everything goes smoothly. All my life I have carried out a double search: first I wanted to know God and when I found him, I worried about the most appropriate method to instruct Senegalese youth. I have asked God a lot to enlighten the people of my country. To make the grain more pleasant to others, it is always necessary to grind it. What you have already understood is always reexposed to your consciousness to make you more experienced. Do the same with the others. Never be discouraged by not being understood in the moment. Rather, thank God for the obstacles and always try to overcome them with Him. Always strive to penetrate the conscience of men. Never be in a hurry, God has all eternity. Your testimonies are proof that God is in us.

I am calm that I have not disturbed the conscience of our guests. You lead me to the conviction that Senegal is spiritually saved. But be careful, keep the flame alive for the formation of other seekers, the light is not kept under the bed, nor does it enter the eyes. The approach must always be adapted to the receptive capacity of individuals. One must conduct oneself gently, methodically, discerningly, penetratingly and patiently, intellectual, moral and spiritual virtues typical of spiritual educators. In a word, it is simply about loving.

Love is the magic word that saves the world and carries out the divine will.

Since our guests found out about the group through Norman and Roger 5 months ago, they expressed their desire to come and meet us in Dakar and we feel honored by this proof of brotherly love. We also prepare ourselves for trips around the world.

## Exhibition Theme: The Spirit In Man

This work has been carried out by Abdoul Karim DIALLO, on the occasion of the visit of our French and American guests. It is subdivided into five parts:

### Introduction

In the chain of creation of beings endowed with will, man is the weakest link. Created on the periphery of divinity, he initially has no awareness of God. This position puts us in a situation that requires a particular manifestation of God so that the spirit can act in us. God has indeed endowed us with all the necessary equipment to seek and find him. The Helpers, the mind and the personality are instruments to better coordinate with the will of God. But God has gone further by indwelling man's consciousness as Adjuster. All religions talk about it without giving it too much importance. However, this presence is essential to understand the true relations of man with his creator. It is in this presence that I would like to insist in my exposition, since it is an unprecedented situation, a totally particular manifestation of God's love for men. After having created them here below, He honors them with his presence and his support in all the phases of material, morontial and spiritual life. But this many men ignore it. Even knowing it is not the purpose. What man needs is a burning faith and devotion to the highest values. This leads us to address the bases of religious experience.

### II - The Basis of Religious Experience

Men often have a tendency to confuse faith with belief. Belief reaches the level of faith when it motivates life and transforms the way of living. The fact of accepting a teaching as true is not faith: it is a simple belief. Faith leads us to a living communion with higher ideals. The presence of God in each one facilitates it. This faith frees us from all the obstacles that hold back our material ego. This devotion to the highest values is translated by adoration, prayer and service. If it is true that one must know men in order to love them, it is also true that one must love God in order to know him. In his permanent search for perfection, man finds God, who is the very essence of that perfection. Faith elevates us to the ideal of becoming more and more like Him.

Spiritual experience thus requires unwavering faith, sincerity and unreserved devotion to God.

As Michael said: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”

### III - Birth By The Spirit

A man who, by virtue of his impulses and his ideals, associates with God in spiritual experience, ceases to be simply a man. The fruits of that association are not located in the place that men intend to agree. This is not translated by turbans or long rosaries, much less by great erudition. That association means a life of fellowship with God and service to fellow men. The spiritual Ministry acts more and more in this man who has opened his heart to the directives of the Adjuster. The joint action of the human will moved by that motivation and the interior Adjuster, gives birth to the soul, an entity apt to assume the stage that follows.

The fruits of the spirit are recognized at the level of values: the inner life gains ground over the outer aspects. But it is not enough that the spirit dominates all phases of our existence. The morontia soul thus created consecrates itself with the Adjuster within to make us children of God by faith. That is the meaning of birth by spirit.

Jesus said, “Unless he is born again he will not enter the kingdom of heaven.”

### IV - Cooperation With The Adjuster

All religions teach us that God is in us. But men always tend to look for God elsewhere. The awareness of the presence of God in us can greatly facilitate the relationship between man and God. This shows us once again that God loves us and that it only depends on us to know and resemble him. For my part, I have been able to clearly identify the work of the Adjuster in me. Since then I always try to associate my Adjuster to what I do and I am perfectly aware that it is present and active. It is reassuring for man to know that he is inhabited by God. This enhances our position and makes us want to be worthy by faith. I have learned to make the Adjuster a true and loyal companion, an effective partner in the daily struggle to become better. My thanksgiving prayers are a means for me to express my gratitude for the love that the Adjuster never ceases to show me.

### V - My Personal Experience In The Group

In the analysis of my personal experience, I always observe two phases:

The phase prior to my integration into GREPS: like every good Muslim educated in the precepts of Islam, I devoted myself to my religion respecting the cult -my 5 prayers, fasting, almsgiving, avoiding doing harm to my neighbor. From the point of view of my relationships with God, I perceived him as far beyond my comprehension. This provided me with a certain moral ethic but did not facilitate my understanding of God. My questions about God and my metaphysical reflections, which every thinker engages in at some point in his life, did not find satisfactory answers. There were too many contradictions between the nature of God, as observed in the “Quran”, and the behaviors that are bestowed on him. Avenging God, executioner God, warrior God, there have been so many indigestible notions to my conscience. My search impulse was slowed down somewhat by the fact that there was no alternative to understanding God personally and intelligently. The explanation of destiny ended up dissuading me from undertaking anything that was for the best, since they told me that our life was written from our birth and that destiny could not be escaped. So, from that moment on, why make efforts? This situation fed me a feeling of fatalism and resignation. This was my state of mind before coming to the group. The next phase, that of my life in the group, has been very different: I have learned to know myself better as God's project. I have better understood the reality of God and his projects for men, and his way of loving all his creatures. The discovery of Adjuster reality has strengthened my confidence and installed peace in my heart. I have the feeling of belonging to a project of God for an eternity of existence. I have also learned to better relate to God, in cooperation with the Adjuster. The discovery of this reality has erased all anxiety about death.

## Fraternity In Spiritual Experience

**This work has been carried out by Assane DIAGNE, on the occasion of the visit of our French and American guests.**

The cosmos is, because God the Father, First Center Source, wanted it that way. The creation of the cosmos began when the Father said: “Let us make creatures in our image...”. Since then, all the Deities of Paradise have mobilized and associated for this, each one contributing its contribution.

The Father's plan led to the endowment of Adjusters and personality to mortal and evolutionary creatures.

The Donation plan of the Eternal Son led to the donation of the Sons of God in creation, to manifest the Love of the Father and the mercy of the Son.

The plan of Mercy of the Infinite Spirit allows the practical realization of the plans of the Father and the Son; the Infinite Spirit also participates in the administration of creation.

Creation thus began with the Deity and his children, or entities from paradise. The Organizing Deans of forces drew from lower Paradise the primordial forces necessary for creation, manipulated them until they were sensitive to linear gravity; then they handed over to the Directors of Power, who worked on this creative force that came from the Father. Later the Son appears accompanied by the Creative Spirit coming from the Infinite Spirit. With the Ancients of Days, the sons of God will bring into existence the bearers of Life, life on the planets, life of human beings; it is they who, with the plans approved by the creator Son, conceived a biological, material body to which would be added the helpers, the personality and the Thought Adjuster. This is how mortal man was born. When this man awakens to the need for God and aspires to be like Him, he becomes a son of God by faith and enters into the great family of God; You can make your contribution to God's plan in coordination with your brothers. The second spiritual birth justifies the fatherhood of God and therefore the brotherhood of all the children of God, since the morontia soul is created by the Adjuster, who comes from the universal father. It is this soul that makes man a citizen of the cosmos; on the plane of spiritual experience, the soul is the vehicle that, associated with our increasingly perfected personality, fuses with the Adjuster to go towards the original father, and that is always favored by the service of the fraternity.

- Fraternity, in the creation by the children of God, of those who have participated in the creation of our material and morontia worlds.
- Fraternity, in the creation of our being, of the Carriers of Life, Michael and the Creative Spirit.
- Fraternity, then, in the administration with the children of God who mark our journey from the Mansion Worlds to Paradise, to serve us, educate us and help us grow.
- Fraternity of spirits that share our growth efforts and give us all their help.
- Fraternity of the body of revelation that brings us the light of the teachings, for example.
- Fraternity of men born of the spirit in spiritual communion
  - by sharing personal experiences
  - For the spiritual education that makes us discover God's love through life and for that formation that enables us to speak of God with authority
- Fraternity of ancient men, the finaliters of Paradise.

## Conclusion

What God the Father wants to do, he does with his Associates and his Sons. His Love passes through his Children to reach his children. God's love feeds brotherhood.

## Minutes of the Meeting of May 17, 1999

Lecture delivered by **Khatab NDIAYE**

**Subject: Guardianship**

**Introductory speech by M. NDIAYE**

The fraternity lived here confirms something in the meeting of the races, which is an objective of all the children of God. The great project of civilization consists in realizing human sovereignty, the counterpart of divine sovereignty. The justification for the creation of all the universes is found in the meeting of these two sovereignties. According to the divine plan, Adam would have installed a single race and a single color on earth. Finally, it is Michael who has crowned the meeting of the races by spiritual brotherhood. It is always a joy for God that men come together in the spirit; the planetary government works mainly for this purpose.

In Senegal we have understood that we had to cultivate this fraternity and unite with the other races. But first we had to find the God within and relate to Him in order to better identify and love our fellow men in God. We are happy to fraternize with you, we have overcome the barriers of racial colors and found the color of the divine family. We are above all happy that you have enthusiastically agreed to come see us, despite all the difficulties that have finally given way to your dominant desire. Feel grateful for ourselves, our Adjusters, our Souls, all the supramaterial brothers and all the brothers in Spirit. You have allowed us to experience the meeting of the races in the name of God, by God and for God. We thank heaven that has arranged and made it possible.

Our godbrothers leave us about twenty books to distribute according to good logic, especially consider scholars. Thus, we save them the opportunity to know God through unintelligent procedures. On the contrary, we speed up their erudition by making them say to themselves: “show us your knowledge”.

This meeting is part of a plan of international activities that covers several aspects:

* We plan to create a center for the organization of spiritual conferences where the whole world is represented. This corresponds well with the image of Senegal, as a very open country, despite the poverty of ideals of its leaders.
* The idea of representing the foundation of Paris and Chicago in Senegal. The mission of this foundation is to ensure the integrity of the text of the revelation. Machiventa had tried not long ago to preserve the integrity of the divine message on earth, threatened with disappearance. To this end, a gigantic effort and constant vigilance must be made. We pray to God to support the efforts of the foundation in this mission.
* This 5th Revelation is of incalculable wealth for the earth and should be allowed to reintegrate the axis of its evolution. We have to work and pray for the appearance in all countries of representative people who dedicate themselves to the dissemination of the book and to the spiritualization of the men who will come into contact with these revelations. We can be sure that there will be a social awakening after the publication of the book. Therefore, it is totally indicated that there is an African representation for a possible sale.

Above all, we must take care to preserve the spiritual character of the book and try not to be content with its dissemination. We are up for combat and we are aware of our responsibility, we have the same moral duty to preserve this book as an instrument for spiritual education. We pray to God that the flame never goes out, and that women, the threshold of the family, of society and of spirituality, are on their feet.

Thank you for joining your Souls and your Adjusters to ours. We ask God for the material improvement of our homes so that we can receive you better on future visits. God is Spirit and is also Energy. He gives himself to us, and gives us all his attributes, including his Paradise. It is up to us to understand it and try to take advantage of it. We also have to make mutual and continuous gifts, what we live in a fraternal way is inscribed for all eternity.

<ins>Georges</ins>: From now on we live the unity of the races and the unification of the children of God. The first trustees were given the task of spreading the book. But how? Starting with his personal experience. In this, all of you, as born-again beings, are trustees for your life, your work, and your ministry.

I return confident that the Muslim world will be convinced thanks to the excellent pedagogy of M. Ndiaye, who has been able to adapt these teachings to the Muslim religious mentality. We give you all our moral support and our prayers and we assure you that we will keep in touch. We know that we have a foothold in Africa, and that heaven protects us.

### Guardianship

This work has been carried out by Khatabe NDIAYE on the occasion of the visit of our French and American guests.

This exhibition deals with the theme of guardianship, which we develop to consider all forms of attention, guidance and education that a more educated and wiser individual exercises over a younger person, more immature for this purpose. From this point of view, guardianship would take us to more than one section.

- First of all, as a man

Guardianship is the foundation of the spiritual fraternity of men to accept the responsibility of assuming loyally and freely the spiritual development of younger, more immature beings.

- As urantians

The world is currently experiencing the terrible consequences of the disloyalty of some of our former planetary managers (Caligastia-Adam).

- As future educators

We will be led to assume the great responsibility of instructing and educating  spiritually our human brothers.

Having said this, we verify that from one end of the Cosmos to the other, God has arranged it so that the humblest of his children (man) can always be in good care, from the cradle until his admission into the Body of the Finality.

The social differences between creatures, the disparities in the development of individuals of the same stratum, give all beings the opportunity to live a disinterested divine service, to lend a compassionate hand to their less fortunate brothers.

#### I - Material Level

At this level, man is born into existence as a helpless baby but protected by loving parents with almost divine love. The family (other brothers and sisters) and society are also scenarios where they develop their humanity and complete their sociability.

Also on this material level you will find the guide, the spiritual educator who allows your mind to become more sensitive to supramaterial realities and your faith to rise until you become a true child of God by faith, aware of your double nature (material and spiritual) and the need to harmonize them into a single unit of existence.

#### II - Morontia Level

The morontia level of existence (realm of the Soul) is essentially marked by the extraordinary protection of the guardian angel. With irreproachable fidelity, true efficacy and disinterested love, the guardian angel preserves our destiny and progressively harmonizes us with the Holy Spirit, with the Spirit of Truth and with the Adjuster.

Through the ministry of the guardian angel, many other beings contribute their cooperation to the spiritual development of man: intermediate beings, physical controllers, supervisors of the morontia power.

#### III - Spiritual Level

At this level, the human being has all the wealth of divinity to guide him through the dark environments of life on earth, the disadvantages of space and the pitfalls of time.

Spiritual tutelage begins with the presence of the Adjutants of Worship and Wisdom, continues with the entry into the circuit of the Holy Spirit, and ends in eternity with the Thought Adjuster.

The greatest characteristic of guardianship is that it is exercised in the spirit of divine service, that is, with love and without coercion. Their responsibility is enormous, since the consequences of being able to lead to extinction are often dramatic.

For man, God has carried out the most extraordinary tutelary service due to its extension, duration and purpose. Is it not, ultimately, in order to train you to assume similar high responsibilities, similar trust missions, in the developing universes of outer space?

### Participants:

<ins>Richard</ins>: Following the example of Jesus, we manifest the fruits of the Spirit wherever we are led by circumstances. We are all invited to experience a difficult and challenging common life. Someone asked me one day, seeing my enthusiasm in living with God:

- Do you, the readers of Urantia, want to create a new religion? “We don't need a new religion,” I replied, “we are not new ”religionists," but religious men.

The book tells us: everything is a means to an end. I hope that for myself, for you and for all readers, the Urantia Book will be a means to an end. We would find difficulties if we believed that the book is an end in itself; rather they are ends in themselves to relate to the Adjuster and to relate to our brethren. These two relationships are the eternal ends of existence. Living with you during these few days has been a caress from heaven. In you, we have seen a wonderful spiritual group. You are also a beautiful race. It is a real pleasure to have met you. Our contacts will continue until eternity. I greet you and the God who inhabits you.

<ins>Moussa Ndiaye</ins>: Every man is his neighbor's guardian. “You love your neighbor as yourself”. This sums up the guardianship aspect and supports Richard's thinking, loving God and loving your neighbor is an end in itself. It is so coherent and practical that it seems natural, however, it is neither easy nor obvious. We must learn to be tutors at all times. With his apostles, Michael incarnated first lived as a brother who taught divine truths, the axis of their lives. Then he lived as his friend, sharing his Soul and giving his Life. And finally, he loved them as a father, thus representing the Universal Father for them.

Guardianship has a practical aspect. If it were possible for God to make Himself known without being born in the human model, He would have done so. Jesus came to incarnate to live the model of the Father, not only for those who see, but also for all those who believe without having seen, by accepting the Spirit of Truth who embodies the Truth for all the children of God.

The model is important, inevitable for the spiritual awakening of man and for his religious evolution. The model of Jesus instructs us on the technique of communion with the three Center Sources of Paradise. Loving men as a brother, he communes with the Second Center Source. In the phase of fusion with his Adjuster, he communes with the First Center Source. A man's relationship with his fellow men is an end in itself.

We must reflect deeply on the notion of the tutor. The tutelary function of our Guardian Angels consists in how much order they place in our mental circuits to make them accessible to the Adjuster. The work of the Angel requires, like that of a godfather, a great responsibility due to its importance and its difficulty. The Angels continually try to make our thoughts coordinate with the Adjuster, with the Spirit of Truth and with the Holy Spirit without violence, gently and with total respect for our Free Will. And when we don't cooperate, be careful! they cry. Isn't that also the job of women? We must accept the guardianship of Georges, Richard and Marlène, and also, be guardians for them. We also have to be always present in the building of their works, just like they are with us. We are eternally committed to the moral obligation to work fraternally on earth and we entrust ourselves to Michael who invites us to do so. Wherever two or more people meet in his name, Jesus is among them.

Thanks to the God of Nebadon and the God of Paradise for making this possible.

<ins>Assane Diagne</ins>: Khatab's exposition restores in our thought the love of God for man, a love manifested by God himself, by all tutelary beings, by all beings born of the Spirit. The Adjuster continually showers it on us. We can easily imagine that the man who treasures the love of all his brothers and companions in his paradisiacal ascension will be a colossus when he reaches Paradise as a Finaliter. But from here, I benefit from all those contributions integrated into my own personal experience.

In the fraternity, we give what we are in God. We are all, then, within the framework of guardianship. Let's give always, always and everywhere. We are with you wholeheartedly.

<ins>Moussa Ndiaye</ins>: I am very impressed by Richard's way of praying and it makes me reconsider this role of tutor. Life is a ministry. I thank you in advance for all that you will project in your intention of spiritual promotion in our direction. Walk in the axis of guardianship. Guardianship is a much less easy activity than we would tend to believe. It demands a lot of subtlety and sharpness. It is not simply a question of proclamation, but of communion of Souls, of self-giving within continuous adjustments and adaptations; may our Adjusters teach us to be good tutors. We can greatly inconvenience, and even hurt other souls because of our language. Jesus suffered it during his life on earth, which led him to use parables. It is necessary to learn to handle our role as tutor, learn to penetrate the souls of others with the high art of loving and serving.

<ins>Fatou Sow</ins>. We thank our brother guests and friends for their stay, their love and for all the support they have given us. I wish you a happy return.

<ins>Monique Ndiaye</ins>: Since the airport, I have been captivated by the quality of your fraternity. You have offered me the opportunity to fully experience the meeting of the races without any barriers. We were able to share with Norman and Roger, but with you, I have lived a real brotherhood, a deep communion and an immense joy. This meeting is the beginning of rich and varied exchanges that await us in the near future for the dissemination of this 5th Revelation. Please be assured of our love, support and prayers for the achievement of this divine ideal that we share together.

Good return among yours. Our Souls and our Adjusters are with you.

<ins>Karim Diallo</ins>: This meeting has allowed us to live out our hopes of an interracial meeting in God. All human barriers have given way to the effectiveness of this spiritual brotherhood that will always remain. I wish you a good return.

<ins>Doudou Diagne</ins>: Love is essential for human life. Man discovers that his neighbor also needs his love. His great problem is to come to an understanding of this guardianship and this love. We must learn to become guardians in the same way that we have been served. The only word, the only key, the only technique, is love.

This year's meeting with Richard, Georges and Marlène is exceptional. There are events that are of capital importance, when man knows God and discovers that the Spirit is the strongest. Teaching gives us the truth, its reality is given to us by experience. We thank our godbrothers and all of heaven for this opportunity to discover the same divine love across races. This is the beginning of a long spiritual trade.

<ins>Moussa Ndiaye</ins> : We remind you that our brothers present here had sent us a hundred books with Norman and Roger. They themselves have brought us fifteen books, CDs and some work instruments for a better study and understanding of the book. However, we must take good note that the entire content of the book and the infinity of the Adjuster in us is unreal if we do not live it. On the contrary, if we live it, a new reality emerges, not contained in the book, the Light of Supremacy, which satisfies God for having created the Cosmos.

The aim of the book is to bring forth divine beings. We have to live it so that God the Supreme appears.

## The Women&#39;s Meeting, May 17, 1999

**Minutes of the meeting of the women of GREPS with Mrs. Marlène DUPONT**

Meeting at the home of Mrs. Marème Sèye Ndiaye of the women of GREPS with Mrs. Marlène DUPONT, at 4:00 p.m. on May 17, 1999. The conversations were very instructive and here is a synthesis of the different ideas that were they tried.

This meeting was highly appreciated by all those who participated in it. It was the first time in Senegal that women came together around a double and very significant interest in the cosmic economy, because it was about:

- An interracial encounter of different cultures, thoughts and ages;
- An exchange of a purely spiritual nature and of a fairly high level.

Women have been long awaited in their spiritual appointment. The evolution of thought, culture and religion have made possible their access to a high understanding of divine things. We have witnessed in Senegal the evolution of feminine thought in the progressive acquisition of spiritual receptivity. Currently this allows the women of this teaching to break down the barriers of a purely human and material order, and to joyfully and fully engage in interracial exchanges of exceptional beauty.

Women have come to the conviction that personal choice is paramount and allows them to free themselves and affirm their authenticity, whatever the social problems attached to tradition, common customs and culture. They can, with grace and charm, effectively adapt all the truths contained in these present revelations to the everyday situations of life, in which they appear as privileged companions. They claim not to be revolutionaries that cause imbalances in society. Rather, and thanks to the light they have received, they strive to improve everything they do in their respective families and in society in general.

Those who are married become less possessive and come to respect their spouse&#39;s free will more and more. The life of a couple in companionship and complicity is clearly perfected for the benefit of their children. The education of the progeny is increasingly enlightened by cosmic wisdom and is oriented, by God&#39;s design, in knowing how to make potential children of God emerge. The burdens of family life have been greatly lightened and they find great pleasure in starting each day over with the intention of doing better than the day before.

Those who are not yet married anticipate marriage with more serenity, greater understanding of family ethics and role. Since God has become paramount in their lives, they want their future partner to grant respect and consideration for their already consecrated life. Above all, they want to achieve a perfect coordination and harmonization of their life as a daughter of God with the role of wife and mother.

Strong in the example of the Divine Minister, the spiritual woman knows how to invite her Adjuster in all the details of life, mainly in the applications of health and in the preparation of meals.

They long to develop their wisdom in the art of brotherly sharing divine truths with all who ask. They awaken to the clear awareness of the important role they have to play in the family and in all the means of life, a very perceptible role in today&#39;s civilization, hence the need to give priority to their family, social and spiritual education.

They also want to develop their national and international openness towards all those who want, behind them, to discover and live their authentic status from the divine bases. They pray for the increase in the number of women apostles and educators. It seems that they present more aptitudes to listen and perceive the feminine thought in the specificity of their women&#39;s problems, in the sphere that is proper to them.

On the other hand, the education of women by men is more stimulating and responds better to the rule of binary of our Local Universe, directed jointly by the Creator Son and the Divine Minister for the creation and administration of the beings of their universe. Actually, from here until Paradise, the differences between the man and the woman will remain, and both will be called to stimulate each other, help each other, intrigue and encourage each other.

The educators of the 1st promotion, directed by M. Ndiaye himself, testify that their rapid evolution is the result of the continuous stimulation that the Soul of M. Ndiaye provokes in their women&#39;s Souls.

Men and women will not survive, they will not resist, they will not create, if it is not through voluntary and sincere cooperation.

The session adjourned at 18:00 and was followed by the last meeting of the GREPS members with our guests and Godbrothers.
