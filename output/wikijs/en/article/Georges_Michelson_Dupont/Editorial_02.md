Dear readers,

We sincerely hope that this issue 106 of your LINK will find you in good shape despite the uncertainties weighing on Europe and the disasters of war on its doorstep.

Our national meeting will be held this year at La Neylière, in the premises of the Marist community in the Monts du Lyonnais from June 27 to 30, 2024. Around twenty of us will be there.

The following topics are planned for the agenda:

1. Preparation for the European conference of readers of the _Urantia Book_ which will be held from June 6 to 9, 2025 in Paris at the Ravel Hotel. You will find at the end of the LINK, the information available to date. The budget is under study and the rates will be finalized at the end of September 2024. The presentations will be recorded and broadcast live on YouTube and although the conference is “European”, we expect participants from many other Urantia countries.
2. Why are so few people, especially young people, not interested in revelation? What are the new means of communication to use to reach an increasingly “connected” audience? Why is our association shrinking like a piece of shagreen? These are the questions that we will address and to which we will try to find the beginnings of an answer.
3. Discussion and approval of the association's accounts for the year just ended.

The LIEN team wishes you a good read of this issue and a good holiday.
