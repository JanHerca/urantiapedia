Georges Michelson-Dupont

With God the Father, sonship is the great relationship

To you, my Father, I affirm my ambition to become experientially perfect one day through the technique of association, integration and unification of my will with your will.

To you, my Thought Adjuster, I earnestly desire that you take possession of my mind to become my Thought Controller and inspire my will to make the following necessary adjustments:

“May my selfishness become altruism by recognizing with all my heart that I must behave righteously towards others, as Jesus taught in his time.

“May the critical judgments of my mind towards my brothers be transformed into friendship and love through the recognition of my own faults.
“May my indifference to the sufferings of others be transformed into empathy and selfless service through the recognition of my duties towards universal brotherhood.

“Let my self-centered inclination become a compassionate attitude toward the suffering of others by giving them the right and intelligent support: the desire to do good.

With God the Supreme, success is the prerequisite for status, one must do something as well as be something.

To you, our Supreme Mother, as a brotherhood of devoted believers, we reaffirm our ambition to work collectively for the dissemination of revelation throughout the world through the technique of interassociation, integration and unification of our diverse expertise and viewpoints:

Seek the greatest possible wisdom in all our decisions by searching for the highest truth in every situation,

Building trust and loyalty in our fellowship by kindly accepting each other as we are and without judgment.

Working together with compassion for one another, for teamwork is one of the most important lessons to be learned on Urantia.

Accept all collective decisions without being frustrated, it is not about us but about the good of the revelation and the growth of the Supreme.

Finally, I would like to salute and honor our brother and friend, Jean Royer, who has just left us temporarily.

Let's allow a minute of silence to pass and pray for him; to remember the good times we had together.

Universal Father and Supreme Mother, we thank you for your support.
