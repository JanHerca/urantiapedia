> _5. *The Urantia Papers.* The papers, of which this is one, constitute the most recent presentation of truth to the mortals of Urantia. These papers differ from all previous revelations, for they are not the work of a single universe personality but a composite presentation by many beings. But no revelation short of the attainment of the Universal Father can ever be complete. All other celestial ministrations are no more than partial, transient, and practically adapted to local conditions in time and space. While such admissions as this may possibly detract from the immediate force and authority of all revelations, the time has arrived on Urantia when it is advisable to make such frank statements, even at the risk of weakening the future influence and authority of this, the most recent of the revelations of truth to the mortal races of Urantia._ (<a id="a56_861"></a>[[UB 92:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p4_9))



## Grant program

Thanks to specific donations and to fulfill its mission, Urantia Foundation set up in 2022 a grant program called the “Mustard Seed Grant Program” (MSGP) which can be translated as “Mustard Seed” Grant Program with reference to the following quote:

“The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man sowed in his field. Now a mustard seed is the smallest of seeds; but when it has fully grown, it becomes the largest of plants and resembles a tree, so that the birds of the air come and rest in its branches.”

This program is managed by a committee of 6 people, all volunteer members of Urantia Foundation, and is co-directed by two trustees. Its purpose is to financially support projects presented by groups or individual initiatives that are part of the policy of disseminating the teachings of The Urantia Book. More specifically, the grants will support projects that advance education and dissemination in a tangible and measurable way by sowing The Urantia Book and its teachings throughout the world.

The application process for the first 2023 grant cycle closed in January. Twenty-nine initial proposals were received. 18 of these proposals were able to complete the application process and were considered by the committee. These 18 proposals totaled more than $360,000.

After review, the committee recommends funding for eight projects, representing six countries. Some of the projects are recommended with modified grant amounts lower than those initially requested. All of the selected projects total $61,667.19.

The selected and accepted projects are:

**For the USA:**

1. Financial assistance for a project that seeks to prepare motivated students to effectively present the ideas and ideals of the Urantia Revelation to people of all cultures. (Elisabeth Callahan)
