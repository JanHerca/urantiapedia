**Urantia Foundation welcomes four new trustees**

The Trustees of Urantia Foundation are pleased to announce the election of a new generation of Trustees. Our leadership team needs more qualified servers to fulfill our mission of spreading The Urantia Book and its teachings throughout the world.

Each new trustee brings years of professional experience to the _Urantia Book_ community. They add geographic and gender diversity critical to the global expansion of the Fifth Epochal Revelation. “It is wonderful to finally expand the Urantia Foundation Board of Trustees from the current five members to a new nine-member board,” said Marilynn Kulieke, Urantia Foundation vice president. “We are so grateful that each new trustee has chosen to share their talents, experience, and dedication with us. What a wonderful day!”
