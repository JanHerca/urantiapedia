DEAR readers, seekers of truth, Dear members of AFLUB,

So here we are, back from vacation rested, ready to tackle a new term, charged as we are with positive energy to get through the inevitabilities of life. They will be opportunities to progress in wisdom and self-control if we know how to go through them with the living faith that dissolves, absorbs and transcends all the problems of life.

When the apostles were tired, after traveling the roads of Galilee and preaching the gospel, the Master usually granted them a week or two of vacation to rest from the tension and visit their loved ones to encourage them. Thus, when they returned to work, the apostles were refreshed and full of energy to go and proclaim the good news to the lost and the poor.

You have in your hands or rather on your screen the new _Link_. Indeed, during the national meeting held in Neylière from June 18 to 21, the members present unanimously decided to rethink the content and presentation of _Link_, our little quarterly, and you will find inside the new editorial charter as well as the publication dates and the guidelines for sending your studies, news and other information. It was also decided that _Link_ would now be sent electronically to subscribing members who will receive it by email in the form of a PDF file. Subscribers who do not use a computer are requested to make themselves known to the AFLUB secretary who will send them a paper copy by post.

You will have noticed that the _Link_ banner is the same as the one used for the AFLUB Forum web page. We wish to maintain aesthetic consistency as well as optimal visibility of the association.

Finally, we would like to thank the members of the previous team in charge of publishing the _Link_. They all showed remarkable tenacity and a lot of goodwill; it is a job that requires rigor, self-sacrifice and a great sense of responsibility. We thank them for it.

For the editorial team and the Editor-in-Chief:

_Georges Michelson-Dupont_
