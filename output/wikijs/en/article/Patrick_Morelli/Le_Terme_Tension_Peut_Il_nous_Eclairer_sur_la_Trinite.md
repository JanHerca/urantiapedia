The term tension in the singular and plural is used in 25 paragraphs, apart from meanings such as nervous, psychological or other tension.

> “_As a time-space creature would view the origin and differentiation of Reality, the eternal and infinite I AM achieved Deity liberation from the fetters of unqualified infinity through the exercise of inherent and eternal free will, and this divorcement from unqualified infinity produced the first *absolute divinity-tension.* This tension of infinity differential is resolved by the Universal Absolute, which functions to unify and co-ordinate the dynamic infinity of Total Deity and the static infinity of the Unqualified Absolute._” (<a id="a39_541"></a>[UB 0:3.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p3_21))

In this chapter the term tension is used for the first time in The Urantia Book. One of the observations that can be made about the liberation of Deity from the fetters of unqualified infinity is that the inherent and eternal free will of Deity is apparently not included in the fetters of the unqualified. The term divorce also suggests a rupture between the static unqualified and the dynamic infinity of Deity that is resolved or compensated by the Universal Absolute, which reunifies and coordinates these two antipodal states. The Urantia Book deduces that the Universal Absolute was inevitable in the act of the absolute free will of the Universal Father.

> “_This is the primal concept of original reality: The Father initiates and maintains Reality. The primal *differentials* of reality are the deified and the undeified—the Deity Absolute and the Unqualified Absolute. The primal *relationship* is the tension between them. This Father-initiated divinity-tension is perfectly resolved by, and eternalizes as, the Universal Absolute._” (<a id="a43_384"></a>[UB 0:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p4_5))

It should be noted that the first relationship between the deified and the non-deified is in fact the tension between these two extremes. The primordial concept of the original reality that the Father establishes is programmed, desired by him, this differential is resolved by the Universal Absolute which is eternalized to continue to support all realities.

> “_The finite can coexist in the cosmos along with the Infinite only because the associative presence of the Universal Absolute so perfectly equalizes the tensions between time and eternity, finity and infinity, reality potential and reality actuality, Paradise and space, man and God. Associatively the Universal Absolute constitutes the identification of the zone of progressing evolutional reality existent in the time-space, and in the transcended time-space, universes of subinfinite Deity manifestation._” (<a id="a47_514"></a>[UB 0:11.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p11_13))

This tension factor is certainly permanent, even outside the framework of the existential Deities, its manifestation is surely immediate at all levels of reality, the stabilizing activity of the Universal Absolute must be constant. This Universal Absolute is very mysterious because it is specified at:

> “_The Universal Absolute is the potential of the static-dynamic Deity functionally realizable on time-eternity levels as finite-absolute values and as possible of experiential-existential approach. This incomprehensible aspect of Deity may be static, potential, and associative but is not experientially creative or evolutional as concerns the intelligent personalities now functioning in the master universe._” (<a id="a51_415"></a>[UB 0:11.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p11_14))

> “_Paradise is the absolute source and the eternal focal point of all energy-matter in the universe of universes. The Unqualified Absolute is the revealer, regulator, and repository of that which has Paradise as its source and origin. The universal presence of the Unqualified Absolute seems to be equivalent to the concept of a potential infinity of gravity extension, an elastic tension of Paradise presence. This concept aids us in grasping the fact that everything is drawn inward towards Paradise. The illustration is crude but nonetheless helpful. It also explains why gravity always acts preferentially in the plane perpendicular to the mass, a phenomenon indicative of the differential dimensions of Paradise and the surrounding creations._” (<a id="a53_752"></a>[UB 11:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p8_9))

Apart from the definition of the Unqualified Absolute, elastic tension can seem somewhat obscure.

> “_In the eternity of the past, when the Universal Father gave infinite personality expression of his spirit self in the being of the Eternal Son, simultaneously he revealed the infinity potential of his nonpersonal self as Paradise. Nonpersonal and nonspiritual Paradise appears to have been the inevitable repercussion to the Father’s will and act which eternalized the Original Son. Thus did the Father project reality in two actual phases—the personal and the nonpersonal, the spiritual and the nonspiritual. The tension between them, in the face of will to action by the Father and the Son, gave existence to the Conjoint Actor and the central universe of material worlds and spiritual beings._” (<a id="a57_703"></a>[UB 11:9.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p9_3))

The analysis of this last chapter can possibly indicate to us that the personal expression of the Universal Father reveals the creations of actualities such as the Original Son with concomitantly the creation of Paradise, and if arbitrarily, we follow a chronology, the Conjoint Actor and the Central Universe of Havona, the two being created simultaneously. If we make a comparison which is certainly not reason, with the <a id="a59_423"></a>[UB 0:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p4_5), “_the primordial concept of original reality_”, where we are in the presence of potentialities, the Universal Absolute appears to resolve the first tension between the deified and the non-deified. We cannot nevertheless deduce that precedence is given to potentiality over actuality, because we are told that all these phenomena are of eternity and simultaneous.

> “_It is probable that these alternate directions of successive space processions of the universes have something to do with the intramaster universe gravity technique of the Universal Absolute, which consists of a co-ordination of forces and an equalization of space tensions. Motion as well as space is a complement or equilibrant of gravity._” (<a id="a61_349"></a>[UB 12:4.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p4_16))

> “_Passive and potential force becomes active and primordial in response to the resistance afforded by the space presence of the Primary Eventuated Master Force Organizers. Force is now emerging from the exclusive domain of the Unqualified Absolute into the realms of multiple response—response to certain primal motions initiated by the God of Action and thereupon to certain compensating motions emanating from the Universal Absolute. Primordial force is seemingly reactive to transcendental causation in proportion to absoluteness._” (<a id="a63_539"></a>[UB 42:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_8))

In this paragraph, we can note that the Universal Absolute also uses a gravity which coordinates and equalizes spatial tensions. The interventions of the Universal Absolute are truly plural.

> “_2. *Primordial force.* This represents the first basic change in space potency and may be one of the nether Paradise functions of the Unqualified Absolute. We know that the space presence going out from nether Paradise is modified in some manner from that which is incoming. But regardless of any such possible relationships, the openly recognized transmutation of space potency into primordial force is the primary differentiating function of the tension-presence of the living Paradise force organizers._” (<a id="a67_513"></a>[UB 42:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_7))

> “_a. *Puissant energy.* This is the powerful-directional, mass-movemented, mighty-tensioned, and forcible-reacting energy—gigantic energy systems set in motion by the activities of the primary force organizers. This primary or puissant energy is not at first definitely responsive to the Paradise-gravity pull though probably yielding an aggregate-mass or space-directional response to the collective group of absolute influences operative from the nether side of Paradise. When energy emerges to the level of initial response to the circular and absolute-gravity grasp of Paradise, the primary force organizers give way to the functioning of their secondary associates._” (<a id="a69_676"></a>[UB 42:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p2_11))

The last two paragraphs illustrate the compelling need for the manifestation of certain beings, who by their very presence compensate and balance the tensions created by the passage from one system of manifestation to a more diluted one.

The Paradise Trinity—the eternal Deity union of the Universal Father, the Eternal Son, and the Infinite Spirit—is existential in actuality, but all potentials are experiential. Therefore this Trinity constitutes the only Deity reality embracing infinity, and therefore the universal phenomena of the actualization of God the Supreme, God the Ultimate, and God the Absolute occur.

> “_7. *The Universal Absolute.* Unifier of the deified and the undeified; correlator of the absolute and the relative. The Universal Absolute (being static, potential, and associative) compensates the tension between the ever-existent and the uncompleted._” (<a id="a75_260"></a>[UB 105:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/105#p3_8))

> “_The so-called ether is merely a collective name to designate a group of force and energy activities occurring in space. Ultimatons, electrons, and other mass aggregations of energy are uniform particles of matter, and in their transit through space they really proceed in direct lines. Light and all other forms of recognizable energy manifestations consist of a succession of definite energy particles which proceed in direct lines except as modified by gravity and other intervening forces. That these processions of energy particles appear as wave phenomena when subjected to certain observations is due to the resistance of the undifferentiated force blanket of all space, the hypothetical ether, and to the intergravity tension of the associated aggregations of matter. The spacing of the particle-intervals of matter, together with the initial velocity of the energy beams, establishes the undulatory appearance of many forms of energy-matter._” (<a id="a77_957"></a>[UB 42:5.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p5_14))

All these tensions are always compensated by the Universal Absolute:

> “_When the three eternal persons of Deity function as undivided Deity in the Paradise Trinity, they achieve perfect unity; likewise, when they create, either associatively or severally, their Paradise progeny exhibit the characteristic unity of divinity. And this divinity of purpose manifested by the Supreme Creators and Rulers of the time-space domains eventuates in the unifying power potential of the sovereignty of experiential supremacy which, in the presence of the impersonal energy unity of the universe, constitutes a reality tension that can be resolved only through adequate unification with the experiential personality realities of experiential Deity._” (<a id="a81_672"></a>[UB 56:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p6_1))

> “_The conceptual grasp of the Trinity association of Father, Son, and Spirit prepares the human mind for the further presentation of certain other threefold relationships. Theological reason may be fully satisfied by the concept of the Paradise Trinity, but philosophical and cosmological reason demand the recognition of the other triune associations of the First Source and Center, those triunities in which the Infinite functions in various non-Father capacities of universal manifestation—the relationships of the God of force, energy, power, causation, reaction, potentiality, actuality, gravity, tension, pattern, principle, and unity._” (<a id="a83_647"></a>[UB 104:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/104#p2_6))

Throughout the analytical development of this “tension” there is often encountered a unifying element which unifies and coordinates this antagonism. This is also reflected in chapter 5661 (P. 6412) by the unification in progress of God the Supreme and the Almighty Supreme by the Supreme Being. These unifying and coordinating elements are certainly one of the manifestations which are taking place in the Master Universe, so that the unification of the duality of the First Source and Center may appear in its relationship with every part of its creation, which inevitably reaches into the original Trinity and the Seven Absolutes. These Seven Absolutes which in turn, through the functional associations that are the Triunities, produce the same pattern, two antagonistic elements and a unifying coordinating element, this on the existential level first and then through a system of transmissible functional associations, without the Universal Father, on the Ultimate Supreme level that are the two Triodities, the actual and the potential, unifying and certainly creative of the experiential and transcendental Deities that are the Ultimate and the Supreme.

> “_Man’s urge for Paradise perfection, his striving for God-attainment, creates a genuine divinity tension in the living cosmos which can only be resolved by the evolution of an immortal soul; this is what happens in the experience of a single mortal creature. But when all creatures and all Creators in the grand universe likewise strive for God-attainment and divine perfection, there is built up a profound cosmic tension which can only find resolution in the sublime synthesis of almighty power with the spirit person of the evolving God of all creatures, the Supreme Being._” (<a id="a87_583"></a>[UB 116:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p7_6))

> “_The interassociation of the Original, the Actual, and the Potential yields the tensions within infinity which result in the possibility for all universe growth; and growth is the nature of the Sevenfold, the Supreme, and the Ultimate._” (<a id="a89_242"></a>[UB 115:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_9))

> “_God’s gifts—his bestowal of reality—are not divorcements from himself; he does not alienate creation from himself, but he has set up tensions in the creations circling Paradise. God first loves man and confers upon him the potential of immortality—eternal reality. And as man loves God, so does man become eternal in actuality. And here is mystery: The more closely man approaches God through love, the greater the reality—actuality—of that man. The more man withdraws from God, the more nearly he approaches nonreality—cessation of existence. When man consecrates his will to the doing of the Father’s will, when man gives God all that he *has,* then does God make that man more than he is._” (<a id="a91_699"></a>[UB 117:4.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p4_14))

To conclude with these last four paragraphs, the term “tension” perhaps allows us to measure to what extent the initial unity of the First Source Center is primordial to consider, to try to imagine all its reality of creation that follows it. Indeed, apparently from the first manifestation of existential reality, the tension is mentioned by the Urantia Book, tension immediately, not to say simultaneously compensated by the rebalancing of a creation of reality that tends to preserve the underlying original unity, and this on the existential plane. For the levels of reality that follow, absonite and finite, it seems that the process is identical, that is, the permanence of this phenomenon of divergence convergence, linked in an intrinsic way to its original mark of unity of divine perfection, thanks certainly to the inevitability of the Trinity. This permanence of the underlying unity is certainly present in Divine Providence and in many other passages of the _Urantia Book_ that would be interesting to analyze. In addition to this, this phenomenon through the information given to us in paragraph <a id="a93_1111"></a>[UB 115:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_9), implies that all growth in the universe is linked to tensions between the Actual and the Potential.

The return to the creative source of all reality projected into the entire space of the master universe is inevitable, the incompleteness of this reality provoking a tension by its manifestation, includes in its very context of appearance the compensating element linking it to the source of its original unity. For the Universal Father, everything is already accomplished.
