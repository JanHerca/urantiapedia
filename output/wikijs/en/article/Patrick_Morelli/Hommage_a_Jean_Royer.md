Jean Royer left us at the age of 78, his soul is currently sailing with his seraph carrier towards the world of houses. Trying to define Jean is quite difficult, because he is a complex personality, he still lives. What was most striking during his life among us was his sense of reserve and modesty, because despite an obvious erudition he was always full of delicacy and humility. His personality is the only one I have really encountered that deserves this term of erudition.

The breadth of his possibilities was such that his profession allowed him to fully develop his mastery of languages such as English, Greek, Latin, Esperanto. But he was not only a literary man, in the scientific fields he also excelled, during the seventies he wrote a thesis on an astrophysics subject with Jacque Weis, who had the pseudonym at the time “Louis Colombelle”.

He also participated in this field in some of the works of Robert Charroux, published by Laffont. He was also passionate about astronomy, and he was a reference for us in this field.

His range of possibilities covered many other areas, for us the most interesting concerned the Urantia Book, he was an exegete of the Urantia Book, his friendship was unfailing and his loyalty to Urantian concepts was permanent.

When a friend leaves us, we always tend to make more of them than they really are, but as far as he is concerned, everything mentioned in this tribute is true. See you soon Jean.
