In the attempt to understand the distinction that can be made between the Supreme Being, God the Supreme and the Almighty Supreme, does the Supreme Being have one personality or several? The three denominations certainly have only one and the same personality. The diversity probably comes from the level of their manifestation, paragraph 5 of the introduction to booklet 116 is evocative of this positioning.

This is the case for all of Divine creation, which taken separately, without a vision of synthesis of the whole, can appear disparate, anachronistic and lacking in logic. Although we are incapable of having a clear and precise vision of this whole, spiritual clairvoyance, through its fleeting flashes of lucidity, allows us to envisage certain designs of our Creator.

> “_The Supreme Being functions primarily in the central universe as a spirit personality; secondarily in the grand universe as God the Almighty, a personality of power. The tertiary function of the Supreme in the master universe is now latent, existing only as an unknown mind potential. No one knows just what this third development of the Supreme Being will disclose. Some believe that, when the superuniverses are settled in light and life, the Supreme will become functional from Uversa as the almighty and experiential sovereign of the grand universe while expanding in power as the superalmighty of the outer universes. Others speculate that the third stage of Supremacy will involve the third level of Deity manifestation. But none of us really know._” (<a id="a41_762"></a>[UB 116:0.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p0_5))

We can possibly envisage the change of status, between a spiritual personality and a personality of power, by the difference of manifestation through one and the same personality. The beginning of section I of booklet 116, indicates to us the almost indispensable development of the passage from the Supreme Being to the Almighty.

> “_The experience of every evolving creature personality is a phase of the experience of the Almighty Supreme. The intelligent subjugation of every physical segment of the superuniverses is a part of the growing control of the Almighty Supreme. The creative synthesis of power and personality is a part of the creative urge of the Supreme Mind and is the very essence of the evolutionary growth of unity in the Supreme Being._” (<a id="a45_430"></a>[UB 116:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p1_1))

The word enslavement indicates to us the pressure exerted by the Supreme Being, for the execution of his plans (themselves dictated by the Paradise Trinity), on the Almighty executor, thanks to the action of union of synthesis of the supreme mind, which will unify the attributes of power and personality. The result of all this will be, one and the same unified and personal Deity.

> “_The union of the power and personality attributes of Supremacy is the function of Supreme Mind; and the completed evolution of the Almighty Supreme will result in one unified and personal Deity—not in any loosely co-ordinated association of divine attributes. From the broader perspective, there will be no Almighty apart from the Supreme, no Supreme apart from the Almighty._” (<a id="a49_383"></a>[UB 116:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p1_2))

> WITH God the Father, sonship is the great relationship. With God the Supreme, achievement is the prerequisite to status—one must do something as well as be something. (<a id="a51_170"></a>[UB 115:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p0_1))

The Supreme mind can also seem very mysterious, to be differentiated from the infinite mind of the Infinite Spirit and the cosmic mind, ministry of the seven Master Spirits. This mystery comes in part from the appearance of Majeston, following the creation by the seven Master Spirits in correlation with the Trinity of Paradise of the forty-nine Reflective Spirits. Majeston has focused since its appearance the cosmic presence of the supreme mind (<a id="a53_450"></a>[UB 116:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p4_3)).

The Almighty Supreme is inseparable from God the Sevenfold, since his appearance coincides with those of “the high creators and controllers of the evolutionary superuniverses” (<a id="a55_177"></a>[UB 116:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p2_1)), who are part of the first three levels that are the Supreme Creators.

God the Sevenfold consists of:
1. The Creator Sons (and the Creative Spirits)
2. The Ancients of Days
3. The Master Spirits
4. The Supreme Being
5. The Joint Actor
6. The Eternal Son
7. The Universal Father

The Septuple Controllers consist of:
1. The Master Physical Controllers
2. The Supreme Centers of Power
3. The Supreme Directors of Power
4. The Almighty Supreme
5. The God of Action
6. Paradise Island
7. The Source of Paradise — the Universal Father

In the composition of the Sevenfold Controllers, just one remark can possibly be made, the Eternal Son appears absent.

One of the reasons why the Sevenfold God appears is given to us in the second paragraph of section 2 of booklet 116:

> “_Unqualified Paradise Deity is incomprehensible to the evolving creatures of time and space. Eternity and infinity connote a level of deity reality which time-space creatures cannot comprehend. Infinity of deity and absoluteness of sovereignty are inherent in the Paradise Trinity, and the Trinity is a reality which lies somewhat beyond the understanding of mortal man. Time-space creatures must have origins, relativities, and destinies in order to grasp universe relationships and to understand the meaning values of divinity. Therefore does Paradise Deity attenuate and otherwise qualify the extra-Paradise personalizations of divinity, thus bringing into existence the Supreme Creators and their associates, who ever carry the light of life farther and farther from its Paradise source until it finds its most distant and beautiful expression in the earth lives of the bestowal Sons on the evolutionary worlds._” (<a id="a79_922"></a>[UB 116:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p2_3))

This is certainly one of the typical phenomena of dilution, which the Deity operates to be manifest and perceptible, at the level of time and space. As for God the Sevenfold, unlike the existential level, where the seven Absolutes manifest themselves in a functional manner, through a triple combination, the experiential level apparently gives preference to the sevenfold functional combination for its spiritual and material manifestations.

> “_The Universal Father achieves freewill liberation from the bonds of infinity and the fetters of eternity by the technique of trinitization, threefold Deity personalization. The Supreme Being is even now evolving as a subeternal personality unification of the sevenfold manifestation of Deity in the time-space segments of the grand universe._” (<a id="a83_349"></a>[Introduction: 7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p7_8))

God the Sevenfold is a creative expansion of God the Supreme.

> “_*God the Supreme* in Havona is the personal spirit reflection of the triune Paradise Deity. This associative Deity relationship is now creatively expanding outward in God the Sevenfold and is synthesizing in the experiential power of the Almighty Supreme in the grand universe. Paradise Deity, existential as three persons, is thus experientially evolving in two phases of Supremacy, while these dual phases are power-personality unifying as one Lord, the Supreme Being._” (<a id="a87_478"></a>[UB 0:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p7_7))

Pious the Sevenfold is the only means at our disposal, page 11 — 5 Introduction “To compensate for the finite nature of creature status and to overcome their limitations of concept, the Universal Father has established for evolutionary creatures a sevenfold approach to Deity.” (<a id="a89_279"></a>[Introduction: 7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p8_1))

To conclude, even if this Sevenfold God is made up of 1,400,032 personalities: (700,000 Creator Sons, 700,000 Creative Spirits), 21 Ancients of Days, 7 Master Spirits, 1 Supreme Being, 1 God the Spirit, 1 God the Son and finally God the Father, the Sevenfold God allows the finalization of the total emergence of the Supreme Being, who will take his full and complete place in one of the two trinities subsequent to Havona, The Ultimate Trinity made up of:

The Supreme Being
The Supreme Personalities
The Absonite Architects of the Master Universe.

The multiple unified in the Ultimate Trinity.
