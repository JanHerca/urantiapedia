When we are born, we get on the train and meet our parents, and we believe they will travel forever with us.

However, at one station, our parents will get off the train, leaving us alone to continue the journey...

As time passes, other people get on the train.

And they will be important: our siblings, friends, children, even the love of our life.

Many will resign (even the love of our life) and leave a more or less large void.

Others will be so discreet that you won't realize they've left their seats.

This train journey will be full of joys, sorrows, expectations, hellos, goodbyes and farewells.

Success is having good relationships with all passengers as long as we give the best of ourselves.

We don't know at which station we will get off. So let's live happily, love and forgive!

It is important to do this, because when we get off the train, we should leave only beautiful memories for those who continue their journey...

Let's be happy with what we have and thank heaven for this fantastic journey.

Also, thank you for being a passenger on my train.

And if I have to get off at the next station,
I'm happy to have walked a part of the way with you
I want to say to every person who reads this text that I thank you for being in my life and traveling on my train.
