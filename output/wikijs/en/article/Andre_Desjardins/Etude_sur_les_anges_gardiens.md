Guardian angels or guardians of destiny are undoubtedly the most misunderstood and unknown celestial helpers for most human beings. The vast majority of people living on our planet believe in angels and their personal guardian angel, but many of these beliefs are often far-fetched and not in accordance with the real functions of angels. Many things are said or have been said and much is written about angels; one only has to go to stores specializing in esotericism or go to a bookstore in the “spirituality” section to realize this. This means that we can have a very personal interpretation according to the image we have of angels and their functions. The purpose of this study is to better understand the function of the Seraphic Guardians in relation to the function of the Thought Adjusters. Their task is less recognized and yet so essential to the survival of the personality of its human associate.

The best description of these seraphic bodies is probably in _The Urantia Book_ and several papers are devoted to them, and even then, these seraphim seem to be unknown among the most knowledgeable readers. These spirit beings are a creation of the Mother Spirit of the local Universe and number over 71,663,616 individuals as mentioned in _The Urantia Book_: <a id="a22_360"></a>[[UB 38:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/38#p6_2)] constitutes the largest operational organization of seraphim, an angelic army. It is rather difficult to elaborate and fully understand the very numerous work and functions of all the Seraphic Corps in our local universe. Some of these angelic beings are destined to serve in various capacities in their local universe and others are destined to become guardian angels.

Guardian angels are perhaps the most intriguing of the seraphim; they lack the prestige and notoriety of the Thought Adjuster because they work in the shadow of the latter. They do not have the same appeal as the indwelling Adjuster, but their work in the background is essential to personality survival since the morontia soul is in their precious custody. Their origin is different from the Thought Adjuster, and this is perhaps the primary reason why they do not have the same appeal. Thought Adjusters emanate from the Universal Father, and seraphim have their origin in the local universes; they are a creation of the Mother Spirit of a local universe, and the majority of seraphim serve in various capacities there, but most of them can qualify for the attainment of the sacred spheres of Paradise.

Seraphim are not born as men; they are born as they are and in full possession of all their faculties, but they can change their status through their service to the ascenders. They are born in an adult and mature state, but they are devoid of experience, unlike the birth and experiential growth of a human being such as here on the planet. It is rather difficult to comprehend the full complexity of their ministry, but in all such cases seraphim must conform to the injunction to be perfect; no one can evade this obligation of the experience of evolutionary perfection in time-space. Thought Adjusters must also conform to this in order to have the real and essential experience for their ministry; even our Master Son Michael of Nebadon had to bestow himself seven times in order to have the experience among the creatures of his universe.

Regarding the seraphim, the UB states: <a id="a37_39"></a>[[UB 39:0.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p0_10)] “Man begins life as a helpless infant; hence every mortal attainment must embrace all experiential prerequisites; seraphim have no such preadult life—no childhood. They are, however, experiential creatures, and by experience and through additional education they can augment their divine and inherent endowment of ability by the experiential acquirement of functional skill in one or more of the seraphic services.” Thus, the evolution of seraphim is different from human beings; the difference is in their service; they must acquire skill and practical experience in the experiential worlds by evolving in status and experience. Through their service to mortals, they thus acquire practical experience.

However qualified these angels may be, they cannot take the initiative in leaving their local universes; they are confined there according to their abilities and functions for the needs of the personalities who reside there. If it were possible for the seraphim to move out of their local universes of their own accord, the seraphim population might decrease and influence their service to mankind. According to the UB, the creation of seraphim is still current: <a id="a39_463"></a>[[UB 38:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/38#p1_3)] “Seraphim are still being periodically created; the universe of Nebadon is still in the making. The Universe Mother Spirit never ceases creative activity in a growing and perfecting universe.” This assumes that as soon as a seraphic guardian leaves his local universe in order to pursue his co-destiny with his human associate, he is replaced considering that the creation of seraphim is still current in order to maintain the minimum of 71,663,616 individuals as mentioned in ***The Urantia Book***. Thus the Mother Spirit of the Universe creates another seraphim in order to replace the void left by this seraphic guardian. This new seraphim is born without experience, a bit like a baby being born on our planet.

The best way for a seraphim to get out of the local universe is to apply for the position of seraphic guardian, but before they can take on this role they must qualify and gain the experience necessary to attain the title of personal guardian assigned to a human associate. In this regard, the UB tells us: <a id="a41_307"></a>[[UB 39:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p8_5)] “The supreme choice of seraphim in the career of time is the post of guardian angel in order that they may attain the career of finality and be qualified for assignment to the eternal spheres of seraphic service.”

Only successful destiny guardians can be sure of following with their human associate the progressive path of evolutionary ascension. These seraphim, by passing through the ascending experience of mortal beings, thus share the destiny of our human nature. The UB states: <a id="a43_271"></a>[[UB 113:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p7_7)] “For seraphim, the surest way of achieving the Paradise Deities is by successfully guiding a soul of evolutionary origin to the portals of Paradise. Therefore is the assignment of guardian of destiny the most highly prized seraphic duty.” These seraphim have a personal interest in the guidance of an ascending mortal. Since these angels guide the ascending career and destiny of their human associate, they can thus pass out of the local universe and be enlisted in the Corps of the Finality. Therefore they are rightly called destiny guardians. That destiny guardian who is associated with us in time also becomes our finaliter associate in eternity; for this seraph, it is the quintessence of his achievement.

By guiding an ascending mortal, the seraphic guardian thus secures a pass to achieve this goal. To give an example, imagine a bodyguard carrying important files on behalf of a dignitary; this in effect gives him permission to go anywhere to follow and accompany this dignitary, in the same way that this same bodyguard cannot take any initiative to go anywhere if he is not accompanied by his dignitary. Thus, by guiding the destiny of ascenders, these guardians of destiny determine their own destiny.

The difference between the Thought Adjuster and the Seraphic Guardian is in their respective functions, but they always work together in perfect harmony as mentioned in the UB: <a id="a47_177"></a>[[UB 113:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p4_5)] “While there is apparently no communication between the indwelling Adjusters and the encompassing seraphim, they always seem to work in perfect harmony and exquisite accord.” In order to better understand the difference in their respective functions, one must imagine the functioning of a computer. There are two important components inside a computer: the burner and the hard drive and the data written on the hard drive.

Let's assume that the recorder is the Thought Adjuster, the hard drive could represent our mind and the data recorded could be represented by the Seraphic Guardian on the hard drive. In order to simplify these actions, we must be able to give a concrete example of these actions. Thus the UB mentions: <a id="a49_302"></a>[[UB 110:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p2_3)] “The Adjuster does not seek to control your thought as such, but rather to spiritualize it, to give it an eternal character.” The UB also tells us: <a id="a49_496"></a>[[UB 113:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p3_4)] “And herein is revealed the reason why the seraphic guardian eventually becomes the personal custodian of the mind patterns, memory formulas, and soul realities of the mortal survivor during that interval between physical death and morontia resurrection.”

By coordinating all of this information and changing the Thought Adjuster's term “spiritualize” to “digitize” and changing the Seraphic Guardian's term “memory formulas” to “inscribed data” and ultimately our mind and identity could represent the hard drive on the computer.

The Father has thought of everything and has done everything to ensure that nothing is lost of the identity so essential to the survival of the human personality. Thus the Seraphic Guardian is the eternal guardian in order to preserve the experiential values of his human associate always accompanied by his complement of being as mentioned in the UB: <a id="a53_352"></a>[[UB 113:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p2_9)] “When a seraphic pair accept guardian assignment, they serve for the remainder of the life of that human being. The complement of being (one of the two angels) becomes the recorder of the undertaking. These complemental seraphim are the recording angels of the mortals of the evolutionary worlds.” In digital language, we could call the complement of being like the “back up” or an exact copy of the original data on a computer.

The work of the seraphic guardian takes on its full meaning during repersonalization and with the help of the Thought Adjuster and assisted by the complement of being, he so preciously preserves the values and the personal data attached to the experience of his human associate. Thus with the help of the Thought Adjuster and the help of the complement of being, everything must be coordinated and unified so that everything is in accordance with the repersonalization of the unique identity of the associated personality. This coordination is essential for repersonalization on the morontia worlds, just as in a computer; everything must be in accordance so that the data recorded are gathered, unified and synchronized as in a single operation.

In conclusion of this study; although our morontia soul is a joint co-creation of our mind and our Thought Adjuster, but without the intervention of our seraphic guardian we could not access this eternal union with our Thought Adjuster as described in the UB: <a id="a61_260"></a>[[UB 113:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p7_4)] “And as you ascend the morontia spheres, eventually it is the seraphic guardians who witness and certify the decrees of your eternal union with the Thought Adjusters.” This is why the seraphic guardian plays an essential role in the repersonalization of his human associate, because everything that is attached to personal values relating to our personality is preserved by him.
