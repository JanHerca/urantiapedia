<p style="text-align:center;">
You tell me, Sir, that I have bad luck,<br>
That with this life that I lead, I am ruining myself,<br>
That we gain nothing by overdoing it:<br>
You tell me, finally, that I am tired.<br>
Yes, sir, I am tired: and I flatter myself about it!<br>
I'm tired in everything, my voice, my heart, my spleen,<br>
I fall asleep exhausted, I wake up tired,<br>
But thank God, sir, I don't care.<br>
Or, when I do care, I make a fool of myself.<br>
Fatigue, often, is just bragging...<br>
We are never as tired as we think!<br>
And even if that were the case, wouldn't we have the right to do so?<br>
I'm not talking to you about dark weariness,<br>
That we have, when the body is worn out by habits,<br>
Only has pale reasons to move...<br>
When you have made yourself your only horizon.<br>
When you have nothing to lose, to win or to defend.<br>
This fatigue is bad to hear.<br>
She has a heavy brow, a dull eye, a rounded back<br>
And gives you the appearance of a dying living being.<br>
But feeling yourself bend under the formidable weight<br>
Lives for which, one fine day, we became responsible,<br>
Knowing that we have joys or tears in our hands,<br>
Knowing that we are the tool, that we are its tomorrow.<br>
Knowing that you are the leader, knowing that you are the source,<br>
Helping a life to continue its course,<br>
And for that fight until your heart wears out:<br>
This fatigue, sir, is happiness.<br>
And sure that with each step, with each assault that we deliver,<br>
We are going to help a being to live or survive,<br>
And sure that we are the road and the port and the ford,<br>
Where would one get the right to be too tired?<br>
Those who make their life a beautiful adventure<br>
Mark each victory hollow on their face,<br>
And when misfortune comes to put another hole in it,<br>
Among so many other hollows, it goes unnoticed.<br>
Fatigue, sir, is always a fair price.<br>
It is the price of a day of effort and struggle.<br>
It is the price of labor, of a wall or of an exploit,<br>
Not the price we pay, but the one we receive.<br>
It's the price of work, of a full day.<br>
This is proof, sir, that we walk with life.<br>
When I come home at night and my house is asleep,<br>
I listen to my sleep and, there, I feel strong!<br>
I feel all puffed up with my humble suffering<br>
And my fatigue, then, is a reward.<br>
And you advise me to go and rest!<br>
But if I accepted what you are proposing to me,<br>
If I abandoned myself to your sweet intrigue,<br>
But I would die, sir, sadly of fatigue.<br>
</p>

Robert Lamoureux
