One of the paragraphs that has filled me the most is the following:

You will learn that you increase your burden and reduce your chances of success if you take yourself too seriously. Nothing takes priority over the work in the sphere in which you are situated, whether in this world or the next. The work of preparation for the next and higher sphere is very important, but nothing is as important as your work in the world in which you find yourself living. However, although the work is important, the self is not. When you feel important you lose energy in the natural wear and tear of ego dignity, so that little energy is left to do the work. It is not the importance of the work but the importance of self that exhausts immature creatures. It is the weight of self that exhausts, not the effort of achievement. You can do important work if you do not give yourself importance. You can do several things as easily as one thing if you let go of your self. Variety is soothing; it is monotony that wears and exhausts. One after another, the days run the same and always with the same alternative: life or death. <a id="a42_1048"></a>[UB 48:6.37](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p6_37)

I am fortunate to always have this gem present at work and it is a great liberation. It makes life much easier for me, and for some reason unknown to me it seems that this attitude is perceived and valued by those with whom I share my time.

In other areas, however, I am not able to apply it as I would like. At home, for example, it is much more difficult for me to apply it naturally, I don't know if it is because each member naturally occupies a different role, or for another reason. Even in the UBIS courses, where the ego is well domesticated, I have not been able to apply it at the level I would like, because even though I am humble, I continue to give myself a lot of importance in meditating on the answers, which greatly limits my interactions and ability to move forward.

Many times I imagine a world applying this simple lesson, the unnecessary suffering that would be saved, the happiness that could be achieved and the great spiritual leap that it would represent in the face of the exclusive and selfish steamroller. And not only in situations of war or great social dramas like the current ones, but also on a family and personal level, at home. The fears and complexes that limit us would never have a place. We would be unstoppable, capable of bringing out the best in each personality, and of “surprising” even the Supreme with our contributions.
