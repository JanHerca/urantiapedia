On January 14, around fifteen people gathered to pay a final tribute to **François Dupont**, who carried the Belgian movement for almost 40 years.

His wife, **Annette**, was present.

Everyone was able to express in simplicity and meditation the memory they had of François. Several messages also came from France, as François had been so present in the French movement, and even one of the founders of the **AFLUB**.

François Dupont was not only a reader, but also a great teacher of The Urantia Book.

He set up several book reading groups and supported these groups for several years.

I would like to pay tribute to a great thinker, a great intellectual who was a guide for many people and for me, personally.

When I gave my first lectures on The Urantia Book, François was next to me.

He was someone I could count on and he was very important to me as a support when we created our readers' association in Belgium.

For nearly 40 years Francis referred to The Urantia Book and we know that now he is on the Mansion world to continue his life of service as he did here on earth.

Francis was a worker of God, because during this entire period when he developed the knowledge of The Urantia Book for himself and for others, he brought himself and others closer to God.

Now we rejoice that he is coming even closer to God.

“Human life continues—survives—because it has a function in the universe, the task of finding God. Animated by faith, the soul of man cannot stop until it has reached this goal of destiny, and when it has reached this divine goal, it can no longer end, for it has become like God—eternal.”

Jean Annet
