We arrived this morning of April 26 at Notre Dame des Lumières, which is hosting a national meeting of readers of the _Urantia Book_ organized by the AFLUB. The place, with an inspiring name, is magnificent: the presence of a cloister, a chapel and religious statues gives the place a serene atmosphere. In addition, its location in a very calm natural setting encourages meditation.

This is the first time we have attended this type of meeting. How many of us will there be? What are the other participants like? What are we going to do? Many questions are racing through our minds.

The welcome is warm. "Where are you from? How long have you been reading the book... These questions allow us to make initial contact. Then we attend a first meeting, which brings everyone together while each person writes down their contact details on a sheet, which will then be distributed to the participants. There are about fifty of us.

Then we split into two groups. We will work with Georges Dupont on the theme that unites us: “If we only learn to love those who love us, we are destined to live a narrow and mediocre life”. A participant reads the passage that is the subject of our study and everyone can give their opinion or make a comment, which gives rise to a fascinating debate. It is also an opportunity to practice listening, to accept the point of view of the other if it is different from ours.

In the afternoon we go to the group led by Moussa, whose qualities we have heard about. We are not disappointed, Moussa leads the meeting with great skill and his interventions are very interesting. Clearly we are in front of someone of great quality.

The next morning is devoted to the general meeting. Even if it is not a study, it is still interesting to see how it goes. The meeting is well led by Séverin and criticisms or requests for clarification are issued without it turning into endless discussions.

These different meetings were interspersed with meals where we were able to get to know different participants better. After the one on Sunday lunchtime, which closed these two days, we returned happy to have participated in this meeting. Beyond the words, something was happening, we felt in communion with the people present. And it gives hope to see that on our planet so torn apart, where there is so much suffering, something new, positive, inspiring is being born. May love grow and suffering diminish.

Fraternally.

Anne and Thierry Lepage
