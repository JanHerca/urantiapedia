## Purpose

> The purpose of cosmic evolution is to achieve unity of personality through increasing spirit dominance, volitional response to the teaching and leading of the indwelling Spirit of God. (<a id="a38_188"></a>[UB 112:2.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p2_15))

> “Although this gospel of the kingdom never fails to bring great peace to the soul of the individual believer, it will not bring peace on earth until man is willing to believe my teaching wholeheartedly and to establish the practice of **doing the Father's will** as the **chief purpose in living** the mortal life.” (Jesus) **When a person finds God they have found everything**. (<a id="a40_383"></a>[UB 180:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p6_1))

## Religion

Religion is the revelation to mankind of the divine and eternal destiny.

Religion is a purely personal and spiritual experience.

## Religious philosophy

Although religious experience is a purely spiritual subjective phenomenon, such an experience embraces a positive and living faith attitude toward the highest realms of universe objective reality. **The ideal of religious philosophy is such a faith-trust as would lead man unqualifiedly to depend upon the absolute love of the infinite Father** of the universe of universes. Such a genuine religious experience far transcends the philosophic objectification of idealistic desire; it actually takes salvation for granted and concerns itself **only with learning and doing the will of the Father** in Paradise. The earmarks of such a religion are: faith in a supreme Deity, hope of eternal survival, and love, especially of one's fellows.

No matter how illusory and erroneous one's theology (and/or cosmology), one's religion may be wholly genuine—and everlastingly true.

When theology masters religion, religion dies; it becomes **a doctrine instead of a life**. The mission of theology is merely to facilitate the self-consciousness of personal spiritual experience. Theology constitutes the religious effort to define, clarify, expound, and justify the experiential claims of religion, which, in the last analysis, can be validated only by living faith. In the higher philosophy of the universe, wisdom, like reason, becomes allied to faith. **Reason, wisdom, and faith are man's highest human attainments**. Reason introduces man to the world of facts, to things; wisdom introduces him to a world of truth, to relationships; faith initiates him into a world of divinity, spiritual experience.

Faith most willingly carries reason along as far as reason can go and then goes on with wisdom to the full philosophic limit; and then it dares to launch out upon the limitless and never-ending universe journey in the sole company of **TRUTH**.

When reason once recognizes right and wrong, it exhibits wisdom; when wisdom chooses between right and wrong, truth and error, it demonstrates spirit leading. And thus are the functions of mind, soul, and spirit ever closely united and functionally inter-associated. Reason deals with factual knowledge; wisdom, with philosophy and revelation; faith, with living spiritual experience. Through truth man attains beauty and by spiritual love ascends to goodness.

Faith leads to knowing God, not merely to a mystical feeling of the divine presence. Faith must not be overmuch influenced by its emotional consequences. True religion is an experience of believing and knowing as well as a satisfaction of feeling.

> And come hither, and I shall light a candle of understanding in thine heart, which shall not be put out, till the things be performed which thou shalt begin to write.
> [II Esdras 14:25](/en/Bible/2_Esdras/14#v25)

> Give me a scallop-shell of quiet, 
> My staff of faith to walk upon, 
> My scrip of joy, immortal diet, 
> My bottle of salvation, 
> My gown of glory, hope's true gage,
> And thus I'll make my pilgrimage.
> _Sir Walter Raleigh_
