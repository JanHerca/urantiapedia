While the President read the regulations to remind everyone of the operating rules of the Ordinary General Meeting, the members of the assembly signed the attendance sheet when entering the meeting.

The attendance sheet is verified, approved and certified as accurate by the assembly office, which notes that there are 14 members present (and 10 proxies), out of a total of 39 members making up the association.

The attendance sheet is attached.

The quorum having been reached, according to article 13 of the statutes, the Assembly can validly deliberate.

Mr. Max Masotti, secretary, is appointed by the President to take notes on the minutes of the national meeting.

In accordance with the invitation which was sent to all members, the agenda was as follows:

### I. Resolution on the year 2018 — Election of the Executive Board

The assembly votes by show of hands and reappoints the executive board in its entirety.

For the record:

- _President_: Mr. Ivan Stol
- _Vice-president_: Mr. Périer Lucas
- _Treasurer_: Mr. Jean Duveau
- _Secretary_: Mr. Max Masotti

### II. Resolution on the year 2018 — Deliberations of the members concerning the proper functioning of the association.

- Concerning the Vice-President, the latter keeps us informed of emails and translations from the UIA.
- The reading committee is made up of Ms. Danielle Lascala and Messrs. Ivan Stol, Jean Duveau and Patrick Morelli.
- Mr. Georges Michelson-Dupont remains editor of the Link.
- In Belgium, Mr. Jean Annet no longer prepares photocopies of the edition of the Lien and we decided with Georges Michelson-Dupont to have it printed by local printers. We are going to ask the printer for a quote to have around twenty Liens, Tiding and News printed for those who want to read them on paper and for those who do not have Internet.
- Initially, these documents will be sent to Mr. Ivan Stol who will manage the sending to readers and subsequently, the secretary will take over.
- Concerning the exceptional sending of 50 Urantia books to Mr. Guy Stéphane N'yasse in Douala, Cameroon, Mr. Robert Gallo, Mr. Gilles Mauroy and Mr. Max Masotti propose that Mr. Guy Stéphane N'yasse pay us a minimal price in return.

Mr. Robert Gallo also asks that this should not snowball with other African countries because they also risk asking for free book shipments for which the AFLUB could no longer cover the costs.

Mrs. Paule Arif and Mr. Georges Michelson-Dupont opt for a check of the books, that is to say that Mr. Guy Stéphane N'yasse gives us a list of the names of people to whom he gave the books.

Mr. Ivan Stol proposes to make a free shipping trial for the 50 books. This request is put to the vote and:
10 people vote for donating the books and 3 for the shipping to be paid for.

Ivan informs us that the Foundation also takes care of book shipments and translations.

- Mr. Jean Duveau asks if we will always have just one meeting per year or if we will return to the previous rhythm of two annual meetings?

The assembly decides that if Jean wants to hold a meeting in his region that is no problem but it will not be a national meeting with an Ordinary General Assembly.

Mr. Jean Duveau also asks to hold the next national meeting at Notre Dame de Lumières in Goult in the Lubéron.

The secretary takes note of this and will contact the person in charge as soon as possible because, for Lumières, you have to book at least 1 year in advance.

An email will be sent to all readers to inform them of the dates of this future meeting.

Mr. Georges Michelson-Dupont informs us that the Foundation is doing well regarding the budget, organization and translations.

### III. Resolution for the year 2018

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/Le_Lien/images_02/144.jpg">
</figure>

_Speech by Georges Michelson-Dupont on a future project for the association._

**The Concept.**

Since we are looking for the future of our association, the idea is to create in France a study and meeting center where readers from all countries could meet and organize events, seminars, conferences and receive young people on summer vacation, or even for readers' vacations. This place could also host a university dedicated to teaching the concepts of the _Urantia Book_ as well as training students to become moderators of study groups. Finally, the center would include material, intellectual and spiritual activities.

The problem is how to give birth to such a project?

There are several solutions which depend on the activities that we wish to implement and the financial resources to be released for such a project.

**Solution No. 1: A center strictly dedicated to a Urantian project.**

Buy through an SCI (Société Civile Immobilière) or rent through the European associations partnering with the project a set of buildings with land around to accommodate working or retired people who would take care of administering the reception area. Couples with or without children should be able to have their own home; single people their own room. The idea is to not have employees and the rents would be low.

**Solution No. 2: A more ambitious project including solution No. 1 plus a resource center.**

It would be open to the public like monasteries and would be chargeable. The advantage of this formula is a small financial contribution. It would include around twenty simple but comfortable monastic-style rooms with shower and toilet.

In both solutions the activities proposed in the center would be:

1. Spiritual (meditation, prayers, worship)
2. Intellectual (studies of the concepts developed in The Urantia Book)
3. Physical (Contact with nature through the maintenance of gardens, orchards, vegetable gardens and vineyards)

**Why France?**

- The geographical position of France in Europe is very advantageous because it is central.
- Real estate prices in France are relatively cheap.
- France is a very touristy country with contrasting landscapes and a pleasant climate.

**Why an SCI?**

The tax aspect is a fact that must be taken into account. A donation made to the AFLUB to purchase real estate, whether in France or abroad, will be taxed at 60% by the French tax authorities. It is better for readers to join forces and invest their money in an SCI (which will belong to them and which will avoid dispossessing their beneficiaries upon their death) and rent the property to the association by an emphyteutic lease. [(from the Greek emphyteusis “implantation”) is a very long-term real estate lease, most often 99 years, which gives the lessee a real right on the thing leased, on condition that he improves the property and pays a low rent, the improvements benefiting the lessor at the end of the lease without the latter having to compensate the tenant (called emphyteuta).

**The purchase or rental of buildings.**

On Le Bon Coin, there are fully equipped reception centers with several hectares of land which sell for sums between €500,000 and €1,000,000 depending on their condition and geographical location.

There are also abbeys and cloisters that are being sold because the Church is selling off many of its properties but they need to be restored. You can also contact real estate agencies specializing in these products (for example: https://www.patrice-besse.com/belles-demeures/nord-pas-de-calais/ermitage-chapelle-18eme-siecle/)
