**Central Universe**

**1**

> Andovontia is the name of the tertiary *Universe Circuit Supervisor* stationed in our local universe. He is concerned only with spirit and morontia circuits, not with those under the jurisdiction of the power directors. It was he who isolated Urantia at the time of the Caligastia betrayal of the planet during the testing seasons of the Lucifer rebellion. In sending greetings to the mortals of Urantia, he expresses pleasure in the anticipation of your sometime restoration to the universe circuits of his supervision.

<a id="a55_0"></a>[UB 19:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/19#p3_3) A Perfector of Wisdom, seven Divine Counselors, and a Universal Censor constitute a triune divinity tribunal, the highest mobile advisory body in the universes of time and space. The Perfectors of Wisdoms are the wisdom of the Paradise Trinity.(<a id="a55_287"></a>[UB 19:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/19#p2_3))

The Divine Counselors are the perfection of the divine council of the Paradise Trinity. (<a id="a57_89"></a>[UB 19:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/19#p3_5)) The Universal Censors are the judgment of Deity. They are the judgment of the Paradise Trinity. When he speaks, it is final. <a id="a57_257"></a>[UB 19:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/19#p3_7) and <a id="a57_303"></a>[UB 19:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/19#p4_5)

In this legal trio, the Perfector of Wisdom would be the “I was” and the Divine Counselor the “I will be”, but the Universal Censor is always “I am”.

**Local Universe**

**4**

> The Father Melchizedek is Gabriel’s first assistant. When the Bright and Morning Star is absent from Salvington, his responsibilities are assumed by this original Melchizedek Son. (<a id="a65_183"></a>[UB 33:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p6_2))

**5**

> After the completion of the physical organization of a starry and planetary cluster and the establishment of the energy circuits by the superuniverse power centers, subsequent to this preliminary work of creation by the agencies of the Infinite Spirit, operating through, and under the direction of, his local universe creative focalization, there goes forth the proclamation of the Michael Son that life is next to be projected in the newly organized universe. Upon the Paradise recognition of this declaration of intention, there occurs a reaction of approval in the Paradise Trinity, followed by the disappearance in the spiritual shining of the Deities of the Master Spirit in whose superuniverse this new creation is organizing. Meanwhile the other Master Spirits draw near this central lodgment of the Paradise Deities, and subsequently, when the Deity-embraced Master Spirit emerges to the recognition of his fellows, there occurs what is known as a “primary eruption.” This is a tremendous spiritual flash, a phenomenon clearly discernible as far away as the headquarters of the superuniverse concerned; and simultaneously with this little-understood Trinity manifestation there occurs a marked change in the nature of the creative spirit presence and power of the Infinite Spirit resident in the local universe concerned. In response to these Paradise phenomena there immediately personalizes, in the very presence of the Creator Son, a new personal representation of the Infinite Spirit. This is the Divine Minister. The individualized Creative Spirit helper of the Creator Son has become his personal creative associate, the local universe Mother Spirit. (<a id="a69_1669"></a>[UB 34:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p1_1))

**6**

<a id="a73_0"></a>[UB 36:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p4_1) These residences are called the midsonite worlds of the systems, and on each one a materially modified Melchizedek Son has mated with a selected Daughter of the material order of descent. The Eve Mothers. (<a id="a73_248"></a>[UB 36:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p4_2)) The descendants of a Melchizedek life carrier and a Material Daughter are known as midsoniters.

**7**

> Les Susatias.
> Les Univitatias.
> Les Fils Matériels.
> Les Créatures Médianes. [LU 37:9.2-6](/fr/The_Urantia_Book/37#p9_2)

**8**

> 7. *The circles of the finaliters* have a unique structure at the center. And this same vacant temple is found on every system headquarters world throughout Nebadon. This edifice on Jerusem is sealed with the insignia of Michael, and it bears this inscription: “Undedicated to the seventh stage of spirit—to the eternal assignment.” Gabriel placed the seal on this temple of mystery, and none but Michael can or may break the seal of sovereignty affixed by the Bright and Morning Star. Some day you shall look upon this silent temple, even though you may not penetrate its mystery. (<a id="a84_585"></a>[UB 46:5.32](/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p5_32))

**Urantia**

**9**

> Very little was heard of Lucifer on Urantia owing to the fact that he assigned his first lieutenant, Satan, to advocate his cause on your planet. Satan was a member of the same primary group of Lanonandeks but had never functioned as a System Sovereign; he entered fully into the Lucifer insurrection. The “devil” is none other than Caligastia, the deposed Planetary Prince of Urantia and a Son of the secondary order of Lanonandeks. At the time Michael was on Urantia in the flesh, Lucifer, Satan, and Caligastia were leagued together to effect the miscarriage of his bestowal mission. But they signally failed. (<a id="a90_616"></a>[UB 53:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p1_4))

**10**

> Since Michael elected to remain aloof from the actual warfare of the Lucifer rebellion, Gabriel called his personal staff together on Edentia and, in counsel with the Most Highs, elected to assume command of the loyal hosts of Satania. Michael remained on Salvington while Gabriel proceeded to Jerusem, and establishing himself on the sphere dedicated to the Father—the same Universal Father whose personality Lucifer and Satan had questioned—in the presence of the forgathered hosts of loyal personalities, he displayed the banner of Michael, the material emblem of the Trinity government of all creation, the three azure blue concentric circles on a white background. (<a id="a94_673"></a>[UB 53:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p5_4))

**11**

> Only fourteen phyla have appeared on Urantia, the fishes being the last, and no new classes have developed since birds and mammals. (<a id="a98_135"></a>[UB 65:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p2_11))

**12**

> 2. *Mansant,* the great teacher of the post-Planetary Prince age on Urantia, who pointed his fellows to the veneration of “The Great Light.” (<a id="a102_144"></a>[UB 45:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p4_4))

**Jesus**

**13**

1353.1 Two persons of remarkable character were constantly walking in the temple courts, Simeon, a singer, and Anna, a poetess. Simeon was a Judean, but Anna was a Galilean. For this occasion, Anna had written a poem which Simeon began to sing.

**14**

> There lingered constantly about the courts of the temple two remarkable characters, Simeon a singer and Anna a poetess. Simeon was a Judean, but Anna was a Galilean. This couple were frequently in each other’s company, and both were intimates of the priest Zacharias, who had confided the secret of John and Jesus to them. Both Simeon and Anna longed for the coming of the Messiah, and their confidence in Zacharias led them to believe that Jesus was the expected deliverer of the Jewish people. (<a id="a112_499"></a>[UB 122:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p9_2))

**15**

> When Paul first went to Corinth, he had not intended to make a prolonged visit. But he did not know how well the Jewish tutor had prepared the way for his labors. And further, he discovered that great interest had already been aroused by Aquila and Priscilla, Aquila being one of the Cynics with whom Jesus had come in contact when in Rome. This couple were Jewish refugees from Rome, and they quickly embraced Paul’s teachings. He lived with them and worked with them, for they were also tentmakers. It was because of these circumstances that Paul prolonged his stay in Corinth. (<a id="a116_583"></a>[UB 133:3.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p3_12))
