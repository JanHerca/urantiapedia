On the occasion of Micaël's birthday, Éliane Grivet was kind enough to welcome us, for the second time, to her home in Pontet, near Avignon.

She had prepared a succulent beef bourguignon for the seventeen guests present.

This time, the meeting also brought together readers from the Var group as well as a new participant, a former reader, who is in the process of preparing an illustrated site on the UB texts and submitted her project for the appreciation of the readers present.

The oldest readers in France from the Avignon group were thus able to meet new readers coming from a different study group but all in search of the same Truth which binds us.

The meeting took place in a very fraternal atmosphere and was a total success and after a final study on booklet 102/8 “The proofs of religion”, the meal took place after a tribute to Micaël.

This reinforces our belief that it would be encouraging to repeat this example of a regional meeting in the future and we hope that other groups will follow this example.

Another big thank you to Éliane who spared no effort to offer us this good meal which allowed us to come together in friendship and fraternity.
