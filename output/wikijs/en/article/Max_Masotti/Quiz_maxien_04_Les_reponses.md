**Central Universe**

1. The first jubilee marked the mortal's agreement with his Thought Adjuster when the purpose to survive was sealed. The second was awakening into the morontia life; the third, fusion with the Thought Adjuster; the fourth, awakening in Havona. The fifth celebrated the discovery of the Universal Father; and the sixth jubilee marked the occasion of awakening on Paradise after the final slumber of the transit of time.

**Urantia**

9. <a id="a67_3"></a>[UB 58:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/58#p0_1) THERE are only sixty-one worlds like Urantia in all Satania—planets where life is modified.

They were very lightly dressed during the day, but wrapped themselves in blankets in the evening.

15. <a id="a81_4"></a>[UB 132:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p0_4) Jesus may have anticipated that the Jews would reject his mission, but he certainly foresaw that his messengers would soon come to Rome to proclaim the kingdom of heaven. Thus these men and women taught by Jesus were prepared to recognize additional and similar truths in the teachings of the early Christian missionaries. This ready acceptance of the teachings of the preachers of the gospel was the element which gave such a powerful impulse to the rapid spread of Christianity in Rome and from there throughout the empire.

18. (<a id="a84_5"></a>[UB 158:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p3_2)) The acceptance of the fullness of the bestowal of Michael’s incarnate life on Urantia by the Eternal Son-Mother of Paradise. Jesus now had the assurance that the requirements of the Eternal Son were being met in his case. This assurance was brought to him by Gabriel. <a id="a84_318"></a>[UB 158:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p3_3) 2. The testimony of the satisfaction of the Infinite Spirit as to the fullness of the bestowal on Urantia in the likeness of mortal flesh. The representative of the Infinite Spirit in the universe of Nebadon, Michael’s immediate associate and ever-present co-worker on Salvington, spoke on this occasion through the agency of the Father Melchizedek. <a id="a84_712"></a>[UB 158:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p3_4) Jesus received with pleasure the two testimonies concerning the success of his earth mission brought by the messengers of the Eternal Son and the Infinite Spirit, but he noticed that his Father did not indicate that the bestowal on Urantia was complete.
