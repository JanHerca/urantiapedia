[UB 132:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p0_4) Jesus may have anticipated that the Jews would reject his mission, but he certainly foresaw that his messengers would soon come to Rome to proclaim the kingdom of heaven. Thus these men and women taught by Jesus were prepared to recognize additional and similar truths in the teachings of the early Christian missionaries. This ready acceptance of the teachings of the preachers of the gospel was the element which gave such a powerful impulse to the rapid spread of Christianity in Rome and from there throughout the empire.

[UB 158:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p3_4) Jesus received with pleasure the two testimonies concerning the success of his earth mission brought by the messengers of the Eternal Son and the Infinite Spirit, but he noticed that his Father did not indicate that the bestowal on Urantia was complete.
