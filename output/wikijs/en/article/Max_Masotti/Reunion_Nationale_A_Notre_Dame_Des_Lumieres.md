Reminder:

thank you to those who want to come to the national meeting in Lumières, send me an email to reserve apart from those who have already responded.

We were unable to reserve another date because for Lumières, you have to book 1 year in advance and we were not sure where we were going to hold the meeting. If you do not respond to me to reserve, you will be forced to find a way to reserve a room somewhere other than Lumières. I would like to inform you that last year there were 25 of us. Please respond to me as soon as possible.

Best regards to all.

Max.
