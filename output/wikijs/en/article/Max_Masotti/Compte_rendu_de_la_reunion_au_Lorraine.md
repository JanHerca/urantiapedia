_June 22, 23, 24 and 25, 2006_

For the first time, our friends and organizers Pascal Coulombe, Dominique and AnneMarie Ronfet and Sèverin Desbuisson, decided to hold the summer 2006 meeting in the North-East of France.

The Grand Seminary of Lorraine welcomed us in an austere atmosphere.

Quote from our friend Jean Royer, always very philosophical and very wise: “Nothing is dramatic unless we are warned about it in advance.”

In short, we all dreamed of Our Lady of Enlightenment.

The sun was there during these three days and embellished our stay even if it did not make us become like Moussa; it also shone in our hearts.

A word also, for the record, about this city of Nancy.

Nancy which is adorned with this magnificent Place Stanislas which is connected to Place Carrière by a superb triumphal arch with dazzling golden grilles.

This place is the fruit of the work of the architect engineer Bertrand Cœurtois.

This city of Nancy where on January 8, 1477, the victory of René II against Charles the Bold ensured the independence of Lorraine and fixed the destiny of France.

The Duke of Burgundy lost his life in this battle.

The Château de l'Asnée was sold to the diocesan association in 1932.

It was in this place that the city of Nancy isolated inhabitants affected by the plague; it became an episcopal seat in 1777.

Nancy which was liberated by General De Gaulle on September 25, 1944.

But, let’s get back to our sheep.

Our Parisian friends arrived later following a fault caused by a GPS failure.

The Thursday evening group consisted of seventeen people.

We shared the meal, sitting at three different tables, and serious conversations alternated with various jokes.

The atmosphere was already becoming very fraternal between old and new acquaintances.

Humor was not left out.

We took advantage of this meal to discuss our different thoughts on our activities and awareness during the past year.

Following the meal, we organized a meeting which focused mainly on setting up the votes for the election of the new board of directors.

Our friend, Xavier Grandveaux, joined us on Friday morning for breakfast.

A meeting was set up around 9:15 a.m. The subject of our study being: “How the Spirit of Truth illuminates our everyday actions”, we decided together to define the difference between the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Truth.

Three groups were formed according to each person's choice.

Everyone expressed, more or less, their personal feelings about the Spirit of Truth.

After lunch, the group was invited to visit the park surrounding the Asnée estate.

The meeting resumed around 2:30 p.m. and general debate on the results of the three study groups of the morning, then formation of two new groups to continue the study on the Spirit of Truth.

On this occasion, we were joined by Noël Briens, a reader arriving directly from our beautiful Brittany.

Following the Friday evening meeting, some decided to visit the city and others awaited, with undisguised impatience, the Togo — France match.

During the evening meal, the balance of the Urantian troop, composed of Belgians and Parisians, arrived.

Following the Saturday breakfast, a meeting was held and a first approach regarding the votes for the election of the president and vice-president was proposed.

From this first election, two names emerged, those of Michel Rouanet and Pascal Coulombe.

A subsequent vote will have to confirm these initial results.

Around 10 a.m., three groups formed to continue the study on the Spirit of Truth.

Around 4:30 p.m., everyone left to visit the Hague Park.

The evening which followed the meal was the occasion for meditation, almost general, in a green setting and under a tree of a respectable age.

I personally deplore the fact that the Swiss were only represented by a single, recent reader named Guy Deviron.

Would they have fallen asleep in the sweetness of the shadow of their mountains in eternal meditation? God alone knows and perhaps also the Seven Supreme Executive Agents.

(For those who doubt this, please consult the UB in <a id="a112_52"></a>[UB 17:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/17#p1_3)).

Throughout the study, we were able to realize that the application of the Spirit of Truth in our daily actions was a divine and active presence which had to be listened to seriously and put into practice as often as possible, although we all know that this Spirit is limited in its functions and its power by the personal receptivity of men (<a id="a114_342"></a>[UB 34:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p5_5)).

It is fair to note that from these meetings emerges an osmosis and a fraternity which, I am convinced, is surely due to our celestial angelic friends and certainly also to this Spirit of Truth bestowed by our Creator Son.

This osmosis resulted, on Sunday morning, in various enriching and poignant testimonies discussed by the various readers.

It is very pleasant and of certain value to be able to mentally harmonize with the different points of view of each other while waiting to try to do so, later, on the mansions, on Jerusem and on Edentia with the Univitatias and throughout our progression passing through Salvington, Uversa and up to Paradise where we will be received into the embrace of the Universal Father.

The goal was achieved and proved to us that regular and in-depth group study is more than beneficial for everyone.

Sunday, late morning, was the least appreciated moment because it marked the time of return and separation, which was always a little painful.

It was with a weeping heart that the group from Avignon was the first to leave, bound by the obligation to respect the train schedules, but happy to have been able to make new acquaintances and to have tasted all the flavor and with the hope of seeing us all again soon.

A little quote from UB to console us:

> _Having started out on the way of life everlasting, having accepted the assignment and received your orders to advance, do not fear the dangers of human forgetfulness and mortal inconstancy, do not be troubled with doubts of failure or by perplexing confusion, do not falter and question your status and standing, for in every dark hour, at every crossroad in the forward struggle, the Spirit of Truth will always speak, saying, “This is the way.”_ (<a id="a130_452"></a>[UB 34:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p7_8))
