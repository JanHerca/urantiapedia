Without boredom, taking it easy, an oyster waltzed among the waves.
Filtering her food out of habit, she inadvertently swallowed a grain of sand.
Misshapen, rough, dirty, this intruder seemed ugly, trash, no joke.
Wanting to reject this rock, indigestible, hard, yes this undesirable stranger,
She blew without exhaling, nothing to do, she was incapable of it.
To dislodge, however small, this unknown rascal with the sullen appearance.

I should remove it quickly because it could surely hurt me.
the oyster said to itself, thinking of its fragile being, its good health.
You have to stay in shape, perfecting your body is the key.
To appear beautiful, soft, transparent, velvety, that’s a good idea.
But having your privacy robbed by someone so untalented...
Can she accept being changed, shaken up, ruled?

This stone, this brute, this unloved thing, to separate from it, to reject it?
A path emerges from the abyss and illuminates everything.
Friendly, loving, tenderly you must surround it
Of understanding, of compassion, of affection, to give.
More tolerance, indulgence, patience, longanimity.
Invite to share your life, to change your path, what a destiny!

Day after day, night after night, the courage of the oyster shows itself.
A shiny veil of mother-of-pearl soon appears on the pumice stone.
Time is running out for the layers to pile up together.
A most precious stone, a pearl made very round.
The oyster would never have thought of making a blonde one too.
Work, play, grow and progress in long-term friendship.

The heart of the oyster was able to grow thanks to this grain of sand.
Both knew how to take advantage of a sudden affable desire.
The unpredictable gains of our incomparable companions
They were able to show us that it is frankly invaluable.
To receive questionable or unspeakable strangers into your home
To finally produce an abundance of delectable fruits.
