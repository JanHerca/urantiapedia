**Central Universe**

1. On Uversa, the headquarters of your superuniverse, we designate the Son as the Co-ordinate Spirit Center and as the Eternal Spirit Administrator. [UB 6:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p1_5)

4. Long, long ago, the Eternal Son bestowed Himself on each of the circuits of central creation to enlighten and advance all Havona inhabitants and pilgrims, including the ascending pilgrims of time.

5. The Infinite Spirit possesses a unique and astounding power, antigravity. This power is functionally present (observable) in neither the Father nor the Son.

And this unique attribute is transmissible to certain high personalities of the Infinite Spirit.

**Jesus**

16. This commandment was this: “_Verily, verily, I say unto you, A servant is not greater than his Master, neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. Know ye not that there is no place of preference at my table? Understand ye not that I love each one of you as much as the others?

Let him that would be great, become the younger: and let him that would be chief, become the servant._” ([UB 179:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p3_8) & [UB 179:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p3_9)).

[UB 188:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p4_5).
20. At Jesus' trial, Annas justified three charges against him:
	1. That he dangerously misled the common people. That he taught them impossible things and that he deceived them in other ways.

	3. That he taught magic, in that he promised to build a new temple without the use of hands. [UB 184:3.10-12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p3_10).
