**Superuniverse**

1. The beings who compose the sevenfold approach of the Ultimate Trinity, now evolving, will ultimately consist of the Supreme Being, the Supreme Creator Personalities and the Absonite Architects of the Master Universe, those unique universe planners who are neither creators nor creatures. <a id="a40_291"></a>[UB 0:12.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p12_6)
2. The mind of mankind is a gift from the Daughters of the Conjoint Actor, the Divine Ministers of the evolving universes. <a id="a41_123"></a>[UB 3:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p1_8)
3. It is the Father and the Son who personalize the Creator Sons. In much the same way, the Magisterial Sons are personalized by the Son and the Spirit. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit also unite in personalizing the Trinity Teacher Sons, who are gifted with various talents and travel the grand universe as the celestial teachers of all human and divine personalities. <a id="a42_374"></a>[UB 7:6.5-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/7#p6_5)

**Local universe**

4. These three Most High Fathers, heads of the constellations, are assigned for a decamillennial — 10,000 standard years, or approximately 50,000 years of Urantia time. <a id="a46_169"></a>[UB 35:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p6_1)
5. The destiny of the seraphim is to reach Paradise through evolutionary human technique. <a id="a47_90"></a>[UB 39:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p8_5) 3. Seraphington is the destiny sphere of the angels. <a id="a47_185"></a>[UB 39:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p8_9)
6. The universe of Nebadon is now rotating far away in the southeast of the superuniverse circuit of Orvonton. The universes nearest to it are Avalon, Henselon, Sanselon, Portalon, Wolvering, Fanoving, and Alvoring. <a id="a48_216"></a>[UB 32:2.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p2_12)
7. The spornagias. They are sensitive only to the first five adjutant mind-spirits. They do not respond to the spirits of worship and wisdom, but the mind sensitive to five adjutants is equivalent to a level of totality or sixth reality, and it is this factor which persists as experiential identity. <a id="a49_301"></a>[UB 46:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p7_5)
8. The System Archivist — Vilton, secretary of the Lanonandek Ministry of Satania, is number 374 of the Third Order. Vilton was a member of the original Lanaforge group. <a id="a50_170"></a>[UB 45:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p3_6)

**Urantia**

9. The carrier birds were called fandors. Bon's group successfully trained the large fandors as passenger carrier birds, but their breed became extinct over thirty thousand years ago. Carrier birds fly at about 100 miles per hour. These enormous birds can carry one or two average-sized people for a continuous flight of over five hundred miles. <a id="a54_346"></a>[UB 66:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p5_6) <a id="a54_388"></a>[UB 74:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p3_4)
10. It was in the despair of realizing failure that Adam, the day after Eve's fault, sought out Laotta, the brilliant Nodite woman who directed the Western schools of the Garden, and premeditatedly committed the same folly as Eve. <a id="a55_231"></a>[UB 75:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p5_2)
11. the first, dean of the primary order, was released from his duties. He now serves on Jerusem as a member of the council of twenty-four, and he has already fulfilled once, since Pentecost, the function of governor general of Urantia. <a id="a56_237"></a>[UB 77:9.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p9_5)
12. The primitive men—the **Andonites**—had black eyes and a swarthy complexion, somewhat like a cross between yellow and red. <a id="a57_127"></a>[UB 63:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p4_1) The **6 Sangik Races**: The Red Man, the Orange Man, the Yellow Man, the Green Man, the Blue Man, the Indigo Race. The **Nodites**. <a id="a57_301"></a>[UB 73:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/73#p1_3) The Nodites were descended from the rebellious members of the Prince's staff and took their name from their first leader, Nod, who had once chaired the Dalamatian Commission of Industry and Commerce. The Amadonites were descended from the Andonites who had chosen to remain loyal to Van and Amadon. “Amadonite” is more of a cultural and religious designation than a racial name; racially, the Amadonites were essentially the Andonites. “Nodite” is both a cultural and racial name, for the Nodites themselves constituted the **eighth race** of Urantia. <a id="a57_895"></a>[UB 76:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p4_1) Adam and Eve were the founders of the violet race, the **ninth race** of mankind to appear on Urantia. <a id="a57_1040"></a>[UB 78:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p1_3). The violet race—the Adamites and Adamsonites.

**Jesus**

15. In March of 8 BCE (the month Joseph and Mary were married). <a id="a66_64"></a>[UB 122:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p7_1)
16. In the midst of the Greek believers, after glorifying his Father, the Personalized Adjuster, who had dwelt in him before his baptism, appeared before him, and Jesus paused, which was noticed by those present. The Adjuster, who was now a powerful spirit and who represented the Father, said to Jesus of Nazareth: "I have already glorified my name many times in your bestowals, and I will glorify it again. <a id="a67_409"></a>[UB 174:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p5_10)
17. The Tower of Siloam. <a id="a68_25"></a>[UB 166:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p4_4)
18. It was John Mark. John Mark and Jesus were there, both holding the basket. Soon the Master let go, looked at the boy and said: "Since with all your heart you long to go with me, it will not be denied you. <a id="a69_209"></a>[UB 177:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/177#p1_2). In the higher spheres this event has been called 'the day a young man spent with God in the hills'. <a id="a69_354"></a>[UB 177:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/177#p1_3)
19. To Peter's question, Jesus answered: “Have I not told you all these years that my kingdom is not of this world? You see me now weak and in the flesh, but when I come again, it will be in power and in the spirit. The eyes of the flesh see the Son of Man in the flesh, but only the eye of the spirit will see the Son of Man glorified by the Father and appearing on earth in his own name.” <a id="a70_391"></a>[UB 176:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_4). The doctrine of the second coming of Christ was therefore incorporated early into Christian teachings. <a id="a70_539"></a>[UB 176:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_1). However, the time of the reappearance of the Son of Man is known only in the councils of Paradise. <a id="a70_683"></a>[UB 176:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_5)
20. At the end of the last supper, Jesus gave this new commandment: “Love one another as I have loved you. If you do this, if you love one another like this, all men will know that you are my disciples.” <a id="a71_204"></a>[UB 180:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p1_1)
