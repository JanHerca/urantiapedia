13. David Zebedee maintained a headquarters for the work of the kingdom in his father's house at Bethsaida. This was the central seat of Jesus' operations on earth, and a relay station for the messenger service that David provided between the believers in various parts of Palestine and the adjacent regions. He did all this on his own initiative, but with Andrew's approval. David employed forty or fifty messengers in this intelligence service for the work of the kingdom, which was growing and expanding rapidly. While providing this service, he earned part of his living by devoting part of his time to his former occupation as a fisherman. [UB 149:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p0_4)

18. A warlike king always entered a city mounted on a horse; a king on a peaceful and friendly mission always entered mounted on a donkey. Jesus did not want to enter Jerusalem mounted on a horse, but he was willing to enter peacefully and benevolently, mounted on a donkey, as the Son of Man. [UB 172:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p3_5)
19. The village of Bethany. It was in this small village, where almost all the men, women and children were believers, that Jesus chose to accomplish the most powerful work of his earthly bestowal, the resurrection of Lazarus. If he resurrected him, it was not to bring the inhabitants to believe, but rather because they already believed. [UB 172:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/172#p3_1)
