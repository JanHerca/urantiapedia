**Urantia**

9. <a id="a63_3"></a>[UB 53:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p3_1). The cause of the rebels was presented under three headings:
    1. The reality of the Universal Father.
    2. The universal government of Michael, the Creator Son.
    3. The attack on the universal plan of education of ascending mortals.
10. <a id="a67_4"></a>[UB 38:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/38#p2_5) You are right to love angels, but they should not be worshipped; they are not objects of worship. When your prophet “fell in worship at the feet of the angel,” the great seraph Loyalatia said to him: “See that you do not do this. I am a servant like you and your race, who have all been commanded to worship God.”

Amadonite" is more of a cultural and religious denomination than a racial name. Racially, the Amadonites were essentially the Andonites.

**Jesus**

13. Joseph's ancestors went back to Andon and Fonta and Mary's to Ratta. <a id="a75_73"></a>[UB 122:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p1_1) to <a id="a75_120"></a>[UB 122:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p1_3).
14. (<a id="a76_5"></a>[UB 122:8.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p8_7)). Jesus was born on August 21 at noon in the year 7 BCE.
15. (<a id="a77_5"></a>[UB 126:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p3_8)). Jesus found in the library of the synagogue of Nazareth, among the apocalyptic books that he was studying, the manuscript called “The Book of Enoch”. One passage particularly impressed him, the one where the expression “Son of Man” appeared. The book explained that before coming to this world to bring salvation to humanity, this Son of Man had crossed the courts of heavenly glory and immediately decided to adopt as his inaugural title “The Son of Man”. This is what he did later when he began his public teaching. Jesus had an infallible ability to recognize the truth and never hesitated to admit it, whatever the source from which it appeared to emanate. (this text is abbreviated).
16. <a id="a78_4"></a>[UB 134:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p8_6) Towards the end of his stay on the mountain, Jesus asked his Father for permission to hold a conference with his enemies of Satania as the Son of Man, as Joshua ben Joseph. This permission was granted. During the last week on Mount Hermon, the great temptation, the test of the universe, took place. Satan (representing Lucifer) and Caligastia, the rebellious Planetary Prince, were present with Jesus and were made fully visible to him.
17. (<a id="a79_5"></a>[UB 140:10.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p10_9)). Jesus answered: “The kingdom of heaven consists of three essential elements: first, recognition of the fact of God's sovereignty; second, belief in the truth of sonship with God; and third, faith in the efficacy of the supreme human desire to do God's will—to be like God. And this is the good news of the gospel: through faith, every mortal can possess all these essential elements of salvation.”
