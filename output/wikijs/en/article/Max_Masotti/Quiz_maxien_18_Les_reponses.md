When my spirit comes to dwell in you, it will shed light on the difference between sin and righteousness, and enable you to judge wisely in your hearts concerning them.” [UB 180:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p6_2)

Have faith in God, have faith in one another, and so you will enter into the new service of the kingdom of heaven.” This was the ninth morontia appearance of the Master.
