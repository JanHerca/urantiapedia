**Superuniverse**

1. The Absolute Trinity — The second experiential Trinity now in process of actualization, will consist of God the Supreme, God the Ultimate, and the unrevealed Consummator of Universe Destiny. [UB 0:12.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p12_7)
2. The functional family of the Third Source and Center, as revealed in The Urantia Book, falls into three great groups:
	- I. The Supreme Spirits. A group of composite origin which embraces among others the following orders:
		1. The Seven Master Spirits of Paradise.
		2. The Reflective Spirits of the Superuniverses.
		3. The Creative Spirits of Local Universes.
	- II. The Power Directors. A group of creatures and control agents that operate throughout organized space.
	- III. Personalities of the Infinite Spirit. This designation does not necessarily imply that these beings are personalities of the Third Source, although some of them are unique as will creatures. They are generally grouped into three major classifications:
		1. The Higher Personalities of the Infinite Spirit.
		2. The Armies of the Space Messengers.
		3. The Guardian Spirits of Time. [UB 9:8.15-23](/en/The_Urantia_Book/9#p8_15)

4. The Seven Supreme Power Directors are the physical energy regulators of the grand universe. Their creation by the Seven Master Spirits is the first recorded instance of semimaterial offspring of purely spirit ancestry.

These power directors function individually in regulating power-energy in the superuniverses but collectively in the administration of the central creation. They function from Paradise but maintain themselves as effective power centers in all divisions of the grand universe. [UB 29:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p1_3)P 320.3
