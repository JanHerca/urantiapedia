Thereafter, the Most Highs, with the approval of Uversa, ordered his removal and requested the leaders of Salvington to appoint a new System Sovereign to take charge of this troubled and conflict-torn system of inhabited worlds. For the record, this was the second bestowal of our Creator Son.

	- The world of semi-spiritual life (<a id="a58_37"></a>[UB 35:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_7))
	- The sphere of progressive spiritual life (<a id="a59_45"></a>[UB 35:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_8))

10. The seven adjutant mind-spirits are the creation of the Divine Minister of a local universe.

**Jesus**

14. The improved economic situation of the Nazareth family was felt at home in many ways and Jesus was also allowed to resume music lessons; he loved to play the harp.(<a id="a75_168"></a>[UB 126:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p1_6))
15. These are the names of Jesus' sisters and brothers: **James**, in the early morning of April 2, 3 B.C.E. (<a id="a76_110"></a>[UB 123:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p1_5)); **Miriam**, born on the night of July 11, 2 B.C.E. <a id="a76_207"></a>[UB 123:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p2_3); **Joseph**, the fourth child of the family of Nazareth, was born on Wednesday morning, March 16, 1 B.C.E.

17. If Jesus took Peter, James and John to the mountain of the transfiguration, the reason was not that they were, in any sense, better prepared than the other apostles to witness this scene, nor more spiritually qualified to benefit from such a rare privilege. Not at all. The Master knew well that none of the twelve was spiritually qualified for this experience, and that is why he took only the three apostles who had the mission of accompanying him in the moments when he wished to isolate himself to enjoy a solitary communion.(<a id="a78_534"></a>[UB 158:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p2_5)).
