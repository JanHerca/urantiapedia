14. After the conference with the apostles, Jesus had an interview with Lazarus and recommended him to avoid sacrificing his life to the vengeful spirit of the Sanhedrin.

15. In the year 30, the Sadducees were eager to get rid of Jesus for the following reasons: They feared that the growing popular favor accorded to Jesus by the multitude would endanger the existence of the Jewish nation by a possible conflict with the Roman authorities. Jesus' zeal for temple reform directly reduced their income; the cleansing of the temple affected their purse. They felt responsible for the preservation of order and feared the consequences of a further expansion of Jesus' new and strange doctrine of the brotherhood of man. (P. <a id="a65_551"></a>[UB 175:4.4-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/175#p4_4) & 2.3 & 4). of the first and commands: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.

(<a id="a67_453"></a>[UB 179:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_2)). All the apostles perceived that something out of the ordinary was happening.
