_by Gard Jameson_

There are very few sentences in _The Urantia Book_ that contain only three words.

In fourteen citations, we hear: **“God is love.”** In “Paper 56, Universal Unity,” we are told by “a Mighty Messenger . . . , _by request_ of the Nebadon Revelatory Corps and _in collaboration with_ a certain Melchizedek, _the vicegerent Planetary Prince of Urantia_” in the opening of the paper: **“God is unity.”** (emphasis added, <a id="a20_334"></a>[UB 56:10.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_22))

In “Paper 115, The Supreme Being,” we hear from a Mighty Messenger, perhaps the very same: “While infinity is on the one hand, **UNITY**, on the other it is **DIVERSITY** without end or limit.” (<a id="a22_195"></a>[UB 115:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_4)) Those words, “UNITY” and “DIVERSITY,” were capitalized by the direction of the revelatory commission.

The message couldn't be clearer—divine realities seek for greater degrees of UNITY.

In their message at the fiftieth anniversary of Urantia Foundation, Barbara Newsom and Carolyn Kendall, wrote:

> The revelators [^1] continued to guide the group during this period, advising in 1946 that _we cannot expect widespread acceptance of the Urantia Revelation until ninety percent of the followers attain unity of purpose_. . . . Unity was often a theme of the counsel given by the revelators to the Contact Commission [^2] and shared with the Forum[^3].

The world is craving _unity of purpose_, and the peace that ensues. Perhaps “_the followers_” of the _Urantia Revelation_ could set an example. What do you think?

May those with courage listen deeply to the revelatory commission with both the compassion to understand their message and the wisdom to act upon it!

## Notes

[^1]: The revelators, also known as members of the revelatory commission, were the superhuman personalities responsible for the planning and delivery of the Urantia Papers, which were later published as _The Urantia Book_.
[^2]: In the early twentieth century, a small number of men and women in Chicago, IL, USA, known as the Contact Commission was the human focus group for the materialization of the text of the Urantia Papers.
[^3]: Members of the Forum, established in 1923, met weekly to listen to and discuss revealed material which helped the Urantia Papers to be understandable by the human mind.
