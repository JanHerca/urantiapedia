_By Gard Jameson, treasurer, Urantia Foundation, Nevada, United States_

The Urantia Revelation envisions a world that embraces a culture of love, compassion, and hope, with values of truth, beauty, and goodness, and informed by spiritual attainment and cosmic consciousness. You have a unique and extraordinary opportunity to foster that culture for generations to come!

One of the most meaningful ways to support the enduring mission of Urantia Foundation is through a planned gift. Unlike annual donations, which provide immediate support, planned gifts are designed to secure the long-term future of the Foundation. By including Urantia Foundation in your will or trust, or as a beneficiary of a retirement account, you help sustain its work for decades to come.

An advantage of planned giving is that it enables benefactors to make a significant impact without affecting their current financial security. Whether through a bequest, a charitable trust, or another giving vehicle, these gifts can be structured to align with personal financial and estate planning goals while also providing potential tax benefits to the donor.

Beyond financial support, planned giving is an expression of faith and commitment. It reflects a deep understanding that the dissemination of _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings requires long-term vision. Many individuals who include Urantia Foundation in their estate plans find great fulfillment in knowing they are contributing to a higher purpose—one that extends far beyond their lifetime.

The future of Urantia Foundation depends on forward-thinking individuals who recognize the value of sustained support. If your life has been impacted by the revelation, please consider making planned giving part of your legacy. It will ensure that _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings continue to enlighten and inspire future generations.

To learn more about how you can make a lasting impact, visit [urantia.plannedgiving.org](https://urantia.plannedgiving.org/) or contact [Tamara@urantia.org](mailto:tamara@urantia.org) for a confidential discussion. Your legacy can help shape the spiritual future of the world.
