For most of us, adjuster fusion seems a distant and unobtainable dream; an unreachable, lofty goal that is not achievable within this lifetime. Many consider it hardly worth thinking about adjuster fusion, much less working towards it, believing that accomplishing this divine objective would require a millennium at least. We dismiss the magnificent potential for union with our thought adjusters as an egoistic fantasy that is too unlikely to waste time contemplating, rather than the path to eternal salvation each of us is invited to take. Because union with our adjusters is generally considered impossible in this lifetime, there is a dearth of workshops or discussions that focus on the steps to adjuster fusion, yet it is not an implausible dream, and is more within reach than we realize. 

Our celestial family believes the promotion of adjuster fusion in furtherance of the ascension plan is one of the most important functions of the universe. Consider the following quote from Paper 77: 

> The entire organization of high spirits, angelic hosts, and midway fellows is enthusiastically devoted to the furtherance of the Paradise plan for the progressive ascension and perfection attainment of evolutionary mortals, one of the supernal businesses of the universe—the superb survival plan of bringing God down to man and then, by a sublime sort of partnership, carrying man up to God and on to eternity of service and divinity of attainment—alike for mortal and midwayer. <a id="a37_481"></a>[[UB 77:9.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p9_12)] 

In Paper 110, a Solitary Messenger laments that we do not pursue the goal of fusion more persistently: 

> I cannot but observe that so many of you spend so much time and thought on mere trifles of living, while you almost wholly overlook the more essential realities of everlasting import, those very accomplishments which are concerned with the development of a more harmonious working agreement between you and your Adjusters. The great goal of human existence is to attune to the divinity of the indwelling Adjuster; the great achievement of mortal life is the attainment of a true and understanding consecration to the eternal aims of the divine spirit who waits and works within your mind.  <a id="a41_592"></a>[[UB 110:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p3_4)]

Our Thought Adjusters, too, are dedicated to leading us to fusion. We are told that the great days in the career of an adjuster are first when the mortal subject breaks through the third psychic circle ensuring the Monitor’s increased range of functioning, then when the human partner attains the first psychic circle enabling at least some degree of intercommunication, and last, when final and eternal fusion occurs. Only in this way do we receive eternal life, and our Thought Adjusters achieve personality. What more vital objective is there? 

## Forerunners 

While a lofty goal, adjuster fusion in this lifetime, or shortly after our arrival on the Mansion Worlds, may be more possible than we realize. Enoch was the first mortal on Urantia to achieve fusion in the flesh. He was the son of Jared, and a sixth generation descendant of Adam and Eve living in the second Garden. The Bible says Enoch lived 365 years before he was taken by God. The text reads that Enoch ‘walked with God and was no more, for God took him’ ([Genesis 5:21-24](/en/Bible/Genesis/5#v21)). [Hebrews 11:5](/en/Bible/Hebrews/11#v5) reports, “By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death, and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.” _The Urantia Book_ does not give us much information about Enoch, but it does confirm what the Bible says by describing him as  "the first of the mortals of Urantia to fuse with the Thought Adjuster during the mortal life in the flesh." <a id="a47_977"></a>[[UB 45:4.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p4_13)]

The prophet Elijah was the second individual to leave our world by fusion. _The Urantia Book_ extols him as <a id="a49_108"></a>[[UB 97:9.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p9_19)] "_one of the greatest of the prophets,_" and <a id="a49_199"></a>[[UB 45:4.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p4_15)] "_a translated soul of brilliant spiritual achievement during the post-Material Son age._" In the Book of Kings in the Bible, Elijah is described as a prophet and a miracle worker who entered Heaven alive “by fire.” _The Urantia Book_ informs us that as a result of their spiritual leadership, Enoch and Elijah currently sit on the Council of 24. (<a id="a49_593"></a>[[UB 45:4.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p4_15)]) One advantage enjoyed by both was a higher concentration of undiluted violet blood than any of us have today, as, according to the Bible, they were direct descendants from Adam's line. This genetic inheritance also afforded them longer lives, making it easier to fuse within their lifetimes. We, however, have the Fifth Epochal Revelation, and thus have information about the ascension scheme and the purpose of adjuster fusion that they may have lacked. Enoch and Elijah dispel forever the notion that only Jesus, a superhuman Son of God, could possibly fuse during this mortal life. 

When Jesus of Nazareth went down into the Jordan to be baptized, he was a mortal of the realm who had attained the <a id="a51_115"></a>[[UB 136:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p2_2)] "_pinnacle of human self-identification with the spirit._" _The Urantia Book_ also tells us that He stood in the Jordan a perfected mortal, having developed "perfect synchrony and full communication with his indwelling spirit adjuster," and he accomplished all of this by the age of 31. (<a id="a51_449"></a>[[UB 136:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p2_2)]) Of course, Michael, our Creator Son, had no need of fusion, but the human Jesus was given an experience as equivalent to fusion as an incarnation of God-made-man could have had. He, John, and Jesus' two brothers, heard a voice from on high say <a id="a51_740"></a>[[UB 136:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p2_3)] “_This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased._” After his baptism, Jesus departed for 40 days of seclusion to determine how to proceed. 

A similar event awaits all candidates for adjuster fusion. [Paper 47](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57) informs us that when the union between an evolving soul and the divine adjuster is imminent, an archangel announces "This is a beloved son in whom I am well pleased" in the presence of the candidate's associates. After this short ceremony, the individual is granted forty days of spiritual retirement to choose from among the various paths to Havona. Perhaps the human Jesus was given a similar experience in the flesh so that he could better understand the experience of ascending mortals and model the way for those who would follow him. 

It is hard to know how many, if any, other mortals have fused since Enoch and Elijah. If there have been a number, it certainly hasn’t been reported in the news. However, it’s also plausible that those eligible for fusion have elected to stay on the planet as long as possible to help out on earth, even as the human Jesus remained here after attaining 'perfect synchrony with his indwelling spirit adjuster' to complete his mission. Also, we are told some mortals of Adjuster-fusion status are exempted from translation to continue in important administrative posts. (<a id="a55_569"></a>[[UB 55:3.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p3_13)]) Others, may be held in waiting as ‘adjuster fusion candidates’, those who have reached betrothal status with their thought adjusters, but have not yet actually fused. _The Urantia Book_ describes this in Paper 109: 

> 3. [The adjuster] has a subject who has made the supreme decision, has entered into a solemn and sincere betrothal with the Adjuster. The Adjuster looks beforehand to the time of actual fusion and reckons the union as an event of fact. <a id="a57_238"></a>[[UB 109:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p2_4)] 
> 
> More and more humans will fuse as our sphere approaches Light and Life; we are informed that “_natural death becomes less frequent as the Adjusters increasingly fuse with their subjects during the lifetime in the flesh_”. <a id="a59_224"></a>[[UB 52:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p7_4)] 

This doesn't mean we as individuals have to wait until Light and Life to begin striving for fusion. The more mortals that advance in that direction, or successfully fuse, the closer to Light and Life we will all become. 

## Why Strive For Adjuster Fusion Now?

The more sluggard among us may conclude there is little point in working for something now that can be done later on the mansion worlds, but regardless of how many mortals have succeeded, or what status they may be in, there can be little doubt that achieving adjuster fusion status while still on earth is of great assistance to the divine plan and our brothers and sisters. Not only does such a soul-satisfying accomplishment ensure your own survival and participation in the ascension scheme, it pleases God and optimizes your chances of effectively serving Michael and Mother while here. The more in harmony any of us are with God, the greater the positive spiritual impact we can have on society. Because of their detailed knowledge about fusion, _Urantia Book_ readers have the potential to be modern forerunners by furthering their own individual inner union with God, and thereby facilitate humanity's eventual collective attainment of Light and Life. In intimate conversations with members of several different Urantian circles, this author has encountered a number of individuals who believe they have reached high levels of ongoing spiritual attunement with their adjusters. They consider themselves candidates for adjuster fusion, have experienced having that status affirmed by their adjusters, and are living their lives accordingly. Hopefully, this article will inspire individuals who have had similar experiences to feel more comfortable in sharing them with others so that all of us can grow in our awareness that such an achievement is both desirable and possible. Such sharing about personal spiritual experiences regarding the journey towards fusion could also facilitate each other's mutual growth on the path. 

## Identifying _Your Progress Towards Fusion_

_The Urantia Book_ offers a wealth of information about the necessary spiritual levels that must be achieved to reach fusion. Identifying where you are in that structured progression may help inspire and encourage you to continue to make progress. How can you ascertain your own progress towards fusion? We are told that fusion generally occurs on Mansion World #5 or #6, and are given an accurate description of the spiritual levels and accomplishments required to master each of the Mansion World levels prior to that. Mansion World #1 is almost entirely devoted to deficiency ministry. Survivors arriving on this sphere present with manifold defects of creature character and deficiencies of mortal experience. Biologic deficiencies are addressed on the first mansion world, and major defects in planetary experience pertaining to sex life, family association, and parental function, are either corrected or projected for future rectification among the Material Son families on Jerusem.

For those who have issues with rudimentary social skills, on Mansion World #2, working groups and social organizations begin to form and survivors learn social interaction. Mansonia #2 provides for the removal of intellectual conflict and cures all varieties of mental disharmony. The training of the first two mansion worlds is mostly of a deficiency nature in that it has to do with supplementing the experience of the life in the flesh. 

Mansonia #3 is the sphere where positive educational work is begun. Survivors learn progressive morontia culture, enhance their understanding of the correlation of morontia mota and mortal logic, and gain practical insight into metaphysics. Ascending mortals are taught cosmic meanings and interrelationships, and are becoming ‘born of the spirit’, i.e., discovering God within themselves, and becoming God conscious. 

Ascenders on the 4^th^ mansion world are introduced to a new social order based on understanding sympathy and unselfish love of mutual service, rather than one predicated on personal aggrandizement or self-seeking conquest. They develop an increased appreciation of the broadcasts and other phases of local universe culture, and are becoming self- conscious of God knowing, God-revealing, God- seeking and God-finding. 

On mansion world #5, sojourners are taught the language of Uversa. A real birth of cosmic consciousness takes place, and pilgrims become universe minded with a bona fide enthusiasm for the Havona ascent. Study becomes voluntary, unselfish service natural, and worship spontaneous.

The sixth mansion world is devoted to initial instruction on universe administration, and an overview of career paths, and is the sphere where the perfect fusion of the human and the divine Adjuster usually occurs. On that glorious day which guarantees our eternal survival: 

> The union of the evolving immortal soul with the eternal and divine Adjuster is signalized by the seraphic summoning of the supervising superangel for resurrected survivors and of the archangel of record for those going to judgment on the third day; and then, in the presence of such a survivor’s morontia associates, these messengers of confirmation speak: ‘This is a beloved son in whom I am well pleased.’ This simple ceremony marks the entrance of an ascending mortal upon the eternal career of Paradise service. <a id="a91_519"></a>[[UB 47:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p8_4)] 

It is not difficult to analyze the requirements for passage from one mansion world to the next, look within to honestly appraise your progress, and by this means approximate your personal spiritual growth and mansion world level. Taking a look at the chart below may help with your own self- assessment. The chart is over simplified and doesn’t attempt to reflect the complexity and comprehensive nature of decisions made in advancing mortals from one mansion world to the next, but can assist in estimating your progress.

If you regularly seek out God and opportunities for service, have developed a sense of universe citizenship, and love to worship spontaneously, and study the _Urantia Book_, you exhibit many of the character attributes of Mansion World #5, and may be closer to fusion than you realize. Of course, you can wait until you reach the Mansion Worlds to address the issues that may be hindering your advancement, or you can constructively use your time on earth to make progress now. Our thought adjusters have individualized plans to help us advance and grow spiritually, and we may be assured that they are eager to aid us to move towards fusion. 

## Mansion Worlds And Their Functions

Mansion World #1 To correct biologic deficiencies, defects in sex life, family life, or parenting skills 

Mansion World #2 To ameliorate mental disharmonies and improve limited social skills 

Mansion World #3 To develop God consciousness in those who haven't found God in themselves 

Mansion World #4 To increase desire for God and cultivate greater sympathy and a love of service 

Mansion World #5 To foster cosmic consciousness and a voluntary desire for worship. 

Mansion World #6 To facilitate greater alignment with the divine will and fusion 

## Striving For Fusion

If reading about the success of Enoch and Elijah, hearing about the experiences of others, and identifying your own progress thus far, inspires you to work towards fusion the following suggestions about adjuster attunement found in Paper 110 of _The Urantia Book_ may be helpful: 

- Choose to respond to divine leading, basing your life on your highest consciousness of truth, beauty, and goodness. 
- Love God and desire to be like him. 
- Love men and sincerely try to serve them. 
- Joyfully accept your cosmic citizenship and universe duties. 

Further strategies might include developing a daily habit of praying for help in pleasing your adjuster and your divine parents. Take the Kingdom by storm, calling in all the divine assistance from your guardian angels and the midwayers and other members of our celestial family that are available to you, knowing they will be eager to help. Read over Jesus’ sermon on ‘Counting the Cost ’ and then practice seeking to align your will with the divine will in every situation. Commit yourself to making your best effort to do whatever you believe God wants, even if it means risking your personal finances, the approval of your family, your social standing, and your own personal desires. Jesus says: 

> “You who would follow after me from this time on, must be willing to pay the price of wholehearted dedication to the doing of my Father’s will. If you would be my disciples, you must be willing to forsake father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters. If any one of you would now be my disciple, you must be willing to give up even your life just as the Son of Man is about to offer up his life for the completion of the mission of doing the Father’s will on earth and in the flesh.” <a id="a127_494"></a>[[UB 171:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p2_2)] 

## For Those Seeking Further Assistance 

Those who desire further assistance with the journey towards fusion might benefit from this clip from Cosmic Citizen blog radio featuring Don Clementin of ChristExperiment.org titled 'Rejecting Mediocrity and Becoming Supermortals.' The recording in written form is found on the ChristExperiment.org webpage and has a blue box in the upper left hand corner that will start the recording: 

https://www.thechristexperiment.org/bhd-rejecting-mediocrity-becoming 

Don offers a compelling argument for pursuing adjuster fusion, and gave a dynamic presentation on the subject at _Urantia Book Service Corps of New England's_ spring retreat a year ago. 

Fellow readers pursuing their quest for fusion may want to consider a visit or retreat at Prior Rev. Dr. Robert Crickett’s ‘_St. Enoch and St. Elijah Monastery_’ in New Zealand. The 55 acre property is an exquisite botanical garden with a winding drive commemorating Enoch and Elijah, and many other spiritual leaders mentioned in the _Urantia Book_. The Prior endeavors to assist his visitors in attaining greater attunement with God within, and guests have ample time for daily prayer, study, meditation, and reflection. Immersion in such a spiritually rich environment can help individuals find the answers they seek, bring them closer to God, and nurture their spiritual growth. For further information, contact the monastery at rob@sffj.org. 

## Conclusion

If we could clearly hear the voices of our Thought Adjusters, they would exhort us towards fusion, reminding us that: 

> Today you are passing through the period of the courtship of your Adjuster; and if you only prove faithful to the trust reposed in you by the divine spirit who seeks your mind and soul in eternal union, there will eventually ensue that morontia oneness, that supernal harmony, that cosmic co-ordination, that divine attunement, that celestial fusion, that never- ending blending of identity, that oneness of being which is so perfect and final that even the most experienced personalities can never segregate or recognize as separate identities the fusion partners—mortal man and divine Adjuster. <a id="a143_599"></a>[[UB 110:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p1_6)]

Even though Jesus ministered in an age before many people on earth had adjusters, he taught his followers that the Kingdom of Heaven was within. Two thousand years have passed since then, and now every normal minded person has an adjuster. The time is ripe for believers to understand that not only does the Kingdom of Heaven lie within, but so too, the door to eternal life through union with our adjusters, and a supernal adventure beyond our imagining. 

> ... At last all creatures become conscious of the fact that God and all the divine hosts of a well-nigh limitless universe are on their side in the supernal struggle to attain eternity of life and divinity of status. Such faith-liberated sons have certainly enlisted in the struggles of time on the side of the supreme forces and divine personalities of eternity; even the stars in their courses are now doing battle for them; at last they gaze upon the universe from within, from God's viewpoint, and all is transformed from the uncertainties of material isolation to the sureties of eternal spiritual progression. <a id="a152_618"></a>[[UB 101:10.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p10_9)]
