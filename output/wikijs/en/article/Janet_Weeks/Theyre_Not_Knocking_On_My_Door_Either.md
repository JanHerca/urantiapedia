Some thoughts on Anne Bendall's article, 6-0-6 Newsletter May/June 1989.

No. I don't have them knocking on my door, either. No-one ever says to me “How do you do it?”, “Where do you get it from?” or “Where do you find the answers?” Not even any member of my family ever asks, or gives any recognition or questioning thought.

But through all the sometimes emotional and trying situations in life, I know how I do it and where my strength comes from.

As Jesus passed by, he always offered words of care and comfort, eased embarrassment and scattered love to everyone with whom he came in contact. Because of this scattering and outpouring of love and goodness, there was a response from those who received it. That response varied from a tentative and discreet touch of his garment by a shy,trusting little lady, to the noise and mobbing by throngs of crowding and excited people.

Recipients react in different ways to that which is given to them.

We readers of _The URANTIA Book_ have different reactions to the unfolding of the words of the gift of the revelation which we have received. Do we become emotional crusaders, or do we re-adjust our own lives on a quiet, personal basis? We are told that the zeal of the crusader can be dangerous, but the realisation of the love within us cannot help but overflow to others. In our own small way, whatever we are capable of, we can share our gift with others. ‘The act is ours; the consequences, God's’. ([UB 48:7.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_13))

Some years ago, I admired and was envious of, the strength of the faith of a friend. I knew that this friend had “'something” which I did not. But I did not knock on that door, either. That friend showed me the way to knock on God's door, and I knocked on His instead. My needs were there — and they were met.

Now I know where to obtain the answers to life's problems, and also that I have the assurance and peace which passes all understanding.

It does not matter to me that people do not come knocking on my door yet. I am a less than average achiever in life, you could call me very average. I am like the little trusting lady who reached out for the hem of Jesus' garment. Not an overly confident or extrovert person, but one who is infinitely trusting of the results of this tentative action.

I reached out and I found.

Maybe the only thing “wrong” with people like you and me, Anne, is that we are mere Urantian mortals with many, many handicaps. But that in itself can be a challenge!

We are still growing, we are still seeking, and we are still learning. And while ever this progress continues, we can be certain that “Even if I cannot do this, there lives in me one who can and will do it.” ([UB 4:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p4_9)), and that we are ascending upwards and ever inwards, however slowly.

So as we pass by in our work and play, by the showing of our simple, every-day concern and love towards our brothers, we hope and pray that they may, in time, see that we have “something” that is missing in their own lives. When they realise the need, we can show them the way to go knocking on our Father's door. “Knock and it shall be opened to you, seek and you shall find”.

Let peace be in your heart and songs of praise upon your lips, that you are chosen in love for service, Service for the King of all beings. In all the Universe there is no greater gift that can be given to man. The greatest of all gifts is the gift of service.
