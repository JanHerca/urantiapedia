_By Felipe Arrigorriaga, Santiago, Chile_

_Editor’s Note: Felipe lives in the capital of Chile, where he works as an independent publicist. He found_ The Urantia Book _in 2004 and says it changed his life. He is dedicated to promoting the book in Chile through book fairs and spiritual festivals, and he has attended several international conferences. He helped form the first Chilean Association of readers of_ The Urantia Book_, and also collaborates with the Urantia Book Fellowship._

Located south of Peru and wedged between the Andes Mountains to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west, Chile is a long and narrow country that stretches 4,000 miles along the western edge of South America. If you were to turn Chile upside down, it would run from the northern tip of Alaska to the end of the Baja Peninsula of Mexico.

Chile is geographically diverse. The Atacama Desert, known as the driest place on earth, is a virtually rainless plateau made up of salt basins and lava flows. Located in the northern part of Chile, it stretches over 600 miles along the Pacific Coast. The Atacama Desert is a popular spot for astronomers and tourists alike. The clear skies offer spectacular views of the Milky Way galaxy.

This contrasts with the lush forests, glacial lakes, and volcanoes of the southern Andes region. If you were to be transported to Patagonia, you might think that you were in the fjords that are found in Alaska and along the coast down to Seattle. It is sparsely inhabited, with alpacas and guanacos running wild. This beautiful area of Chile has mountains, bays, many islands, and national parks. Tierra del Fuego is the jumping-off point to Antarctica.

In section 5 of Paper 78, “The Andite Migrations,” we learn that the Andites set off from Japan in open boats and landed on Easter Island, which since 1887 is considered part of Chile, and set up their religious and administrative center. Only 132 ever made it to the mainland of South America and established the ancestry of the later rulers of the Incas. Easter Island is a world-famous tourist destination because of the giant moai statues. The current mayor of Easter Island, which is also named Isla de Pascua, is a devoted Urantia Book reader.

Chilean culture is like a rich tapestry, with indigenous roots interwoven with Spanish colonial influences. The warm and welcoming people are known for their hospitality and strong sense of national pride. The vast majority of Chileans are Christians—around 70% Catholic and 17% Protestant. Minority religions include Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. Our culture emphasizes family values and respect for elders.

Chile is one of the most developed nations in South America, with a stable democracy and a prosperous economy that is driven by mining (especially copper), agriculture, fishing, and, increasingly, the technology and services sectors. Wine production is also significant, as Chilean wines gain international recognition. Tourists are attracted to the vibrant urban life of Santiago, natural wonders such as Torres del Paine National Park, and Elqui Valley for stargazing. Adventure lovers flock to the Andes for skiing, hiking, and climbing.

There have been Urantia Book reading groups in Chile since the 1980s. The Asociación Urantia del Cono Sur was formed in 1999 with readers from Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Peru, and Uruguay. This organization eventually became inactive due to the challenges of maintaining a cohesive governing board with leaders from so many countries. But the local Urantia movement continued to thrive, with readers attending book fairs and spiritual festivals. Ricardo Roselló began the efforts to form a new Chilean association, and I succeeded him a year ago. The new association was announced in March during the 2024 Urantia Association International Conference in Baltimore, and we look forward to hosting our own conference next year.

I am so happy to represent my country on the Cultural Advisory Council. I hope to learn about other cultures and discover what is happening with _The Urantia Book_ in other countries. It gives me great pleasure to share what we are doing in Chile to make _The Urantia Book_ known. I am passionate about this great and wonderful mission!
