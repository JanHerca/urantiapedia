It is a painting whose function is that of any painting: to help us see, understand, grasp and, often, celebrate a sense of wonder.

Without a framework, we cannot nourish ourselves mentally. Conceptual frameworks, frames of reference, painters' frameworks, obviously...; we need frameworks all the time.

So, this table of LONG TIME, relative as it is, will only be useful temporarily... And, it is not by chance, it wants to celebrate TIME. And time, it passes!!! And, what is more, the growth of understanding increases on this planet and the table will quickly become outdated! And if it contains errors, I will gladly amend it to give it another opportunity to serve. Thank you for your contribution to making it outdated and current!

In fact, I thought while drawing it that the table spoke for itself. But the editor-in-chief of the Journal Réflectivité insisted. I had to write an introductory text!

So, reader, I recommend that you start with the two quotes in the table. They present the challenge of TIME in the most beautiful way. This challenge is to have meaningful EXPERIENCES to contribute to the great work of the Supreme — the divine Mother — for this second age of the Universe.

The first quote (<a id="a37_17"></a>[UB 26:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p5_3)) warns us that the difficulties will not diminish in the future. For those who say yes to the divine plan, you should know that we will want difficulties... more and more difficult. So, if we were looking for wisdom and knowledge to make an armor against unfortunate or difficult events (a sort of Florida for the winter), it seems that it will not happen anytime soon.

Now look at the other quote (<a id="a39_29"></a>[UB 118:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p1_8)). It is as stimulating as the previous one. Thus, separating the three components of time - past, present and future - prevents us from properly understanding events and places us in a state of waiting for spiritual maturity. So, long live integration and conjugation in the continuity of all time! What is better, integrating the three aspects of time - past, present, future - will allow us to grasp the meaning of eternity of which time is only fragments.

Happy reading and enjoy the wonder.

## High point.

We are in TIME simply to contribute our significant experiences to the divine adventure of the Supreme, the divine Mother. Ah! My veneration for this Mother should have led me to name Her more in my painting! May She not hold it against me... I leave Her the last word: Divine Mother of the universe, I venerate You! This entire document on the second age of the universe speaks of You right up to the conclusion.

**Conclusion**: Now read this quotation which embraces the whole and bridges the Supreme with our experience: “_The evolving Supreme will eventually compensate finite creatures for their inability ever to achieve more than limited experience contact with the universe of universes. Creatures can attain the Paradise Father, but their evolutionary minds, being finite, are incapable of really understanding the infinite and absolute Father. But since all creature experiencing registers in, and is a part of, the Supreme, when all creatures attain the final level of finite existence, and after total universe development makes possible their attainment of God the Supreme as an actual divinity presence, then, inherent in the fact of such contact, is contact with total experience. The finite of time contains within itself the seeds of eternity; and we are taught that, when the fullness of evolution witnesses the exhaustion of the capacity for cosmic growth, the total finite will embark upon the absonite phases of the eternal career in quest of the Father as Ultimate._ ” <a id="a47_1077"></a>[UB 117:5.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p5_14)
