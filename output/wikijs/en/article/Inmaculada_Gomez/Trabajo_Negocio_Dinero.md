The topics of this presentation represent a fundamental part of the vicissitudes that most humans experience on this planet, and _The Urantia Book_ reveals teachings and ideals whose objective is, as in all other aspects of life, to bring the kingdom of heaven to earth by doing the will of our Father / Mother Creator.

## JOB

Work, regardless of its nature, should be viewed as a form of service to others and a way to contribute to the well-being and progress of society. It is important to perform work efficiently and with a positive attitude, as well as to emphasize the importance of teamwork.

An example of this is seen in document LU 133:4.8, in which Jesus said to the landlady of a Greek inn:

> “Offer your hospitality as one who receives the children of the Most High. Raise the thankless task of your daily work to the heights of a refined art by the growing consciousness that you are serving God in those whom he indwells through his spirit, which has come down to dwell in the hearts of men, thus seeking to transform their minds and lead their souls to a knowledge of the Paradise Father who has bestowed all these gifts of the divine spirit.” [UB 133:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p4_8)

Each individual has a unique role in the universe and a spiritual mission in life. Work, when performed with a higher purpose and dedication to service, is an opportunity to contribute to the well-being of humanity and spiritual advancement.

All activities can be spiritually elevated when performed with love and dedication. It highlights the value of working the land, which for thousands of years has been considered a lowly occupation. The vision offered in the book is its exaltation, as clearly stated in document LU 66:7.19:

> “Work with the soil is not a curse; rather is it the highest blessing to all who are thus permitted to enjoy the most human of all human activities.” [UB 66:7.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p7_19)

## BUSINESS

In the field of business, the importance of living a life based on ethical values and respect for others is emphasized. In any activity, including business, individuals are expected to make decisions that reflect a high level of integrity and consideration for the well-being of all.

Businesses should be oriented toward creating value for society and satisfying people's needs.

The book's teachings promote high values in ethics, honesty, and fairness in business practices.

A vision of unity and brotherhood among all people would influence the way economic resources are managed and financial decisions are made.

Business should foster collaboration and unity rather than destructive competition, encouraging collaboration across nations and cultures to address economic and social challenges.

## MONEY / WEALTH

_The Urantia Book_ teaches that material wealth is neither intrinsically good nor evil, that we should free ourselves from the love of wealth, but not necessarily from wealth itself ([Doc. 163:2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p2_1)). Rather, it emphasizes that the true value of money or wealth is related to its use and purpose.

The accumulation of wealth should be aligned with high spiritual values and should be viewed as an opportunity for service and contribution to the well-being of humanity, rather than as a selfish pursuit.

An example is what is said in document LU 81:6.38:

> “High civilizations are born of the sagacious correlation of material wealth, intellectual greatness, moral worth, social cleverness, and cosmic insight.” [UB 81:6.38](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_38)

Wise management of material and financial resources stems from an awareness of one's own and others' needs, and decision-making must promote sustainable growth and well-being by using resources efficiently, rather than depleting or wasting them.

This wise wealth management includes financial planning, investing in constructive projects, and generosity toward the less fortunate.

Regarding money in particular, the book clearly states that it is simply a tool that facilitates the exchange of goods and services. It should not be excessively worshipped or pursued.

Rather than focusing on accumulating money for its own sake, the emphasis is on using money consciously to advance spiritual goals and contribute to collective well-being.

Excessive focus on accumulating wealth can distract people from their spiritual growth and deeper purpose in life, so people are encouraged to seek a balance between material needs and spiritual aspirations.

In this sense, it is in document 165:4.6 where Jesus preaches the following:

> “But never forget that, after all, wealth is unenduring. The love of riches all too often obscures and even destroys the spiritual vision. Fail not to recognize the danger of wealth’s becoming, not your servant, but your master.” [UB 165:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p4_6)

The book suggests that the true value of life is not found in the accumulation of material possessions, but in spiritual growth and a relationship with God through selfless service and generosity toward others to contribute to the collective well-being.

The accumulation of wealth, whether in the form of money or material and financial resources, provides the opportunity to share with others and participate in the improvement of society as a whole. The act of giving and serving has a spiritual value that transcends material value.

In [Paper 132.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_1), Jesus advises a rich man on how he should estimate his wealth, classifying it into ten different methods of accumulating assets and advising how to act in each situation. This document invites us to classify our own wealth according to its source and makes us reflect on whether we are truly applying its guidelines and advice.

In summary, The Urantia Book presents a perspective that values wealth and money as tools that can be used for service and spiritual growth. Wise stewardship, generosity, and a focus on higher spiritual goals are emphasized as fundamental to a rich and meaningful life.

In my view, if I had to summarize in one sentence the ideal that this book presents to us for applying its teachings to these very materialistic matters, I would say that people are urged to first seek personal and spiritual growth, the search for truth and connection with Divinity over material concerns.
