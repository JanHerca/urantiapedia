Louis Dupré, professor of the philosophy of religion at Yale University, presents an intriguing interview in the July 16-23, 1997 _Christian Century_ entitled, “Seeking Christian Interiority.” Dupré observes that Western Civilization has become a secular culture. Christianity has lost its creative power and can no longer integrate our culture. “We have all become atheists, not in the hostile, antireligious sense of an earlier age, but in the sense that God no longer matters _absolutely_ in our closed world, if God matters at all.” (p. 654)

Since Christianity no longer plays an integrating role in the life of postmodern societies, and since tradition has lost its authority, the individual must now integrate life through personal spiritual experience. The need for some coherent meaning in our lives is so strong that many turn to ultraconservative religious models from the past. Such unauthentic ways for achieving integration results in schizoid, compartmentalized living — juggling an outmoded religious theology with the contemporary scientific, secular culture.

Authentic faith must integrate all other elements of a society if it is to survive. The Fifth Epochal Revelation provides the frame of reference that makes such integrated living possible. It also makes it possible to appreciate the evidence of the Spirit of the Universal Father in other faith communities. During this period of the breakdown of the spiritual orientation of Western Civilization, like Augustine during the decline of the Roman empire, we must integrate our lives through personal spiritual dedication and commitment. The extensive information about the Thought Adjusters in _The Urantia Book_ is a great help in this personal integrative pilgrimage.

Gradually new religious institutions will evolve based on the creativity of the Fifth Epochal Revelation that will, in time, create a new integrating culture throughout the world. Students of _The Urantia Book_ have the unique opportunity to participate in the formation of these new religious institutions and experience the beginnings of a new age on Urantia!

> “Some day a reformation in the Christian church may strike deep enough to get back to the unadulterated religion of Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. You may preach as religion about Jesus, but, perforce, you must live the religion of Jesus.” ([UB 196:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p2_1))
