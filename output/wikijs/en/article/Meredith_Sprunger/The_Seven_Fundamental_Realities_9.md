## 6. Growth methods: Transformation and adaptation

Growth and adaptation are the principles of planetary survival. Organisms either thrive or deteriorate. Human beings improve in physical condition until the years of adulthood, then slowly decline in physiological fitness. Although bound up in bodily power, our mental and spiritual development does not share these material limitations. The future is open to spiritual growth and mortal transcendence for everyone. The psychological disciplines of this path are exacting. We are free to choose among facts, meanings, and values. In doing so, the human pilgrimage is sometimes derailed by evil, the ignorant and unconscious violation of universal law; barred by sin, the willful discernment of disobedience to divine law; or terminated by iniquity, a complete identification with nonreality, by which the individual commits spiritual suicide.

Most people grow up with a limited awareness of the spiritual magnitude of existence and a partial commitment to eternal values. With increasing experience, we discover that our choices and mental attitudes are fundamental to all aspects of human effectiveness. We learn to use our minds to overcome obstacles and solve problems. Through loyalty to endearing values and creative imagination, we learn to transcend the limitations of our environment. It is the pains of experience that teach us the limits of sensual pleasure, the satisfaction of fair play, and our loving relationships. We become aware of the growing importance of a genuine guide within us, usually associated with a reality beyond ourselves—God. At some critical point in our lives, the culmination of these empowering experiences leads us to a personal encounter with the indwelling presence of God.

When we commit our lives to our Heavenly Father, even if we are not fully aware of it, a revolutionary event has just occurred in our mind and soul. Our act of dedicating our will and spiritual allegiance is an event of cognitive transformation, opening our lives to a new level of spiritual growth and power. No loss of opportunity or skill can stop this upward adventure into the kingdom of God. In this act of will we have chosen the critical step in the psychological reorganization or consolidation and consecration of all our values, incentives, and motivations. What knowledge, reason, and sheer force of will cannot accomplish, faith, insight, and mental transformation accomplish through spiritual power. They free us from the confinement of the options and limitations of the physical level. In essence, we have been born again; we have chosen the direction of our destiny. We possess a new identity that fully recognizes and accepts our status as sons or daughters of God, with all the privileges and obligations that come with this acquisition of the new birth.

We must now grow into this new or fully accepted individuality, into spiritually robust strength and beauty. How much this conversion or consecrated experience has greatly changed our lives depends largely on two things: where we were before this psychological transformation took place and the maturity we have achieved in steady volition and mastery of the mind. When the mind is prepared and ready, sudden changes are possible. Normally, the consolidation of psychological resources, the mobilization of persistent and courageous will, and spiritual growth are required before we can control, master and redirect our animal impulses, instincts and emotions. Our aspirations and ideals spring forth in geometric proliferation but our ability to realize them in life proceeds at an arithmetic pace. Accordingly, our growth takes place mostly by evolutionary adjustment, occasionally interrupted and aided by spiritually transformative events.

It is with the ordinary quality of our lives that we should welcome dissatisfaction, but not be discouraged by our slowness in changing it. While we hunger for growth, our loyal efforts and highest desires ultimately determine what we shall become. Because we are indwelt by spirit, the potentials of our personality dominate the actuals; and our day-to-day achievements shape our destiny. It takes time, wisdom, and intense effort to reconcile our animal and spiritual natures. There are inevitable conflicts in advancing from life in the flesh to life in the spirit, from self-centered orientation to central reality.

Sensual and selfish desires are not suppressed by religious rules or official prohibitions. Nor can they be banished by force of will. Just as a boiler generates steam as long as there is a fire in the hearth, our animal passions are fed as long as they occupy our consciousness. Negative attention directed toward control or abstinence is almost as effective in generating desire as positive thinking anticipating fulfillment. As long as there is conscious visualization in the hearth of the boiler of psychological attention, the steam of desire is generated. We must find ways to stop the power generated by the demand of consciousness. Just as two objects cannot be in the same space at the same time, two thoughts cannot occupy the mind at the same time. Substitute control of thought is the way to determine the direction thus decided. It is **a rigorous and repetitive discipline** but it is the sure way to mastery of the mind.

The constant renewal of our minds through a transcendence of our animal nature can only be accomplished when the spiritual frame of reference becomes spontaneous and natural. We must visualize by faith, we must actually “live into” the new insight, the new attitude, the new emotion, or the new spiritually motivated action that our desires yearn to become a part of our lives. This process of restructuring our minds and behavior is slow but unfailingly effective. We must expect periods of hunger pains and the suffering of deprivation, but these trials are soon replaced by **the joy of experiencing the mastery and vigor of physical, psychological, and spiritual fitness**. The rule of the Spirit involves effort, conflict, struggle, suffering, perseverance, and unwavering faith; but the rewards of the spiritual religious life are growth, integrity of character, wholeness, competence, inner peace, joy, happiness, and the highest human fulfillment.

Changes in growth are **associated with action, service and time**. Spiritual development is largely an unconscious process. Small changes in our mode of thinking or feeling sometimes take place at the subliminal level of consciousness and occasionally result in a sudden transformation of enthusiastic new insight. However, usually the progression of our reasoning and ideals is far in advance of that of our feelings and emotions. Spiritual maturity unifies our intellectual, volitional and emotional natures. At some point in our pilgrimage our temperament or inner life becomes free from the inducements of physiological, social and environmental coercion. As sons and daughters of God, our identity transcends all other references and we are full of the joy and expression of happiness of those who live in typical spiritual settings.

Spiritual growth is not an experience or a straight path. Typically, we have setbacks and setbacks that require new dedication, readjustments, and efforts. Even when we have strengthened levels of achievement, we are not allowed to enjoy our accomplishments for very long. Soon, new insights, new transformations, and new adjustments demand our full attention and effort. This is a constant process of life as long as we want to grow.

As personality development matures, its achievement is more rapid and less traumatic. For individuals who have achieved a
good control of the mind, spiritual psychological transformation can quickly readjust attitudes, emotions and behavior. These changes become less radical and are assimilated to a natural reaction, an expanded perception of reality. We learn how to convert the difficulties of time into stepping stones for spiritual realization. Such a spiritual life transforms mediocre individuals into **people of power**.

## Summary of the presentation

The crux of spiritual psychology is the moment we commit our lives to the Heavenly Father. This event of cognitive transformation commits us to a new stage of growth and power. The realization of our new status is orchestrated by a dialectic between a sudden spiritual transformation and a personal evolutionary adjustment culminating in spiritual growth. Through mastery of the mind, the Inner Spirit unifies our inner life, frees us from physiological, egocentric, and social coercions, and fills us with the joy of those who live in typical spiritual settings. The Universal Father uses this psychological process to transform mediocre individuals into people of power.
