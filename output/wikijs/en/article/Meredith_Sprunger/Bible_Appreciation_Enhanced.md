Many years ago a friend who was the senior minister of a prominent city church asked me, “How do you view the Bible after reading _The Urantia Book_?” He had briefly examined the book and assumed it would have a negative effect on my evaluation of the Bible. He was, therefore, a bit surprised when I answered, “I have a much greater appreciation of the Bible since I have been studying _The Urantia Book_.”

The authors of _The Urantia Book_ place Biblical writings in a holistic picture of progressive revelation on our world. They impart a new appreciation for our courageous forebears and their historic witness to truth. Much that modern scholarship has regarded as myth in the Biblical narrative we learn has an actual historical basis and validity. The stories of Adam and Eve, the tower of Babel, Noah and the ark, and other events are examples of Biblical accounts which have a solid historical base but have been reshaped by tradition for religious purposes.

_The Urantia Book_ presents a background and setting for many Biblical statements and events which today seem farfetched or “deus ex machina” happenings and makes them understandable and reasonable when seen in context. I have observed that some pastors whose scholarly inclinations have led them to take a rather liberal position regarding Biblical material have, after reading _The Urantia Book_,started using Biblical references in their preaching with new conviction and power.

Authentic new revelation always builds on the best of the old. The New Testament is continuous with the highest truths of the Old Testament. In the same way, _The Urantia Book_ confirms the essential truths of the Biblical message. The place of Jesus' role in revelation and salvation is affirmed and enlarged. The primary effect of reading _The Urantia Book_ for most Christians is a new and expanded appreciation of the stature and wisdom of Jesus and an enlightened gratitude for the effectiveness of his saving ministry to our world and universe. This, along with an expanded view of universe reality, we believe is destined to bring an enhanced spiritual authenticity to the proclamation of the gospel in our contemporary society.
