## Best wishes !

_Normand Laperle_
_Editor of Réflectivité_

The members of the AUQ Board of Directors join me in offering you their best wishes for 2018.

May this new year inspire you with love, brotherhood and the essential values in life.

To serve is to love, God loves.

## Word from the President

_Line St-Pierre_
president@urantiaqc.org

Do we value the knowledge that The Urantia Book offers us, the happiness that these truths bring, the peace and well-being of knowing our history and our eternal destiny? Although this revelation is very recent (62 years), and knowing that it was given for the next thousand years, one might wonder if there is reason to rush to talk about it?

A few years ago when I was in Peru, a friend said to me regarding the dissemination of the book and the teachings, “_if not us, who will it be and if not now, when?_”

Whatever our interests in life, there is always this inherent need to associate with others to share what we experience in common. This is done either in family gatherings, in meetings with friends, in organizations that we are part of or in work.

Is it not a good opportunity at these meetings to listen and really grasp what people have to say and to augment the conversation with something beautiful, good and true, something kind and loving that enhances the discussion, that sheds light on the matters being discussed? It is not always necessary to mention _The Urantia Book_ to build on the facts and truths shared, but to trust in the spirit within us that will guide us to say the right things. Gentleness and discernment in our speech must work together to contribute to the opening of searching souls.

The word “trust” is written at least 177 times in the book. In an airplane, we trust the pilot who flies through the air at 35,000 feet; in surgery, we entrust our body to the expertise of a doctor with his scalpel who will cut us open; is it not more desirable to put all our trust in this divine part, the Thought Adjuster who enlightens us in those moments when we must find the right words, the words that enlighten, the words that comfort?

It is here, now, that the Father's work is accomplished.

May the year 2018 be a continued source of health, joy, love, faith and accomplishments of all kinds to shine your light throughout the cosmos all the way to Heaven!

## Happy New Year 2018!

_Marc Belleau_
treasurer@urantiaqc.org

The year 2017 was full of events of all kinds. But what caught my attention was the courage shown by victims of sexual assault, men and women, in publicly denouncing the reprehensible acts of those who use power to satisfy their baser instincts. Power should serve the greater good of society and not the excessive ego of those who wield it. Power, when used well, can serve great causes and advance society, but it takes a strong personality, an upright, balanced and well-developed character to resist the urge to use it for purely selfish ends. But beyond the indignation that we can feel in the face of this outrageous situation, we must rejoice in the collective awareness that it has provoked. It was not only the victims who stood up to denounce these abuses, but all of Quebec society was there to support them; and the message was clear, these behaviors are unacceptable and must no longer be tolerated. A friend recently told me, “_when good people do nothing, evil thrives_.” This time, good people stood up and broke their silence and the results were very real and frankly encouraging. To me, this inspiring episode is a step forward in the right direction, a demonstration that there is hope for the advancement of spirituality in our society; justice and fairness will ultimately triumph.

For 2018, I wish us to have as much courage to face the many problems we face. There is a great future for our society, for our world, Urantia, and it is up to us to build it.

## Annual General Meeting (AGM)

_Marc Belleau_
treasurer@urantiaqc.org

I would like to invite you to the Annual General Meeting to be held on **<ins>Saturday, February 10, 2018</ins> at the Hotel and Suites Le Dauphin 600 Boul. Saint-Joseph, Drummondville** QC, Canada. Your presence will be most important since we will be presenting the strategic plan and related projects. The morning will be devoted to the presentation of the activity report and the budget for 2017 as well as the **election of the <ins>vice-president</ins> and the <ins>treasurer</ins> whose positions <ins>become vacant</ins> this year**.

In the afternoon, we will present the strategic plan followed by a group discussion where you can share your ideas and impressions on the proposed directions. I can tell you right now that this plan is based on 2 important pillars: **the promotion of The Urantia Book** and its **teachings and the support of study group hosts**. All the activities of the Association will revolve around these 2 axes. However, the emphasis will be on the **support of study group hosts**, because, at present, little is done to help these important actors of the movement. We will explain to you in more detail the strategies put forward to achieve the objectives that we have set for ourselves.

We hope that you will be present in large numbers for the presentation of the future directions of your Association.

I'm looking forward to seeing you again.

## New study group in Montreal: “The Artisans of Progress”

_Robert Cadieux_
_Montreal_

Study groups are still few in number in Quebec. However, the AUQ and active readers strongly desire the formation of several study groups. There are two living intentions in the dissemination of The Urantia Book: to increase the number of readers and to enhance the understanding of its teachings through group study; that is, to live up to the spiritual ideals taught that can be magnified in human experience and integrated into the consciousness of our spiritualized mind.

For what purposes?
Bringing forth the fruits of the Spirit in our daily actions. Jesus listed 11 of them during his eighteenth appearance in Tyre, on Tuesday, May 16, 30 AD.

He said: "And these are the fruits of the divine spirit produced in the lives of spirit-born and God-knowing mortals:

- _service expressing love,_
- _devotion without selfishness,_
- _courageous loyalty,_
- _sincere fairness,_
- _enlightened honesty,_
- _hope still alive,_
- _trust without suspicion,_
- _merciful ministry,_
- _inexhaustible goodness,_
- _indulgent tolerance,_
- _lasting peace.”_ <a id="a128_20"></a>[UB 193:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p2_2)

This is the spirit of this new group: to study, to share, in seriousness and joy.


## My encounter with The Urantia Book

_Liguori Leclerc_
_Three Rivers_

It was 1947, I was working at the Canadian Pacific Railway station in Lac Megantic, and it was the year the world discovered the first flying saucers in New Mexico, one of which crashed killing all but one of its occupants, the mummies preserved by the American government, the details of which were revealed several years later.

Although it was a surprise to many people including myself, I quickly realized that it was normal that there exist other inhabited worlds and planets elsewhere in our universe, considering the thousands of stars that we can observe at night, and our inability to be able to contact them.

In 1965, I found _The Urantia Book_ in a bookstore in Shawinigan and discovered the answer to my eternal questions that had been bothering me since 1947. In this book there is an answer to everything that it is possible to know concerning our universe, the place where we must pass upon our death, our journey in various environments to Jerusem, the capital of our system, after having passed and studied the numerous knowledge beforehand including the description of the island of Paradise, the means to get there, also the life of Jesus in its entirety, as well as several explanations concerning the Bible and its authors, something that can only be found elsewhere than in The Urantia Book.

I advise new readers to start with the table of contents and choose the topics that interest them most, before moving on to the more advanced chapters, which will interest them as time goes on with the book itself.

## Study Group “What a great discovery!”

_Claudette and Jean_
_St. Lucia_

It's much more than I imagined!

After completing some readings of The Urantia Book, motivated by the search for truth, I remained hungry, but did not dare to sign up for a study group, for fear of being disappointed. More than 25 years ago, a reader in whom I had great confidence, shared with me negative comments about his experience with a study group, so I had ruled out this alternative, while continuing to read, on my own.

This year, I was intrigued by an ad from a reader looking for someone to share with. After meeting him, I decided to join the study group he was a part of, what a good decision. Since then, I have noticed that my understanding is much greater and my motivation has increased a lot.

An important factor has been added to this experience of reading “The Urantia Book”, namely the fact that my partner and I are now living it together and are enriched by it. Claudette, through her sharing, contributes to healthy questioning and more in-depth research.

She writes: “_The study group allows us to exchange our understandings, to welcome new knowledge, and to benefit from the experiences of others. It allows me to enter more deeply into my heart, to listen, to strengthen my knowledge, to guide and deepen my understanding of the writings. It is a privilege and a joy for me to share with the Urantia brotherhood. It is essential nourishment, reassuring guidance, a stimulation of my faith._”

“_We agree that our exchanges as a couple, on our understandings, our experiences, our discoveries and our uncertainties, stimulate us in our approach, but undoubtedly also have the effect of raising the quality and richness of our relationship._”

I understand so much better the organization of the Universes, of Paradise, but also and above all of God's plan and what we must do to access it. There is now in me a certainty so much stronger and deeper concerning the reason for living and the reason for continuing my spiritual growth. The love, which lives in me, is now so different in its power, in its expression, in its discernment, in the sensation of carrying it.

The presence of the study group creates a form of supervision, of support, which encourages us in reading, but also in practice. The regularity of the meetings creates a form of very beneficial momentum which stimulates and guides us.

## My experience with study groups

_Francine Fortin,_
_Farnham_

On my 50th birthday, I remember it very well, I was sitting in front of my loveseat and, in front of the mirror, the great existential questions arose in my mind. What is the meaning and purpose of my Life? Have I lived an existence full of challenges and trials for no reason? What will happen after my death? Will I die without all the lessons I have learned during my Life having a purpose? By questioning myself, I felt an immense need to live forever, to live something else after my death, to continue living... somewhere else perhaps? I refused that everything be in vain, without purpose, without reason.

After much thought, I knew that the only answer would come from God and that it was time for me to turn to Him.

Having been excommunicated from the Catholic religion at a very young age, following my father's suicide, I had no desire to turn to any human religion to find Him. What I knew of God, through the Catholic nuns of my childhood, inspired far too much fear in me.

I then stated out loud my intention and desire to find and know a **<ins>Good</ins>** God. I did not know at that time that He had heard me.

This is how a few days after my birthday, I received from my friend Line the gift that would change the course of my present and future Life: The marvelous Urantia Book.

The dedication read: “_Tintin [that's been my nickname since forever], the important thing is not who we are, but who we want to become. It's not where we are, but where we want to go. 50 years is just a blink of an eye in eternity._”

Inspired by this dedication, I decided to set to work and begin reading this mysterious book. I felt and hoped to find the answers to all my questions.

So, one fine morning, well rested, happy and filled with a certain eagerness, I open this book and begin reading the first part.

Oh woe! I remember very well the unease that invaded me with each page I read. The more I read, the less I understood all these terms and found no logic in them. I still persisted and continued reading for a hundred pages before concluding that alone, I would never succeed. I felt completely stunned, destroyed and very disappointed.

My ego had just taken a hit! I, who thought I was intelligent, could not understand this incomprehensible and illogical puzzle to my mind.

It must be said that, in the past, I had never turned to any religious reading.

It was with frustration and sadness that I contacted my friend and confessed my failure. Line then told me about study groups and that there was one that was held in my area. But since it was in July, it didn't start again until September. She shared her experience with me, comforted me by telling me that it was quite normal not to understand anything at first.

She advised me to stop worrying and instead read the fourth part, the Life of Jesus. Which I did with immense joy and a certain peace!

So, in September, I showed up, anxious, not knowing what to expect, at the study group at Pierre Routhier's. Oh, what happiness and what wonderful moments I experienced there! I was surrounded by patient readers who were happy to answer all my questions. I discovered extraordinary and generous people who became my friends. My understanding of _The Urantia Book_ doubled and I gradually learned to live according to some of its teachings.

A few years later, I moved to the South Shore and joined another study group at Guy Vachon's. My happiness and understanding continued to grow every week, in contact with these readers who taught me and shared their knowledge and life experiences. I saw, through their testimonies, the impact that The Urantia Book had on them and this reflected on me. I made friends there for eternity.

At 60, fulfilling one of my biggest dreams in life, I retired, moved to live 6 months of spring and summer in a beautiful big trailer on a campground and live the other 6 months of fall and winter in a house in Mexico.

Naturally, The Urantia Book follows me wherever I go, it is part of my Life. With the EPUB version, I installed it on my e-reader.

My only regret was not being able to join a study group. There are a few in Mexico, but let's just say my Spanish isn't as advanced to participate. I was pretty confused and turned to my friend Line again.

She informed me that with her husband Gaétan, they had adopted a new formula with the internet, to facilitate access to the members of their group when they had the flu or the weather prevented them from going out and that I could join them via this medium simply by clicking on a link that they would send me. My happiness was at its peak and I bless them every day for offering me their hospitality from a distance, from the campsite and Mexico, thousands of kilometers from Quebec.

Within this new study group, I have found reading friends and discovered new ones who, each in their own way, contribute to enriching my Life. They inspire me and help me to continue to grow according to the teachings of the Book. I continue, every week, to accumulate new understandings that bring me ever closer to God and solidify my unwavering faith.

Every Monday night I look forward to reconnecting with my study group and there are few times when I haven't been able to attend.

So it has been 13 years since I first opened The Urantia Book.

And it is through participating in study groups that my understanding of this divine book has grown immensely, allowing me to know my Father, my Adjuster, Michael and all creations, inspiring me to live my Life according to The Plans and Will of God.

Through the Urantia Book study groups, I learned to understand Him better, love Him, communicate with Him, through prayer, meditation and worship. I sought Him and finally discovered Him!

I found meaning, purpose and eternity in my existence.

Everything happens in the study groups: discussions, listening, sharing, new avenues of reflection, explanations, questions, understanding, fraternity, respect, happiness and Love.

I know that alone, I would never have achieved such results. I think it is important not to isolate oneself in reading the Book and that in Life it is essential to associate with people to help each other in our own journey. It is comforting for me to be able to freely discuss, think and reflect in respect and fraternity, on what unites us all: God!

I pray to Our Father to bless all of you who follow the instructions of the revelators by continuing to form study groups throughout the world and I wish you the great happiness of being part of them, if you are not already.

## Thematic meeting in Montreal, October 15, 2017

**Perceptions and Spiritual Growth**

I come back to what I was saying earlier. In my little human mind, I cannot understand how a being of such high rank could come to deny the existence of the Universal Father and his universal plan of cosmic progression from the human to the divine.

This is a big difference in perception because for me, with faith, there is no doubt.

Of course it must be remembered that this rebellion was an isolated act in the local universe of Nebadon. For our universe contains 10,000 systems of 1,000 planets like that of Satania and this rebellion was only the third in the history of Nebadon which is, relatively, a young local universe which counted in 1934, only 3,840,101 inhabited planets.

Michael took counsel with his heavenly brother Emmanuel. Following this important conference, Michael announced that he would continue the policy that had characterized his handling of similar uprisings in the past and would adopt an attitude of non-intervention.

> “_Since Michael elected to remain aloof from the actual warfare of the Lucifer rebellion, Gabriel called his personal staff together on Edentia and, in counsel with the Most Highs, elected to assume command of the loyal hosts of Satania. Michael remained on Salvington while Gabriel proceeded to Jerusem, and establishing himself on the sphere dedicated to the Father—the same Universal Father whose personality Lucifer and Satan had questioned—in the presence of the forgathered hosts of loyal personalities, he displayed the banner of Michael, the material emblem of the Trinity government of all creation, the three azure blue concentric circles on a white background._” (<a id="a249_677"></a>[UB 53:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p5_4))

> “_The Lucifer emblem was a banner of white with one red circle, in the center of which a black solid circle appeared._” (<a id="a251_123"></a>[UB 53:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p5_5))

“_There was war in heaven; Michael’s commander and his angels fought against the dragon (Lucifer, Satan, and the apostate princes); and the dragon and his rebellious angels fought but prevailed not._” (<a id="a253_202"></a>[UB 53:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p5_6)) This “_war in heaven_” was not a physical battle, a conflict as conceived on Urantia. In the early days of the struggle, Lucifer discoursed constantly in the planetary amphitheater. Gabriel had established his headquarters nearby, and from there he continually exposed the sophistries of the rebels. The various personalities on the sphere who were hesitating as to the course to take moved back and forth between these discussions until they had arrived at a final decision.

> “_But this war in heaven was very terrible and very real. While displaying none of the barbarities so characteristic of physical warfare on the immature worlds, this conflict was far more deadly; material life is in jeopardy in material combat, but the war in heaven was fought in terms of life eternal._” (<a id="a255_309"></a>[UB 53:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p5_7))

I question and wonder, what does this tell me: I must avoid the traps of pride. I have within me the ability to perceive what is right and what is not. Perception vibrates on the strings of harmony—Truth, Beauty, Goodness.

**I perceive:**

1. That I am indwelt by the spirit of the Father—the presence of my **Thought Adjuster**.
2. That I am enlightened by the spirit of the Creator Son—the **Spirit of Truth**. My perception that my spiritual direction, the spiritual decisions I make and that direct me are true.
3. That I am guided by the Mother Spirit circuits of our universe—the **adjutant mind spirits** and the **Holy Spirit**, and by the Mother Spirit personalities who accompany me and whose guidance I can perceive—my **guardian angels**.

It is because we perceive the spiritual life within us that it can and does grow.

My perceptions: I asked myself; what is the most beautiful thing that has happened to me? It is to have perceived, to have realized that I am a child of God, a son of God by faith. This is a spiritual meaning to my perception.

Spiritual growth: It is something internal and personal. I grow with the help of the spirit that inhabits me.

I am already on the road to eternity. The awareness I have of it, I live it in the present moment. My perception is that eternity is that, quite simply, the present moment.

Why was The Urantia Book given to us? To expand our cosmic consciousness and heighten our spiritual perception. We have with The Urantia Book a personal tool that is the final revelation of truth to the humans of earth.

I am connected to life through the flesh—through my physical body. My human nature and consciousness have their origin in God, in his plan of creation.

I am a man, a child of time. I am currently living my cosmic youth as a conscious being of the universe. Through The Urantia Book and the teachings of Jesus, I have discovered religion. The religion of personal spiritual experience.

The teachings of The Urantia Book inspire me and guide my steps. I live with the determination to put them into practice.

This is how I thought I would set the table for our discussions and exchanges this afternoon.

We are the children of time. We are born on earth as a baby and become a child of time. We will grow and evolve as sons and daughters of God by faith until fusion with our Thought Adjuster. After fusion, after receiving our everlasting name from our seraphic guardians, we become ascending sons and daughters of God. It then becomes certain that our journey will take us to Paradise and beyond.

> “_Fusion with a fragment of the Universal Father is equivalent to a divine validation of eventual Paradise attainment, and such Adjuster-fused mortals are the only class of human beings who all traverse the Havona circuits and find God on Paradise. To the Adjuster-fused mortal the career of universal service is wide open. What dignity of destiny and glory of attainment await every one of you!_” (<a id="a285_401"></a>[UB 40:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p7_5))

So. What I perceive is that I am aware of living here on Urantia the awakening of my consciousness. I realize that I am living the experience of my human life and that it is the beginning of my great cosmic adventure. Of the great journey towards Paradise. My guiding thread that connects me to God is faith. My way of achieving this is to do his will to become like him. I am aware; I perceive that we are currently living our cosmic youth. Our souls are waiting at the gates of morontia life. Through our life experiences, we are aware of this, we take full advantage of it and, I said to myself that:

<p style="text-align:center;">
When we hold<br>
In his hands<br>
This wealth<br>
To have life and the future<br>
Full of promises<br>
We can live in joy<br>
Our youth<br>
Because every moment<br>
From the present time<br>
Are important<br>
And, towards the future<br>
The spirit in us<br>
Transports us<br>
Loves us<br>
</p>

So, I've set my place for this afternoon's discussion table.

Gaétan will now tell us about the time frame of the judgment of Lucifer's rebellion.

This afternoon we will discuss together with Marc Belleau this dynamic of perceptions and spiritual growth.

This activity allows several readers of different levels of understanding to share and study together the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. It promotes spiritual progress by allowing its participants to find practical applications of the teachings of The Urantia Book in their daily lives. This important practice helps to maintain a broad perspective on concepts of truth.

**To submit your articles:**

**Add:** Your <ins>name</ins> and <ins>city of residence</ins>.

**Warning :**

All submissions of articles or otherwise become the property of the journal and none will be returned.

We do not guarantee that all articles in our possession will be published in the next Réflectivité.

For the sake of fairness, we operate on a first-come, first-published basis. There is one exception to this rule: if I receive an article that discusses _recent_, past, or future events, it will be given priority over all others.

We reserve the right to edit articles for the benefit of the readership. However, in certain specific cases, these changes will be submitted to the author concerned for final approval before publication.

Any interpretation, opinion, conclusion or artistic representation, stated or implied, are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinion and views of the UAI or national and local level associations.
