Hello readers and friends of the association,

In my previous message, I alluded to the confused and uncertain situation in which our world finds itself. I offered us tools and means made available to us by the Urantia Association of Quebec to help and support us in fulfilling our duty, that of shining the spiritual light among those who seek the voice of wisdom, love and truth.

A new way has been available since March 1st to help us share the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. A course called **The Ministry of the Master**, offered by **The Ambassador School**, will provide a correspondence to the way Jesus taught and shared the truth. More information can be found in the **EDUCATION** section of our website.

Another tool I often talk about is study groups. Don't judge me too harshly, but I still struggle to understand why there are so many readers who are not in a study group or who do not start one? The revelators have made it clear to us that we need to create thousands of study groups around the world in order to simply and wisely integrate and disseminate the teachings of _The Urantia Book_.

The Urantia Association International, through our website, provides us with a guide to help us create and manage a study group. The AUQ has a list of in-person and virtual study groups, available to interested readers. Also, an international website sponsored by Urantia Foundation, the Association and the Fellowship, translated into several languages, including French, offers a wide variety of study groups around the world and is open to all.

There are numerous articles, testimonies, and seminars available on the elaboration of the intellectual and spiritual benefits and benefits that study groups offer to readers of The Urantia Book in our world. Today, more than sixty years after its publication and millions of copies sold, there are no more than five hundred study groups. This is a deplorable situation, if I may say so, considering all that has been made available to facilitate the access to and establishment of study groups.

Are we so comfortable in our material lives that the spiritual aspect and purpose of our existence completely escapes us? What will it take to wake us up? Recently I attended a meeting organized by readers from Colombia who are very enthusiastic about study groups. They are organizing a training for the creation and facilitation of study groups, and have about sixty readers interested in this training. In Quebec, several years ago, a similar meeting was organized and we had difficulty gathering more than twenty readers. In our province of Quebec, about three hundred _Urantia Books_ are sold each year, not counting the downloaded versions, and this has been the case for several decades. Where are all these readers?

It is said that the discovery of the Truth frees us from many things, starting with our ignorance, not only does it free us from many things, but it offers us a new way of living and also invites us to share it. The Truth with a capital T, not only illuminates us, but invests us with a new responsibility, that of making it shine. Let us remember the words of the Master:
<br style="clear:both;"/>

> “_*“You are the salt of the earth, salt with a saving savor. But if this salt has lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted? It is henceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men.”*_” (<a id="a43_219"></a>[UB 140:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p4_2))

> “_*“You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it gives light to all who are in the house. Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and be led to glorify your Father who is in heaven.”*_” (<a id="a45_327"></a>[UB 140:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p4_4))

These two quotes have encouraged me and continue to support me as we face the adversity and ignorance of today's world. We, the student-readers of _The Urantia Book_, have a great responsibility; much has been given to us, it is up to us to give back what we have been so abundantly given. If you do not know how to do so, join a study group, participate in online courses, attend conferences organized by our association, and visit our website for more information on how to serve the Revelation.

## Death of Jacqueline Harvey

_Normand Laperle_
Lévis

On February 2, 2022, at the age of 85, Jacqueline Harvey went to follow her path to the Father in another world. For those who did not know her, she was the wife of the late Alcide Paradis. She lived in Sainte-Foy, Quebec and is survived by two children and two grandchildren.

We knew her as one of the pioneers who actively contributed to the dissemination of the _Urantia Book_ in Quebec. As for me, my very first experience of reading the _Urantia Book_ in a study group was at her home.

Since Alcide's passing, she has been known as someone who was involved locally with her own study group.

In her private life, she also occupied her free time as a painter and her paintings were sold continuously at the Château Frontenac in Quebec. She was also an experienced pianist in classical music.

I will always have a very good memory of his presence among us. I anticipate the day when we will meet again somewhere on the ascending paths of the universe.

See you soon Jacqueline...

## The human being and his spiritual development

_Pierre Bellavance_
Sherbrooke

When I first read _The Urantia Book_, I was pleasantly surprised by the place and destiny of man in God's universal plan. Coming from a Catholic background, where man prays and fears God and suddenly finds himself after his death in heaven in the presence of God, I was impressed to see that a very long career of spiritual ancestry awaited me in order to prepare me to meet God. Having a strong interest in psychology, I wanted to better understand what a human being is according to _The Urantia Book_ and how his psychological development can be harmonized and better meet his spiritual aspirations. In this research, I borrowed certain concepts from humanistic psychology to enhance them with the concepts of Truth, Beauty and Goodness dear to _The Urantia Book_. This research work is an essay that commits only me. It is a reflection that has helped me to better understand the sometimes very complex concepts surrounding the human being and to better guide my own approach to earthly happiness taking into account my future universal and eternal cruise towards my heavenly Father. May the reading of this humble reflection bring you more understanding and love for yourselves and illuminate your earthly steps with a light of hope and joy.

Fraternally,

## Understanding and following Jesus in a living way

Personal inspiration of a day:

For those who want to believe in a creator God and have the “certainty” of survival after this life, it is true that Jesus' teaching or philosophy of life is very, very simple.

It is not necessary to know how to read or write to understand and follow Jesus in a living way.

We must love the Creator God and his creatures, replace hatred with love and anger with kindness (To Love is to Serve).

We must live the golden rule: “Treat others as you want to be treated.”

To communicate, commune, pray, meditate, worship sincerely with God, live in the awareness or conscious presence of God.

We must have faith and above all “total trust in Jesus Himself”, remember Him and follow His teachings (No one goes to the Father except through Me).

We must forgive freely and remain firm in personal disinterest (it is for God and for the well-being of our neighbor that we act, the actions are ours and the consequences are those of God).

Personally, I think that's more or less what it's all about: “following Jesus.”

These are the fundamental and universal principles on which one must live; the basis or the simple foundation. (No need for a big speech).

When this is realized, the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ can greatly clarify our thinking and keep the spiritual flame burning in spiritual attainment.

“You must give in order to receive” is a functional and living law.

One thing that is becoming increasingly clear to me is that we should not confuse “intellectual excitement” with “spiritual fulfillment.”

Especially with a “high-tech” book like ***The Urantia Book***, we can spend our lives addicted to intellectual excitement without ever having tasted the flavor of spiritual fulfillment that needs to be experienced!

This is a danger that at the end of our earthly life can become a heavy regret for some (especially in the awareness of the sterile and useless loss of time for the growth of the soul and the joy of living life to the full).

## Conference: Science vs Religion

**Sunday March 6, 2022**

***Richard Lachance***

We will examine the state of affairs on the current debates among the most prominent scientists adhering to vs. opposing the proof of God, “Intelligent Design”, creationism vs. evolution.

We will discuss atheism and agnosticism, the example of Lucifer, the problem of pride, and the triumph of faith in a personal God.

We will then examine the current understanding of the structure of the large-scale universe according to cosmological hypotheses based on ***The Urantia Book*** in light of the latest scientific discoveries.

Suggested reading: Booklets 100 to 103; and more particularly, to whet your appetite <a id="a142_85"></a>[[UB 101:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p2_11)], <a id="a142_134"></a>[[UB 103:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p8_4)], <a id="a142_181"></a>[[UB 103:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p8_5)], <a id="a142_228"></a>[[UB 103:8.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p8_2)], <a id="a142_275"></a>[[UB 132:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p2_4)]
