Hello readers and friends of the association,

I hope your summer was full, that you took full advantage of your vacation, the good weather, the rain, nature and the different activities that allowed you to appreciate God's kindness to us. There is a spiritual activity that we can practice every day and at any time of the day, gratitude.

I often find that gratitude is the gateway to worship and leads me to a greater appreciation of everything around me. For several years I have been interested in the beneficial effect that gratitude has on me, and since then, I have noticed that more and more I perceive the goodness of God even in the smallest details of my life which fills me with more gratitude and love for our Heavenly Father.

I also find that gratitude contributes greatly to the appreciation of my brothers and sisters in the Spirit. It proves to be a valuable asset in allowing me to appreciate and deepen my relationship as a son to my Heavenly Father while bringing more into my mind the responsibilities in establishing human brotherhood in cooperation with the Supreme Being. One cannot be a son of God without promoting human spiritual brotherhood.

I invite you to this practice of gratitude. In association with prayer it is a wonderful antidote to make us more grateful and gently invite us to worship. This practice has the advantage of supporting us in the difficult moments of our life. It contributes greatly to improving my attitude towards the difficulties of life. Just as one of my friends likes to say, 'difficulties are life lessons' so let's take the time to appreciate them.

The wonderful thing is that God has given us all the spiritual means to evolve and progress in the universe and these means are so simple and natural that we often look elsewhere for what we have inside us. Do we take the time each day to collect ourselves in silence and dialogue with our heavenly Father? Do we begin our day by renewing our will to do the divine will? Do we take the time each day to thank God for having him in our lives? Do we pray each day that there will be more men who enter into a sincere relationship with God?

The Urantia Association of Quebec provides you with a daily meditation that is sent every morning by email to those who register. What better way to start your day than by adhering to a spiritual meditation. You can register and receive this daily meditation by following this link: https:// www.urantia-quebec.ca/publications/meditation-du-jour-2 .

Hoping that you appreciate the efforts of the association to contribute to your welfare and spiritual growth. It must be remembered that the spiritual work of advancing the truth and teachings of The Urantia Book is the responsibility of all readers. As our Master was fond of saying, to whom much is given, much will be required.

To love is to serve

## Picnic for the feast of Jesus

As every year, the AUQ organized a picnic meeting for the feast of Jesus on August 21 in the beautiful Mount Royal Park near Beaver Lake in Montreal.

Except that this year we saw each other again after two years of interruption due to the health measures imposed.

We were 15 enthusiastic people, happy to meet up in a wonderful atmosphere of camaraderie.

Gaétan Charland, our president, spoke to us about Jesus, his birth and the mission of his life of incarnation on our world.

Jesus revealed God to us as his Father and our Father. This revelation of God's fatherhood has as a corollary that we are all his children and because of this, we can realize human brotherhood which is the goal of humanity's spiritual growth.

Furthermore, he taught us that God lives in us as spirit and that to realize this presence is to be born of spirit.

I also spoke about the life of Jesus and the immense gift he left us after his departure: the Spirit of Truth who is present in us to guide us, like the spirit of his Father, our Thought Adjuster.

His time here helped to raise the level of spiritual consciousness of our humanity and freed us from the slavery of fear.

I remembered what he told us:

<figure id="Figure_5" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/Reflectivite/2022_09/002.jpg">
</figure>

> ““I have come into this world to do the will of my Father and to reveal his loving character to all mankind.” (<a id="a81_113"></a>[UB 143:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p1_4))

In this we can imitate Him and do as He who is the way, the truth and the life.

We ate together and discussed the living subjects that interest us.
A beautiful, ordinary Sunday to celebrate the birthday of an extraordinary person.

We each returned with light hearts and peace in our souls.

Until next year when we sincerely hope that many of you will come for a picnic to celebrate the Master's birthday.

## The paradox of the modern era

_Samuel Heine_
Reunion Island

This is the paradox of the modern era, we have never had so much time for ourselves and yet we often complain about not having enough time (we always want to go faster, supposedly due to lack of time). When we say going faster, we often mean doing things halfway, in a superficial way. It can also mean rarely going all the way to the end of what we want to achieve and this becomes over time “a bad habit that becomes commonplace” (a habit to avoid especially when we are young).

As my big brother Doudou once told me, “you have to know how to organize yourself in time.”

And I would add, let's not wait until we retire to decide to take time for ourselves and for things that are much more essential to our short lives.

There is also the psychological self-illusion of the chaining of time in our existence (young or old approaching physical death) which can be an illusory obstacle that leads us to say; I have failed in my life, I have wasted my life (we imprison ourselves)

This is truly a concrete realization for me these days. A result of the regular practice of deep reflection before each prayer (meditation).

And prayer allows us to emerge into silent and spiritual worship.

It is in these moments that consciousness accesses the world that awaits us (smile). It is a very transformative practice, it deserves to dedicate time to it.

## Presentation of UBIS courses for September 2022

Hello dear readers of your new newsletter Réflectivité!

For the third quarter of 2022, UBIS (Urantia Book International School) has made three courses available free of charge to its students in the institution's French-speaking department. These varied training courses are classified under three accessibility criteria: “basic”, “intermediate” or “advanced”.

The basic level course is entitled “**The Thought Adjuster—Our Passport to Eternity.**” It is the first part of a trilogy that will be offered by Agnes Lazar and Guy Perron. This course will be spread over a period of six weeks. As we all know, the concept of the Thought Adjuster is one of the most profound revelations that has been given to us, it is a study of the divine presence that dwells within us. Papers 107 and 108 will be studied.

The intermediate level course is called “**True Freedom.**” It will be offered by Michelle Heulot and Claude Barbaux. This course will be spread over a period of eight weeks. What is true freedom? This training will present us with the answer given by the revelators and especially that of our master, Jesus of Nazareth. Among the texts to be studied, there will be sections of fascicles 54, 100, 162, 194 and 195.

The advanced level course is called “**The Mind**”. It will be offered by your humble servant. This course will be spread over a period of ten weeks. We will see together what the mind is, its different manifestations, its characteristics and its possibilities. We will cover in this training all types of minds starting from the highest level, that of the paradisiacal deities, to the lowest level, that of men and animals. Among the texts to be studied, there will be sections of fascicles 6,9,16,36,112 and 116.

For further information, you can go to the following web address: https://www.urantia.org/fr/education/information-horaire-des-cours-et-inscription.

I would be happy to see in these classes many people that I have not seen for a long time partly because of the pandemic. We have in Quebec a large pool of people who have known this epochal revelation for many years. In addition to deepening the various subjects proposed, the experience and knowledge of these people comfortable with the concepts included in this revelation could greatly benefit the younger and less experienced during the weeks of discussions planned between all the speakers. All classes take place in a virtual classroom where you can participate at your leisure according to the schedule and time you have available. It would be a simple and pleasant way to give back to others what we have received so generously from our dear revelators!

So this is an appointment that I am launching for you for the registration scheduled for September 12, 2022!


## The School of Ambassadors

The Ministry of the Master course offers insightful means, knowledge and ways to better minister to those who believe and do not believe in God, and shed light on their belief.

Begin your journey to a successful Fifth Epochal Revelation outreach ministry by visiting

https://fr-school.thechristexperiment.org

and be one of those:

- Who “will dare to depend solely on Jesus and his incomparable teachings”; - who will be “exclusively devoted to the cause of humanity.”
- Who will devote themselves “exclusively to the spiritual regeneration of men”; and
- Who will “rapidly provide the necessary guidance and inspiration for the social, moral, economic and political reorganization of the world”!

This activity allows several readers of different levels of understanding to exchange and study together the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. It promotes spiritual progress by allowing its participants to find practical applications to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ in their daily lives. This important step helps to maintain a broad perspective on concepts of truth.
