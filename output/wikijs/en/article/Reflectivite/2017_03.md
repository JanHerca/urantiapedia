## Word from _the_ president

Line St-Pierre
AUQ President
president@urantiaqc.org

> “_There is simply nothing in all universal existence which can take the place of actual personal experience,. . ._” (<a id="a22_119"></a>[UB 22:9.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/22#p9_7))

Although my allegiance is to the God within me, I feel connected by membership in the Urantia Brotherhood, that worldwide family of students and readers who have sought the truth and found it. I feel particularly in harmony with the teachings contained in this book, which seem to me to be the most beautiful and enlightening in helping me live a fulfilling and meaningful life.

In our immediate circle, the Urantia Association of Quebec held its Annual General Meeting on February 11 and to fill the position of outgoing president Maurice Migneault, my husband Gaétan G. Charland proposed my candidacy to occupy the presidency.

For years I was made aware of the basics and functioning of the association by occupying the position of secretary, of the members' committee, of the communications committee, and of the women's committee with at my side a visionary man passionate about the 5th revelation, its teachings and its dissemination.

In <a id="a30_3"></a>[UB 84:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p1_9) we read “_...a man and a woman cooperating are, in most of their actions, far superior to two men or two women._” How much more interesting and stimulating can we as a couple coordinate our efforts in participating in the awakening and spiritual advancement of our brothers and sisters in God.

As a logical continuation of my journey and my progression, I therefore accepted to take up this challenge and to see new potentials and new service opportunities come to fruition in the next two years.

When I embraced this wonderful revelation 15 years ago, my responsibility was unequivocal, I was accountable to God and to the society that was calling me. How to participate in God's plan, how to share Him, I did not know yet, however, doors quickly opened to invite me to get involved here and there...

Let us wish each other beautiful invitations to respond to the real needs of our society by sharing with love and wisdom the teachings of The Urantia Book!

## Report — Annual General Meeting of the A.U.Q.

_Allain Nelson_
_Montreal_

It was on February 11th, at the Hotel le Dauphin in Drummondville, that the annual general meeting of the Urantia Association of Quebec was held. The number of thirty people, including twenty-six members in good standing of the A.U.Q., made up the room.

Several regions of the province were represented in the assembly, including Quebec, Outaouais, the Laurentians, greater Montreal, Montérégie and magnificent Beauce.

These administrative meeting days require the members of the A.U.Q. Board of Directors to submit its financial and executive reports and to update its mandates.

For our A.U.Q. this year, two mandates were expiring, that of the presidency and that of the treasury.

We can all say a huge thank you to Mr. Maurice Migneault for fulfilling his mandate as president and welcome with open arms **our new president: Ms. Line St-Pierre!!!**

And, as for the treasury mandate, it was renewed to our great satisfaction by Mr. Marc Belleau who accomplished a remarkable job.

Administratively, everything went according to plan. In addition, a new way to contribute to the financing of our Quebec Association was updated, without it costing us a penny more than your annual share as a member of the A.U.Q.

How? Through prepaid card purchases from participating merchants.

Want to know more? Well! Don't hesitate to contact our treasurer, Mr. Marc Belleau, he will be much better able to give you the details than I can... I even think he has a few cards available right now.

Well done and a fraternal thank you to all of you!!!

Now, the technicality being elaborated, let's add a grain of spirituality.

Yes, because at the end of the day, a moment was allocated for sharing. The topic: “Sense of belonging”.

A few people spoke, but time was running out. So through Réflectivité, let me tell you! ...from a personal experience:

**A.U.I. Congress, San Antonio, Texas.**

**The Man on Crutches**

Fortunately, the driver stopped directly in front of the door of the registration office, because by stepping out of the
van that picked me up at the airport, the hot air entered my lungs and suffocated me!! So what about the rays of the Texas sun? Burning!

Inside, several people are already present, but all busy with something. I could feel a certain excitement, but what exactly? Quite difficult to define!

My check-in completed, I feel really alone among a crowd of strangers all speaking English. I had to make myself useful for something, so that would serve as an entry for a first contact.

The man on crutches sitting on the ground appears in my field of vision. Without saying a word, I sit on the ground facing him. I took a bag, he raised his head and indicated to me what to put inside it without more or less, and this, without saying a word.

That's it!! This stranger had just included me in his circle.

From then on, I felt better. The man welcomed me, simply and without knowing anything about me.

**Lesson**: “Belonging” and team spirit arise from the will of each part, and only when they are unified in a common goal and working for the good of the whole.

## Réflectivité: (Statistics)

_Normand Laperle_
_Editor in Chief_

During 2016, we published 11 Reflectivities, including a special 8-page edition in March dedicated to Pierre Routhier. It alone contained 28 testimonies.

A Réflectivité always contains 4 pages. The last page is always dedicated entirely to the list of study groups and the penultimate page always contains announcements. Therefore, there are 2.5 pages left per Réflectivité for articles. This allows you to write, on average, 2700 words, or 7.5 columns (i.e. 360 words per column).

**Article length** (I only count the articles with development): A total of 33.5 pages of text were written in 2016. Average length of an article: 1.93 columns (700 words). The shortest article: 0.5 columns. The longest article: 6.26 columns (2 pages) written by Réal Demers.

**Total number of articles**: 36 articles in total. An average of 3.3 articles per Réflectivité, which is divided as follows: 5 activity reports (Visit, election, other). 15 philosophical. 1 announcement. 4 on study groups. 1 on the San Antonio, Texas convention. 1 tribute. 5 songs. 4 on the Urantia Association.

**Gender** (Articles): Men: 33 (91,66%). Women: 4 (11.11\%). Total articles: 36 (one article was of mixed source)

**Genre** (Writer): Men: 12 (75%). Women: 4(25%), Total Writers: 16

**List of people who have published**: Alain Nielsen, Brigitte Cave, Éric Tarissan, Gaétan G. Charland, Gilles Brien, Jean-Claude Lafrenière, Line St-Pierre, Marc Belleau, Maurice Migneault, Normand Laperle, Paul-Y van Deléglise \& Roberte Roussel, Réal Boucher, Réal Demers, Robert Cadieux, Rolande L. Martin, 84 years old.

## Study groups

_Gaétan G. Charland_
_Chairman of the UAI and AUQ Study Group Committee_
groupe.etude@urantiaqc.org

Hello Urantia Book Students,

There is a pressing need in this world for more study groups to assist “_The Urantia Book_” in its mission to “_expand cosmic consciousness and heighten spiritual perception_” (<a id="a142_177"></a>[UB 0:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p0_2)). But it is also necessary to keep in mind the objectives that study groups should have so that they may be an effective tool in the training of leaders and teachers and provide effective means by which we may learn to integrate the teachings of “The Urantia Book” into our daily lives.

In my own desire to increase the effectiveness of the study group I have hosted for many years, I have introduced many variations of reading and study so that the interest of new and old readers alike does not wane. Although I have not always been successful, I have learned many lessons that have helped keep the group engaging and rewarding all these years.

Our latest exploration and improvement, because we live in a country where the temperature may prevent some students from participating in the group, or for other reasons that do not allow some of them to travel, we have made the group available over the internet with the help of a video-conferencing program called “Zoom”. Please be aware that this is not an online study group, open to all where any reader from anywhere in the world can join us; for now, it is only open to the constant members of our group. However, on some occasions we have allowed other students to join us in order to satisfy their curiosity and see how it works.

For this experiment, the only thing needed is a computer with a camera and microphone or a tablet that can be set up near the area where the group is meeting and, of course, a subscription to “Zoom” which is not very expensive. I have a subscription that I could share with anyone interested in trying this adventure, if using it does not conflict with our group schedule. It is a great way to attract new members to your group, giving them a way to participate if they are too far away to travel to your group. It can also serve as a non-intimidating introduction for someone interested in attending a study group while staying at home.

In today's world, there is no reason why readers should not participate in a study group, as there are many ways to facilitate access. The Study Group Directory currently lists 76 virtual study groups in eleven different languages, as well as 368 regular study groups. The Study Group Directory Committee has introduced five languages (plus English) to the interface of this website, and a new interface and features will be added to this site soon. Your browser's default language is automatically displayed if it is supported, or you can select a language from a drop-down menu. If your group is not yet listed in the directory, please do so as soon as possible so that readers in your area or elsewhere can locate you.

As for younger readers, we are continuing to brainstorm how to help them start their own study groups or at least attract them to the ones that are available. The Study Group Committee is working on creating a survey that will be sent out soon to all readers in our database asking them a few questions about their interest and ideas about study groups, if you have any suggestions on what kind of questions we should ask, please let me know.

Enjoy your study group!

## “Inspiration of the moment” from our readers

Good morning,

I would like to start a new section in Réflectivité. A quote section. ***“Yours”*** **quotes** ***“to you”***.

Let me explain. Sometimes we have flashes of intelligence. A little bit of a sentence that comes to us out of nowhere; that “pops” into our heads, and sticks there for a while. It's like a bubble that rises from the unconscious and bursts in the conscious. The little bit of a sentence enlightens us. You perceive them as words of wisdom. In some way, they make you grow. Some people will write them down.

If you have any of these magic phrases? Send them to us. We might publish them.

We do not guarantee to publish them. We reserve the right to select them at our convenience.

They can be signed **or** anonymous. **They must come from you.**

---

Here are some collected from our readers. (They will not be signed):

- I have nothing to show to others, except to those who want to see themselves in me.
- Little by little, the bird builds its nest.
- Without action, there is no hope.
- Faith brings inner peace.


## Document to read
