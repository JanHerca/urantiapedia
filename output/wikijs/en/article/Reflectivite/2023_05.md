Hello members and friends of the association,

I assume that all of us are familiar with the famous quote from Jesus that he uttered at the ordination of the seventy: “_Truly the harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few_”. [UB 161:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/161#p1_3) In fact, it is not my custom to use quotes to highlight a specific point or situation, I do so today to emphasize that soon at the Annual General Meeting, the association will hold the election for the positions of President and Treasurer.

As every year, two positions on the association's board of directors are subject to election, and I am always disappointed to see the very few candidates who are proposed during these elections. I understand that the majority of the association's members do not like to take on the responsibilities of an administrative position, but it must be understood that without this organization that is your association, the revelation could not progress effectively in its mission here in Quebec.

## My thoughts on outdoor space levels

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">

_Jean Lapierre_
Bromont

Hello everyone,

Claude Flibotte wrote a very interesting article in the April 2023 issue of Réflectivité on the aggregates of matter in the levels of exterior space. He also mentioned that we will have to do service in this level of absonite space. We can ask ourselves when and under what conditions these exterior universes will be inhabited? Already, we know that there, all reality (physical, mental and spiritual) is, or will be transcended because these universes belong to absonite reality.

The purpose of my presentation is to try to understand this reality at the absonite level. This will not be easy because we are beings conditioned by time and space and in these external universes the transcendentals who will eventually live there are not independent of time and space (they are not absolute), but are not conditioned by it. It is interesting to note in Paper 12 (Section 3) that observations made by researchers from Uversa on gravity concluded that the action of physical gravity in the grand universe represented only a small fraction of the total gravity of the master universe. As for spiritual gravity, its action in the grand universe represented almost the totality of the supposed value of this spiritual gravity in the master universe. These two Observations on gravity coincide with what is revealed in ***The Urantia Book*** concerning the external universes.

_In winning souls for the Master, it is not the first mile of compulsion, duty, or convention that will transform man and his world, but rather the second mile of free service and liberty-loving devotion that betokens the Jesusonian reaching forth to grasp his brother in love and sweep him on under spiritual guidance toward the higher and divine goal of mortal existence._ [UB 195:10.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_5)

***The Urantia Book*** invites us to commune with the divine Spirit residing in our mind, to share our inner life with it, in order to give meaning and eternal value to our human career, thus generating the expansion of our soul. But what are the difficulties in setting up such a progressive evolution and how can we practically overcome them? Gilles Mauroy will share with us the relevance of the principles of NVC (Nonviolent Communication) to help transform mental poisons into fruits of the spirit.

Gilles was born in the south-east of France where he spent his adolescence mainly occupied by his studies and the practice of competitive alpine skiing. Between the ages of 13 and 17, despite his atheist education, Gilles became aware of the quest for eternal perfection as a meaning to his life. A few years later, _The Urantia Book_ invited itself into his life and has accompanied him ever since.

Gilles has a background and career as a scientific engineer. He is currently a logistics software consultant with expertise in demand forecasting and replenishment.

## Conference Sunday May 28, 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.

**THE INFINITE PAST AND THE ETERNAL WORLDS**

by _Éric Tarissan_

To participate in the meeting, click on the link below ten minutes before the 1 p.m. meeting.

https://usO2web.zoom.us/j/88544957302

A presentation of the First Age and the realities which constitute it and which were never created, since they have existed from all eternity.

Knowing that the divine Plan is a plan of endless progression, and that eternally we will never cease to discover the Infinite that are the Consciousness, the Truth and the Love of God, we will never finish broadening, deepening and enhancing our relationship with God, since even his personality is also Infinite.

By taking a short visit to the eternal past because, if there exists a **endless** destiny for us and for the universe in which we are, it is because on the contrary, realities take place which are, for their part, **without beginning**!

**Thanks to Jean Lapierre**

Before explaining the content of my thoughts, I would like to sincerely thank our brother and friend Jean Lapierre for his numerous written interventions in the form of emails following our discussions within our study group Le Pont. I would also like to thank him for his text entitled “_My thoughts on the exterior space levels_” published in this issue of the journal Réflectivité for the month of May 2023. Thanks to your great desire to understand the message of this fifth epochal revelation, Jean, you stimulate my mind and push me out of my comfort zone to seek to grasp all the facts, all the meanings and all the values of spirit contained in ***The Urantia Book***!

## The ideological struggle — Freedom vs license (part 3)

_Zshonette Reed_

As mentioned in previous articles, we believe that the ideological struggle humanity faces right now is the struggle between true and false freedom or liberty versus license.

Paper 54 of _The Urantia Book_ says this about freedom and license:

Of all the troubling problems arising from Lucifer's rebellion, none has caused more difficulty than the inability of immature evolutionary mortals to distinguish true freedom from false freedom. [UB 54:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p1_1)

A bit of history and context in retrospect. It was in the year 2000 that Line, my wife, Guy Perron and I went to New York to participate in a conference of the Urantia Association International. For me, it was a most important opportunity to meet an educator who had, according to an article published in the UAI Journal, taught over eight hundred people the teachings of the _Urantia Book_ with only one book. At that time, I had just started my first term as president of the AUQ and I was looking for someone with experience in education to teach others how to share the teachings of the _Urantia Book_.

As president of the AUQ, my mandate required me to pursue the spiritual mission of the association which is to disseminate the teachings of the Urantia Book, to create study groups and to train leaders and teachers. This is the reason that pushed me to meet this teacher, Moussa Ndiaye from Senegal. It was a most inspiring meeting which contributed to creating a deep fraternal and spiritual relationship with readers from Senegal. Upon returning from this congress, we rushed to organize the “Living Your Faith” congress and we took advantage of this opportunity to invite Moussa Ndiaye.

## Remembrance Dinner 2023

On Thursday, April 6, during the Remembrance Supper, I had the pleasure of meeting in person for the first time my brothers and sisters of our “Discovery” study group. For several years, I have had the privilege of exchanging with them each week on readings and reflections during meetings on the revelations of the _Urantia Book_. These friendly and fraternal exchanges have always been a great source of motivation for me, an invaluable support in my spiritual journey. I learn a lot there and my faith can only be greatly inspired by discerning in each member of the group, the constancy and the great sincerity of their approach. Of course, the technology allowing us to meet with Zoom was and still remains a privileged and very effective means of communication. It allows us to be present to each other despite the space that separates us. However, my meeting in person with the members of the fraternity brought out much stronger emotions in me. The initial embarrassment having dissipated, I was joyful and very happy to have the privilege of being there, present with them to experience a moment of intense interiority, a serious, real and profound communion of spirit. Gathered around a succulent meal, we prayed, we paused a few times and we gathered to reflect on the imperishable meaning of the last supper that Jesus took with his apostles, on Thursday, April 6, in the year 30. I cannot here pass over in silence the conscientious and careful preparation of the facilitator of our meeting, from which I quote here some extracts that marked our evening:

## Adjuster, absoluteness and fusion!

The origin of this text comes from an email exchange between several readers of The Urantia Book. We were wondering whether the Adjuster was an absolute entity before the fusion and whether he remained so after the event. In order to get a better idea of this question, it is interesting to consider the Adjuster before his fusion with his human subject, then after the fusion.

**The Adjuster before the merger**

Let's see together what a Thought Adjuster is. In quote [UB 107:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p1_2) it says: “_are undiluted and unmixed divinity, ***unqualified*** and unattenuated parts of Deity_.”

## Urantia and the rebellion

Hello everyone,

Our planet has experienced rebellion and the Adamic fault which caused many misfortunes. However, we are taught that the benefits which followed the rebellion weigh more in these positive effects? Here is a non-exhaustive list, perhaps you could find others?

This has helped to trinitize mortals who have resisted this rebellion and have become Mighty Messengers, and we know that they play an extremely important role, particularly at the headquarters of our superuniverse.

We are agondontaries and this inherent quality will remain for eternity in service.

## Fun game

Here is a fun game concocted by our friend André Pominville. It is a grid to complete entirely devoted to terms used in _The Urantia Book_. The letters are shared when the words cross.

The solution to this grid can be found on the following page. [_At the end of this page_]

Good luck, and have fun!

This month, the word grid will be inspired by three intuitive perceptions of the cosmic mind which help us to be rational (coherent, logical).

**Horizontal**

- 3\. the \_\_\_\_ is the technique that philosophy tries to use. [UB 101:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p2_2)
- 7\. Religion is the supreme gesture of man magnificently reaching towards the final reality, his \_\_\_\_ of finding God and being like him. [UB 196:3.30](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_30)
- 8\. Science also stabilizes philosophy by eliminating the \_\_\_\_ . [UB 81:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_10)
- 9\. the \_\_\_\_ is the method of religion [UB 101:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p2_2)
- 10\. the third endowment of the mind [UB 16:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_10)

**Vertical**

- 1\. the first endowment of the mind [UB 16:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_10)
- 2\. the \_\_\_\_ is the method (technique, editor's note) of science. [UB 101:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p2_2)
- 4\. the second endowment of the mind [UB 16:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_10)
- 5\. Philosophy is his attempt to \_\_\_\_ human experience. [UB 196:3.30](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_30)
- 6\. Science is man's \_\_\_\_ to solve the apparent enigmas of the material universe. [UB 196:3.30](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_30)

An editor's note is, in the written press, a note that a person inserts within a text of which he is not the author. This portion is then placed in an incision, followed or preceded by the acronym N.D.L.R., NDLR or ndlr, all separated from the original text by parentheses or brackets. The acronym “N.D.L.R.” is sometimes used in publications that are not newspapers (books or scientific works, in the margin or in a note), in an incision of a quote from another author who is named at the end of the quote. This same acronym can then be understood more as: “Note From the Reader-Editor”.

This activity allows several readers of different levels of understanding to exchange and study together the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. It promotes spiritual progress by allowing its participants to find practical applications to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ in their daily lives. This important approach allows us to keep a broad point of view on the concepts of truth. You wish to participate or form a study group; we will be happy to assist you. If you wish to have your study group appear in this list, contact the person in charge, via email association.urantia.quebec@gmail.com or at 450-565-3323.
