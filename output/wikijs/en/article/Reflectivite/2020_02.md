## Word from the President

_Line St-Pierre_
president@urantiaqc.org

The board members are considering developing a “***Statement of Faith***” that will allow any researcher who finds themselves on our website to clearly read the values to which we adhere and aspire.

We focus on the premise of the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man and the divine presence living in each individual.

At the **Annual General Meeting in St-Jérôme on April 4th**, there will be a brainstorming session in the afternoon. If you can't join us at that time and have an idea to submit to us, you are welcome to do so.

For ten years now, I have been interested in involving more women in the spiritual emancipation of other women, as women are the torchbearers of morality and spirituality. In 2013, I formed a group, the “Daughters of God” with three American women and every year since 2014, we have facilitated women's retreats and workshops at Urantia Foundation and wherever we are invited for the happiness and spiritual edification of women. The title of the retreats is “Dancing with God”. **I invite women from Quebec who speak English to join us and live this unique experience.** For more information, visit our website: www.sisterhoodcircle.net.

A first retreat will be held this year from March 26 to 29 in Boulder, Colorado and from September 10 to 13 at the Foundation in Chicago.

Urantia Association of Canada and the Fellowship will be teaming up from **July 28 to August 1, 2020** in the **Fraser Valley, British Columbia** for the Urantia Global Experience, themed “_LIFTING TOGETHERUNITED IN PURPOSE — SERVING GOD THE SUPREME_”. For more information, visit: https://www.urantiaglobalexperience.com.

The next “International Congress” will take place in the Sacred Valley of the Incas in Peru in April 2021. You refer to the Tidings on the website of the International Association at the following address for information and to register.

I wish you great discoveries!

## ERRATUM

An **error** has crept into the **last** “**Réflectivité \#331 January 2020**”, in the box “**Upcoming AUQ Activities**” on page 3.

Contrary to what is mentioned, **the AUQ Annual General Meeting** of **<ins>April 4, 2020</ins>** will **NOT be in Drummondville**.

She will instead be at the **Best Western Hotel, 420 Monseigneur-Dubois Blvd, Saint-Jérôme, Quebec, J7Y 3L8**.

Review the box on page 3 for correction and details.


> “_Jesus did not vehemently denounce even the Pharisees, as did John. He knew many of the scribes and Pharisees were honest of heart; he understood their enslaving bondage to religious traditions. Jesus laid great emphasis on “first making the tree good.” He impressed the three that he valued the whole life, not just a certain few special virtues._” (<a id="a51_354"></a>[UB 140:8.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_22))

## AUQ ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

_Robert Cadieux_
Montreal

**<ins>Call for applications</ins>**

This year, at our Annual General Meeting there will be an election for the positions of Vice President and Secretary.

**<ins>Job Description:</ins>**

**The Vice President** replaces the President and any other member of the Council as needed. Like the President, the Vice President of a local association liaises with other local associations and participates, as a voting member, in meetings of the national association.

**The Secretary** handles mail and takes minutes. He or she keeps the membership register, directs readers to study groups, and answers members' questions or delegates another person to answer them.

Any member in good standing wishing to submit his candidacy or to request more information, can do so now by e-mail to: secretaire@urantiaqc.org He can also wait until the “Annual General Meeting” to submit his candidacy directly on site, at the time of the vote.

## AUQ 2020 MEMBERSHIP

_Marc Belleau_
Your treasurer

Hello dear readers of the _Urantia Book_ and members of the AUQ.

I would like to remind you that it is time to renew your membership, if you have not done so yet. For those who have already sent their payment, a huge thank you!

Without your financial assistance, the AUQ cannot pursue its projects aimed at energizing the Urantia movement in Quebec, supporting the formation of study groups, or promoting the book and its teachings.

Several services are offered by your association, whether it is the organization of themes, the updating and maintenance of its website, the creation of supplementary literature or social activities allowing readers to meet and fraternize.

Membership, at a cost of $60 per year, gives you the right to vote at annual general meetings, the opportunity to hold a position on the board of directors and to sit on one or more committees. In addition, you automatically become a member of Urantia Association International. You will find more information on the AUQ website at the following address: http://urantia-quebec.ca/devenir_membre.php.

I would like to remind you that no tax receipt can be issued for the membership fee.

Have you considered making a donation to your association? No matter the amount, what matters is putting your shoulder to the wheel to help the AUQ accomplish its mission. It is also a good way to reduce what you pay annually to the government for the benefit of a cause you believe in.

In fact, donations are tax deductible. The AUQ sends a receipt to all donors every January, regardless of the amount of the donation. A little reminder, don't forget to update your address on our site at http://urantiaquebec.ca/modification_membre.php.

Would you like to see your donation go to a specific project? I suggest you support the PIRT (_Prisonner Inquiry Response Team_) program which aims to promote the _Urantia Book_ in Quebec prisons. Chris Gravel, one of the people in charge of this project, has already sent copies of the book to prisons in Quebec and Canada. To date, we have received 3 requests from inmates who want to receive their own book. You just have to send your donation by mail and write PIRT on your check; we will know that it must be used for this specific program. It costs about $45 to purchase and send the book, depending on where the book is sent.

You can also make your payment via the AUQ website on the http://urantia-quebec.ca/ home page; simply press the “_Donation to the Urantia Association of Quebec_” button. You will be redirected to the Association's PayPal website. You do not need to open an account to make the payment; a simple credit card will suffice. If none of these methods appeal to you, you can send a check to the Association's address.

A little reminder, don't forget our Annual General Meeting on April 4 in St-Jérôme. We look forward to seeing you there.

> “Forceful ambition, intelligent judgment, and seasoned wisdom are the essentials of material success. Leadership is dependent on natural ability, discretion, will power, and determination. Spiritual destiny is dependent on faith, love, and devotion to truth—hunger and thirst for righteousness—the wholehearted desire to find God and to be like him.” (<a id="a97_354"></a>[UB 156:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_7))

## Response to the text by Maurice Migneault published in the latest Réflectivité

_Claude Flibotte_
Sainte-Julie

Hello Maurice,

I read with great pleasure your text entitled “Reading between the lines” published in “_Réflectivité \#331 January 2020_”. What you state in your article exactly matches my point of view on how to approach the revelations made by our invisible friends. Certainly, they have given us a fantastic amount of new information and corrections of facts known to us over the millennia, however, it is up to us to think a little further, based on the data so graciously offered. Moreover, they greatly encourage us to do so in order to “_expand_ [our] _cosmic consciousness and enhance_ [our] _spiritual perception_” <a id="a106_609"></a>[UB 0:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p0_2). I encourage you to reread section four of booklet 101 entitled “_The limits of revelation_”. <a id="a106_743"></a>[UB 101:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p4_1)

> “_Today, and as you are, you must discern the invisible Maker through his manifold and diverse creation, as well as through the revelation and ministration of his Sons and their numerous subordinates._” (<a id="a108_206"></a>[UB 1:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p5_3))

I think that a thorough study of these texts should normally lead — for all people seeking the truth — to a multitude of questions that stimulate the mind, increase our perception of facts in the healthy search for new meanings to eventually lead to a greater spiritual perception. We have the duty to go beyond our animal tendency to seek ease in order to embrace the full light of truth and thus give the lie to the opinion of the revelators who tell us that there are very few true thinkers in this world!

> “_The slothful animal mind rebels at the effort required to wrestle with cosmic problem solving._” (<a id="a112_102"></a>[UB 100:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p4_2))

We must seize our courage with both hands and dare to think further because... “_true cosmic self-fulfillment results from self-identification with cosmic reality and with the finite cosmos of energy, mind and spirit, limited by space and conditioned by time._” <a id="a114_262"></a>[UB 94:11.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p11_6)

So, dear Urantians, let us take up this challenge to think freely in collaboration with our Thought Adjuster, the Spirit of Truth and all other spiritual influences to advance one more step forward this poor planet which needs it so much!

## History of the three audio documents about Urantia

_Claude Flibotte_
Sainte-Julie

The adventure of creating these documents began, I believe, in 2007.

At that time, I had learned that a certain Mr. Lachance from Quebec had hired a professional reader to record the fourth part of the “_Urantia Book_”, the life of Jesus. I found it unfortunate that the entire book was not thus put into audio format and I set myself the goal of producing the other three parts. So I formed a team of volunteers to carry out this task. Marc Belleau, Roselyne de Baets and Guy Vachon answered the call in addition to your humble servant. The late Alcide Paradis had the task of listening to the documents and pointing out pronunciation errors to me. My role at the beginning was to coordinate everyone, check the recordings, make corrections, improve the sound and produce a final document in mp3 format.

The complete production took three years of work and it was in 2009 that I proposed to the Urantia Foundation to include on their website this audio version of _The Urantia Book_.

After reading the two books by William S. Sadler Jr., I felt it was important to make them available in audio format as well. The two volumes produced in French by the AFLUB (_Association Francophone des Lecteurs du Livre d'Urantia_) were no longer available, so I asked Georges Michelson-Dupont for permission. Here I am again for another audio recording session. If my memory serves me right, I began this work in 2010. My good friend Marc Belleau generously committed himself with his beautiful voice and artistic talent to producing the recordings of [“_Une étude du maitre univers_ ”](/en/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/Study_of_the_Master_Universe). For my part, I tackled the recordings of [“_Appendices à une étude du maitre univers_ ”](/en/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/Appendices_to_Study_of_the_Master_Universe). This other adventure spanned several years and ended in December 2019.

Today, January 8, 2020, Tamara Strumfeld of Urantia Foundation wrote to me that the audio “Appendices” are now available on their website for download. They are also or will soon be available on the AUQ website in the “Book” section.

I consider that reading the Urantia Book is essential to understanding the revelations made to our world. However, to understand all the subtleties, in a human language closer to us, the two books by William S. Sadler Jr. are essential. Not only will these three audio documents be of great use to any blind person, but they will also be useful to all students who wish to take these audio books with them on a trip, in their vehicle or in the comfort of their living room on an audio system.

They constitute an additional medium to master the learning of these revelations in order to expand one's cosmic consciousness and enhance one's spiritual perception.

> “2. Few persons live up to the faith which they really have. Unreasoned fear is a master intellectual fraud practiced upon the evolving mortal soul.” (<a id="a137_153"></a>[UB 48:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_4))

This activity allows several readers of different levels of understanding to exchange and study together the teachings of The Urantia Book. It promotes spiritual progress by allowing its participants to find practical applications to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ in their daily lives. This important step helps to maintain a broad perspective on concepts of truth.
