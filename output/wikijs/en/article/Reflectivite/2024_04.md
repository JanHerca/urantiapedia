Dear members and friends of the association,

Just recently, I had the privilege of participating in a historic event in the journey of _The Urantia Book_ and its accessibility to one of the most populated regions of our planet. I attended the very first conference held for the yellow people in Taipei, Taiwan. This event marked the launch of the simplified Chinese edition of _The Urantia Book_. This translation, the result of an extraordinary work spanning over 12 years, finally saw the light of day thanks to the unwavering commitment of Richard Zhu, a Chinese native from China living in the United Kingdom.

## The Remembrance Supper — A worldwide meeting with the Master —

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/Reflectivite/2024_04/002.jpg">
</figure>

On the evening of April 6, A.D. 30, Jesus instituted a communal meal with his twelve apostles in the upstairs room of a friend's house, and asked them to celebrate this meal in remembrance of him as often as they wished. This supper became known as the Memorial Supper and is “the only ceremony or sacrament associated with his life's mission” on Urantia. ([UB 179:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_4))

About the Memorial Supper, here is what a Melchizedek wrote

Jesus did not ask his disciples to meet periodically to recite word combinations indicating their common beliefs. He only commanded that they meet to actually do something, to partake of the common supper in remembrance of his bestowal life on Urantia. ([UB 99:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p5_10))

Many students of _The Urantia Book_ regularly and periodically celebrate this Remembrance Day when they gather together. But what if all readers throughout the world were to commemorate the Remembrance Supper simultaneously or even asynchronously as a united “Urantia Family” on or about the anniversary of this occasion! What a show of solidarity and unity that would be for us and for our heavenly family who look down upon the little world of the Cross!

What if our annual commemoration of the Remembrance Dinner became a tradition!

Let us unite our community with one voice in remembrance of our Sovereign Master Son, Christ Michael of Nebadon. Let us show Him that we take His teachings to heart, that we deeply appreciate the flesh-and-blood life He lived here as Jesus of Nazareth, and that we rejoice in this new dispensation of freedom and grace.

For over ten years, more and more people have come together to celebrate April 6th together. You are invited to join the celebration this Saturday by gathering in a small, intimate group to celebrate the Remembrance Supper as a global family.

OR: Join one of the Zoom rooms that will be set up, in French, Spanish and English for those who are alone, so that you too can participate in the celebration.

A World Remembrance Dinner will be hosted by the Center for Unity at: 8:00 p.m. IDT (GMT/UTC+3) / 1:00 p.m. EDT / 10 a.m. PST

https://us02web.zoom.us/j/5735267683?pwd=NVNuWUQ5TVFXaGFnRXRaMGsrV3piZz09

Please feel free to share the attached invitation and/or create your own Zoom room to promote participation.

Prepare to join this Urantia celebration to honor “the united life of the Father and the Son in one gift.” ([UB 179:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_3))

Who knows where these little acts of worship and love for the Master might lead!

## Philanthropy — Urantia Fund 5th Revelation

Urantia, 5th revelation is an endowment fund that was opened with the Mouvement Desjardins. It was created by a reader of the _Urantia Book_ who wishes to remain anonymous. The deposit of $25,000 was made in June 2023 and should earn interest over the next few years depending on the stock market price. We would like to thank this generous donor who took the trouble to open this fund to which you can subscribe by visiting the Mouvement Desjardins Foundation website (see the address at the end of this text).

The endowment fund allows the invested capital to grow by generating interest that is paid annually to the AUQ, thus ensuring a minimum recurring income for the accomplishment of its mission. It is an intelligent way to ensure the sustainability of our organization. The Desjardins Foundation is responsible for managing the fund and sending tax receipts. The amounts are invested in SociéTerre action funds that comply with the rules of responsible investment. Investing in an endowment fund allows your donation to generate, over time, a much higher amount than the initial outlay. To contribute to this endowment fund, go to the following address: Make a donation - Desjardins Foundation ([jedonneenligne.org](jedonneenligne.org)).

## Spirituality — What an inspiration!

Right now, every morning, I read through a few pages of the life and teachings of Jesus in ***The Urantia Book***.

If we are looking for the highest, simplest practical path to our spiritual growth and fulfillment, for me it is this book.

I admire the life and teachings of Jesus, it is a “universal” teaching, undoubtedly the simplest and most balanced path.

Dear members,

You are cordially invited to attend the Annual General Meeting.

The members of the board of directors will present the actions carried out by the Urantia Association of Quebec in 2023 concerning the mission of the _Urantia Book_ and its projects for 2024.

**Agenda**

1. Opening of the Assembly
2. Reading and adoption of the agenda for May 5, 2024

10. Adjournment of the meeting

From 1:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., Gaétan Charland will present his conference: “Spiritual unity and us”, which will be followed by discussions and exchanges.

Although we have an idea of the definition of the word unity, we will explore the meanings of unity as spiritual, what it requires of us, lovers of this revelation, and how we can manifest this spiritual unity in our lives.

We will also examine why spiritual unity is fundamental to our organization and why, without it, organizational unity will not be achieved, which could compromise the success of our mission, the dissemination of _The Urantia Book_ and its wonderful teachings.

> ***In winning souls for the Master, it is not the first mile of compulsion, duty, or convention that will transform man and his world, but rather the second mile of free service and liberty-loving devotion that betokens the Jesusonian reaching forth to grasp his brother in love and sweep him on under spiritual guidance toward the higher and divine goal of mortal existence.*** ([UB 195:10.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_5))

Dear readers, you will certainly find this question asked by Aaron Michael and the answer given by a new artificial intelligence model, Claude Opus, interesting.

To compare the author's writing style and abilities, he asked the AI to analyze and compare the writing style of the introduction and first three papers of _The Urantia Book_ to that of Dr. William Sadler.

Here's what she says about it:

As we often tell you
The world is all about vibrations
We permeate your mind
From different songs

When we want to call you back
That life was given to you
In order to make the most of it

## Why did Jesus have to die in order to send us his Spirit of Truth?

Recently, in a study group, I asked this question, hoping, following the UBIS teaching method, to lead the participants to a deep personal reflection on this subject. Unfortunately, I obtained very little participation, most remaining silent, probably because the question caught them off guard.

One of the participants suggested that Jesus, who was the truth itself on earth, could only proclaim this truth to those in direct contact with him, but to extend the truth to everyone, he had to leave this world and return in spirit. In my eyes, this answer was not wrong, but it seemed to me to partially answer the question. It was also suggested that Jesus, by resuming his status as Michael of Nebadon, creator of his universe, by his return to the Father, had received additional powers allowing him to diffuse his Spirit of Truth on his creatures. Again, although I also agree with this, since Michael did indeed receive full authority over his universe following his seventh bestowal, this answer represented more a consequence of the completeness of his ministry than an explanation why he absolutely had to die to spread his spirit.

## Born again

<figure id="Figure_13" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Reflectivite/Jean_Lapierre.jpg">
</figure>

Being born again is about the inner life and it is a process of unification that gives us access to the divine Spirit that dwells within us. This inner revolution is always in progress and is highly personal to the person who experiences it.

Faith is paramount in this experience and the new meanings experienced are integrated into the experience of the one experiencing. This experience does not come through the senses, but through feeling. The Adjuster must, however, depend on the mind to express and realize himself. But, the individual has experienced this spiritual level reality in his soul and it is this experience that his consciousness feels instantly. This spiritual feeling becomes the proof of the believer having faith and this process becomes more intense with time but can never be brought as proof to his peers, because it is independent of any external reference.

This activity allows several readers of different levels of understanding to exchange and study together the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. It promotes spiritual progress by allowing its participants to find practical applications to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ in their daily lives. This important approach allows us to keep a broad point of view on the concepts of truth. You wish to participate or form a study group; we will be happy to assist you. If you wish to have your study group appear in this list, contact the person in charge, via email association.urantia.quebec@gmail.com or at 450-565-3323.
