## Word from the President

_Line St-Pierre_
_President_
president@urantiaqc.org

The pleasure of traveling is an interest that has been with me since I was very young. To know other cultures, to meet other peoples, other races, to observe their customs is a very enriching way of living and understanding my fellow men. Today I look at these experiences just as pleasant, but how differently.

This month, returning from New Mexico, where with 3 other women we were organizing our schedule of retreat activities and workshops that we will be leading in 2017 in the United States, I had a connection in Denver, Colorado. I was able to experience on many occasions during this trip, which took me 26 hours instead of 7 and a half hours, how to bring to light and practice these beautiful teachings that we are studying.

Since the strict measures have been implemented in airports, traveling by plane is what I dislike the most. Even though all these steps are necessary, including the endless waits between flights, going through security, going through customs, waiting for luggage, all this causes discomfort, anxiety and stress in most people. And what happens in these uncertain times, when people are stressed and sometimes panicked? They become irritated, and do not act reasonably, to say the least.

It was during this period of waiting and confusion, because of the storm that was raging in Montreal where all the Air Canada flights that were supposed to land there ended up in Toronto with thousands of passengers arriving from all destinations, either to stopover in Montreal or like me having Montreal as my final destination, that I intuitively began to share the practices of the teachings of The Urantia Book. I am certain that under the influence of the Thought Adjusters very good things are happening and we must tell ourselves this to become more aware. “_The act is ours, the consequences are God's._” <a id="a28_614"></a>[UB 117:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p5_5)

For a few hours, I had been waiting in a line of several hundred people to reschedule my flight for the next day, while elevator doors opened and about fifteen Haitians arriving from Port-au-Prince with all their enormous luggage in carts made their way through and passed by us to head off to who knows where! Offended Quebecers used quite insulting language about them. I turned around, smiled and offered my understanding of this supposed misunderstanding. I told them that these people being from a different culture than ours, in an unknown environment and without direction, specify that, if they were at least informed where to go, they would follow the course of things just like us. Well, the couple I spoke to intervened very kindly each time the elevator doors opened by indicating to the foreigners the direction to take.

From this experience I see how important it is as a student of revelation to help transform our society. The discontent and frustration of these people was gone and their idea of this situation changed their perception to see the how and why of others' actions. To speak, to offer a few words of comfort, to encourage, to help, to smile, to remain open to opportunities is simply the beginning of what we are asked to do with these teachings; to love and serve as we go along.

“_Love is the manifestation of the inner, divine life impulse. It is founded on understanding, fostered by selfless service, and accomplished in wisdom._” <a id="a34_155"></a>[UB 174:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p1_5)

## Support your association for the price of a stamp

_Marc Belleau_
_Treasurer_
Treasurer@urantiaqc.org

You now have the opportunity to financially support your association while doing your daily shopping. When you purchase prepaid cards on the Fundscrip website, the merchant from whom you purchase the card will donate a percentage of the sale to the Urantia Association of Quebec. There is no cost to you, except for the price of the stamp for receiving the prepaid cards by mail.

There are 234 participating retailers in Canada, including 119 in Quebec alone, including: Provigo, Metro, Super C, IGA, Maxi, Shell, Petro Canada, Irving, Ultramar, La Baie, Sears, Walmart, Best Buy, to name a few. You can consult the list on the Fundscrip website at the following address: http://www.fundscrip.com/detaillants. The website is simple and user-friendly to navigate. The instructions are clear and the service is reliable. Since November 2016, I have been paying for my groceries every week with these cards and I have had no problems. It is a simple way to support my association.

**The process is simple**. You register on the Fundscrip website and your file is created instantly; you order the cards from the retailers of your choice, you go to your bank's website and make a payment with the number given to you by Fundscrip; you will save this number in the list of your suppliers; it will be used each time you make a payment to Fundscrip. Once the payment is made, the cards are sent to you within a week (allow 3 business days). You just have to use these cards to pay for your purchases. It's that simple! You have to,

Of course, buying these cards regularly; that is where the key to the success of this fundraising tool lies. I will give you an example: I buy $500 per month in Provigo prepaid cards which, each time, give 3% of the purchase amount ($15) ; à la fin de l'année 2017, Provigo aura versé $180 to the Urantia Association of Quebec through me. Now, imagine if 10 members of the AUQ acted in the same way! That would be an amount of $1800 per year that would be injected into the association's projects without much effort.

You could sell these cards to family members or friends or give them as gifts; this is another way to introduce The Urantia Book into your community. Plus, you are forcing large corporations to give back to the community; this is a smart way to promote philanthropy in our society.

Since I presented Fundscrip at the Annual General Meeting held in February in Drummondville, about fifteen new members have registered. I sincerely hope that you will join this select group of individuals dedicated to supporting AUQ projects. If you need help registering or purchasing cards, please contact me at tresorier@urantiaqc.org and I will be happy to guide you.

## Meeting with a median

_Claude Flibotte_
_Sainte-Julie_

_[This text follows a creativity exercise requested during one of my trainings at the “Urantia Book Internet School” (UBIS in English) where I asked students to imagine their encounter with a medium._

***This exercise was intended*** _to make the revelations about our cousins the middlemen a little more real in their minds and also ***to create a climate of relaxation and pleasure in the creation of a short literary work*** in contrast to the serious study of the book. I will give you an example today.]_

To begin, I would like to thank each and every one of you who have taken the time to reflect on this possibility and I hope that it has offered you the tangible sensation of a reality to come! In response to my own questioning, here is my humble contribution to this cogitation.

**My encounter with a midwayer**

That afternoon, as was my custom, I went to the local library to undertake research on the midwayers revealed in The Urantia Book. I wanted to know if, in the history books, I would find some traces of their interventions in this world. Loaded with a pile of books, I had withdrawn to a secluded space where calm and solitude reigned. I was immersed in my research when suddenly, I felt the impression of being observed. Looking up, I saw a man of rather remarkable stature, standing on the opposite side of the room. How had I not noticed him when I entered earlier? Very tall, with blond hair almost red, of an age difficult to judge, but definitely adult, rather handsome, elegantly dressed, he was there, silent, and smiling at me. Recovering from my astonishment, I returned his smile accompanied by a respectful hello. It was then that he approached me and looking at my books open on the table, he started a conversation.

**Him**: I know that for a long time you have been trying to understand what midwayers are and their tasks on this world! If you wish, I could answer your questions.

**Me**: Ah, you know The Urantia Book, but how do you know that this subject is so close to my heart?

**Him**: Because I know you well and your persistent questioning about us, with the agreement of my superiors, prompted me to meet you.

Rather shaken because I suddenly realized.

**Me**: you... you... are...

**Him**: I am “d-e-f” the fifth at your service!

He declared, accompanied by a broad smile that most invited a frank camaraderie.

**Me**: So, you are what I think you are, a secondary midfielder?

**Him**: That's right. I am the fifth being descended from the third and fourth child with rather special gifts inherited from grandparents Adamson and Ratta.

**Me**: Wow! How come you're contacting me, and why me?

**Him**: Because you so ardently wished for it and so that I can give you a foretaste of what our future relations will be like when humanity is ripe for first global contact.

**Me**: Is it coming soon?

**Him**: Not really, but it depends only on you for this blessed day to arrive and for us to finally be able to reveal ourselves to you and work together, hand in hand, for the spiritual advancement of the planet.

**Me**: So what can I do to make this a reality?

**Him**: You are already doing it! The search for truth, sincere communion with your Thought Adjuster, and loving service to your fellowmen is all that is required of you. Many are already doing this, and when all humanity is in agreement with this way, first contact will be made.

**Me**: What advantages will we have in this contact?

**Him**: The entirety of our millennia-old knowledge will be at your disposal. I have existed for over 37,000 years and my primary midwayer brothers for over 500,000 years. Between us, as the United Midwayers of Urantia, we have a tremendous amount of life experience, knowledge and wisdom that awaits the blessed day of our union, we the midwayers and you our human cousins. Our medical knowledge will relieve your physical ailments. Our technological advances far exceed yours. We are in communication with personalities from all over the universe, our knowledge is vast on all levels. Our life experience can serve you as moral, psychological and spiritual aid. Our culture, far ahead of yours, will bring you answers about events of the past that will open the doors to the knowledge of what you really are and what you are called to. The angels envy you and would like to be in your place and dedicated to your eternal destiny.

When you realize the wonders of your personality in perfect accord with your divinity, the purpose of our Divine Father's command will have become a reality, to be perfect in your sphere of existence as He Himself is perfect in His. Now I must leave you, duty calls!

**Me**: But, will I see you again?

**Him**: If each of us does our duty, our paths will certainly cross again.

**Me**: What should I do now to make that blessed day come?

**Him**: Pass on to your brothers and sisters the message of our conversation and let each one respond as he or she pleases. I know that together we will succeed!

With these last words he disappeared from my sight, but his words remained forever in my mind and in my heart!

Sometimes we have flashes of intelligence. A little piece of a sentence that comes to us out of nowhere; that “pops” into our heads, and stays there for a while. It's like a bubble that rises from the unconscious and bursts in the conscious. The little piece of a sentence enlightens us. You perceive them as words of wisdom. In some way, they make us grow.

Some people will write them down. If you have any of these magic phrases? Send them to us. They have to come from you. We might publish them. \*

They can be “anonymous” or signed: your name, your initial, or a pseudonym of your choice.

\* **We do not guarantee to publish them. We reserve the right to select them according to our convenience**.


## Michael's Day 2017

As usual you will just have to follow the instructions with the **concentric circles**.

Bring your own food and chair.
