## You are the salt of the earth

FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, GAÉTAN AND I HAVE BEEN PREPARING FOR THIS LONG FORTY-TWO DAY TRIP TO MEET THE LEADERS OF OTHER URANTIA ASSOCIATIONS IN SOUTH AMERICA AND MAKE THEM TWO PRESENTATIONS, ONE ON THE MISSION OF THE URANTIA BOOK AND THE OTHER ON STUDY GROUPS AND THEIR IMPORTANCE.

We passed through 6 countries, including Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile and Peru. We changed currency 6 times, we experienced two earthquakes, the first in Chile of 5.9 and the second in Peru of a similar magnitude. The temperature varied during the day from 12 C. to 34 C. and for the food it was quite varied, it goes without saying. I was able to taste an incredible variety of fruits that I had never seen. Some tasty, others with a taste that I suppose you get used to after a while.

Gaétan has given presentations in 10 cities, Bogota, Baranquilla, Pereira, Medellín, São Paulo, Buenos Aires, Punta del Este, Santiago de Chile, Arequipa and Lima. Several chance meetings with readers and 15 planned meetings with groups — 5 means of transportation: plane, ferry, bus, taxi, trains, 17 flights and many hours of waiting in airports.

One common thread bound these people who were waiting for us in all these places we visited; that of the responsibility to share the teachings of The Urantia Book and the message of the fifth epochal revelation.

The old adage that we know and which can be summed up as: “Travel broadens the mind”, I firmly believe it. To get away from home and experience something other than what we know, another way of doing things than in our little corner of the country, becomes a very profitable adventure; the prospect of doing and letting others know broadens our minds and our scope of action. It allows us to adjust our way of acting, our know-how.

What a pleasure to know other cultures and other customs, to share our experiences of success and failure in the way of approaching people and disseminating the teachings. I have seen the work of committed couples shedding light in this world through different personal actions, by living the teachings and by being examples for their peers. This makes me think how much stronger as a couple we can together energize ourselves, stimulate ourselves, better understand the work we do and give meaning to our lives, since together we have a common goal, there is the blessing.

I met wonderful and courageous people, many women, of all ages, who were also as curious as I was to know what my activities were in Quebec in relation to the Fifth Revelation. We exchanged many hours, about our lives, our children, our couple, our birth of the spirit, the spiritual joys that manifested themselves during new encounters. All these human contacts inspire me to better serve God who is in the other. This awareness of God in women in particular, makes me appreciate even more the goodness of God in this sensitivity that we have.

Sharing one another's experiences strengthens others in their spirit and encourages each to want to continue serving with joy and enthusiasm. “_The God-knowing man describes his spiritual experiences, not to convince unbelievers, but for the edification and mutual satisfaction of believers._” <a id="a40_294"></a>[UB 1:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p6_6)

I have seen the loyalty of women in Peru and Chile doing projects together, either to educate young children or to teach work techniques based on the highest values. I have seen this need they have to want to do everything in their lives for the most important cause that exists at this time on the planet.

I have seen the wisdom of God through the actions of many, who also feel this urgency to live and teach the supreme values. In Colombia, more precisely in Pereira, 2 couples educate their 4 young boys of 5-6 and 10 years old so that they become the future leaders of the Urantia movement in their country. We stayed for four days with Jairo Franco Londono and his wife Maria Mercedez, their 10 year old son is quite remarkable; lively, intelligent, creative, he composed a story of several pages that seems like science fiction to his friends and teachers, but which deals with texts from the UB. For several years now, he has been following his father and attending the study group. The parents organize role-playing games with characters, Andon and Fonta, Adam and Eve. I observed the family values that are at the highest in their home. I appreciated their expertise with their children so much that sometimes I felt tears welling up as I witnessed the love they had for their children.

At the official meetings organized by each president of the association of the country visited, there were between 25 and 55 readers. At the beginning of the meeting, Gaétan asked the group leader to read booklet 140, 4th chapter, **VOSOTROS SOIS LA SAL DE LA TIERRA, VOUS ÊTES LE SEL DE LA TERRE**. It was read in a reverent manner and each time I sensed that the participants were inspired and so was I. I heard this text twelve times in Spanish and three times in Portuguese. Even if I did not fully understand the language, I felt the intensity with which it was shared. The more I heard it, the more I absorbed it. After each reading of this text Gaétan added: “_and if it is not you, who is it? And if it is not now, it will be when?_” This sentence often comes back to me since our return.

What a joy and what a privilege to have met so many personalities dedicated to bringing man a little closer to God and bringing God a little closer to man.

A journey strewn with blessings in relation to all these human and spiritual experiences lived with men and women, readers and non-readers.

## CONFIDENCES OF A STUDENT

I WAS ASKED TO WRITE A WORD FOR TIDINGS / RÉFLECTIVITÉ. I THANK THIS PERSON WHO DOES ME THE HONOR OF HAVING THIS CONFIDENCE IN ME.

I was asked to write a word for Tidings/Réflectivité. I thank this person who does me the honor of having this confidence in me.

It is impossible for me to describe The Urantia Book; the work is too majestic, too great, too extraordinary, and is the work of and the work of intelligences beyond my understanding. However, the teaching that I hold most dear is personal religion as taught by our beloved Sovereign Michael. This extraordinary and simple teaching is based on faith in sonship with the First Source and Center through the presence of our wonderful Adjuster. It is through goodwill that this daily faith is manifested; it is through goodwill that we come, with the absolute aid of our Adjuster, to do in all things the will of Our Father in Heaven. It is through goodwill that we experientially progress each day in this personal religion that has been so generously offered to us. This magnificent personal religion transcends all established evolutionary religions; ***it is free***! Free from established and stationary dogmas, free from external and unnecessary ceremonies, free from submission to outdated and outmoded teachings, free from the representations of idols and icons. We have received from the Father of us all this infinite gift: FREEDOM; and the marriage and present union which we can desire and make with our Adjuster assures us of the continuation of the grand adventure of the eternal life of love and service to and for the Creator of all things.

In daily application among many others, my goal is like yours, to bring other humans to enter the Kingdom.

Here is a story.

One rainy day I went into a shelter to wait for the bus, there was already a boy there. Having forgotten my watch, I asked him the time, he complied, but added comments about people who were always in a hurry and about the behavior of people in general, he continued by expressing the low level of esteem in which he held and inspired society. It was obvious that this boy was unhappy and tormented.

Without really knowing how or why, I asked him if he knew of a book called Urantia. He answered curtly that he only dealt with philosophy. I replied that the book I was talking about was much more than philosophy and even surpassed all known philosophy.

His astonishment seemed sublime to me. Perhaps I had just found an authentic seeker of truth.

At that moment the bus arrived, before boarding, I repeated to him: do not forget - Urantia. - He went to the back and I remained standing near the entrance. For a moment, I felt a heavy questioning look on me, yes, I was right, I turned my head slightly and he was looking at me with great intensity. We got off at the subway and melted into the crowd.

You see, I think of that boy from time to time and an inexplicable and curious smile of tenderness comes to me; because I am convinced within myself—and I want to believe it—that he has purchased the _Urantia Book_ and just like us, he has found what he was looking for and is bent with love and interest over the study of the revelation.

Winning a soul into the Kingdom is a wonderful thing.

At the moment and in the study of Revelation, I have finished booklet 187, tomorrow I will start 188.

Just like all of you, I felt an immense pain while studying this booklet. But with my spiritual journey, I refused to condemn and rebel. And this last sentence of booklet 187 proved me right:

> _Thus ended a day of tragedy and sorrow for a vast universe whose myriads of intelligences had shuddered at the shocking spectacle of the crucifixion of the human incarnation of their beloved Sovereign; they were stunned by this exhibition of mortal callousness and human perversity._ (<a id="a83_288"></a>[UB 187:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p6_3))

I end here, because I think I have exceeded the space allotted to me. But perhaps I will come back to you...

I leave you what I acquired with the revelation: my love and my tenderness.

Urantia Book Student

## TESTIMONY

I ALWAYS LOOK FORWARD TO THE JOURNAL, AS IT IS MY ONLY LINK TO THE GREAT URANTIA FAMILY. I AM 85 YEARS OLD, AND IT IS STILL NOT EASY TO FOLLOW YOU EVERYWHERE.

I came across The Urantia Book in 1982 and since then I have been reading it for half an hour every day (meditation). It is the greatest happiness of my life, a happiness that lasts, and so invigorating.

The Sky is Open for me and my family, there are 7 books in the family, because we are all so far from each other, still, I am happy to have introduced them to this book.

(LIVING WITH YOUR INNER BELIEFS)

The five colors blind the eye;

The five tones deafen the ear.

The five flavors dull the taste.

The chase and the chase drive people crazy.

Wasting energy on acquiring rare items slows down the growth of the individual.

Lemaître observes the world, but trusts his inner vision.

It allows things to come and go.

He prefers what's inside to what's outside.
