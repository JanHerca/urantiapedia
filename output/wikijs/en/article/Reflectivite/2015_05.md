## A word from the president

_Maurice Migneault_
_AUQ President_
urantiamaurice@gmail.com

The big event is fast approaching... I want to talk once again about the Urantia Association International Congress which we will be hosting this summer.

So far, I have had the chance to participate in two of these conferences: in Malaga, Spain, and in Medellín, Colombia. It is difficult to describe the richness of human experiences and friendships that we have the opportunity to live and create during these meetings. To better synthesize my thoughts, I thought I would choose quotes from “The Urantia Book” relating to the brotherhood of which we will be witnesses and actors.

## Why participate in the Lennoxville congress?

_Gilles Brien questions_
_Gaetan Charland._

For long-time UB readers, the upcoming international congress marks a first in the history of the Urantian movement in La Belle Province. This is the first time that such an event has taken place in Quebec. Gaétan Charland answered a series of questions for Réflectivité readers.

**Q1. Why is the congress a first?**

**R1**. This type of event occurs very rarely in the same country. And more and more national and regional associations are competing for the opportunity to host such an event. The next time a gathering of this type is held in Canada or Quebec may be many years away.

**Q2. Why is it important for a reader to be at the conference? What does it bring him/her?**

**R2**. Each conference provides a broader vision of the mission of the “_Urantia Book_” and its teachings. The one that will take place in Quebec explores how to experience the teachings of the Book in one's own life, in one's family, among children and among adults. Among the speakers, there will be long-time students of the “_Urantia Book_” who have professional training in education in various fields such as philosophy, psychology, communications and religion.

These experts will be giving presentations and workshops on topics that complement their lectures. In addition, the conference will feature the president and several trustees of the _Urantia Foundation_. This is a unique opportunity to meet and interact with these visitors and leaders. Not to be missed: Foundation President Mo Seigle will be leading a workshop on new generations.

**Q3. Can I bring my children or non-reading spouse?**

**R3**. The congress offers free registration for children under 13 years old, this includes accommodation, meals and a childcare service. However, children under 3 years old require special care that we will not be able to offer.

**Q4. What is the best experience to have at these congresses?**

**R4**. Meet people from all over the world and from different cultures, and make new friends. Explore new ideas and expand spiritual and intellectual horizons.

**Q5. How do you see the evolution of the Urantian movement in Quebec? What do you hope will be the results of this conference?**

**R5**. In Quebec, as in some South American countries, our religious culture has encouraged the acceptance of the “_Urantia Book_” by many people. I would even say thousands. Year after year, the number of “_Urantia Book_” sold in Quebec has remained constant, at an average of about 300 books sold each year. The number of study groups in Quebec per capita population is the highest in all countries where study groups are recorded. I believe that the future of the “_Urantia Book_” and its teachings will have a promising future in Quebec as long as these same readers respond to the impulse of divine guidance and become more deeply involved in this spiritual adventure. I believe that this conference can give Quebec readers the motivation and determination necessary to conquer the new generation that seems increasingly to be seeking material adventure and the endless quest for personal pleasure.

### As a conclusion

Gaétan Charland invites all readers from Quebec and Canada, past and present readers, dormant readers and crusading readers, to join the international gathering in Sherbrooke (Lennoxville) from July 30 to August 2.

If you are wondering whether you should attend this conference, if you are asking yourself the question, it is because the answer is hidden in the question... It is like asking yourself the question when you are hesitating: should we turn on the light? When you ask yourself this kind of question, it is because it is dark enough to make light.

## “Hospitality Service” for Urantia International Congress 2015

_Gilles Bertrand_
_Quebec_

Dear readers,

As you probably read in a letter from the _A.U.Q._ recently, Gaétan Charland took this opportunity to elaborate on a new service for members who will be visiting the congress in Lennoxville, Quebec.

The _hospitality service_ of which I am simply the coordinator, is therefore requesting the participation of our readers from Quebec. We Quebecers will have the honor of offering lodging for a period outside of the conference hours. The generosity of the hosts who will offer free lodging and breakfast in the style of a ‘_gîte du passant_’ (B & B) is quite appropriate. For the rest (lunch, dinner and tourism), it will be at the expense of the visitors.

If there are enough offers to meet the demand, the program will work ideally. At the moment, there are many more requests for accommodation than there are available hosts. We are continuing to try to fill the gap right now. Increased participation in the “hospitality service” program is therefore fraternally reminded to you. The demand is high and English-speaking hosts are even more highly appreciated, because the Dutch and Malawians, for example, are much more comfortable with English vocabulary. Quebec is predominantly French-speaking and this trend continues among our hosts. However, an experience with another linguistic culture would perhaps be just as interesting to try out, what do you think? Are you ready to open your home wide?

If you feel like it, write to me.

Finally, $j$ I would like to remind you of this passage where Jesus speaks to Ganid that:

> “_To become acquainted with one’s brothers and sisters, to know their problems and to learn to love them, is the supreme experience of living.”_” (<a id="a118_149"></a>[UB 130:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p2_6))

I hope that this invitation, this solicitation, will make you aware of the near urgency of this particular need. I therefore await with good grace your generous offers of accommodation and hospitality.

Gilles Bertrand, coordinator of the _Hospitality Service_ within the framework of the _Urantia International Congress_ in July 2015.

## International Congress 1993 — International Congress 2015

_Louise Sauve_
_Ormstown_

Memories of a past that come to join a reality to come through this other congress which is at our feet!

Already 23 years ago, a worldwide gathering of readers of the “_Urantia Book_” was being planned in our beautiful province. A historical fact where brotherhood, friendship, love, the meeting of the other, my brother my sister coming from this other elsewhere to share a common ideal, the same great feeling of spiritual love towards the same Divine Father Celestial as interior!

A prayer, a meditation, an adoration where there was only one soul, one heart, one spirit in this great brotherhood whose center was occupied by this Divine Presence of the master, of our dear Michael and of our dear Father.

Love one another as I have loved you. They were there, the Father and the Son in our midst and in each of us! What spiritual joy and what Divine Happiness!

My friends, will we be there again to live again at this gathering what the Father and the Son ask of us? When you are gathered in my name in our name, I will be in the midst of you all!

I write this in the name of the call of our soul which wants to gather in the folds of our uniqueness the marvelous memories of a brotherhood always more and more in the making.

Thank you for reading me. $\square$

## Prayer

This is the prayer we say at the beginning of each of our reading sessions at “La Maisonia”, Quebec.

O Master of the Universe.

May the reign of divine love,
of truth and wisdom,
be established in me as in all beings.

Help me to understand and do your will
so that all those around me,
be helped by your power in me.

## Did you know that?

**Every time you buy a “Urantia Book” (and others)** through the AUQ website, you arrive at Amazon, and the latter returns a small percentage (3 to 4%) of the amount of your purchase to the Urantia Association simply because you went through the AUQ website to get to Amazon.

Pass this on to all your friends who want to buy one of these books.
