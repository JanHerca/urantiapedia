Hello readers and friends of the association,

At the end of the year, some people take stock of the things they have accomplished in order to assess the progress they have made in their search to better serve the human brotherhood. As a student of the fifth revelation, it is important to set spiritual goals if one is to progress in achieving a greater awareness of God.

Booklet 196 tells us this:

## Equity and eco-responsibility

_Marc Belleau_
Montreal

Did you follow the COP27 conference? I am talking about the United Nations conference on climate change held in Egypt in November 2022. Among other things, we discussed the importance of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and therefore our dependence on oil in order to achieve the 1.5°C reduction target by 2030. It emerged that the Royal Bank of Canada is among the companies that support and invest in highly polluting fossil fuels (see the hyperlink at the end of the text). The AUQ uses the services of this institution for its financial transactions. In light of this new data, the members of the Board of Directors, in an effort to align the actions of the AUQ with its spiritual mission, decided to close its account at the Royal Bank of Canada to open one with a Desjardins caisse.

Learning to better communicate and disseminate your knowledge of _The Urantia Book_ to reach people without offending them, giving just enough to interest them, is what you will learn in the course The Ministry of the Master.

It is offered free of charge on the internet; the training is self-taught and each lesson is approximately 30 minutes. You listen lesson after lesson and you will be amazed to see how this course is enriched with methods and techniques of ministry taught by Jesus to his apostles and disciples. And this to better share and increase among our brothers their knowledge of God, Jesus and the truths contained in ***The Urantia Book***.

Click on the REGISTER link and make a difference in your approach to others.

## Planning and schedule of events for 2023

Like every year, I ask book students to present a conference to us, often on a theme that they have chosen to enhance the understanding of the subject and spiritually edify the audience.

If you would like to present the fruit of a work relating to a theme contained in ***The Urantia Book***, contact me at this email address.

communication@urantiaqc.org

On February 26, Amsata Fall from France chose to present her conference to us,

**In the service of the Master-Son, of our Mother the Divine Minister and for the Glory of the Heavenly Father**

On March 19, _Gaétan Charland_ will present his conference entitled

**Luciferian thought, revelation and us.**

April 30 Moustapha Ndiaye from Senegal (theme to come)

The **Annual General Meeting** will take place on May 6, possibly in person.

We will notify you in a future edition of Réflectivité.

August 20, the **picnic for the feast of Jesus** on Mount Royal

All activities are published on the website and further confirmations are awaiting from presenters for the fall.

## In tune with revelation

_Gilles Bertrand_ (retired police officer)
Quebec

During an exceptionally hot summer, in this decade of 1990, I had a lot of difficulty falling asleep. It is true that on this mid-August afternoon, the children of the neighborhood were having fun cooling off noisily in the swimming pool next door. In my bedroom, despite the curtain being tightly closed, the 3 p.m. sun managed to penetrate inside even without having given it my express invitation. Despite everything, a certain rest was granted to me. Of course, you surely know that multiple schedules are the usual frequency of a cop, whose night shift, this infernal week, happens to him periodically and the latter must manage this recurring problem himself and this was precisely my case.

## The Jewish mentality, Jesus, and us in the 21st century!

_Claude Flibotte_
Sainte-Julie

As a reader of _The Urantia Book_, we do this with our 21st century mindset, but what about Jesus' apostles and the Jewish population in general. When Jesus asked his apostles, “_But who do you say that I am?_” Simon Peter replied, “_You are the Deliverer, the Son of the living God._” A statement immediately endorsed by the rest of the apostles (<a id="a126_348"></a>[UB 157:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p3_5)). What can we deduce from this statement by Peter?

**The Jewish mentality of that time**

Being a Jew of that time is probably very different from being a Jew today. At that time, science practically did not exist. Astronomy had been studied by different peoples, but was mainly the preserve of a certain intellectual elite. The people were more into astrology and other magical beliefs. Philosophy and mathematics were more of a Greek specialty. The strong point of the Jews lay in their religious beliefs instilled from a young age with its multiple rules and dogmas imposed by their religious leaders.

Hello readers of your journal Réflectivité,

This month, I would like to talk to you about our study group **“Le Pont”**. This study group originated from the idea that the late Guy Vachon had to bring together readers of _The Urantia Book_ at his home, several years ago, for a study of this fifth revelation. Having learned of this study group on the South Shore of Montreal, I joined them for a few years.

As this group had become quite large in terms of participation, it had smaller ones and two subgroups were then formed, one heading towards Montreal, and the other became the group “Les estudiantins”, the group that I started at that time in Saint-Basile-le-Grand. This lasted for a few years, then due to a lack of participants, and following the death of my partner, I put the group into dormancy.

## The effort of the Revealers

_Samuel Heine_
Reunion Island

In my complete, annual rereading of _The Urantia Book_, which began in January of this year, I have reached Paper 48.

What I find extraordinary is that the revelators make an enormous effort to adapt what they think, perceive and feel to our earthly or human way of thinking, perceiving, feeling in order to bring us to an understanding of the life of the spirit and the often unconscious interactions or supports from which we already benefit in our earthly course of life. I think that is why

It has been part of God's plan from the beginning that we be accompanied very early on to the worlds of creation.

We do not realize the enormous momentum and energy that is put into human consciousness.

We are between two worlds and what separates us is as thin as a razor blade (if I may say so). The angels are very close to us!

Happy holidays my brothers and sisters, the adventure has only just begun, the best is ahead of us, beyond us, within ourselves... :kissing_heart: :raising_hand: :thumbsup: :heartbeat: :pray:


## Departure for Maisonnia

### Death of Yvon Belle-Isle

_The Réflectivité Team_

It is with sadness that we learned of the death of Yvon Belle-Isle, husband of Irène Belle-Isle, née Dicaire. He left us peacefully, surrounded by his loved ones on November 23, 2022 at the age of 78.

In addition to his wife, he is survived by his children, Lynne, Charles and Jean and four grandchildren.

His funeral service took place on December 9 at the Chute-à-Blondeau Community Center in Ontario.

He died from bile duct cancer, with metastases to the liver and lungs, which took his life less than three months after his diagnosis. He remained calm and told his loved ones that he wanted to live his death well.

Yvon has been well known in the Urantia movement during theme days and events. He was at the reception with Irene at the Urantia Association International conference organized by the AUQ at Bishop's University in Lennoxville in 2015 whose theme was “_Progressing from the human to the divine_”. He is now moving from the world of humanity to the divine world through the career of the ascending soul on the morontia progression worlds where we will go, each of us, at the end of our earthly days.

He was a funny man, a good-natured man, serene and a man of service, very attentive to everyone.

Yvon, your sense of humor has always made us laugh! We are sure that you will do the same on the worlds of houses.

## Death of my dear companion Sylvie Bariteau

_Alain Cyr_
City of Lemoyne

Brothers and sisters of the Urantia community,

I thank you with all my heart for the many messages of condolence and encouragement that I have received from many of you. I also thank those who, without the written form, sent me prayers and good thoughts. All of this has been strengthening.

Sylvie was born in 1954 and I met her for the first time when she was 13 (I was 15). It was also the year of the death of her father, whom she was very fond of. Soon after we met, she became my greatest friend. The years have made us each sail our separate ways, but 38 years ago, destiny brought us together as a couple. She was not a regular reader of the Urantia Book, but she lived up to this revelation through her honesty, her frankness, her generosity, her love and her respect for others. We discussed spiritual matters quite often. In fact, during one discussion, I was amazed to hear her version of man and his relationship with the Supreme God.

It was in a warm and peaceful atmosphere that she took her last breath on Urantia at the Champlain Palliative Center in Brossard, on December 6, 2022, around 11:15 p.m. and God granted me the privilege and happiness of being at her side at that moment. Have a good trip my love and see you soon.

## Psychic circles and morontia life (part one)

_André Desjardins_
St-Alexis-des-Monts

***Editor's note*** _This text appeared in a condensed form in the November 2022 publication of the UAI “Journal”. We are publishing it here in its complete version as intended by the author._

\*N.B. [This thesis on psychic circles is taken from papers 110 and 111 of the _Urantia Book_ as presented by _a Solitary Messenger from Orvonton_.]

_An archangel of Nebadon_ states: “You should understand that the morontia life of an ascending mortal is really initiated on the inhabited worlds at the conception of the soul, at that moment when the creature mind of moral status is indwelt by the spirit Adjuster.” <a id="a229_268"></a>[[UB 48:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p6_2)] This quote indicates that morontia life actually begins on our planet at the formation of the soul by a sincere moral choice announcing the indwelling arrival of the Thought Adjuster. The joint formation of the morontia soul with the Adjuster opens access to the morontia worlds and it is possible for a human personality to know and experience the morontia life during his earthly life with the absolute conviction of being part of this great morontia family.

## Fun game

Here is a fun game concocted by our friend André Pominville. It is a grid to complete entirely devoted to terms used in ***The Urantia Book***. It will test your knowledge of this fifth epochal revelation! Use the clues to complete the words. The letters are shared when the words intersect.

We are looking for a way to write the appropriate letters directly on the grid. Perhaps we will have found a solution for the next publication. For now, you can print this page to complete the grid or simply reproduce it by writing your answers on a sheet of paper.

The solution to this puzzle can be found on the following page [_At the end of this page_]. Good luck, and have fun!

## Editor's note

### Réflectivité belongs to you!

_Claude Flibotte_
Editor in chief

Hello dear readers of your journal Réflectivité!

We hope that this new format of your monthly Réflectivité will be enjoyable for you! It was designed to devote more space to your literary creations, to your research and studies on subjects that fascinate you when reading the Urantia Book. As an example, we have in this issue the first part of the very interesting and extremely detailed article by André Desjardins on “Psychic Circles and Morontia Life”. The second part of this article will appear in the February issue. Obviously, we are not necessarily asking you to write such a long article, but know that there are no longer any space limits for publishing your bursts of consciousness.

This feat is made possible by lifting the restrictions imposed by the previous hybrid version, both electronic and paper, limited to 4 pages. Now, Réflectivité will be available in an electronic version that can be viewed on the Urantia Association Quebec website, and sent to your email box for all people registered on the mailing list. For an indefinite period, a paper version limited to four pages will still be produced for people who responded to the postal survey.

We hope that many of you will respond to this invitation to write and publish in your newspaper ideas, articles, news of general interest, news from your study group, etc., in short, anything that would be of interest to be shared with our brothers and sisters in spirit. Don't forget to include photos of what you want to share! Along with each text, we would like to include a photo of you, your name and the city of residence.

The email address to send your works is: c_flibotte@videotron.ca.

Don't be shy, if you have doubts about your writing skills, our team will adapt your text to the best of its presentation and correct small mistakes and typos. All you have to do is experience the joy of sharing your texts and photos with everyone!

This activity allows several readers of different levels of understanding to exchange and study together the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. It promotes spiritual progress by allowing its participants to find practical applications to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ in their daily lives. This important approach allows us to keep a broad point of view on the concepts of truth. You wish to participate or form a study group; we will be happy to assist you. If you wish to have your study group appear in this list, contact the person in charge, via email association.urantia.quebec@gmail.com or at 450-565-3323.
