Dear readers and members of the association,

As we begin this new year, perhaps you have felt the call or inspiration to immerse yourself once again in reading and studying the teachings of The Urantia Book. Some of you may have decided to join a study group or take one of the many courses offered by UBIS, UUI, Divine Wisdom Progressive, or the Ambassador School. These multiple activities are often necessary to nourish and maintain the spiritual flame that burns within us.

Claude has been a student of The Urantia Book since 1970. Upon reading this revelation, he understood the importance of his daily efforts to BE like the Father according to His ordinance. He also integrated into his life the necessity of DOING something for the good of all humanity according to the expectations of the Supreme Being.

In his desire to serve and be useful to the great divine plan, Claude participates in four study groups, including two groups as a facilitator; he is the editor-in-chief of the journal Réflectivité; he is a teacher-facilitator for the UBIS school; he was appointed director of the French linguistic department for the UBIS school; he has produced several documents in PDF format on various Urantian subjects downloaded from the Urantia Association of Quebec website, and he writes articles for the various Urantian publications.

_(Editor's note: According to the information provided by Gaétan Charland, it would seem that the story of Larry Mullins and Dr. Meredith Justin Sprunger is marked by more or less exact interpretations, we prefer to warn you of this!)_

Good morning,

Recently, I read the book entitled: “A History of the Urantia Book” by Larry Mullins and Dr. Meredith Justin Sprunger. I particularly appreciated the historical background of the facts concerning the arrival of this revelation to us and also the events leading to what was called the Sherman storm which led to the schism between the Urantia Foundation and the Brotherhood. I will hereby focus mainly on the first point.

TESTIMONY OF JACQUES WEISS on IFTUB

Among those studying the typescript of the Urantia Papers between 1935 and 1955 was one Miss Caroline Brown, a well-informed spiritualist with whom I had extensive conversations in New York during the winter of 1947-48. At that time Miss Brown never alluded to the existence of the Papers.

In the early 1950s this group received a heavenly message that due to advances in planetary communications, the number of potential readers had become sufficient to justify publication of the Pamphlets in English, with an initial print run of 10,000 copies, and that a translator into another language would be found to make it a truly worldwide work.

During the Christmas period of 1955, as soon as the papers appeared in English under the title of “The Urantia Book,” Miss Brown sent me a copy and suggested that the message of the publication might be intended for me.

It took me the first months of 1956 to read the book.

## Let's not forget our own value

_Maurice Migneault_
Quebec

There are already thousands of studies or works surrounding ***The Urantia Book*** thanks to courageous readers seeking truth. Even if we must recognize the undeniable contribution of all these thinkers, we must not forget an important fact: the place we occupy in the universe is unique, and consequently, our point of view is also unique. No one else can see things from where we stand. In addition, we possess a personality that is unique in the universe. Therefore, the spiritual thought of the humblest among us has as much value as that of the most renowned of men.

Hello everyone,

The following excerpt is from Paper 19 given by a Divine Counselor, a Co-ordinate Being of Trinity Origin who represents, in fact is, the counsel of perfection. His combined conclusions are not only complete, but they have attained to consummation. When his unified counsel has been admitted, judged, confirmed, and promulgated by a Universal Censor, it is most likely to approach the threshold of universal totality. **These verdicts approximate as nearly as possible the absolute attitude of Deity within the temporal and spatial limits of the situation involved and the problem concerned** (Source 19:3.6):

I was composing a text on the subject of energy in all its forms according to ***The Urantia Book*** when I had the idea to ask questions to the artificial intelligence AskJesus Chatbot from thecenterforunity.org. Here is the address for the website, and here is the direct address of the AI: https://www.thecenterforunity.org/ask-jesus-chatbot. The page is in English, but if you ask your question in French, usually, the AI also answers you in French. You just have to enter your request in the box marked “_Enter question here_”, then press Enter on your keyboard. Your question will be transferred to another box below and the AI will answer you after a few seconds.

If I translate the English text at the beginning of the web page, it looks like this:

It is my pleasure to share with you an update on the study group directory. Bill Beasley is the chair of the committee and always keeps the committee on track. Scott Brooks is the website administrator and handles updates, the annual cleanup project, and general site maintenance. Jackie Koury represents the Fellowship and responds to many email inquiries. Rick Lyon has been the representative of Urantia Association International for many years. He has done a lot of work, including answering the majority of reader inquiries and scraping data for the website. However, Urantia Association felt that this position would be best left to the chair of the association's study group committee, so we selected Phillip Marriott of Australia to join our team. He is dedicated and has agreed to continue all of the work that Rick has done.

## Thoughts on our morontia future

_Francois Audet_

It has happened to me sometimes, as perhaps to some of you, when confronted with the vicissitudes of life, to console myself by rereading papers 47 and 48 dealing with the world of mansions and morontia life. Human nature being what it is, it is sometimes tempting to do a selective reading of the _Urantia Book_, to concentrate on the exciting aspects and to ignore the restrictive aspects. During certain presentations, an idyllic world was dangled before us, castles in Spain so to speak, morontia versions! I have even heard some, and it has also crossed my mind, almost wish for death in order to move on to something more pleasant and easy! The following text therefore seeks to counterbalance this tendency to “run away” and attempts to substitute a more positive vision in accordance with the revelation.

I sometimes feel very different among readers, the majority of whom are male. I often go off the beaten track in my thoughts, and I really like following my curiosity.

Triggering occurs by paying attention to my own feelings, emotions, or ideas that arise when I read a quote or story in ***The Urantia Book***.

And that's how sometimes I attach a life experience to his stories.

It goes without saying that many people are looking for light in these dark times of our civilization, as well as a deeper meaning in their lives.

## Perfection of intention!

(Editor's note: We have added and slightly modified two email communications from Jean to his study group to publish his text).

Hello everyone,

Religion therefore lives and thrives, **not by sight and feeling, but rather by faith and clairvoyance. It consists neither in the discovery of new facts nor in the encounter with an exceptional experience; <ins>rather, it consists in the discovery of new spiritual meanings in facts already well known to humanity</ins>.** The highest religious experience does not depend on previous acts guided by belief, tradition and authority; nor does it arise from sublime feelings or purely mystical emotions. Rather, it is a profoundly serious and effective experience of spiritual communion with the spirit influences that reside in the human mind. Insofar as this experience can be defined in psychology, it consists simply in knowing experimentally that the reality of belief in God is the reality of such a purely personal experience. [UB 101:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p1_4)
