## Paradise Island

SUNDAY AUGUST 18 WE were at Michael's joyous party and I had the opportunity for the third or fourth time to meet Alain Nielsen, this character with a slightly rebellious appearance, but with a bright smile and a solid and warm handshake, as well as the beautiful tall Chantal Chartier who I did not know was Alain's partner.

Now, at one point I heard Alain talking about a possible meeting at Diane Labrecque's for a presentation that would talk about the Central and Divine Universe. So I was interested because I had just read the revelation in the _Urantia Book_ on this subject and I was curious to know more.

On September 8th, we met with 15 other people at Diane Labrecque's to hear this revelation of the book presented by none other than Alain Neilsen and his accomplice Chantal who was the creator of the visual projected on the big screen, thanks to the magic of the computer. And at 3pm we were all embarked aboard the space vehicle piloted by Alain, who described to us the number of kilometers, step by step, that separated us from the earth and it was a most spectacular flight to the island of Paradise and thanks to the comfort of the vehicle and the skill of the pilot, no one got airsick.

Indeed, we had an outstanding presenter and popularizer who knew how to capture all our attention from the beginning to the end with clear and precise texts that were easy to understand, thanks to Chantal's excellent graphics and the explanations that Alain gave us, supporting each text described. Then we returned to Urantia a little before six o'clock, a little tired from the great trip but so delighted. Then it all ended around the magnificent and generous table of our host and host Diane who told us about her last trips to California and Israel. There were nine of us sharing this delicious community dinner.

What a joy it was!

## Paradox of faith, works and service

ANYONE WHO HAS HAD ANY LITTLE exposure to the New Testament, apart from the four Gospels, has found himself faced with an apparent contradiction between the apostles James and Paul. Paul, doubtless inspired by St. John: “That whosoever believeth in Him may have eternal life” ([John 3:11](/en/Bible/John/3#v11)) will repeat after him: “It is not by the works of the law that a man is justified, but by faith in Jesus Christ... not by works, lest any man should boast” ([Galatians 1:16](/en/Bible/Galatians/1#v16)).

After the statements of the apostles John and Paul, the epistle of James seems discordant: “faith without works is dead” (James 2:17). There is a dilemma between the teaching of Paul and that of James. But before trying to find out which of the two is closer to the truth, we must ask a preliminary question: what works are we talking about? The precepts of the Torah? This Law (Torah) that Paul's entire work combats? Customs and practices related to the time? The rules within the nascent Christian organization? It is desirable that works also be the good that we can do to all those whom life places on our path. But between works, service and faith, the latter is supreme. _The Urantia Book_ records this teaching of Machiventa Melchizedek: “_Thou shalt not doubt that faith is THE ONLY requisite for eternal salvation_” <a id="a36_826"></a>[UB 93:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p4_8)

Despite the absolute that faith alone is the door to eternal life, the problem of works and service remains intact. It is not so much the relationship between principles and action that is most paradoxical, but the insistence that is put on promoting works, service, while these are, according to The Urantia Book, spontaneous and occur infallibly in those who are truly born again, born of the Spirit:

> “_Any religious belief which is effective in spiritualizing the believer is certain to have powerful repercussions in the social life of such a religionist. Religious experience unfailingly yields the “fruits of the spirit” in the daily life of the spirit-led mortal._” (<a id="a40_273"></a>[UB 99:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p5_6))

If the new birth infallibly and spontaneously produces the fruits of the Spirit, how can we understand that so much effort must be made to incite to works and service? If we affirm that to love is to serve, then there is reason to ask a legitimate question: to serve what? The organization? To serve whom? To this affirmation, I would prefer, and by far, this passage from the Urantia Book which renders more fully the amplitude of the word love:

> “_Love is the desire to do good to others._” (<a id="a44_48"></a>[UB 56:10.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_21))

## Dare, commit yourself...

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/Reflectivite/2013/004.jpg">
</figure>

In the Reserve Corps of Destiny, we recruit those who are willing to engage in the scene of temporal action... because to love is to serve.

In conclusion, don't wait until you have everything you need before making a service decision... because you might miss a great opportunity to serve! Dare, commit yourself and the rest will come.

## This prayer of serenity is intriguing!

WHY is the SERENITY PRAYER so universally known and recited by so many people? I perceive that this simple and non-sectarian supplication appeals to human common sense by naturally involving faculties deeply inscribed in one's being. This prayer has all the necessary assets to succeed if the person who uses it is frankly honest and sincere in his approach.

Before going any further, for those who are not familiar with it, let me present this supplication to you in this world-famous version.

_My God,_
_Give me serenity_
_To accept_
_The things I can't change,_
_Courage_
_To change the things I can,_
_And wisdom_
_To know the difference_

As a reader of The Urantia Book, we have been informed that the human being that we are is endowed with a consciousness (Intelligence or reason). This consciousness or intelligence is also made of dynamic and effective faculties. (Attention, memory, reflection, affectivity...) All these faculties are alive and constitute its state.

Here are the seven (7) perceptions of consciousness:

- Intuition-orientation
- Understanding
- Courage
- Knowledge (including adventure, curiosity)
- Council (in the sense of association, committee)
- Wonder (Adoration, imagination, gratitude, hope)
- Wisdom (Love, sensitivity, brotherhood, unity, experience, balance, progress)

Called adjutants, these spirits emanate from our personality and appear very early in our life. They take their place quickly and naturally in our daily activities and all this in a lively, creative and more than instinctive way.

But let's get back to our main topic: the Serenity Prayer. Let's find its true foundations. On one side we have the seven (7) faculties of consciousness (listed above), they are well installed in our mind. On the other side, we have a personal approach (Serenity Prayer) that we address to a higher Power.

Let us analyze point by point the character of this very popular prayer.
1. The word PRAYER, in the title itself (PRAYER OF SERENITY) leads us to look at several things. And this first observation clearly indicates to us that there is a supplicant and a supplicant, a petitioner and a giver. There is therefore a relationship between personalities. This relationship determines the fact that there is an association (**Adjuvat of advice**).
2. This acquisition (Adjuvat of advice) continues in the presence of the word SERENITY. Serenity is an objective, a goal or an ideal to achieve. It is not part of the animal vocabulary and is located in the category: Adoration-wonder, in this phase where the human encounters unifying divine qualities. Serenity definitely enters into these high values. We have therefore added another element to our research, it is **the adjuvat of adoration**.
3. After finding two functional adjutants, we continue reading the prayer and we arrive at: THE COURAGE TO CHANGE THE THINGS I CAN Here, textually, it is obvious that the word courage is directly mentioned. So we have found a third adjutant, it is **the adjutant of courage**.
4. As a fourth point and by taking up the same process, we can discover there **the adjutant of wisdom** in the following line: THE WISDOM OF KNOWING THE DIFFERENCE. No need to insist further on this faculty ennobling man so that he becomes wise, qualifying him and thus further benefiting him.
5. In this same section: THE WISDOM OF KNOWING THE DIFFERENCE, we also find the word know. This fifth discovery leads us directly to the **adjuvant of knowledge** well described in the natural faculties that we all possess.
6. By analyzing and then synthesizing the last sentence: THE WISDOM TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, it forces us to reflect, and therefore ultimately to understand (**Adjuvant of understanding**) the entire prayer. Understand and admit that a sixth adjutant has clearly just surfaced there.
7. The vision-direction of this prayer leads us to choose (to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can), to decide personally (with God's help) our destiny. In my head, I have therefore found this seventh adjutant (**the Adjutant of orientation**) that I was looking for, to conclude my personal analysis of the serenity prayer.

The popularity of this prayer is conditioned not only because it does not offend our human and divine nature, but because it respects in every way the natural functioning of our being. Moreover, it appeals to the divine Creator (as we conceive Him), to humbly receive His help. It therefore incorporates into it the fundamental respect for our personal being.

What liberating inspiration in this prayer that suits me well. I personally find this prayer constructive, humble, guiding, voluntary, joyful, universal, respectful, down-to-earth, visionary, realistic, generous, optimistic, courageous, precise, just, exact, creative, progressive, eternal, philosophical, religious and wisely spiritual.

I opened a Pandora's box this September morning by imagining all these relationships that actually coordinate and I leave you with these new thoughts in this:

_The Urantia Book_ also reveals to us (researchers can easily find these revealing passages) that our personality-will can act freely in seven (7) distinct powers, here they are listed:

- The power of Emergence
- The Power of Judgment
- The Power of Choice
- The Power of Execution
- The effective power of action
- The power of evaluation
- The power of love

It would be exciting to know if these powers of manifestation potentially active in our being would function just as well as the seven faculties of consciousness have coordinated so harmoniously in connection with the Serenity Prayer. By doing this exercise, you will prove for yourself that the Serenity Prayer is gracefully grounded in these movement actions that we all possess.

Finally the Serenity Prayer needs faith to complete its balanced cycle, this trio of divine grace consciousness — power — faith in the willing personality of the praying person. I believe that with this divine basis, this prayer will remain eternally in its place on the progressive path of the human on earth. From my own point of view, at least, I see it that way.

I wish everyone this daily serenity, because it is the attitude of the happy soul before the obstacles of life and like many other human brothers I will seek it when needed. Do not be afraid to use it at all times or at all times, generous it boldly and truly keeps all its promises.

Kind regards,

## UAI International Congress in 2015

AS PART OF THE Urantia ASSOCIATION of Canada, it is under this banner that the Urantia Association of Quebec has proposed its candidacy to become the host of the next **International Congress of the UAI** which will be held in 2015.

It was last April that the AUQ received the official response to undertake the necessary steps to organize this major event, which will take place from July 30 to August 3, 2015 at Bishop's University in Lennoxville in the Eastern Townships.

Since then, the Board of Directors team has met three times to determine the main theme of the conference, develop themes for each of the 3 days, and choose presentation and workshop topics that fit the conference theme, **Progressing from the Human to the Divine — Revealing Oneself to God**.

Theme for Day 1- The Individual, theme for Day 2- The Family and theme for Day 3- Society/Brotherhood.

When the development of the content of these days in terms of presentations and workshops is completed, an announcement will be made on the UAI website, on the Canadian site and on the AUQ site as well as in other Urantian publications to invite interested parties to submit a curriculum of their presentation or workshop.

In 2014 we will need volunteers for the training of the committees and their organization; contact us at association.urantia.quebec@gmail.com

Thanks to those who have already offered their participation and help in organizing this memorable event.

## STUDY GROUP GROWTH CYCLES

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/Reflectivite/2013/005.jpg">
</figure>

IT IS NORMAL DURING THE LIFE OF A STUDY GROUP to have ups and downs, just as it happens in human families, we could very well call these groups “study families”.

There always comes a time when the group must die out or split up to allow others to be born and thus increase their numbers. These groups are living entities, and as such, respond to natural cycles of growth of which “death” or “dormancy” is a part. If we want to avoid these cycles, we will tend to form institutions with linear growth, and a great danger awaits us then.

> _But as religion becomes institutionalized, its power for good is curtailed, while the possibilities for evil are greatly multiplied._ (<a id="a163_138"></a>[UB 99:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p6_3))

It is likely that we will all one day have to experience this little mourning of seeing our group die out due to death, aging, moving or social obligations. We should not worry about it, this is a normal process of growth. The important thing is that the participants have kept this family spirit, this taste for grouping and studying together, just as children one day leave home to start their own family.
