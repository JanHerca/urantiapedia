Dear readers and members of the association,

I hope you are enjoying the summer to the fullest and taking time to rest and travel if that is part of your vacation plans. We are all well informed about current events in the world, and it is possible that some of you are worried about the current situation, whether political, social, religious or spiritual.

As president of the Urantia Association of Quebec, I have never discussed political subjects with you, except to make vague references to the troubling conditions that we observe in the world. I am sure that many of you are informed by the media and, of course, the Internet on the political situation south of our border. Nor do I wish to dictate your political, social, religious, and even less spiritual choices.

## Topic — What does _The Urantia Book_ say about democracy?

***According to ChatGPT***

***The Urantia Book*** presents a critical, yet nuanced perspective on democracy. Here are some key points it raises:

1. Inherent Value of Democracy: ***The Urantia Book*** recognizes the value of democracy as a system that acknowledges the dignity and worth of individuals. It appreciates the principle of government “by the people, for the people” as a significant step in the social and political evolution of humanity.
2. Limitations and challenges: Despite its recognized value, ***The Urantia Book*** highlights several limitations and challenges inherent in democratic systems:
   - _Popularity over competence_: He criticizes the tendency of democracies to value popularity over competence, where leaders are elected based on their ability to appeal to the masses rather than their qualifications or short-term: Democracies often focus on short-term goals and immediate benefits to gain votes, sometimes at the expense of long-term planning and stability.
   - _Potential for mediocrity_: There is a concern that democracy can lead to mediocrity, where the lowest common denominator sets the standard, potentially stifling exceptional leadership and innovation.
3. Education and Awareness: The book emphasizes the importance of education and awareness for a successful democracy. An informed and educated electorate is considered crucial for making informed decisions and choosing competent leaders.
4. Evolutionary Nature: Democracy is viewed as an evolving system that reflects the growing political maturity and social consciousness of humanity. It suggests that over time, as societies evolve and individuals become more spiritually and intellectually advanced, democratic systems will improve and become more effective.
5. Spiritual Leadership: ***The Urantia Book*** emphasizes the need for spiritual leadership and moral guidance in democracies. It argues that without a foundation of ethical and spiritual values, democratic systems are prone to corruption and ineffectiveness.

In summary, ***The Urantia Book*** appreciates the democratic ideal, but emphasizes the need for continuous improvement, education, and moral leadership to address its inherent flaws and realize its full potential.

## Thought, progress and destiny

The mind is a wonderful gift to use! Without the mind, we would have no life to think and dream; no curiosity to seek answers to difficult questions. The mind is for storing, exploring, and deciding. It is given by the higher mind for ever greater adventures in the discovery of truth. The first important question, in my humble opinion, is only three words: _What is true?_ (or replace “true” with “real”). Apply this to all of life's activities for adventurous curiosity! The mind allows us to dream of possibilities. Thought allows us to become aware of the higher mind that knows our needs and has developed a progressive plan for each person.

## About the Seven Psychic Circles

Following my reading about the seven psychic circles described in ***The Urantia Book***, I often wondered how I could identify which circle I was in at the time of these questions. Is it even possible to know? What can I base myself on to get an idea in my investigation? Knowing that mastering these circles is not the equivalent of merging with my Adjuster (<a id="a140_361"></a>[UB 110:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_1)), if I could recognize the stages, perhaps I could facilitate the moment of fusion! My first instinct is to refer to the book!

**WELCOME TO THE FAMILY**

***The Urantia Book*** emphasizes the family as the fundamental social unit and as a crucial factor in the development of individuals and society. In this study aid, we examine the family as the basic building block of human civilization.

## My take on the Thought Adjuster

**Foreword**

***The Urantia Book*** is probably the only book in which the designation “Thought Adjuster” is used, and few equivalents exist in religious or philosophical literature. From the spiritual standpoint, it is represented as the essence of the highest level of divinity bestowed upon personalities at the lowest hierarchy of will-living beings. Will-mortals are the only personality type in which the Thought Adjuster can dwell in their minds and amalgamate into a single entity. Several variations of its designation are described and used in The Urantia Book, such as Mystery Monitors, Presence of God, Bestowal of the Universal Father, Image of God, Spiritual Presence of the Universal Father. <a id="a174_694"></a>[UB 108:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p6_3). All of these designations represent the Thought Adjuster to the will-mortals of time and space according to their own conception. Although their origin is a perfect reflection of the divine personality of God, they are prepersonal and can manifest and express themselves only through a mortal volition personality, and only through them can they experience living perfection. The bestowal of personality by the Universal Father decreed that the self-will of volition beings predominates over the prepersonal origin of the Thought Adjuster.
