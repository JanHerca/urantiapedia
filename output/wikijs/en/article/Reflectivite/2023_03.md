Hello members and friends of the association,

I would like to discuss with you the concerns of the members of the board of your association regarding the question of the sustainability of the association which has been of concern to us for many years! We, the members of the board, looking at the photos and video recordings of the activities of the association, notice that the majority of its readers are well over sixty.

We do not see young readers emerging from the population of Quebec. In fact, they are disconcertingly rare. The 70s and 80s were certainly marked by a significant interest in ***The Urantia Book*** by young adults of those decades; I was one of them. What are the significant differences that could characterize this era from that of today? I am sure that there are several and that you could surely name a few. In fact, this situation is not exclusive to Quebec, and can be observed on several continents with the exception of South America and Africa.

_Editor's note: here is a publication in an email initially addressed to members of the Le Pont study group, but which we consider useful for all readers!_

Hello everyone,

While studying this booklet last Wednesday, new meanings emerged in me which have continued until now. I share them with you this morning. Michael, before carrying out his last outpouring on our planet, received advice from his brother Emmanuel concerning this outpouring, this mission, its limitations and even additional advice. Booklet 140 on the ordination of the twelve is quite similar: Jesus gives his apostles (sometimes he also calls them ambassadors) preliminary instruction, recommendations, the reason for sending them into the world, that they had to show paternal love, his demands concerning their new birth and his demands also to get involved only in the spiritual domain to establish the new kingdom in the hearts of Jews and Gentiles.

We learn that Jesus asks his Father to accompany them as he himself was accompanied and to give them wisdom. In fact, he entrusts his twelve men to the care of his Father. He tells them:

## How do I understand this process of becoming like God?

_Gilles Bertrand_
Quebec

I would like to submit to you a method of progression towards God, which came to my mind following certain reflections on this subject. Let me tell you about my recent adventure which still delights me today.

First, I took from ***The Urantia Book*** some basic information, the bare minimum, don't worry, which I submit to you for a better understanding of my text. These three paragraphs will be enough to direct your thoughts towards my lived experience and perhaps some proposals that will benefit your personal efforts.

A good example to resemble God is to understand the behaviors and actions of our master Jesus and study his profound teachings. Then try to have attitudes and actions to sincerely imitate these discoveries and put them into practice. We must therefore trust the Spirit of Truth who must adequately direct his own personality through the evolving soul.

Also, there is another point not to be neglected, it is to always have this desire present in our mind to resemble God. I then suggest to you this injunction found in ***The Urantia Book***, to sincerely recognize divine paternity and to worship with love, which probably brings me closer to this goal.

## The Christ Experiment's — The School of Ambassadors

<figure id="Figure_4b" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/Reflectivite/Ambassadeurs.jpg">
</figure>

In the course **The Ministry of the Master**, the student progresses at his own pace. Each lesson includes a ten-minute video presentation explaining the lesson, a multiple-choice quiz, a poster summarizing the lesson and a student comments section where everyone can read and comment on the lesson.

The **Ministry of the Master** course offers insightful means, knowledge and ways to better minister to those who believe or do not believe in God, and shed light on their belief.

Here are the titles of some lessons:

What is the Ministry of the Master?

Transforming the message of salvation into ministry

Why Christianity?

Enhancing Christianity

The Importance of the Master's Ministry

Ministry Ethics and Final Thoughts

and be one of those

- Who “will dare to depend solely on Jesus and his incomparable teachings”; — who will be “exclusively devoted to the cause of humanity”.
- Who will devote themselves “exclusively to the spiritual regeneration of men”; and
- who “will quickly provide the directives and inspiration necessary for the social, moral, economic and political reorganization of the world!”

Georges was born in Paris, France, in 1947. His father, Jacques Dupont, gave him _The Urantia Book_ in the early 1960s. Georges was part of the team that spent fifteen years revising and correcting the French translation. He was also responsible for distributing the French translation of _The Urantia Book_ in French-speaking countries for many years.

Georges became a trustee of Urantia Foundation in September 1995, created the first electronic search engine for _The Urantia Book_, and formatted the small vinyl version of the book in English, Finnish, French, and Spanish.

In 1999, he and Dorothy Elder launched _Urantia Book International School_ (UBIS), the first online school dedicated to the in-depth study of _The Urantia Book_.

Today, Georges is the International Vice President of Urantia Foundation, Head of Translations, and Director of UBIS.

He lives in Recloses, France with his wife Marlene, an ardent student of the book. They have two adult daughters and one granddaughter. By profession, Georges was an electro-metallurgical engineer. Georges and Marlene owned a high-end lighting and furniture factory in Paris, France. They have been retired since 2010.

## Adjutant mind-spirits in animals

An article in the magazine “Science & Vie” from January 2023, titled “_How animals apprehend the world around them_” by Valentin Faivre caught my attention, and I had fun making a connection with the adjutant spirits-minds as taught in ***The Urantia Book***.

We know that these minds come into play when the ability to learn from experience (<a id="a168_83"></a>[UB 65:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p7_6)) manifests itself. In this article, the author drew up two tables. One focused on the cognitive abilities and the other on the emotional abilities of eleven livestock species, tables based on a study by Bob Fisher of Texas State University. This work concerned eighty-two behaviors present or not in their subjects.

The day Gaétan became president of the association in Quebec, he asked me what I thought about hosting a study group at home. Knowing that it was a strong desire that he cherished, that of wanting to do something beautiful with this book, I agreed. He told me that it was not something temporary or something that for some was fashionable, but that it would be a commitment as long as we had the capacity! And the journey in this adventure has continued since September 1999.

As a new group, the 5-6 participants that we were, started ***The Urantia Book*** by starting at the beginning with the complex papers. During the last hour, the meetings were lightened with the reading of the Life and the teachings of Jesus, while being inspired by the beautiful lessons that we read there and sharing the way they were practiced in our lives, which allowed us to quickly create bonds of camaraderie and to appreciate each other. It took us 12 years to read the first page to the last.

**Part 1 — Taking a stand.**

In the publication mandate of The Urantia Book we are told that we must have an army of teachers and leaders ready for a great educational work after the conclusion of the present ideological struggle. We have produced a video explaining that we believe the present ideological struggle is the same as that raised by the Lucifer Rebellion, that is, true freedom versus false freedom, or freedom versus license.

Although the rebellion was crushed by Michael in the fulfillment of his bestowal mission, the effects of the rebellion remain. And this residual effect is why we continue to experience the ideological struggle on our world. If we are correct that the ideological struggle is the struggle between freedom and license as presented by the Lucifer rebellion, then it is imperative that we take a stand on the right side of the struggle.

Many years ago when I was working in my video rental business, several young adults worked for me and I had the opportunity to put into practice the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ on many occasions. It must be said that for me, the primary goal of having a business was to ensure a substantial income that would allow me to participate freely in the adventure that the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ offered me.

Very often, we can provide many services to others without ever having had a look at the result or the consequences of our action. I am going to share with you one of my personal experiences that I had forgotten and which, after several years, came to confirm for me what I had read in ***The Urantia Book***: that the actions are ours and the consequences belong to God.

## Could Proxima Centauri B be a planet of non-breathers?

“_The planetary conduct of non-breathers would be of more than interest to you, because a race of these beings inhabits a sphere very near Urantia_” (<a id="a232_150"></a>[UB 49:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p3_6)).

Here is a quote from the Urantia Book that certainly piques your curiosity, at least mine! In the past, I read an article by an author dealing with this subject, which unfortunately I have not been able to find, who located their planet inside our solar system. Obviously, for the Melchizedek of the Jerusem school of planetary administration, “very close to Urantia” can mean inside our solar system as well as light years away from us!

Experience lived on Reunion Island on January 1, 2022

Bahaism, or Baha'ism, also known as the Bahá'í Faith (in Persian: بهائی (bahāʾī), pronounced [baˈ.haː.ʔ.iː] or [ba.hɑː.i]) or Behaism (old spelling), is an Abrahamic and monotheistic religion, proclaiming the spiritual unity of humanity. The members of this international religious community describe themselves as adherents of an “independent world religion”

I wanted to share with you an experience I had, my brothers and sisters. For about twenty years, we have been very close friends with a couple of Iranian origin who belong to the Bahá'í religion or faith. I talk about it quite often, because each encounter leaves a deep mark on us, in a very pleasant and indescribable way.

## Fun game

Here is a fun game concocted by our friend André Pominville. It is a grid to complete entirely devoted to terms used in _The Urantia Book_. It will test your knowledge of this fifth epochal revelation! Use the clues to complete the words. The letters are shared when the words intersect.

If there is no solution for writing directly in the grid, you can print this page to complete the grid or simply reproduce it by writing your answers on a sheet of paper.

The solution to this puzzle can be found on the following page [_At the end of this page_]. Good luck, and have fun!
