Hello readers and friends of the association,

I would like to draw your attention to a subject that has been on my mind for several years. This subject, too often hidden because of its relationship with Lucifer and our fallen planetary prince Caligastia, and which refers to itself as Luciferian thought. I have often observed that when the name Lucifer or Caligastia is pronounced, it is always in relation to the troubling history of our planet and not on the influence that this can have on our movement.

Our observations of the present influence of Luciferian thought are often limited to the actions or attitudes of authoritarian political regimes, organized crime groups and gangs, certain religious groups, or those individuals classified as libertarians. Rarely would we think that our entire civilization continues to be markedly affected by this Luciferian thought philosophy, much less in the Urantia movement and its constituent readers.

I will write very briefly on this topic today, but I will speak more extensively about it in a virtual presentation and in an article that will appear in the UAI Journal. What I want to bring to your attention is the profound influence that the separation of the Urantia Brotherhood Association and Urantia Foundation in 1989 had on the current state of our movement in the world and its spiritual mission.

From that fateful day when Luciferian thought played a pivotal role in this separation, the future of the Urantia movement found itself in a vulnerable position.

For the book informs us that “A house divided against itself cannot stand. The non-Christian world will not accept capitulation to a sectarian Christendom. The living Jesus represents the only possible hope for unifying Christianity. **The true Church—the fellowship of Jesus**—is invisible, spiritual **and characterized by unity**, but not necessarily by uniformity.” <a id="a36_370"></a>[UB 195:10.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_11)

The revelators clearly teach us the dangers that the lack of unity in our movement holds for us. To this day, Urantia Association International and Urantia Book Fellowship are finding it increasingly difficult to coexist in the same territory. This division, characterized by competition for human and financial resources, creates smudges in the spiritual nature of our movement. The division thus reflected cannot attract young readers who should serve as a replacement for the aging generation that we are.

Each of us, as seekers after truth, has a great responsibility toward that which has been abundantly given to us. We must reflect in our lives the teachings of The Urantia Book, which we consider to be most liberating and true. The integration of the teachings into our way of life is the only technique, when intimately associated with prayer, meditation, worship, and service, that will enable us to gradually free ourselves from Luciferian thinking and to exert a beneficial influence upon the world around us.

This is why the Urantia Association of Quebec does so much to promote the virtual schools of the _Urantia Book_. We, the French-speaking readers, are privileged to have access to four schools that offer courses in French; so why not take advantage of this course proposal to acquire the spiritual and intellectual means necessary to free ourselves from the influence of Luciferian thought? To register for one or more of these schools, visit the website under the EDUCATION tab by following this link: https://www.urantia-quebec.ca/education

For those who understand English, you can watch the presentation I gave on November 19th, entitled “Luciferian Thought, Revelation and Us” by following this link: https://vimeo.com/773552009

In conclusion, I invite you to show your support for an initiative to unify the two organizations, the Fellowship and the UAI, by writing to the president of the UAI, Enrique Travers: enriquetraver@urantia-association.org

For the holiday season, I wish you moments of rejoicing with your family and friends that they are filled with love, spiritual joy, peace and that the year 2023 brings you growth and opportunities for service, so that your life is fulfilled in grace and wisdom.

To love is to serve

## New status coming soon for Réflectivité

Hello dear readers of your newsletter Réflectivité.

As announced in the November 2022 issue, a major change will take place for your publication covering new activities and texts concerning ***The Urantia Book*** mainly in Quebec. I would like to answer in this text the questions you may have.
<br style="clear:both;"/>

### Why this change?

This new version of Réflectivité is intended to be more pleasant to read by using a slightly larger typography spread over two columns instead of three. It will be more illustrated and in color. It will allow the publication of long texts that did not find their place in the version limited to four pages. The goal is to give you the floor with all the space you can expect.

Many of you are long-time readers, making you ideal candidates to pass on to younger readers all the wisdom you have acquired during your studies. The universe of universes is a vast school where everyone is both master and student. It is our duty to pass on our knowledge and experiences that we have acquired to those who follow us, just as the revelators hope that we do.

### What's new

From now on, the texts will be grouped under a header banner describing its category. We will find among others the following categories: thematic, true story, study group, announcement, obituary, biography, fun games and many others.

About the fun games, our brother André Pominville will produce grids to complete according to questions, all related to ***The Urantia Book***. This will be an excellent way to have fun while challenging our knowledge of this fifth epochal revelation. There will be crosswords, hidden words and no doubt other surprises!

We have a wonderful website at AUQ full of useful information for everyone. The Réflectivité will certainly make the link to unite these two information bodies in order to complete your research. This new version of the Réflectivité will be devoted exclusively to an electronic version in PDF format readable on computers, tablets and even smartphones. Our publication is following in the footsteps of the electronic format as several newspapers have already done. For example, La Presse papier has been available exclusively in electronic format for several years under the name La Presse +

### What will happen to the paper version

Following the survey conducted using an insert in the previous issue, a few people expressed their desire to continue receiving the paper version. Although this choice will result in an additional workload for the production of two versions, the AUQ is committed to continuing the paper version in its current form, namely a newsletter. These readers will find the president's message, announcements and current news.

The complete and improved electronic version will be available, as always, on our AUQ website. Thus, anyone wishing to benefit from it will have the leisure to come and consult it and download it as they wish.

Until then, happy reading everyone!

## How could Jesus know the thoughts of his contemporaries?

This is a question I asked myself when reading about his life in ***The Urantia Book***. After careful consideration, I see two possible reasons for this phenomenon.
<br style="clear:both;"/>

### Jesus experienced normal humanity until his baptism

Throughout his human life, from birth to baptism, Jesus experienced what all of us experience as human beings. His body was transformed from that of a baby to that of an adult. His mind was educated by his parents, his teachers, and the society of the day. Like us, he received the help of the seven adjutant mind-spirits, the Holy Spirit, and his Thought Adjuster. The Spirit of Truth was obviously not yet prevalent on Urantia at that time. With time and life experiences and under the guidance of his Adjuster, Jesus moved through the psychic circles one by one, attaining mastery of the first circle and control of his personality just after his journey around the Mediterranean on Mount Hermon (134:8). Was it the attainment of these first psychic circles that enabled him to search the hearts of people and know their thoughts? I do not think so.

### The change after the baptism event

It is written that at the time of baptism, Jesus “_was a mortal of the realm having reached the pinnacle of human evolutionary ascension in all that concerned the conquest of the mind and the identification of self with the spirit_” (<a id="a108_234"></a>[UB 134:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p8_4)). This event marked the end of Jesus' purely human life; he could, at will, use only his human mind or his divine mind. He could also use a mixture of both types of minds. So how could Jesus search the hearts and minds of men?

### First solution track

We remember that the Eternal Son draws to himself all spiritual thoughts by his absolute hold over spirit gravity (<a id="a112_115"></a>[UB 6:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p4_1)). Since the Eternal Son is the mother of all Creator Sons, it is quite plausible that these Creator Sons would inherit something of her attributes from their mother. Thus, all spiritual thoughts conceived by mankind are within the reach of the Creator Sons. Moreover, their Spirit of Truth, when poured out upon their bestowal world, will be in close contact with every human being animated by sincere righteousness producing many fruits of the spirit (<a id="a112_608"></a>[UB 194:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_1)). Thus Michael of Nebadon, fully conscious of his Creator Son nature, but still incarnate as Jesus of Nazareth, had this power to perceive spiritual thoughts in his subjects.

### Second solution track

We know that Michael of Nebadon is in constant close liaison with his companion, the Divine Minister of Nebadon (<a id="a116_113"></a>[UB 33:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p3_1)). This Creative Spirit is the god of mind for our local universe, and he distributes the mind circuit to all living creatures in his universe (<a id="a116_298"></a>[UB 36:5.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5_15)). Added to this is the influence of the seven adjutant mind-spirits (<a id="a116_411"></a>[UB 34:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p5_2)), and the spiritual ministry of the Holy Spirit (<a id="a116_502"></a>[UB 34:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p5_4)). Since thought is the product of mind and the Divine Minister is the giver of this mind circuit, it is self-evident that she is continually aware of all the thoughts that emerge from her own mind circuit in her children. As the Creator Son is in constant liaison with the Creative Daughter, of course he knows what the Divine Minister knows, which is to say, he knows what all his creatures are thinking! Here, then, is a second reason supporting the fact of his ability to know the real intentions of his subjects. Michael's ability to perceive people's thoughts manifested itself on many occasions during his earthly life. Whether it was with Nalda at Jacob's well (%%4%), in the company of the young man who was fearful and dejected (<a id="a116_1282"></a>[UB 130:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p6_1)) or at the announcement of the death of Lazarus (<a id="a116_1375"></a>[UB 167:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p4_1)).

Now that Jesus is dead, and Michael of Nebadon has poured out his Spirit of Truth upon all flesh, and this spirit is being diffused through the Divine Minister, it is even more evident to me, that Michael knows all our thoughts and will always work to show us the way (<a id="a118_269"></a>[UB 34:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p7_8))!

A quotation from _The Urantia Book_ well states what I have been discussing with you: <a id="a120_86"></a>[UB 142:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p7_2) _Jesus sought first to make plain to his apostles that he himself was on earth living a unique life in the flesh, and that they, the twelve, had been called to participate in this bestowal experience of the Son of Man; and as such coworkers, they, too, must share in many of the special restrictions and obligations of the entire bestowal experience. ***There was a veiled intimation that the Son of Man was the only person who had ever lived on earth who could simultaneously see into the very heart of God and into the very depths of man’s soul.***_

## The School of Ambassadors

<figure id="Figure_5" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/Reflectivite/Ambassadeurs.jpg">
</figure>

The first school of its kind dedicated exclusively to training leaders and teachers of the gospel of Jesus as amplified in the fifth epochal revelation.

The course **The Ministry of the Master** can be started at any time depending on the time you have available. It is done at the student's own pace.

Here are some student comments.

***This is a very powerful course that reminded me of all the riches of the divine teachings and particularly those of the Master! My inner life has gained in intimacy with the Father and with the Son; and my will to do the will of God has been consolidated.***

***Bravo for the preparation for evangelism, the sound advice on ethics and morals, for making people feel comfortable in a conversation with us!***

***Bravo also for having pointed out the teaching methods of Jesus to his apostles to prepare them well for their future role as evangelists.***

***I appreciate and try to put into practice the advice not to take anything away, but to add! To also talk about what Jesus is doing now, about his Plan which is to perfect his universe and then give it back to his Father!***

> _Wisdom_. From children to truth seekers, everyone has heard this word. A catch-all word where a personal representation develops, ranging from self-restraint to the most ascetic disciplines.
> 
> Rather than limits, can Wisdom be an exponential adventure, a dynamism between the human and God? Where limits are replaced by possibilities? Where capacities mutate into vivification? A kind of treasure hunt for Wisdom, living Wisdom, joyful, practical, simple? And within reach of the soul.
