Hello readers and friends of the _Urantia Book_,

Another month of summer has begun, and many of you have probably already enjoyed a well-deserved vacation with your family this summer. Some of you have probably continued your participation in various Urantia activities, such as study groups, UAI webinars online, and the Urantia University Institute (UUI) coffee meetups.

To those of you waiting for September to resume your Urantian activities, rest assured, the study groups that are taking a break during the summer will resume their activities as soon as the holidays are over, and this will be the case for the Discovery study group that I have been leading since 1999. Starting next month, the online conferences that have replaced our in-person themes since the advent of COVID, and presented by the Urantia Association of Quebec, will resume.

July was a month of great change for the families close to the vice-president of the association, Jean-Pierre Cadieux who left us for the world of homes. Jean-Pierre held the position of vice-president for about three years, he took care of several translation jobs and contributed significantly to the updating of certain parts of the AUQ website. Jean-Pierre was a dedicated student who served even during these last difficult months among us, he was also a member of our Discovery study group, he will be greatly missed.

For those interested in taking Jean-Pierre's position as Vice President, contact us and we will provide you with the list of department responsibilities.

I want to talk to you about an educational project that is close to my heart. In the early 2000s and for about ten years in Quebec, several readers benefited from the courses in Progressive Divine Wisdom given by Mr. Moussa Ndiaye from Senegal. Moussa, having passed away in March 2019, his teaching method and his seminars survived his death.

As a result of the pandemic, several Senegalese teachers of this method, trained by Moussa, decided to join forces and offer these seminars through the Zoom application to anyone who would like to progress.

In view of the strong demand they received from readers and non-readers from different parts of the world, these teachers decided to go ahead and create a school specializing in Progressive Divine Wisdom seminars. Naturally, creating a school requires not only teachers, but also a structure, a curriculum, a website and several computer products and equipment such as computers, Zoom accounts, internet connections and other equipment.

At our next board meeting in September, one of the items on the agenda will be to explore how the Urantia Association of Quebec and its associated readers could help finance this new school. Of course, this school in Progressive Divine Wisdom will be advertised under the new **EDUCATION** section on the association's website where the seminars in Progressive Divine Wisdom will be offered.

In this education section will be found three other schools offering readers a variety of courses contributing not only to the understanding and acquisition of the teachings of The Urantia Book, but also to the spiritual progression of students as well as the wise dissemination of its teachings.

Finally, I would like to emphasize the importance of study groups in spiritual education, an importance that is often overlooked by readers. Dare to join a group and be amazed at what comes out of it.

I wish you a fruitful month of August in your social contacts and remain in physical and spiritual health.

## Goodbye Jean-Pierre

_Robert Cadieux_
Montreal

Our friend, my brother and our brother Jean Pierre Cadieux left us the other day, Tuesday July 13, 2021 at $23: 00$, he was 63 years old. I was next to him with his daughter Rose and his wife Lyne. He simply left for his morontia journey.

I thought to myself that it was as if he was going on a journey to a faraway land and that I would see him again one day, after a while. He told me that he would be there when we went to join him and I know that it is true.

It was Jesus who said:
<br style="clear:both;"/>

> “_The human soul (personality) of man survives mortal death by identity association with this indwelling spark of divinity, which is immortal, and which functions to perpetuate the human personality upon a continuing and higher level of progressive universe existence._” (<a id="a67_274"></a>[UB 132:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p3_6))

Those who knew him know that he had a charming personality, he was in a good mood, good company, an endearing person.

I was close to him, we talked frequently and had long conversations about spirituality, human survival and many topics contained in ***The Urantia Book***. He had a living personal faith, the kind that motivates us and makes certain the reality of our survival.

He had learned a year ago that he had inoperable and incurable esophageal cancer. We saw him gradually weaken, however, when asked how he was, he would answer without hesitation: 'I'm doing very well'. His body was weakening but his faith was unwavering and greater than the disease.

He wanted to retire in about three years and we had plans to work together to serve humans and _revelation_.

We will see him again, as well as all the souls we have known, who have been dear to us and with whom we wish to perpetuate links and experiences of progress.

> “_From the resurrection halls you proceed to the Melchizedek sector, where you are assigned permanent residence. Then you enter upon ten days of personal liberty. You are free to explore the immediate vicinity of your new home and to familiarize yourself with the program which lies immediately ahead. You also have time to gratify your desire to consult the registry and call upon your loved ones and other earth friends who may have preceded you to these worlds._” (<a id="a79_470"></a>[UB 47:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p3_6))

Goodbye Jean Pierre, we will not fail. With authentic faith, we will join you on maisonnia and then on the other spheres for the endless continuity of our spiritual experience.

## Where are you my brothers and sisters?

Hello dear readers of _The Urantia Book_ and of this newsletter!

For about fifty years, I have been studying this epochal revelation. Over the years, I have met a host of Quebec readers who are in love with these teachings. Unfortunately, I do not feel that they are present in the Urantia movement to allow the young people of the generations that follow us to benefit from the treasures of knowledge that they possess. I wonder why they are not there to write articles on the understanding that they have on different themes raised in this book. Why are they not present in the courses offered on the Urantia Book Internet School? Their knowledge and their points of view would be so appreciated by all the participants in these virtual classes.

We are taught that the universe is a vast school and that each being is called to serve as a teacher to those who follow. Should we not consider it our sacred duty to pass on to others what we have so generously received? The motto of the Urantia Association of Quebec is “to love is to serve,” so if we truly love our brothers and sisters in spirit, should we not make the effort to share our ideas?

The UBIS school will once again offer, as has been the case for several years now, three courses for the September term. I would be so happy to meet again those I have known and loved as my brothers and sisters over the years in this great spiritual family under the aegis of our divine Father to all!

My friendly and fraternal greetings!

## Man's relationship with the cosmos and man's relationship with God

<figure id="Figure_5" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">

If through the power of visualization and imagination we could project ourselves high enough into the infinite cosmos to perceive our earth as the size of a needle head, perhaps we would better perceive the interdependence, inter-association or relationship of man with the diversity of living things implanted on the earth.

We could better perceive the evidence that our world is like a microscopic cell eaten away by a cancer called “selfish and immature man” who uses his free will to the detriment of all living things.

The problem probably lies in the fact that most people let themselves drift with events, always thinking that it is up to others to harmonize the interactions of living beings with each other and with their environment (Jesus and God are the greatest ecologists).

There is therefore a kind of general indifference which, even in the face of events like COVID, shows us that at the first deconfinement everything is forgotten to resume the frantic race of ephemeral and selfish pleasures of the senses to the detriment of what is truly more important and vital.

I think it's human nature to only make radical changes when you're at rock bottom or when you're crushed against the wall.

The notion of “prevention is better than cure” is something that is not yet well anchored in the will of man, yet this kind of short film does not teach us anything new and we know very well individually that this is the case.

These are also the causes and consequences of the unbridled materialism that we cherish so much.

Prayer and active engagement “go hand in hand” for inner and outer change, individual and collective, spiritual and material, earthly and cosmic... We also return to the first Wisdom seminar that we received or are receiving:

The relationship of man (the thinker) with his body, the relationship of man with all the living things that constitute our planet Earth, the relationship of man with the cosmos and the relationship of man with God.

This is not information that should remain on paper, but rather a source of transformation “from where we are” and “from where we are in our individual progression”.

I remember an author who wrote that in the beginning, God did not become Word, but “God became Relationship” in a constant flow of love that gives and receives without ever appropriating anything (from the Trinity to us).

## Online conferences by Zoom

As the spiritual progression activities promoted by the association in Quebec will soon resume, and after having asked students to present an online conference, which today replaces our many in-person themes, I invite you to mark your calendar and plan your participation in these events.

These enriching activities via ZOOM encourage the meeting of unique people who, through their interpretation of the teachings, contribute to sharing and increasing our understanding of the subject.

The Zoom link for each of these conferences will be published as time progresses.

Looking forward to meeting you there.

## Illustrator wanted

_Claude Flibotte_
Sainte-Julie

I am collaborating with Georges MichelsonDupont on a three-volume project in French of the same type as the one already published on Jesus entitled: The Untold Story of Jesus: A Modern Biography from The Urantia Book. For those who have not seen a copy of this book, you can find it on Amazon Canada by searching with the English title.

The chosen topics concern the three revelations before that of Jesus, namely the fallen Planetary Prince Caligastia, Adam and Eve and Melchizedek. At the moment, it is the volume on Melchizedek that is the most advanced. Also, we are looking for a good illustrator or even several artists among you to illustrate the text produced. If you have talent to offer for this cause for the benefit of all readers of the French-speaking world, I invite you to contact me by email at the following address:

c_flibotte@videotron.ca.

Thank you in advance for your dedication!

## Problem and solution!

_Samuel Heine_
Reunion Island

“When a problem has a solution, there is no need to worry; even when a problem has no solution, worrying is useless...” (Dalai Lama)

I thought that it is precisely the path that goes from the problem to the solution that is itself the enriching adventure of our spiritual and eternal growth towards God. The harmonization of opposites in man and between men is, from the beginning, the adventure that leads us progressively towards God.

We are the last link in a chain of millions of years of progression and growth, what humanity is today is the current result of this growth and through the level of wisdom acquired in our lives, we educate, transmit and serve the younger generation to continue the building of the kingdom of God

This is the progressive realization of the ideal world here and beyond!

This activity allows several readers of different levels of understanding to share and study together the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. It promotes spiritual progress by allowing its participants to find practical applications to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ in their daily lives. This important step helps to maintain a broad perspective on concepts of truth.
