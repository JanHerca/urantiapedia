## Word from the President

_Maurice Migneault_
_AUQ President_
urantiamaurice@gmail.com

On February 6th, our annual general meeting was held in Drummondville, 37 people were present. How refreshing and energizing it was to spend a few hours with all these beautiful souls.

I don't know if any of you have ever had the experience of attending the debates of the House of Commons of the Canadian Parliament? It is not very edifying, it is not at all what we are shown on the news! Ungraceful behavior and irreverent speeches are the norm. How different from our own assemblies which always take place in harmony and good humor? This must surely be the reflection of a spiritual reality; all at the same table to share the fruits of the spirit.

> “_A group of mortals can experience spiritual unity, but they can never attain philosophic uniformity._” (<a id="a26_108"></a>[UB 103:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p1_1))

Thank you to all those who came to share and thank you also to those who offered us their life testimony. It is so comforting to see that we are not alone in supporting this Revelation. I end with this beautiful quote from Gandhi.

> “_It is better to put one's heart into prayer without finding words than to find words without putting one's heart into them._” — Gandhi

## Support our association

_Marc Belleau_
tresorier.auq@gmail.com

The year 2016 is already well underway and I would like to remind those who have not yet done so to send their annual dues payment by check to the following address: Urantia Association of Quebec, PO Box 304, St-Jérôme, QC, J7Z 5T9. You can also go to the Association website (http://urantiaquebec.ca/devenir_membre.php) and pay by PayPal. The cost of membership is $60.

It is through the financial support of its members that the Urantia Association of Quebec is able to pursue its mission. I believe that the most important aspect of this mission is the creation of a sense of belonging to a community, that of the readers of The Urantia Book. I remember the feeling I felt the first time I attended a conference organized by the AUQ; I realized that I was no longer alone in reading these magnificent writings, that I belonged to a very real community, my community, made up of people passionate about God. Without the activities organized by the AUQ, without the possibility of meeting and sharing in a group, this sense of belonging cannot exist. I think that this idea alone amply justifies membership in the AUQ.

Several projects are put forward by the Association. If you feel like it, make a donation to maintain the newsletters you receive; no matter the amount you wish to give, no help is refused. The publication of the monthly Réflectivité, the translation of Tidings and the journal of the Urantia Association International into French are projects worthy of support, because they participate in maintaining this feeling of belonging to our community; the first allows you to be in contact with readers from Quebec while the second, of international scope, allows you to be in contact with readers from all over the world. By reading these 2 newsletters, you are enriched by the reflection and experience of readers belonging to different and diverse cultures. These newsletters also allow readers to share their inner life with the community. You only have to tell us that you wish to allocate your donation to the publication of the newsletters when you make your payment. You can even specify which newsletter you wish to support.

The association also has a mandate to spread the revelation. The book sending program to poor countries like Africa is another way to support your association. This project gives people who do not have the financial means the opportunity to read The Urantia Book, to form groups and to advance the revelation. It is important to create and support the formation of study groups throughout the world so that the era of acceptance of The Urantia Book on a global scale can come about. Let us be inspired by the plan that Jesus himself followed for his public mission during his stay on our planet. During his 2-year journey in the Mediterranean, he prepared the ground for his apostles, personally teaching various groups and influential individuals in several cities so that the message later spread by the apostles would be favorably received. We too are in this preparatory phase for the era of The Urantia Book, but it will take much more than 2 years to prepare our world; Many groups must be created, and many leaders must emerge before this era can come about.

The role of the association is to help, stimulate and provoke today's readers and those of tomorrow during their spiritual journey on earth. Without your help this will not happen. Personally, I would like these future readers to have the same chance to be part of this great and beautiful community. The Urantia Association of Quebec will survive us all and will continue to welcome thousands of future readers and it is with this in mind that I will continue to serve and support it; I sincerely wish you to have the same privilege. $\square$

## New Online Study Group

_Gaetan Charland_
_Chairman of the Study Groups Committee (AUI)_

I participated in a new online study group designed for young readers in early December 2015. This new study group was started by Antonio Schefer and is facilitated by Jeffrey Wattles. It is international in scope and runs on a high-performance Internet platform called Zoom, which brings together and connects all participants. This Internet application allows participants to see each other if they wish, and the facilitator can share his screen, documents, PowerPoint presentations, and even videos. All sessions are recorded so that each participant can review the session at his or her convenience after it has been made available online by Antonio Schefer.

What is most remarkable and groundbreaking about this virtual study group is its content and protocol. With the expert assistance of Jeffrey Wattles, the group focuses its discussions on training leaders and teachers, exploring passages from the life and teachings of Jesus as recorded in The Urantia Book. But that is not all; it also urges participants to be actively involved at the conferences, making presentations and leading discussion workshops. The group also explores the methodology Jesus used to share and disseminate his teachings, and how each of us can, in our own way, adapt and apply the Master's methods in our own areas of influence.

It is very invigorating and encouraging to see an initiative such as this type of online study group. This initiative responds to the recommendations given to us by the revelators in the [“_Publication Mandate_”](/en/article/The_Publication_Mandate); namely to help train leaders and teachers and to establish thousands of study groups. These same revelators also encourage us to study the life of Jesus to target ways to fulfill our mission as teachers and leaders.

I infer that as more study groups embrace this program, we will see great changes not only in our lives, but in our families and communities. Should you wish to join this study group in English, or view a recording of a session, please contact Antonio Schefer at conference@triniteit.org.

## From drowsiness to wakefulness, to joy

_Paul-Yvan Deléglise & Roberte Roussel_
_Quebec_

The first phase of my life: childhood, adolescence, youth, I lived religiously, in the Catholic context of the time.

**Drowsiness**

To the university studies in philosophy and literature, was gradually added, on the social level, an increasingly marked DISAVOWAL of the Quebecers with regard to the authority of the Church, its liturgy, and its teaching, which led me, not to abandonment, but rather to a PROGRESSIVE SLEEP of my spiritual life.

**Unexpected meeting!**

Then a providential contact occurred at “_La Cabane à sucre du Cap!_”, during a meeting of retired teachers. At lunchtime, at dinner, I found myself next to a foreigner whose very first topic of conversation, surprisingly, was that she had undertaken a spiritual journey a few years ago! We met again, later. She then presented me with the heavy and impressive BLUE BOOK! She expressed the wish that I undertake to read it!

I decided to give it a try. A “Reading Group” recommended that I read the entire book, in one sitting, from cover to cover!

**Almost improbable attempt**

The Introduction and the beginning of Part I pleased me greatly. I was amazed at such great skill in writing about God, about the Divinity... But, when I came to the “enumeration” of the Grand Universe, to the surprising multiplicity of functions, to the fabulous number of Spirits populating the Central Universe, the Grand Universe and the Local Universes, I LITERALLY FALLEN!

It was too much for the earthling that I am, while Catholic theology had once so discreetly alluded to the <ins>7 choirs of Angels</ins>, to three of their leaders with familiar names, and to whom were attributed vaguely defined functions! It seemed difficult to me to accept such a deployment straight away, knowing them presented little, so little utility, so little urgency, during our current stay here below!

So the reaction came to me to put away the BIG BUBE VOUBME.

**Our Attachment to Jesus, and Part IV of Urantia.**

However, before definitively putting Urantia away, I wanted to consult my companion regarding such a decision. We knew perfectly well that the fourth part of the volume (at least a third) dealt with the Life of Jesus. We had a deep respect for Jesus, his life, his teaching. We therefore decided to begin reading this IVth Part together.

Since then, frequently, when we had enough time, we would project the text to be read onto the living room television screen. We would read it, comment on it, and try to understand it as best we could. We would postpone until the next reading the more complete understanding of the passages that remained obscure. We have always applied this technique of reading together since then.

The following references, like many others, have kept us constantly in awe!

- “_The child of promise had come into the world in exactly the same way as all babies before and since that day_” (<a id="a102_116"></a>[UB 122:8.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p8_2))
- Jesus accepts family responsibility, upon the death of his father. “_He became head of a human family_” (<a id="a103_107"></a>[UB 126:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p2_2))
- Jesus travels around the Mediterranean world as tutor to the son of a rich merchant from India. (<a id="a104_99"></a>[UB 129:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p2_9))
- Jesus goes to the Caspian Sea to continue his knowledge of men and peoples. (<a id="a105_79"></a>[UB 134:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p2_2))
- At the meal, Jesus invites his apostles to drink the cup of wine and eat the bread of remembrance. (<a id="a106_102"></a>[UB 179:5.1-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_1))
- Jesus does not die so that his father may forgive us. The individual is not tainted by original sin. (<a id="a107_104"></a>[UB 186:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/186#p5_1))

Reading Part IV connected us even more to Jesus. It opened the blue book to us in its entirety! Consequently, having finished this reading, we decided to start the RANDOM reading of Parts III, II, I.

This is what we did. So we went from one booklet, or one subject, according to the desire, the inspiration, the impulse, the curiosity of the moment; according to, often also, in connection with recent readings. A bit like in the following references:

&sdot; God is a Loving Father (<a id="a113_31"></a>[UB 2:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p5_2)). — It is an enormity to assert that God the Father required that His Son be executed in order that our sins might be forgiven! (<a id="a113_200"></a>[UB 149:2.2-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p2_2)); (<a id="a113_249"></a>[UB 186:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/186#p5_6)); (<a id="a113_296"></a>[UB 188:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p5_9)) — The mansion world. This is the place where we will complete our spiritual evolution in the afterlife, if we will enter it (<a id="a113_466"></a>[UB 15:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p7_5)); (<a id="a113_511"></a>[UB 30:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/30#p4_11)) &sdot; Origin and nature of the Thought Adjusters. They are the Guides of our spiritual journey. ([UB 107](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107)) &sdot; Is the fate of Lucifer settled? (<a id="a113_730"></a>[UB 45:1.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_11)) (<a id="a113_776"></a>[UB 54:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p6_7)) (<a id="a113_820"></a>[UB 67:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p4_7)) — The first human family. The first human couple. (<a id="a113_914"></a>[UB 62:5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p5)) &sdot; The History of Marriage, its evolution. ([UB 82](/en/The_Urantia_Book/82))

How does the volume appear to us now? Urantia presents a harmonious PANORAMA of total scope presenting the entire cosmic reality: Divinity, deities, spirit beings, mind-endowed beings called to ultimate spiritualization; and, equally and incredibly, human beings, to whom it is said, “Be ye perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect.”

Even matter is present in Urantia.

Urantia offers our minds a limitless field of investigation, and our free will a constant reminder to act in accordance with the divine will.

The Urantia vocabulary is of great precision, of great fidelity throughout this vast volume; its meanings demand constant attention, for they are not fully given at first. Precision comes here and there, little by little. Major reference: (INTRODUCTION: V. Personality Reality).

Very often, my partner and I, to free ourselves from material agitation, we take some time to read together. We find calm, peace and often great joy there!

Having completed the second reading of Part IV and having read almost all of the first three, we propose to resume reading the book in its entirety, this time from the very beginning, convinced that our vocabulary having been enriched, our reading will be made easier and we will draw from it light and motivation in abundance!

**Our answer**: When an aspiring reader asks us: “Who wrote this volume?” We answer: “First read a small part of this volume, then you will surely have the answer to your question!”

> “_8. Effort does not always produce joy, but there is no happiness without intelligent effort._” (<a id="a129_100"></a>[UB 48:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_10))

## Buy a book

**Every time you buy a “Urantia Book” (and others)** through the AUQ website, you arrive on Amazon, and the latter returns a small percentage (3 to 4%) of the amount of your purchase to the _Urantia Association_ simply because you went through the AUQ website to get to Amazon.

Pass this message on to all your friends who want to buy a book.

Here is the direct link to the AUQ website: http://urantia-quebec.ca/livre_achat_du_livre.php

This activity allows several readers of different levels of understanding to share and study together the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. It promotes spiritual progress by allowing its participants to find practical applications of the teachings of The Urantia Book in their daily lives. This important practice helps to maintain a broad perspective on concepts of truth.

You wish to participate or form a study group; we will be happy to assist you. If you wish to have your study group appear in this list, contact the person in charge, via email association.urantia.quebec@gmail.com or at 450-565-3323.
