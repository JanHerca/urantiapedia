## Word from the President

_Maurice Migneault_
_AUQ President_
urantiamaurice@gmail.com

Last year at this time, we were all caught up in the whirlwind of organizing the International Congress in Sherbrooke, but what did we individually keep from this experience?

Collaboration within a work team offers us the opportunity to discover new qualities in our brothers and in ourselves. But it is not only qualities that we discover and that others discover, there are also our weaknesses, intolerances, impatience, excessive demands, vain and costly searches for perfection, refusal to delegate and abusive control.

There has been “collateral” damage, injuries related to interactions. It is unfortunate to say, but all of these things are very real, even in activities whose purpose is spiritual progression. If man had only his human resources to help him manage these sometimes perilous situations, his progress would be very slow. But our Heavenly Father has foreseen all of these things and has given us the help necessary to emerge victorious from these human obstacles.

> “_True liberty is the fruit of self-control;_” (<a id="a28_50"></a>[UB 54:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p1_6))

If it is true that faith is the key that opens the door to the storehouse of God's resources, teamwork is the key that opens the door to the storehouse of man's resources. $\square$

> “_If each day or each week you achieve an understanding of one more of your fellows, and if this is the limit of your ability, then you are certainly socializing and truly spiritualizing your personality._” (<a id="a32_210"></a>[UB 100:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p4_6))

## Improve your study group!

_Gaétan G. Charland_
_Chairman of the UAI and AUQ Study Group Committee_

Have you ever felt that the study group you facilitate or participate in has become monotonous, does not satisfy your need for progress in understanding the teachings, or does not foster your desire for spiritual growth?

Many study groups have come and gone since the time of the first publication of The Urantia Book in 1955, and probably many more will be among them as well, and for many good reasons. But there are some of these groups that have disappeared because they have failed in their goals of expanding cosmic consciousness and enhancing spiritual perception. Not only have some study groups failed in both of these goals, but they have also failed in their teachings how to become better seeders of truth, how to be more involved in our spiritual emancipation through service to others, and how to better integrate the teachings into our lives.

> “_The world needs to see Jesus living again on earth in the experience of spirit-born mortals who effectively reveal the Master to all men._” (<a id="a43_145"></a>[UB 195:10.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_1))

I take as an example this quote which invites us to live our lives according to the teachings of Jesus and not to preach about him as many do, in order to live as best as possible the truth of the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of men, which Jesus so eloquently preached not only in words, but in the living examples of his life.

> “_I declare that the kingdom of heaven is the realization and acknowledgment of God’s rule within the hearts of men._” (<a id="a47_122"></a>[UB 141:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p2_1))

> “_This Book is given to those who are ready for it, long before the day of its world mission. Thousands of study groups are to be organized and the Book is to be translated into many languages. Then the Book will be available when man's battle for freedom is won and the world is once more made more fertile for the religion of Jesus and for the freedom of mankind_” (Source: [Publication Mandate](/en/article/The_Publication_Mandate))

Why did the revelators urge us to create thousands of study groups, train leaders and teachers? Except that they had a plan in mind, a plan that may seem so simple in its application that we fail to see its true, far-reaching mission to change the spiritual framework of this world. In order to change this framework of thought, should we not transform ourselves and become the bearers of this change? Could not study groups be a place through which we could accomplish much of this mission?

How can we answer this call to create thousands of study groups and train leaders and teachers? First, by making our study groups more intellectually and spiritually stimulating. How can we do this? By formulating a plan. A wise man named Benjamin Franklin once said, “If you don’t plan, then you are planning to fail!” I believe he was right, if we don’t formulate a plan for our study groups, we are likely to fail in the mission that has been given to us.

Here's how we can proceed if we want to make a plan.

A plan does not need to be complicated, it only requires a few basic principles, such as: setting goals, objectives and developing strategies. Make sure that everyone in your group agrees on this plan and helps in its development, this way, they will be more than willing to carry it out. The consensus of the group is very important if we want the study group to be interesting for each student. Let us remember, we are students and not just readers who participate in a group to socialize, we have an important mission to accomplish.

How does it work?

**A goal** is knowing where we want to go.

**Goals** are there to give us guidance on our path to our goal.

**Strategies** are actions to help us get where we want to go.

So, **let's say our goal would be this:**

To make our group more intellectually and spiritually interesting to new and old readers, men and women, while gently guiding them to become good teachers.

**The objectives can be:**

<ins>1st year</ins>

- We will study 10 booklets together, 5 in the first 3 parts of the book and 5 in the 4th part, the life of Jesus.
- We will study 3 different subjects.
- We will encourage everyone in the group to make a short presentation to the group on a topic of their choice.


**Strategies could be:**

- Ask the group to choose the booklets they would like to study in the first year.
- Choose articles published in the UAI Journal, they provide very good material for reflection while encouraging students to discover what other readers understand of the teachings, this will expand their cosmic awareness.
- Take a UBIS course of your choice within your study group, which will provide all participants with a highly effective educational tool to enhance spiritual insight while enlightening them on the values and effectiveness of integrating courses into their goal of intellectual and spiritual growth.
- Adopt a set of rules for how the group will study together.
- Review your strategies regularly if necessary.
- Use study aids available on many websites to increase the effectiveness of your studies.
- Ask participants from other study groups to present on different topics in your study group.
- Be innovative and creative, get out of your comfort zone.

<ins>2nd year</ins>

Evaluate progress made in the first year and readjust your goals and strategies.

Having a set of operating policies in the group will help keep everyone happy and moving in the right direction.

**Jeffrey Wattles, with the help of Antonio Schefer** has created a protocol for their online study group, some of these rules could very well help each of the hosts in facilitating their study group and thus ensuring that all participants benefit from an experience of intellectual and spiritual growth.

I have copied this protocol here for your benefit, take from it what is appropriate for your group's needs. This protocol was developed for an online study group using the Zoom platform. If you are interested in starting an online study group using this platform, please contact me, I will be more than willing to help you start your group using the Zoom platform.

### PROTOCOL FOR ONLINE STUDY GROUP

1. The host decides when it is time to start, welcomes everyone, explains protocol, makes necessary announcements, and hands the session over to the facilitator.
2. As an experiment for at least the first few weeks, we will pause in silence for a few seconds (10) after each reading and after each intervention by the participants. The goal is to allow the soul to listen and the spirit to express itself.
3. Mute your microphone when you are not speaking so that background noise does not disturb you and raise your hand if you want to speak before unmuting your microphone.
4. Please use the chat function only for questions related to the study session.
5. Use a headset if you can to improve sound quality and reduce background noise and echo when you speak.
6. Please do not type on your keyboard when your microphone is not muted.
7. Turn off your camera if you have problems with your internet connection to avoid loss of sound or video quality.
8. Some adaptation of Jesus' grievance procedure [see Paper 159:1.3 (p. 1762.5)] will be the method of resolving serious problems, if and when they arise with particular individuals.
9. Sessions may be recorded for future use for study purposes. Only active participants, future students, have access to the videos.
10. Turn off your camera if you do not want your image to be used for recordings.

A few years ago for the Study Group Symposium I created a Study Group Study Aid Manual which includes many helpful articles to enhance the quality of our learning experience, please contact me if you would like to receive a copy by email.

Enjoy your study group and be an active participant in their spiritual mission to the world. $\square$

## “Born from the spirit”

_Normand Laperle_
_Vice-president AUQ_

Sunday, May 15, 2016, we will have a theme day at the Le Dauphin Hotel in Drummondville. The theme will be: “**Born from the Spirit**”.

At the beginning, there will be a short presentation to help get into the subject. Then, there will be a period of sharing between us on the subject. I offer you a text from my research, on this subject.

### What is “Born of the Spirit”?

> “A child exists for about nine months before experiencing birth.
> 
> _But the birth of religion_ [(the management of our spiritual life)] _is not sudden; rather it is a gradual emergence._
> 
> _Nevertheless, sooner or later there is a day of birth. One does not enter the kingdom of heaven without being “born again_” — born of the Spirit. ” <a id="a137_151"></a>[UB 103:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p2_1)

I understand that “born again” and “born of the Spirit” are the same thing. I also understand that “entering the kingdom” presupposes that the person is already “born of the Spirit.” One does not exist without the other.

### What is this “entering the kingdom”?

Is this the world after death? The beyond? The morontia world? The time after fusion with the Adjuster?

In Jesus' day, “kingdom” was a common expression. It is certain that if the Bible or the Gospel had been written in our time, we would not use this word, today outmoded.

The Antidote dictionary defines “kingdom” as: “State governed by a king”. In the “Urantia Book” the word “kingdom” is used to designate a place or a political entity.

But in Parts I, II, and III of The Urantia Book, “kingdom” is also used as the word “domain” would be used today, in the sense of “identifying a whole.” For example, we find the expressions: “_the kingdom of good_” <a id="a149_215"></a>[UB 2:5.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p5_12), “_the kingdom of current spiritual values_” <a id="a149_302"></a>[UB 7:1.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/7#p1_10), “_the scientific kingdom of logical uniformity_” <a id="a149_394"></a>[UB 16:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_6), “_kingdom of the spirit_” <a id="a149_463"></a>[UB 34:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p7_6), etc.

In Part IV of “The Urantia Book” Jesus tried to get people out of the geographical and political sense of this word. He said: “_The kingdom of my Father does not concern things that are visible and material. [...] This kingdom is already now among you, for where <ins>the spirit of God teaches</ins>, where it <ins>guides</ins> the soul of man, there in reality is the kingdom._” <a id="a151_380"></a>[UB 137:8.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p8_8)

“_<ins>The Spirit of God</ins>” that “<ins>teaches</ins>” and “<ins>guides the soul</ins>_”? **That's the Adjuster!**

I understand that when we speak of the “kingdom” we are not referring to a place, but rather to the inner contact with the “spirit of God”: the Adjuster.

### Let's get back to “Born of the Spirit”?

It is clearly understood from the following quotes:

> “_Jesus said [to Nicodeme]: “Nevertheless, I declare to you, except a man be born of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.”_” (<a id="a161_144"></a>[UB 142:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p6_5))

“ _Nicodemus then said: But ***how can I begin to grasp this spirit*** which must ***recreate me*** in preparing me to enter the kingdom?_

***Jesus*** _answered: ***The spirit of the Father*** who is in heaven_ ***already dwells in you***.“ Therefore, the word ”_spirit_“ in ”_born of the spirit_" designates the Adjuster.

Jesus adds: “_If you want to ***let yourself be led by this spirit*** from above, you_ ***will very soon begin to see with the eyes of the spirit***”. Which implies that **we already have faith**. Therefore, “_to be born of the spirit_”, **is not to have faith for the first time**. We understand that **faith is a prerequisite** before being able to “_be born of the spirit_”.

Jesus continues: “_then, if ***you choose*** with all your heart the ***government of the spirit***, you will ***be born of spirit***, because the only purpose of your life will be to ***do the will of your Father*** who is in heaven._” <a id="a169_237"></a>[UB 142:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p6_7)

Here we are. The person has just been “born of the spirit”. One might think that “born of the spirit” is the same as “doing the will of your Father”. But no. There is more...

There are two key words in “_being of the spirit_”: “_born_” and “_spirit_.” We have defined “_spirit_.” I will now focus on the word “_born_.” Why specifically use this word? Is there a particular connotation to consider? I come to the conclusion that yes. “_Born_” refers to the precise moment of birth. The moment we are “_born again_.” The “very beginning” of the “_doing the will_” of the father. This is why in the previous quote Jesus mentions “_if you_ ***choose***.”

I come to the conclusion that by “born of the spirit” we must understand: “choose to do the will of the father.” That is what “born of the spirit” is.

One might wonder why create an expression specifically to mark this event? It is because it is a moment that marks a spiritual life in a significant way. A tipping point to which one will want to refer. Why? “_For the sole purpose of your life is to do the will of your Father who is in heaven._”

### But what does that change in my life?

Come discuss it with us on May 15 in Drummondville to listen and share.

Come with your ideas. Here are some ideas for inspiration:

- **The influence on what I am (“to be”)** My inner relationship with myself. When faith arrives, what does it change? Do I feel like I have “chosen the leadership of the spirit” in my life? What does the “partnership” with the spirit change? The directions and adjustments that I give to my inner life. The fruits of the spirit. The quests for meaning. Personal growth.
- **The influence on what I do (“do”)** My external relationship with others. Becoming a better doer with others. Getting involved in activities. Reaching out to others. Managing human relationships. Applying morality and ethics. Influencing others by example. Helping. Serving.
- **And the balance in all this...?**

Working on “being” and “doing”.
The influence of “being” on “doing”.
The influence of “doing” on “being”.
Throw it all away... $\square$

## Thematic

**Sunday <ins>May 15</ins>** 2016 (10:00 a.m. — 4:00 p.m.), you are invited to Drummondville for a theme on “**Birth of the Spirit**”.

Looking forward to meeting you in large numbers.

Hotel le Dauphin, 600 Boulevard Saint-Joseph, Drummondville, QC

This activity allows several readers of different levels of understanding to share and study together the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. It promotes spiritual progress by allowing its participants to find practical applications of the teachings of The Urantia Book in their daily lives. This important practice helps to maintain a broad perspective on concepts of truth.
