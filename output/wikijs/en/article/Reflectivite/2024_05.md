Dear readers and esteemed members of the association,

We are preparing to experience an exceptional year within the Urantia movement, marked by a return to normality imbued with a renewal of hope for the future of our two fraternal organizations dedicated to the dissemination of the _Urantia Book_ and its teachings. The year has already started well, with the holding of an international congress in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, an event in which several Quebec members of the Urantia Association of Quebec had the pleasure of participating.

In-person conferences are also planned around the world, hosted by various national Urantia associations. The Urantia Book Fellowship is hosting its annual meeting, The Summer Study Session, under the theme “Igniting the Word,” in Missouri from July 24-27. My wife Line and I will have the honor of leading a workshop on study groups. For those interested in participating, I invite you to visit [urantiabook.org](urantiabook.org).

Since the dawn of time, man has sought to know the origin, history and destiny of the universe in which he lives. Science, philosophy and religions have tried to provide valid answers but in vain, always leaving man dissatisfied. By presenting the concept of I AM and its diversification, _The Urantia Book_ reveals to us a rational explanation of the genesis of reality but these concepts are judged by some readers as too intellectual and having little or nothing to do with our daily lives.

In this series of three presentations based on the Introduction and papers 104, 105 and 106, I will endeavor to show that what is “above in eternity” conditions the becoming of what is “below, here on Urantia”, thus giving a new and enlarged perspective of our universal career.

Georges was born in Paris, France, in 1947. He was part of the team that spent fifteen years revising and correcting the French translation.

Georges became a Trustee of Urantia Foundation in September 1995. In 1999, he and Dorothy Elder launched the Urantia Book International School (UBIS), the first online school dedicated to the in-depth study of The Urantia Book. Today, Georges is Urantia Foundation's International Vice President, Chief Translation Officer, and Director of UBIS.

## Videoconference on Sunday May 26, 2024 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.

**Personal art of living**

_Gilles Mauroy_, France

***The Urantia Book*** gives us cultural elements on the Age of Light and Life, the supreme destiny of a material planet inhabited by mortals. It also informs us that a mortal can personally attain the status of light and life, even on an isolated world like Urantia. What does the life of an individual who has attained such a personal status look like and how to achieve it? Gilles invites us on a little journey through an art of living starting from human needs and leading to personal happiness.

Gilles was born in the south-east of France where he spent his adolescence mainly occupied by his studies and the practice of competitive alpine skiing. Between the ages of 13 and 17, despite his atheist education, Gilles became aware of the quest for eternal perfection as a meaning to his life. A few years later, ***The Urantia Book*** invited itself into his life and has accompanied him ever since.

Gilles has a background and career as a scientific engineer. He is currently a logistics software consultant with expertise in demand forecasting and replenishment.

Gilles has been participating for several years in courses and workshops on the integration of Nonviolent Communication (NVC), a tool that he finds relevant to support personal, spiritual and social transformations. He is renovating his residence in the Alpes Maritimes in France in order to be able to host spiritual retreats whose objective is to offer a framework allowing trainees to develop living communion with the divine spirit within.

## The CHRIST EXPERIMIENT'S — The School of Ambassadors

<figure id="Figure_6" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/Reflectivite/Ambassadeurs.jpg">
</figure>

The Ambassadors School is in its second year introducing the course **The Ministry of the Master**. It offers new perspectives on sharing the knowledge of the book, in a natural way and without offending people who want to know more about divine reality.

Here is the students’ testimony:

“It is a very powerful course which reminded me of all the riches of divine teachings and particularly those of the Master! My inner life has gained in intimacy with the Father and with the Son and my desire to do the will of God has been consolidated!”

“It is a step forward towards the responsibility of fraternity among us through the example of Jesus and thanks to the love that the Father gives us.”

“This course is transformative. It gives us a taste for serving in brotherhood and in the love of the Father who is the supreme reality. It is transformative, but at the same time it leads us to want to do the will of God.”

**UBH MARIAN ROWLEY to JACQUES WEISS**

_Chicago, Illinois, May 11, 1958_

Dear Mr. Weiss,

We are delighted to receive your very interesting letter of April 30th concerning the translation of The Urantia Book which you are currently making. You have apparently made a great deal of progress in a very short time.

The task of translation requires not only technical knowledge of both languages, but also a sympathetic understanding of the concepts expressed in ***The Urantia Book***, and I can well understand that in the process of translation you will probably build up a study group of people who will become genuinely interested in the teachings of the Book.

Come with me, I'll take you to the 12th International Congress 2024 of the International Urantia Association “***Nature and Nurture of the soul***” “***The nature and the culture of the soul***” which took place from Friday March 29 to Sunday March 31, 2024 at the Maritime Conference Center, in the city of Baltimore in the United States.

A superb, comfortably furnished center, with indoor swimming pool, equipped with 232 rooms, 55 meeting rooms and an auditorium that can accommodate more than 350 people.

The name Maritime, referring to everything related to the navy, has inspired more than one reader to the following quote from The Urantia Book:

Hello dear friends,

I am writing to tell you about my participation in the International Urantia Association conference which was held in Baltimore, Maryland from Thursday March 28 to Sunday March 31, 2024. I really enjoyed this conference whose theme was based on the soul: “_The Nature and Nurture of the Soul_”, nurture meaning the culture of the soul, that is to say the way in which we nourish it, maintain it and cultivate it.

## A hypothesis about personality

**God is spirit and energy**

In this simple description we have the personality aspect which is designated by the word “God”, because this term always designates personality (<a id="a215_146"></a>[UB 0:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p2_10)), then we have the description of the nature of God in that he is as much spirit as energy. Spirit in the sense that he is conscious, divine and perfect, capable of willing and choosing. In reference to the quote <a id="a215_401"></a>[UB 1:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p3_4), the spirit of God is absolute, in the Son it is unqualified and in the Spirit it is universal, then by the union of the three in deity, it is infinite. Energy because it is the origin of the Isle of Paradise, the perfect opposite of the spiritual Son in its nature and function, all that has to do with things and the multiple manifestations of energy. In fact, what distinguishes personality from material, mind and spirit is that these last three enumerations are all diversified manifestations of energy, while personality is something else. By his personality, as Universal Father and as First Source and Center, the Father far transcends what he is as material energy, mental energy and spirit energy (<a id="a215_1149"></a>[UB 1:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p7_7)).

## Address to the Urantia Brotherhood

This text represents a distillation of the guidance or observations made by the revelators to the Forum members, which Christie meticulously conveyed to the members of the Urantia Brotherhood. It is interesting to note that several of these statements also appear in the Publication Mandate. They remain relevant in our time and would be wise to take them into consideration.

## Gravities and mental influences

_André Desjardins_
St-Alexis-des-Monts

Our life has always been based on external influences in order to form our personality from a young age. What we are today is the result of our past actions according to the influences received. The influence of our parents, our educators, our entourage, our surroundings and our religious education has shaped our personality. These influences acquired by education, by conviction or by personal principles lead to seeking common points with other followers having the same ideals and forming an alliance aspiring to the same collective objectives. The desire to belong to a family whether familial, social, racial or criminal is part of the natural desires of each individual. Our perceived influences whether material or spiritual always pass through mental gravity before manifesting themselves in concrete action.

Everyone goes their own way
This is your destiny
What's yours?
First of all mine

Your mission on this earth
Remains entirely
It is that of revealing
What is My Will

And what better way to get there?
Than learning to achieve
The multitude of Truths
That I taught you
