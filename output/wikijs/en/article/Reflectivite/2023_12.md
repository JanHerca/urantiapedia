_Gaetan G. Charland_
president@urantiaqc.org

Dear members and friends of the association,

Time flies by, doesn't it? It seems like we've only just started the year and now we're already approaching the Christmas and New Year festivities. This period brings me back to the excellent conference entitled “Au théâtre du temps”, presented by Sophie Malicot during the virtual conferences organized by the Urantia Association of Quebec. André Malraux said: “Lost time is the time during which we are at the mercy of others.” This invites us to reflect on the use of time over the past year.

Over the past month, I have had the pleasure of attending two other enriching conferences. One was on the material mind presented by Claude Flibotte, while Assane Diagne led another, more restricted conference on the Planetary Government and the 12 groups of super angels who oversee the progress of our planet.

_Gilles Bertrand_
Quebec

At the request of the President of the AUQ, it is proposed to us as students, participating in a study group of the _Urantia Book_, to submit some ideas on the advantages of meeting regularly in this form of communication as such. Notwithstanding this consideration which suggests this form of meeting in the opinion of our planetary supervisors, we can therefore show our capacities to recognize the merits of this request.

There is no need to be an expert in writing or literature to express your opinion or vision on these current meetings. The main purpose of these writings is simply to show the benefits of reading, study and fraternal sharing among us in our regular meetings of the study groups of the _Urantia Book_.

## Conference

**Sunday December 3, 1 p.m.**

Mark Belleau

**Material wealth vs spiritual wealth?**

Do we have false conceptions about material wealth, conceptions that come to us from our religious education, from certain spiritualist currents of our time and which condemn the accumulation of material goods? The Church has often praised poverty as a means of accumulating wealth in heaven. We are constantly confronted with the need to work to accumulate the goods necessary for our survival while continuing our spiritual growth. Jesus, too, had to reconcile these two dimensions of his human experience during his incarnation on Urantia. During this conference, I invite you to explore in more depth how he faced this challenge.

## Justice and judgment

Hello everyone,

Justice and judgment are important acts in our superuniverse and this is how the Ancients of Days surrounded themselves to apply the just judgment of equity.

**Ancients of Days**

1) First, the Ancients of Days themselves are from the Paradise Trinity.

SUB-CLASSIFICATION: The 3rd of the Supreme Personalities of the Trinity

PROGENY OF: The Paradise Trinity

FUNCTIONAL AREA: The Seven Superuniverses

POPULATION: 21, stationary

_The Urantia Book_: Paper 18:3 and see below.

## Guardian of destiny in relation to our mental circuit

<figure id="Figure_5" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">

In this study we will see that the work of our guardian angels, also called seraphic guardians of destiny, is accomplished through our mental circuit as does our Adjuster (<a id="a172_172"></a>[UB 117:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p7_1)) although there does not appear to be any coordination between these two entities.

**Origin of the Seraphim**

The seraphim are a creation of the Divine Minister of our local universe of Nebadon (<a id="a176_85"></a>[UB 38:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/38#p1_1)). The Divine Minister being a daughter of the Infinite Spirit, the God of the mind. Although the seraphim are of spiritual nature and origin (<a id="a176_269"></a>[UB 38:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/38#p2_1)), they work as much on the spiritual level as on the physical level (<a id="a176_380"></a>[UB 38:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/38#p2_3)). This observation logically includes the intermediate level between the two levels described above, that is, in relation to its human subject, the morontia level of the soul and the intellect or material mind.

## Psychic Circles and the Supreme Being

<figure id="Figure_6" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">

</figure>

_Jean Lapierre_

This document relates to the psychic circles (Paper 110:6) and their relationship to what is important to master them. I believe that the mastery of these circles has been largely misunderstood and this is due, I think, to our Judeo-Christian monotheistic heritage where the emphasis was placed only on God the Universal Father, the Source Center of All. This monotheism was good because it allowed the cleansing of a host of gods: it was anarchy. However, we must not make monotheism a dogma because that would obscure in particular the Eternal Son, the Infinite Spirit, the existential Trinity, the two experiential deities, etc.

On a material world and also on the worlds of houses, the conquest of the seven psychic circles concerns the potential for spiritual growth of a personality before its fusion. We deduce that this conquest of the seven circles can also be done on our material world, that is to say, reach the first psychic circle (the fusion could also be done, but it is very exceptional at present). In this booklet, however, we are told that an individual of the seventh circle can know God and be conscious of his filiation with Him as well as the one who is in the first circle.

## Suggestion — Suggested improvements for study groups

<figure id="Figure_6b" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">

_Eric Tarissan_

Following a certain experience of study groups, which are undeniably essential spiritual nourishment, I find it important to make some improvements.

Meeting via video conference has brought about some change with its good and bad sides.

<figure id="Figure_6c" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Reflectivite/2023_12/013.jpg">
</figure>

This is why, in order to have more effective and constructive meetings, I propose the following points:

1) It would be constructive to read the passages that the group is studying, BEFORE the members meet. Why?

Because once back together, the members of the group who had questions about the chapters concerned will then be able to ask their questions and, thus, keep the group in the context of the text.

2) This way of doing things will surely make it possible to lighten the content of the sharing which, too often, extends well beyond the subject; thus promoting a more consistent progression of the Book and a more harmonious and constructive reading.
3) Then, if someone wants to share something related to the passage that has just been read, it would be necessary for this sharing to provide additional elements related to the text, in order to avoid unnecessary repetition of what has just been read.
4) It also happens very often that a person wants to add a simple remark to what has just been said, but finds themselves obliged to wait for the other people who had already raised their hands to share, so that when the person comes to speak, they find themselves out of context and, sometimes, in a frustrating or exasperated way.

So, to avoid this kind of situation, in the case where a person simply wants to make an observation or a quick share, then it would be possible for them to simply raise their thumbs in the air, like this: :+1: making it possible to express themselves spontaneously and quickly.

These new ways of doing things will, I hope, allow us to move forward more quickly and with respect, in the parts studied, and in a more constructive, harmonious and direct manner.

Sincerely, amicably and fraternally!

Since last month, here is the progress of the printing and publication project of the book “The Untold Story of Jesus” in French. The translation is finished and is being revised.

Our goal is to reach $25,000.00 to see the publication of the magnificent “Untold Story of the Life of Jesus”. To date, we are at 19.75% of our goal, or $4,983.09.

We thank you in advance for your generosity which will allow this book to end up in the hands of hundreds of families and inspire them to live a better life with everyone.

_Dr William S Sadler MD_

The composition of this text is based on the book “The Urantia Book Workbooks, volume III” by Dr. William S. Sadler, MD.

**Personality as detailed in _The Urantia Book_.**

**I. PERSONALITY OF THE DIVINITY**

**I. God is an infinite personality.**

This Infinite ONE that we call God, this First Source Center designating him as spirit and energy, is truly personal. Since he is Infinite, his personality is also infinite.
<br style="clear:both;"/>

> Do not permit the magnitude of God, his infinity, either to obscure or eclipse his personality. “He who planned the ear, shall he not hear? He who formed the eye, shall he not see?” The Universal Father is the acme of divine personality; he is the origin and destiny of personality throughout all creation. God is both infinite and personal; he is an infinite personality. The Father is truly a personality, notwithstanding that the infinity of his person places him forever beyond the full comprehension of material and finite beings.

This activity allows several readers of different levels of understanding to exchange and study together the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. It promotes spiritual progress by allowing its participants to find practical applications to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ in their daily lives. This important approach allows us to keep a broad point of view on the concepts of truth. You wish to participate or form a study group; we will be happy to assist you. If you wish to have your study group appear in this list, contact the person in charge, via email association.urantia.quebec@gmail.com or at 450-565-3323.
