## Word from the President

_Line St-Pierre_
president@urantiaqc.org

Recently I received this unusual request from George, a student of the Book, and I invite you to join us in taking this special time to give thanks to our Heavenly Father.

In the newscasts, the networks announced that they were expecting an audience of more than 100 million for the Super Bowl. There is an extraordinary spirit of rejoicing and celebration, but there is still something missing in all of this: Where is the divine?

Even Christmas and Easter days have become celebrations of how much savings we can enjoy on Black Friday days and how much candy the Easter Bunny will bring. God wants you to enjoy all your experiences as He experiences what you experience. However, we will together express our noblest feelings to Him either by offering a prayer, a song, or playing a piece of music according to our interest at that moment. Let us take this time in unison and pray for a better world that thirsts for Truth, Righteousness and having a higher consciousness.

Mark your calendars and be part of this cosmic event on June 21st at 3:54pm GMT. God and you!

## AUQ 2019 Membership

_Marc Belleau — Treasurer_
_Lasalle_

The year 2019 is already well underway and I would like to remind you that it is time to renew your AUQ membership, if you have not done so yet. For those who have already sent their membership, a huge thank you!
Without your financial support, the AUQ cannot continue its projects aimed at energizing the Urantia movement in Quebec, supporting the formation of study groups, promoting the book and its teachings. Several services are offered by your association, whether it is the organization of themes, the updating and maintenance of its website, the creation of supplementary literature or social activities allowing readers to meet and fraternize. Membership, at a cost of $60/year, gives you the right to vote at annual general meetings, the possibility of holding a position on the board of directors and sitting on one or more committees. In addition, you automatically become a member of the Urantia Association of Canada. You will find more information on the AUQ website at the following address: http://urantia-quebec.ca/devenir_membre.php. I would like to remind you that no tax receipt can be issued for the membership fee.

Have you considered making a donation to your association? No matter the amount, what matters is to put your shoulder to the wheel to help the AUQ in the accomplishment of its mission. It is also a good way to reduce what you pay annually to the government for the benefit of a cause in which you believe. In fact, donations are tax deductible. The AUQ sends a receipt to all donors every January, regardless of the amount of the donation. A little reminder, don't forget to update your address with Line St-Pierre, communications manager. You can send her an email at the following address: president@urantiaqc.org.

Would you like to see your donation go to a specific project? I suggest you support the PIRT (Prisonner Inquiry Response Team) program which aims to promote the _Urantia Book_ in Quebec prisons. Chris Gravel, one of the people in charge of this project, has already sent copies of the book to prisons in Quebec and Canada. To date, we have received 3 requests from inmates who wish to receive their own copy. You just have to send your donation by mail by writing PIRT on your check; we will know that it must be used for this specific program. It costs about $45 to purchase and send the book, depending on where the book is sent. You can also make your payment via the AUQ website on the http://urantia-quebec.ca/ home page; you just have to press the button “donation to the Urantia Association of Quebec”. You will be redirected to the Association's PayPal site. You do not need to open an account to make the payment, a simple credit card will suffice. If none of these methods appeal to you, I will be at the Annual General Meeting, faithful to the post, on April 27th and I will be happy to collect your donation. Hoping to see you at this next meeting.

## Testimony

_Eric Martel_
_Joliette_

Hello everyone,

We are all keen to see the success of the 5th Revelation. Of course, it will take a long time. It is happening on a time scale that is not really understandable to us. Nevertheless, I regularly ask myself the question, what can I do on my scale to contribute to the enterprise? First of all, obviously, try to put the teachings of the Book into practice and transmit to those around me the truths that I have discovered, without necessarily talking about the Book. Then, form a study group, which I have managed to do and for the first time last year, I made a donation to the Urantia Association International (UAI). For the moment, this is what I have found to do that is within my power.

Last week I received an email from the UAI asking if I would accept
that my name be published as a donor in their 2018 annual report, without indicating the amount, in order to encourage other potential donors. I of course accepted.

I then asked myself the question, how many readers are there in Quebec and Canada and how many of them contribute financially to the mission of the UAI? I had no difficulty finding the answer and I was amazed by the numbers.

Although the exact number of readers in Canada is not known precisely, because many of them do not contact the organizations, the known number on the list of French-speaking readers is 560 people and 300 for English-speaking readers.

How many readers do you think contributed financially to the UAI in 2018 for all of Canada? The answer is 17!

So, I asked myself the same question again, what can I do? The answer is simple; write to you, give you these numbers and ask you, what can you do?

Although the mission of the Book is spiritual, we live in a material world and money is an indispensable material “means” to carry out the 5th Revelation in time.

Although Jesus never personally handled the finances of the apostolic group, he and his apostles could not have accomplished anything if they had not been financially supported by believers, poor and rich.

The Book teaches us that a group of individuals is much stronger than the sum of the individuals who compose it.

With this in mind, I encourage you to give what you can, whether it is to the UAI or to the Foundation. It is very easy to do, just go to their website.

## From the intellectual to the experiential

_Guy Perron_
_Montreal_

**How are we challenged by the incomparable teachings of The Urantia Book?**

We have all experienced over the years that we are all affected differently by any external stimulus we receive. This applies to almost everything. One person likes a certain movie or series and another does not at all. One person is a classical music fan and another is more into jazz or pop. One person cannot understand why another person is vegetarian, let alone vegan.

Some are deeply affected by what they read in The Urantia Book, others not at all. Some are quite comfortable in their cozy material comforts, others are bored by them. Some are curious, others barely. It is interesting to note that even among those who identify as readers of The Urantia Book, the effects on the individual can vary greatly.

**Let your will be done here on earth as it is done in heaven.**

Some are glad to read the book and to know its writings; they seem quite satisfied thus. A better idea of God, of our relation to Him and of Him to us, a better perspective of the universe and the cosmos in which we live, a better knowledge of our world and its evolution as well as of its inhabitants and the development of the races, a greater intellectual understanding of the life of Jesus and his teachings, all this already brings much that is new and informative.

They are quite content with mental consciousness—the understanding of the idea of God. Certainly, a beautiful and good intellectual satisfaction.

**Let your will be done and not mine.**

Others, driven by a more intense curiosity and a growing inner motivation, have the desire to explore more deeply, to venture further, to better understand experientially what is this new reality that is emerging in their life, their soul, a co-creation in which they are involved with their divine monitor and which continues to grow according to their degree of involvement.

Their perspective of revelation then progresses from a book of great knowledge to a book of morontia nourishment for their own expanding soul seeking to attain first spiritual birth and then fusion with the indwelling Divine Presence.

What a grandiose goal, completely in line with the axis of progression, manifestation of the emerging will of the realization of the ideal of God in us, by each of us, in communion with Him, and in collaboration with Him. What an adventure far beyond the ordinary that can completely fill our life on many levels. We can linger there and even stop there and feel an increased satisfaction. Certainly, a beautiful and good philosophical satisfaction.

**Father, it is my will to do your will...and I do it!**

However, others, driven by a deep inner spiritual force, cannot stop there. They feel this cosmic vigor deep within them. They are already beginning to perceive that even here on this planet, there are no limits to their progress except those they impose on themselves.

And these same limits are pushed back by God as they intensify their quest for perfection as our Father invites us to do.

"_4. We must choose the divine will with all our heart. We must annihilate the inert center of indecision._

_5. Not only do you recognize the Father's will and choose to do it, but you have unreservedly consecrated and dynamically dedicated yourself to carrying out that will in an effective manner._ ” <a id="a107_195"></a>[UB 91:9.5-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p9_5)

“_Men forget all too often that God is the greatest experience in human existence. Other experiences are limited in nature and content, but the experience of God has no other limits than the capacity of creatures to understand, and this experience by itself increases this capacity._” <a id="a109_285"></a>[UB 117:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p6_9)

When men seek God, they seek everything. When they find God, they have found everything. The search for God is a boundless outpouring of love accompanied by the surprising discovery of a new and greater love to be outpoured.

**Know God and serve men.**

And all this expansion is offered to each of us and takes on its full value from the moment we become true living fascicles by being involved in devoted and disinterested service to God and to our fellow men, animated more and more by this faith, this living faith which leads us to manifest abundantly in everything and everywhere in all our interactions, a multitude of fruits of the Spirit.

> “_7. And you must have faith—living faith._” (<a id="a117_48"></a>[UB 91:9.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p9_8))

> _Belief has reached the level of faith when it motivates life and shapes the way of living... Faith is a living attribute of authentic personal religious experience._

_Belief always limits and binds; faith unfolds and liberates. Belief binds, faith liberates. But living religious faith is more than an association of noble beliefs, more than an exalted system of philosophy; it is a living experience concerned with spiritual meanings, divine ideals, and supreme values; it knows God and serves men._ ” <a id="a121_337"></a>[UB 101:8.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p8_1)

How far do we take the adventure? The choice is ours.

> “_There is in the mind of God a plan which embraces every creature of all his vast domains, and this plan is an eternal purpose of boundless opportunity, unlimited progress, and endless life. And the infinite treasures of such a matchless career are yours for the striving!_” (<a id="a125_279"></a>[UB 32:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p5_7))

> “_The goal of eternity is ahead! The adventure of divinity attainment lies before you! The race for perfection is on! whosoever will may enter, and certain victory will crown the efforts of every human being who will run the race of faith and trust, depending every step of the way on the leading of the indwelling Adjuster and on the guidance of that good spirit of the Universe Son, which so freely has been poured out upon all flesh._” (<a id="a127_442"></a>[UB 32:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p5_8))

Good progress to all!

> “_Can you not advance in your concept of God’s dealing with man to that level where you recognize that the watchword of the universe is *progress?* Through long ages the human race has struggled to reach its present position. Throughout all these millenniums Providence has been working out the plan of progressive evolution. The two thoughts are not opposed in practice, only in man’s mistaken concepts. Divine providence is never arrayed in opposition to true human progress, either temporal or spiritual. Providence is always consistent with the unchanging and perfect nature of the supreme Lawmaker._” (<a id="a131_609"></a>[UB 4:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p1_2))

Here are some additional passages that will allow us to deepen our reflections on the subject.

> “_Morality has its origin in the reason of self-consciousness; it is superanimal but wholly evolutionary. Human evolution embraces in its unfolding all endowments antecedent to the bestowal of the Adjusters and to the pouring out of the Spirit of Truth. But the attainment of levels of morality does not deliver man from the real struggles of mortal living. Man’s physical environment entails the battle for existence; the social surroundings necessitate ethical adjustments; the moral situations require the making of choices in the highest realms of reason; the spiritual experience (having realized God) demands that man find him and sincerely strive to be like him._” (<a id="a135_675"></a>[UB 5:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p5_1))

---

> “_Happiness and peace of mind follow pure thinking and virtuous living as the shadow follows the substance of material things._” (<a id="a139_132"></a>[UB 131:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/131#p3_3))

## Bravo and thank you

_Real Boucher,_
_Three Rivers_

The earth turns. And in its movement it carries all these seekers of God.

The February 2019 Réflectivité clearly shows this back and forth of questioning on the origin... energy... God...

UB readers happily enjoy scrolling through the pages of the said “revelation”.

Some people have more spiritual understanding and intuition which they share in the language of the Book in the publications of “Réflectivité” ... ... ...

Novices from outside (including myself, even after two readings of the UB) remain astonished, questioned, even suspicious...

Well done and thank you all the same for the work on the “Réflectivité” edition.
