## THE LIGHT

_Pierre Sauvageau_
_St-Alexis-des-Monts_

Ultimately, it is not only what we understand from what we read that matters, but the chain of thoughts that this reading provokes.

For example, we find in the traditional Gospels the following passage: “_And you, he said, who do you say that I am? Simon Peter answered, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. Jesus answered him again, Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonas, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven_” ([Matthew 16:15, 16, 17](/en/Bible/Matthew/16#v15)). Although I understand the scope of this passage, it leads me to another thought: although the Father had placed the truth on Peter's conscience, how is it that he, Peter, recognized and accepted it? No doubt through his own deductions Peter had come to recognize that Jesus was the Christ, the Messiah announced by the prophets, and that the Father had come to confirm the apostle's thinking. By analogy and at another level, I know many people to whom the L.U. is presented and who are quick to seek out the apparent errors or ideas that make them discredit the Book: they get tangled up in the problem of the 46 or 48 chromosomes, they point out the eugenics inherent in the book when it speaks of the elimination of degenerate lines, are quick to emphasize the racist aspect ”_black men were the most backward_" ([UB 64:6.25](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p6_25)), and for a fervent evangelist, the fact that the L. U removes Christ's status as the Third Person of the Trinity to demote him to being only the 611,121 Michael. So the question arises: why do I, like others, succeed in explaining its apparent errors and are more touched by the magnificence of the entire work of the L. U?

Let us take another example of the chain of thoughts that certain passages arouse. We read in the Gospels: “_The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness does not see it_”. I would dare to add to the Scripture: however, the light illuminates the darkness. The light of the L. U. illuminates many aspects: after having been dazzled by the description of the celestial places as described in the chapters dealing with the world of mansions, after having been enhanced by the teachings of Christ inherent in the fourth part of the L. U., after having been enlightened on different aspects, notably concerning reincarnation: The idea of reincarnation was a “_relict of the teachings of Adam_” ([UB 86:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p4_6)) on the successive attribution of new morontia bodies on the worlds of mansions. It also happened that the light of the L. U. revealed an aspect of the social reality that surrounds me. Good conduct “_static and traditional morality exceed animality only by a very small amount._” ([UB 12:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p5_7)). Yes, this little morality that lines the daily life of those around me is little more than an animality. Seeing myself surrounded by animals troubled me to the highest degree. And my rationalizations, my appeals to Christian charity were not enough to remove from me what the light of the L.U. had just revealed. Following the dazzling light, one of its consequences is that it also makes one blind. I therefore had to avoid the pitfall that the concepts of the L.U. become like a net over voids that can cause anxiety and contradictions, no longer that they become a book of ready-made answers. Fortunately, other passages, like pearls of wisdom, enhance my existence like this one: “_And it is not so much what mind comprehends as what mind desires to comprehend that insures survival; it is not so much what mind is like as what mind is striving to be like that constitutes spirit identification_” ([UB 111:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_5)). Thus from one passage to the next an acuity is woven that makes me become both a more accomplished human and a more enlightened and lucid son of God.

> The good effort of each man benefits all men; ([UB 12:7.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p7_11))

## How Midwayers Prepared for the Coming of The Urantia Book

_Gilles Brien_
_Laval_

Emanuel Swedenborg. Here is a Swedish scientist from the time of Newton, a prolific inventor and precursor of great discoveries in mineralogy, anatomy and psychology, who abandoned his work at the age of 56 in order to make men discover a “rational spirituality” based on visions that he said he had with the beyond. Swedenborg claimed to have received a divine mission and affirmed to have spoken with angels and spirits, nothing less. He relates his visions with a good faith that cannot be contested in a journal written for his personal use, a document that covers a period of more than 15 years. In 1743, in a letter to his friend Dr. Hartley, Swedenborg wrote: "I have been called to a sacred function by the Lord himself, who manifested himself in person before me his servant. Then he opened my sight so that I could see into the spiritual world. He granted me to speak with spirits and angels...”.

Looking back over the dozens of books Swedenborg subsequently wrote, one cannot help but be struck by the similarities between the descriptions of some of his “visions” and the revelations in The Urantia Book, particularly regarding morontia life. Of course, there are discrepancies, and there is no evidence that Swedenborg was contacted by mediums. But for UB readers whetted by the revelations about the mansion world and life on Jerusem, Swedenborg's revelations provide detailed and astounding information.

Swedenborg's goal in anatomy and physiology before his late spiritual conversion was the search for the soul. He had confidence that he would reach this goal with divine permission. Swedenborg was a man of reason who had always been attracted by the mystery of creation, the nature of God, the functions of the soul, its connection with the body. The soul appeared to him as the masterpiece of the creator; he believed that a more complete study of the mechanism of the body would give him a more exact knowledge of the soul and that this knowledge would make him see God more closely.

The first work that Swedenborg drew from his visions was written in Latin and bears a title that is out of place: “The Celestial Arcana, contained in the Holy Scripture or Word of the Lord, unveiled in an explanation of Genesis and Exodus, to which is joined an account of the marvelous things seen in the world of spirits and in the heaven of angels.” This book consists of eight volumes published in London from 1749 to 1756, but without the name of author, publisher, or city.

The nature of Heaven, its division, the description of the sun of Heaven, the nature of its heat and light are the first subjects treated by Swedenborg. They are also the first subjects which pique the curiosity of the readers of the UB who have studied the 46th booklet on the Seat of the Local System. Swedenborg explains that the spiritual world and the material world are similar, except that the things which compose the spiritual world are composed of spiritual substances and forms. With regard to space, and this is probably one of Swedenborg's most interesting statements, the inhabitants of the spiritual world are brought closer or further away from each other according as their inner state is similar or dissimilar. Thus, the earthly idea of space is replaced in the other life by that of the state of the affections and thoughts of the heart.

In his many books on the revelations he claims to have had, Swedenborg describes the changes of state of the angels, their dwellings and clothing, their governments, their employments, their speeches, their wisdom, their innocence, and the relationship that unites heaven to the human race. In speaking of the spiritual beings of the other world, Swedenborg tells us that they were all men on another earth of the universe, then subjected to a period of training in which they were able to freely open their hearts to the heavenly influence and prepare themselves for a higher and indefinitely progressive existence. Swedenborg even deals with children in Heaven and their daily life, which does not fail to arouse the interest of the readers of the UB who know of the existence of the probationary nursery.

In his book “Of the Last Judgment and the Destruction of Babylon: To Show That All That Was Foretold in the Apocalypse Is Now Accomplished,” Swedenborg arouses the most astonishment among UB readers by asserting that the Last Judgment took place in 1757. This event was not, according to him, to take place in the world we inhabit. It was a great transformation carried out in the spiritual world only. This transformation would have been a judgment passed on the evil inhabitants of the spirit world. Would Swedenborg have been informed of the end of a dispensation that would have taken place in 1757?

An anecdote at the end of his life tends to demonstrate that Swedenborg had not invented anything and that he was sane when he said he saw the other world and its inhabitants. As his end approached, his friends suggested that he receive a priest. The latter adjured him to retract, if, in publishing them, he had been motivated by greed or by the sole desire to make a name for himself. Swedenborg sat up in bed, placing on his chest the hand that remained free, the other being paralyzed: “As true as you see me,” he said, “all that I have written is true. I could have said more, if I had had permission.” He died on March 29, 1772, at the age of 81.

The writings of Swedenborg that have most amazed and convinced me concern his encounters with recently deceased survivors and their reactions to their arrival in the other world. The first reaction awaiting the common man who arrives in the world of mansions seems to be one of astonishment that life continues after death. Swedenborg often mentions these observations. In the Arcana Celestiales, he writes: “I found myself in the same world of spirits, where beings newly delivered from human miseries were still asked what surprised them most in this new abode. It is, they answered, not to find eternal rest there, that is wished for us there: it is to find there still new studies to do, new knowledge to acquire, new duties to fulfill, it is finally to find the same necessity to work for one's happiness.”

Swedenborg did not convince everyone and was considered a madman by many of his contemporaries. He never tried to establish a separate cult for this new Church that he announced, even though his doctrine was established as an official church 100 years after his death. Today, these Churches have about 5,000 registered members, mainly in England and 6,000 in the United States.

Bill Sadler, Dr. Sadler's son, was convinced that Abraham Lincoln was a member of the Reserve Corps of Destiny, a select club of mortals recruited to play an inconspicuous but vital role in the smooth running of God's plan on the planet: (http://www.urantia.org/bill-sadlertalks/comments-destiny-reservists).

For my part, I would bet my shirt that Emmanuel Swedenborg was part of this famous group of anonymous mortals. At the time of the production of the UB, this group had in its ranks more than 962 reservists. $\square$

## Urantia Association International Congress 2015

_Line St-Pierre_
_Communications Committee_

As we are in the midst of structuring and organizing the international congress which will take place from July 30 to August 2 at Bishops University in Lennoxville, we are asking for your collaboration and kindness.

Since 2013, a handful of volunteers with the members of the AUQ council have been working rigorously to develop a theme with plenaries and workshops relevant and meaningful to the teachings we read and study in The Urantia Book. “PROGRESSING FROM HUMAN TO DIVINE”

How can we equip ourselves and raise awareness among our family, our loved ones, our colleagues and those we regularly meet to live these values from an early age? The chosen theme was designed precisely with this in mind.

How can you help the organizers? By registering today for the conference either using the form you received in January or on the attached website: https://www.regonline.ca/builder/site/Default.aspx?EventID =1645565, by facilitating a workshop during the conference, by offering a donation to the AUQ to help a reader from Africa or South America attend the meeting, by offering yourself as a host at the hospitality service.

The program will be sent to all those wishing to see the choice of workshops to be developed by writing to me at: line.stpierre@gmail.com.

There are many opportunities to serve at this event, just choose!

To love is to serve

## Response to “Everything is lent to us”

_Cecile Guillemette,_
_avid reader, St-Amable_

Hello to you all, happy new year, and much joy! I am doing well even at 90 years old. You probably know that we are never alone with all the celestial intelligences that surround us!

I would love to go and meet you at the assemblies, but now I stay at home and reading keeps me good company.

A thought for Sylvère Marcoux, article published in the last Réflectivité, who was surprised not to throw a big tantrum when his toolbox was stolen. He is a happy man now. A similar anecdote also happened to me. It is true that we are surprised by this new way of reacting. I wish him lots of “tools”.

Also, I would like to see more on the Supreme Being either in the Journal or in Réflectivité.

A question for you: anchored in Light and Life; utopia or eternity. $\square$

## Editor's note.

_Normand Laperle,_
_Editor in Chief_

**Your articles on Réflectivité**

After almost a year as editor of Réflectivité, some ways of doing things still need to be adjusted and refined.

After going through the fear of a shortage of articles, I had to juggle with the opposite phenomenon, that is to say how to manage a surplus of articles. Still, **don't stop sending your articles**. I prefer to manage a surplus of articles than a shortage.

For you, this surplus means that you will have to wait a little longer before seeing your article appear in Réflectivité.

For the sake of fairness, I operate on a first-come, first-published basis. There is one exception to this rule: if I receive an article that discusses recent, past, or future events, it will be given priority over all others.

If ever a surplus becomes constant, I will then start publishing six pages (instead of four as now), until the surplus goes down again.

**Acknowledgement of receipt**

Another thing. From now on, you will receive a receipt—if I have your email address. (Otherwise, no receipt.) I do not send receipts by paper mail.

**New AUQ website**

You may have noticed on the AUQ website that we have problems with the internet links that give you access to the old Réflectivité.

This problem will be resolved soon since the AUQ is on the verge of having a completely revamped website.

## Definition: “Absonite”

- With absonite, we enter the **“without beginning or end”** ([UB 0:1.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p1_12))
- **“Transcends time and space.”** ([UB 0:1.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p1_12))
  - Sometimes called “transcendental”.
  - “Has no relation to time and space”, but does not ignore them. ([UB 14:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p4_10))
- “_Concerns as much a thing as a being._” ([UB 0:1.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p1_12))
- “On the worlds of Havona there are seven fundamental forms of things and living beings [...] 1. Material, 2. Morontia, 3. Spiritual, 4. ***Absonite***, 5. Ultimate, 6. Coabsolute, 7. Absolute._” ([UB 14:4.1-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p4_1))
  - It is the reality just after the spiritual form.
  - It is the reality of the middle, halfway between the finite and the absolute.
- Humans are destined to reach the Absonite level (live there), possibly even reach the Ultimate level. ([UB 0:8.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p8_11))
