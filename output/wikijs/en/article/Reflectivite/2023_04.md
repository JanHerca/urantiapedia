_Gaetan G. Charland_
president@urantiaqc.org

Hello members and friends of the association,

Last month in my message from the president, I spoke to you about certain concerns of the members of the board of your association, highlighting the small number of young readers in Quebec and elsewhere in the world. Recently, I attended an online meeting called “Alumni Meeting”, which brought together several students from the School of Progressive Divine Wisdom.

During this meeting of sharing and exchange, a student by the name of Joseph Goma from Brazzaville in the Congo made this inspiring remark, that we older readers have reached maturity; in fact we are at the peak of our life and he gave the qualifier of humano-morontial, that is to say that our mortal life is ending and we are approaching morontial life.

## The Ideological Struggle — The Dangers of Lucifer's Manifesto (Part 2)

In taking a stand on the ideological struggle, which we believe to be freedom versus license, as instigated by the Lucifer Rebellion, it is imperative that we understand what we are dealing with.

Lucifer began his rebellion by publishing his manifesto, the so-called Declaration of Liberty. In it, he presented three basic accusations:

***To win souls for the Master, it is not the first league traveled by obligation, duty or convention that will transform man and his world, but rather the second league of free service and freedom-loving devotion; it denotes that the disciple has reached out in the manner of Jesus to seize his brother and bring him, under spiritual guidance, toward the higher and divine goal of mortal existence.*** <a id="a79_403"></a>[UB 195:10.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_5)

It is a painting whose function is that of any painting: to help us see, understand, grasp and, often, celebrate a sense of wonder.

Without a framework, we cannot nourish ourselves mentally. Conceptual frameworks, frames of reference, painters' frameworks, obviously...; we need frameworks all the time.

“.... Such universal frameworks for creature thought are indispensable to rational intellectual operations, they are, without exception, erroneous to a greater or lesser degree.” <a id="a170_179"></a>[UB 115:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p1_1)

## True and false freedom

</figure>

_Gaetan Charland_
Sainte-Sophie

In the presentation entitled “Luciferian Thought, Revelation and Us”, I touched briefly on a subject that deserves to be explored much more thoroughly, that of true and false freedom. ***The Urantia Book*** is probably the only valid source that can inform us about what is true freedom in comparison to false freedom.

I believe it is extremely important for us readers and students of the fifth revelation to understand the deeper meanings of true freedom and its applications in our lives if we are to be bearers of this liberating flame. We live in a time when everything seems to be so confused and intertwined that it becomes difficult for anyone to make an informed choice. When confusion reigns, anarchy breeds and chaos is born.

## Psychic circles

_Jean Lapierre_

This paper is about the psychic circles (Paper 110:6) and their relationship to what is important for mastering them. I believe that the mastery of these circles has been largely misunderstood and this is due, I think, to our Judeo-Christian monotheistic heritage where the emphasis was placed only on God the Universal Father, the Source and Center of All. This monotheism was good because it allowed for the cleansing of a host of gods; it was anarchy. However, monotheism must not be made a dogma because that would obscure, among other things, the Eternal Son, the Infinite Spirit, the existential Trinity, the two experiential Deities, etc.

Hello dear readers of your journal Réflectivité!

In this article we will glimpse the grandeur and magnificence of the immense aggregations of matter located on the outer space levels, at least on the first level. It is revealed to us now that “at least seventy thousand aggregations of matter, each larger than any superuniverse of the present time” are being prepared for the coming ages of the universe. We all have a great interest in knowing these stellar immensities, for we will be called, as members of the Corps of the Finality, to some future service in these outer space universes.

Hello Gaétan,

Thank you again for your solid conference on Luciferian thought on March 19, 2023. It makes us realize that he is very often behind harmful events that are happening even now on our planet. I would like to draw your attention to a logic of the following facts:

When Emmanuel gave his advice to Michael before he undertook his seventh and final bestowal to become Master Son of his universe, he told him in particular this: <a id="a234_162"></a>[UB 120:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p2_3) “... _When you have succeeded in terminating the Urantia secession, as you undoubtedly will, I counsel you to accept from Gabriel the conference of the title of ‘Planetary Prince of Urantia’ as the eternal recognition by your universe of your final bestowal experience; and that you further do any and all things, consistent with the purport of your bestowal, to atone for the sorrow and confusion brought upon Urantia by the Caligastia betrayal and the subsequent Adamic default._”

## Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms

Following Gaétan Charland's conference which took place on Sunday, March 19, 2023, I share with you my thoughts on the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

In the Canadian Charter of Rights, the only thing that “intrigued” me was that there was no mention of our “obligations and duties”.

We simply talk about our freedoms and the consequences of violating their limits, but in return, we do not mention the obligations and duties of the citizen which come with obtaining such freedom, because it is certain that to benefit from such a well-framed and defined freedom, responsibilities (clearly described) must necessarily be taken on by citizens in return.

Hello my dear Claude,

I just finished reading the latest Réflectivité.

I am touched by the amount of people who are involved and dedicated to this publication. I am happy to see that there are articles to suit many types of readers. There are articles for those who enjoy research, in-depth articles, and there are others, more down to earth, who are looking for life experiences.

I am also happy, my friend, to realize that all these people are in fact “in service”, each in their own way, each according to their talents.

I am always struck by the quantity and depth of your research, it is your talent and “it serves our cause and those of our Father well”.

Thank you Claude, endearing man!

In a fraternal spirit!

I just read you in Réflectivité for the month of March and your text fills me with joy. You show us in a nutshell this profusion of miracles of evolution by taking us on a grand tour of all living nature, from its origin in warm berries to our plate. Wow!

It occurs to me that the so intelligent octopus that you admire has not found a way to transmit experience from one generation to the next. It is this limit that it celebrates in kindness by giving its life to its young. And we, who are endowed with the Spirit, have been given the path of human culture, a path that still deserves to be enriched, if we look at current events.

I recently watched the program “Découverte” on Radio-Canada television about the rapid appearance of flowers on the planet thanks to their conjunction with insects. They have no legs, they did not trust the random wind like trees and many plants do to reproduce. They are the champions of reproduction. How do they do it? They have both sexes in the flower “stamens and pistil” and they know how to play with scent and color to unite with the winged insects that go from flower to flower to feed on their nectar. Insects transformed into vehicles that carry no intention other than to feed themselves, and “it is intelligence above intelligence” we are informed that through its petals, the flower increases its scents and colors as soon as it feels the vibration of the insect approaching it. Seduction pushed to the top!

All tenderness!

## My thoughts on true and false freedom in the world

Following the excellent conference by Gaétan Charland given on March 19, 2023 and entitled “_Luciferian thought, revelation and us_”, I share my comments with you!

In my view, freedom and true democracy are intimately connected since the freedom of individuals is included in this governmental system. According to the Melchizedek of Nebadon in <a id="a320_181"></a>[UB 71:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p2_1) it is said: “_Although democracy is an ideal, it is the product of civilization and not of evolution._”

So, since democracy is an ideal, what advantages does it offer us over other forms of government? According to Wikipedia, democracy is a political system that guarantees sovereignty to citizens who exercise it directly through the right to vote. These values concern respect for the Constitution and the rule of law, respect for the legitimate authority of ministers, the defense of human rights and freedoms which constitute the foundation of a democratic society and the acceptance of the responsibility to promote social and economic development. Democracy is based on political, union and religious freedoms.

_Eric Tarissan_

A year ago, I spoke to you about the eternal possible future, since we all know that the divine Plan is a plan of endless progression, and that eternally we will never cease to discover the Infinite that are the Consciousness, the Truth and the Love of God.

In fact, we will never finish broadening, deepening and enhancing our relationship with God, since even His personality is also Infinite.

Which brings me, today, to make a short visit to the eternal past, because we must admit that if there exists a **endless** destiny for us and for the universe in which we are, it is because on the contrary, there are realities which are, for their part, **without beginning!**

So here, for the coming hour, is a presentation of the First Age and the realities which constitute it and which were never created, since they have existed from all eternity.

PS: I will end this presentation with a quick return to the eternal future in order, if possible, to shed a little more light on this fabulous and divine destiny in which, God our Father, has perfectly and absolutely planned EVERYTHING, and this, from all eternity!

One thing is certain, from where He is, God must have an exceptional and incomparable point of view!
