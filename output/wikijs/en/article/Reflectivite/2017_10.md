## Theme of October 15, 2017

**“Perceptions and Spiritual Growth”**

_Marc Belleau_
treasurer@urantiaqc.org

_[Here is an introductory article on the subject of the next upcoming theme, that of October 15, 2017, which will take place from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., at [Club L'Ami-Temps](http://www.lami-temps.com/), 1345 Rue Fleury Est, Montréal, QC, H2C-1R4 (map)]_

There is only one reality, God, but as many perceptions of this same reality as there are creatures in the universe.

Living in harmony with this rich diversity of perceptions is not a simple matter. Peace in our society, in our world, will be possible only to the extent that we accept the free expression of our different perceptions. Many conflicts on Urantia are due to our attitude toward our divergent perceptions. We do not need to analyze what is happening internationally to find examples; we have only to look at what happens at a family dinner when we discuss hot topics such as politics or religion.

How can we take advantage of this variety of perceptions and live in peace despite the presence of opposing perceptions? In the search for answers to these questions, the history of the rebellion will allow us to see what solutions have been put forward by the leaders of our universe and how these solutions can enlighten us on the best attitude to adopt in resolving our differences.

In this theme, we will question ourselves about our way of perceiving reality. What are our perceptions made of? What factors influence our perceptions? By what means can we transform them? What are the impacts of our perceptions on our spiritual life? How do they influence our decisions? How do they affect our growth?

To help us understand better, Jacques L'Oranger will make us aware of the diversity of our perceptions through short exercises in small groups. Gaétan Charland will talk to us about his perception of Lucifer's rebellion, preceded by Robert Cadieux who will give us a short summary of the important points of this episode in the history of Urantia that has strongly colored our vision of things. I will lead the afternoon discussion which will focus, more specifically, on the intelligent and surprising way in which our spiritual leaders dealt with this unfortunate episode. We will also talk about the influences of the planetary rebellion on the currents of thought of our modern society.

So it's a meeting. Hoping to see you in large numbers.

## The role of women in improving our society

_[Speech given by Line St-Pierre during the last theme, in May 2017]_

Welcome to this meeting organized by the Urantia Association of Quebec with the theme “***How to participate in the improvement of our society***”. As the Association is an organization that is oriented towards the accomplishment of a spiritual mission, I invite you to take a moment of recollection to thank all the celestial beings who participated in delivering to us “_The Urantia Book_” and making known to us our grandiose destiny in God's plan.

It is always of interest to know the framework within which the Urantia Association works, and I will read to you its mission:

“Our mission is to help each person meet the great challenge of establishing a better relationship with the divine within them. In this effort to increase cosmic consciousness and enhance spiritual perception, we desire that each human comes to individually recognize the fatherhood of God and thus live universal brotherhood.”

To promote this personal development, and to create an environment conducive to sharing our spiritual life, the URANTIA Association of Quebec encourages the creation and maintenance of study groups of “_The Urantia Book_”, presents conferences and sets up thematic meetings, workshops, seminars, and congresses.

It publishes the newsletter Réflectivité, Tidings and the Urantia International Journal.

One of the primary tasks of the AUQ is to bring together readers of The URANTIA Book, and to invite readers to join study groups.

### Introduction to the day

> “_Religion does need new leaders, spiritual men and women who will dare to depend solely on Jesus and his incomparable teachings._” (<a id="a64_135"></a>[UB 195:9.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_4))

We are all encouraged by the revelators to “_build a new and attractive philosophy of life_” that integrates truth, beauty and goodness the more we grow spiritually.

May seeds of creativity and originality take root in us, as soon as we become “human reflections of the Divine.” We can make the truth shine: God is the flame, and we are the torch.

My presentation is a personal reflection on the failing moral and spiritual education of our youth and almost everywhere in society.

How can we help to establish these ethical and moral values?

15 years ago I had a spiritual awakening that transformed me and gave meaning and direction to my life, a more spiritual direction.

Having traveled extensively for Urantia around the world with my husband, I found that the participation was $1 / 3$ women and $2 / 3$ men.

In 2011, when I was wondering why there were so few women in the movement and where the women who were readers but not participants in the organized events were, I formed a women's committee to investigate the question, which also led us to think about other avenues.

During these meetings (there were 12), in different places in Quebec, what emerged was that in the study groups and meetings, there were too many hypothetical discussions on subjects that were not necessarily practical and that the groups were too intellectual.

You remember that man and woman are different and complementary and that these traces will follow us to Paradise!

In these all-day meetings, the discussions that interested the women the most were all things related to the practical side of life. Family life, raising children, our participation in society as Urantia women, volunteering. Together during these meetings, we saw that society has been allowed to develop on material values and now how can we install ethical and moral values? And we said to ourselves: We have not educated our children in the best way!

Booklet 84 talks a lot about the importance of education.

> “_And home building should be the center and essence of all educational effort._” (<a id="a90_85"></a>[UB 84:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p0_1))

> “_As are the families of the race or nation, so is its society. If the families are good, the society is likewise good._” (<a id="a92_125"></a>[UB 84:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p7_1))

There are other people who have also thought about this question!

Napoleon Bonaparte said: “The destiny of a child is the work of his mother.”

A Russian poetess said: “Give us good mothers and we will give you better children”

In Senegal there is a saying that says: “When you educate a boy, you educate an individual; when a girl is educated, you educate an entire nation.”

Woman is the torchbearer of morality and spirituality.

A few years ago when I ended up in the hospital emergency room with a friend who had injured her head, we waited 12 hours before being taken in. When the doctor examined her he spoke in French and then I told him that she only spoke English, he spoke to her in English and explained to her what he would do and how she should have been taken in much earlier, all the while sympathizing with her after all those hours of waiting.

I told him how caring and humane he was and thanked him.

He replied: “When I was studying medicine, my mother told me that when I had a patient in front of me, to remember that he was a human being and to treat him with dignity.”

This is an example of the impact of a mother's education on her child.

It is the woman who carries the children, who feeds them, who rocks them, who cuddles them, who comforts them, so if this same woman is educated in moral and parental values and when she is pregnant she has the right mental framework, the right thoughts with the knowledge of God and the concern to give birth to a baby who is physically and mentally healthy, then the child she will give birth to will be a child well endowed to live his life, and who in turn will also make a good cosmic citizen.

### Conclusion

Is it not our responsibility as students of the Revelation to awaken the possibility of openness and transformation in other people and to make them aware of these things?
- By restoring value to the human being.
- By promoting the theme of being a mother.
- Speaking of the ideal of the mother's education of the child.
- By having conversations between women.
- By valuing the young girl in relation to her body.
- It is also good to share our experiences as girls with them.
- By providing them with examples of role models; women who are good role models who have succeeded.
- By training parents in family life.
- ...and many other things.

We can all, in our own way, help mothers and mothers-to-be realize the important influence they have on their children. Including teenagers and fathers-to-be.

It's up to us to inspire people to do the things that inspire them and, together, help improve our society.

> “Become a rainbow in someone’s dark moments.” (Maya Angelou)

To be kind to someone in order to brighten someone else's moment, day or life with a smile, a hug, kind words and actions, or simply by being there for them in their struggle during difficult times.
