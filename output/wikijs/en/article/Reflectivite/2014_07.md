## THE FORUM REBELLION

_Gilles Brien_
_Laval_

***Part One — of Two***

For readers who would like to know more about the L.U., its history, its origins and the humans who were associated with its publication, there is a “nebula” of websites on the subject on the Internet. On a search engine like Google, for example, the name Urantia displays 929,000 results. Unfortunately for French speakers who do not have a good command of English, 95% of this content is in the language of Shakespeare.

I use the word “nebula” to describe the websites about the UB, because they are numerous and are not federated, nor necessarily linked to the Urantia Foundation. There are all kinds. Personal sites of readers, portals of organizations, religious movements, etc. We find information on the Urantia movement on anti-UB sites such as on the sites of the skeptics' club or anti-sectarian sites. The word Urantia is even used by several Internet sites of artists or esoteric preachers in imaginative ramblings that make us smile. But there are also gems.

I have been surfing the virtual universe of the L.U. since the arrival of the Internet in Quebec in 1994. Among the Urantian sites that have impressed me the most, with tons of archived documents, historical material and period photos is without a doubt the site [www.squarecircle.com](www.squarecircle.com). Administered by Saskia Raevouri and Matthew Block, this site is a gold mine for any reader of UB. The mission of the site is to serve as a resource center that allows you to learn as much as possible about the UB. On [www.squarecircle.com](www.squarecircle.com) you will find a section of YouTube videos posted by readers from all over the world, in more than 20 languages. There are even Urantian “comics” dating back to 1978, and others more recent, like the one by Matthew Block on the mota teaching method.

The most interesting section of the site [www.squarecircle.com](www.squarecircle.com), for me, is the one dealing with the history of the Urantia movement. It was while searching through this section that I discovered the existence of the most intriguing of the Forum members, the man behind what is called The Forum Petition: Harold Sherman (1898-1987).

Established in 1923 by Dr. Sadler, his son Bill, and his wife Lena, the Forum brought together a group of 20 to 40 people every Sunday at his Chicago home to discuss religion and other topics of mutual interest. The Forum evolved into a focus group for UB celestial revelators until 1942. The previous year, Harold Sherman and his wife Martha were introduced to Dr. Sadler by forum member Harry Loose, a police detective interested in psychic phenomena.

Harold Sherman was a journalist with a passion for metaphysics and spiritualism, a popular spiritual movement in the 1920s and 1930s in the United States. What makes him an interesting character is his multifaceted career. A journalist and copywriter, he wrote children's books, sports books, adult novels, Broadway shows, and even Hollywood screenplays. Deeply idealistic and psychically gifted, it seems, he felt he had a mission to fulfill for humanity, a mission somehow connected to his writing. When he and his wife joined the forum in 1941, they moved to Chicago to study the material more closely and lived at 533 Diversey Parkway from May 1942 to May 1947. Directly across the street from the Sadlers' home. The fifteen handwritten notebooks that Harold Sherman kept describing the Forum sessions are the only first-hand records or accounts of the Forum's proceedings. These notes were published in Sherman's book, “The Sherman Diary,” available on the Internet: [Sherman Diaries](https://squarecircles.com/the-urantia-diaries/).

My curiosity was piqued when I read these notes from Sherman. It must be said that this character played a controversial role in the years preceding the publication of the Book in 1955. Essentially, the reason why Sherman came into conflict with Doctor Sadler was that Sherman would have opposed Sadler's control of the UB.

Sherman is said to have tried to convince Sadler that the manuscript should be published by a prestigious publishing house rather than by a private corporation (the foundation). Based on my interpretation of the readings of the letters exchanged between Sherman and Dr. Sadler, and my humble experience as an old reader, I believe that Sherman made the same mistake that many enthusiastic new readers make.

Like new modern apostles full of ardor, enthusiasm and naivety, we are convinced that a huge publicity campaign for the _Urantia Book_ is the best way to propagate the Book and its teachings. Sadler did not seem (fortunately) attracted by the bling-bling, marketing and modern business methods that Sherman promoted. He was suspected of wanting to offer the book to publishers in New York or Hollywood! He even sent the manuscript of the book to publishing houses for a literary opinion... The publishers' responses can be read on the site [www.squarecircle.com](www.squarecircle.com).

Sherman tried to convince Sadler of the idea of entrusting the texts of the L.U. to a third party, outside the fold of 533 Diversey Parkway and the Sadlers for the publication of
the work. Unfortunately for him, Sherman saw all his suggestions rejected.

In an effort to pressure him, Sherman convinced the other forum members to sign a petition he had written, demanding changes to Sadler's handling of the 5th Epochal Revelation. Needless to say, the petition was very poorly received. Sadler reportedly compared Sherman to Caligastia in his attempt to sabotage the Revelators' plans. This petition was tantamount to a real rebellion that threatened to jeopardize the future of the forum and the publication of the L.U.

## Editor's note

_Normand Laperle_
_Lévis_

From June 11 to 15, 2014, the UAI held an international symposium in Madison, Wisconsin, USA. The total number of participants was between 85 and 95. Aside from the host country, there were people from Pakistan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Australia, Russia, Peru, Brazil and France. French-speaking Canada was represented by 7 people from Quebec: Gaétan Charland, Line St-Pierre, Marcel Laporte, Maurice Migneault, Robert Ezri, Diane Labrecque and myself. The theme of this meeting was “Study Groups” (SG).

In writing these lines, I drew on what we received and discussed in Madison. As your editor, my goal is to invite you to share ideas on the subject. To do this, I will have many more questions than answers.

Here are some questions regarding **motivation**: What motivates you personally to attend your own GE? What is your best GE experience, and what makes it so special? Do you believe GEs contribute to personal growth? If so, how? How can a GE help a reader “_integrate_” and “_live_” the teachings of “The Urantia Book”? What should be your role in GEs?

Other questions regarding **effectiveness** of GEs: What _study methods_ do you find produce the best understanding in a meeting? What difficulties and successes have you encountered during your GE sessions? Describe a few of the solutions to your difficulties. Does your group include a prayer, meditation, or worship component? If so, how would you say this affects the effectiveness of the GE meeting? What study aids have you found most helpful in a GE setting? What outreach methods does your GE use? How successful have these outreach techniques been? What special projects, if any, has your GE undertaken? Do you have any to suggest?

On a **larger scale**: How do you see the role of GEs in the _community of readers_ of “The Urantia Book”? What role do GEs play in the mission of the 5th epochal revelation? Can GEs help foster the emergence of teachers and leaders? If so, why and in what way? Do you feel any responsibilities toward the mission of the revelation as a host of GEs? If so, what are they?

Another essential element to know in this context is the [“**Publication Mandate**”](/en/article/The_Publication_Mandate) which came to us through the same source and the same technique as the documents of “The Urantia Book”, a little before its first publication. You can read it (translated) at the following Internet address: http://www.urantia-canada.org/francais/lelivre-durantia/le-mandat-de-publication.html. This document is essential to understand all the importance and the _long term_ scope of the GE. It is necessary to read, analyze and meditate on this document. To understand it in its depth, try to explain it to someone else without reading it in its entirety. You will realize that the GE project is vast and that we still have a long way to go to bring it to maturity.

The strength of a group lies in the _diversity of its resources_. But these resources must be shared. In teamwork, “_Ten men are not much better than one in lifting a heavy load, unless they lift it together—all at the same time._” (<a id="a74_233"></a>[UB 81:6.37](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_37)). This newsletter serves to create _a sense of belonging to the community of readers of “The Urantia Book”_. Please feel free to write, share, and exchange your ideas and thoughts on the subject of GEs, even if it is only a sentence, an impression, a question. Perhaps in this way you will stimulate someone else _to respond and add his or her two cents to yours_.

Happy reading. $\square$

## The eyes of the soul

_Yvon Belle-Isle_
_Hawkesbury_

For 10 years now, I have been volunteering in palliative care at the Hawkesbury Hospital. On several occasions, I have had the great privilege of accompanying people at the end of their lives, more precisely a few days before death, which, by the way, is a beautiful spiritual experience for me and for the dying person as well, in general.

Before I make my visits to patients, I pray to God, my Adjuster, to guide me to say the right words and have good and valuable exchanges for the physical, moral and spiritual well-being of the patients.

On several occasions I have had very profound exchanges where the person would open up from the depths of their soul, sharing their most intimate thoughts and values. It is at these moments that our souls would come together and at this moment also that I feel the presence of our Adjusters, comforting the patient, and that the communication takes place at the soul level. What a beautiful feeling, an indescribable atmosphere, for me and also for the patient.

This is not just me saying it, but it comes from the mouths of the dying themselves.

I let them know in these moments that they are giving me a beautiful gift by opening up at the level of their soul and that it is in the soul where spiritual life is growing and that it is there where true life is lived and will continue to live. Their intimate and personal testimony makes me see the greatness of their soul. There is my volunteer salary that satiates my soul to the highest degree. It moves me a lot, and those who know me my spiritual emotional sensitivity. I receive an indescribable joy from it and I thank my Adjuster for allowing me to live these moments so rich in divine values. There is a communication from Adjuster to Adjuster between our two personalities. It is priceless, believe me. First of all, these experiences cannot be bought.

I must admit that most of these experiences and sharings have been with women. Opening up is much easier with them.

The last patient I had the privilege of accompanying was a very mature person in personal spiritual values, with a very rich inner life. She could not find the words to express her inner life. She only saw the good in life. It was then that I suggested to her that throughout her life, she had been guided with **the eyes of the soul**. Her eyes lit up at that moment. We were on the same wavelength and our souls were united. She said to me; “Thank you, I like this expression very much and it strikes me a lot. I have never heard something so beautiful and so true. I will remember this.” I hugged her and left her room. It goes without saying that my soul was filled and it took me some time to recover from this great and beautiful emotion. I felt an indescribable joy. She died a week later. She was only 65 years old.

Thank God for allowing me this meeting of souls, with this lady...! $\square$
