## Women's Participation in the Urantia Movement

_Helene Boisvenue_
_Sherbrooke_

_[Round table during the meeting of September 21, 2014 in Drummondville]_

In a roundtable discussion, some of the women readers of The Urantia Book who attended the September 21 meeting discussed women's involvement in the Urantia movement and in study groups. “Why are there generally fewer women than men?” they asked. Here are some elements of the discussion that helped identify some of the causes of the problem and provide some interesting solutions.

### Causes

Often a minority in study groups, women feel misunderstood and uncomfortable, especially when the study turns into intellectual debates that are often very spiritually sterile. This discomfort probably comes from a sad part of our history. Not long ago, religious authority was a man's business. Although the discourse has changed regarding the place of women in our society, many women, especially older ones, have integrated the old norms - we are still dragging the past.

In general, women lack self-confidence when they try to express themselves in public and even more so when they have to assume leadership. The situation is complex and the analysis could be done through sociological studies. A possible cause has been identified by experimental research in education. Too often, educators do not explicitly identify the qualities and abilities of the girls in their care and the latter no longer know why and in what areas they are competent; knowing themselves poorly, the girls then develop little self-confidence.
One participant raised the particular problem of young women who have a demanding profession to which are added family responsibilities, daily management and child-rearing. These women do not really have time to devote themselves to the activities of the Urantia movement. Their spiritual search is expressed mainly in action with their children. Women often live a spirituality applied to family life.

### Solutions

Let us remember how extraordinary and unprecedented was Jesus' attitude toward women. Contrary to age-old traditions, Jesus elevated women and gave them an equal share with men in the evolution of the planet and especially in their spiritual action. Women in spiritual search have important realizations to make and this awareness will lead them on the path of confidence and courage.

Is it not said in the Urantia Book that “_the hand that rocks the cradle fraternizes [...] with destiny._” (<a id="a36_108"></a>[UB 84:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p6_4)). This means that the maternal function that God has attributed to women has developed in them qualities and expertise applicable in all spheres of human development and in particular in that of spirituality. It is important that women discover who they are in order to take responsibility for their spiritual role. Should feeling misunderstood paralyze them and block their commitment? The confidence that women lack so much will be absorbed in partnership with God. Above all, we must not forget the power of the Adjuster. Women must do their part where they are with divine guidance.

Drawing again on a passage from The Urantia Book that states that “A man and a woman cooperating are, in most of their actions, far superior to two men or two women.” (<a id="a38_168"></a>[UB 84:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p1_9)), several participating women expressed their willingness to collaborate with men for their mutual spiritual growth knowing that their partnership will be able to triumph over the natural limitations of each. The divine spirit wants to realize itself through men and women; it is not a competition. Each one has a potential to be actualized.

For young women who are engaged in their professions and family responsibilities and unable to integrate into the activities of the Urantia movement, the participants were unanimous in affirming that all things in their own time is a reasonable rule for them. Spiritual growth is not just a matter of Urantia Book study groups. $\square$

## Editor's note

_Normand Laperle_
_Lévis_

**A big thank you to those who write articles in Réflectivité**. For some time now, we have been receiving more articles. Well done and thank you all. **It is appreciated by all**.

This month we are publishing an article provided to us by the “Outaouais Study Group”. I think it is a good idea. A great group project where everyone's participation is put to good use. We can only applaud this initiative.

## Listening to others

***Study Group*** _of the Outaouais Outaouais_

In the material world, the one who shouts the loudest will be heard the furthest. But we are also spiritual beings and in this world, we do not need loudspeakers to make our prayers heard, because God is so close to us that he hears them even before they are formulated. Would it be possible for us to do the same with our brothers by refining our listening?

But what does it mean to listen to the other? Listening to the other is not only about being attentive to what they say, but also to what is not said, to gestures, to hesitations, to discomfort, etc. We must know how to listen with all our senses, and when this is done well, knowledge of the other goes beyond our understanding.

> “_If once you understand your neighbor, you will become tolerant, and this tolerance will grow into friendship and ripen into love._” (<a id="a79_137"></a>[UB 100:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p4_4))

People don't always manage to say what they really think. Sometimes, behind a disjointed speech, they tell us who they are, and that's important. It's this knowledge of the other that allows us to better understand what they really need, what they are ready to receive and give.

Another reason to improve our listening is that unconsciously or not, we recognize in our brothers the qualities and the defects that we ourselves have. It is therefore also a way to know ourselves better. We are all mirrors for each other. But a mirror reflects light, not darkness. We must tend to illuminate the world with our love as the Father does for all his Creation.

> “_It is literally true, “Human things must be known in order to be loved, but divine things must be loved in order to be known.”_” (<a id="a85_134"></a>[UB 102:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p1_1))

## Summary of the Discussion Groups in Drummondville

_Gilles Bertrand_
_Quebec_

This report follows the article in Réflectivité, from last October on the meeting held in Drummonville on September 21, 2014. Thank you Hélène for detailing for us, through your minutes, the lively testimonies of the seven speakers.

Surely, this new formula of sharing is to be reiterated even more, because it has highlighted deep values that these people have dispensed. They have inspired us greatly and the product of this day was one of the most profitable socially, mentally and spiritually, this speaking in terms of personal and common gains.

Following these presentations, the session ended with workshop discussions, and Luciano Camellini, Vice-President of the AUQ, then asked the participants of these round tables to send him the summary of the reflections of the participating members, which I publish here for the benefit of the readers of Réflectivité.

**The subject of the meeting** was found in this crucial question:

**“How do we live and transmit the teachings of The Urantia Book?”**

Here are the receipts received from three of the spokespeople of these groups. The comments are summarized by a simple enumeration of the notes taken during these sharings, but how enlightening you will find them.

---

**A first group:**

- In my walking group, I discuss with my friends the values of life: sharing, love, service, mutual aid, brotherhood.
- In retirement I volunteer in my community and get involved in social life. I take the time to be, to live the value of the moment.
- I try to make people happy, by smiling, by practicing patience at the checkouts at the grocery store for example. Smile at the cashier,
- My Adjuster provides me with opportunities to grow. I am aware of the Adjuster in me.
- I listen to people with love and respect where they are in their journey of life and growth. I try not to judge people and to be interested in them as a person.
- I take Jesus as an example to address people. I see myself doing like him. He practiced “the art of living”. I try to ask the right questions, as gently and respectfully as possible. Like Jesus, I must love people as he loved us.
- Meditating and praying helps me get out of my problems. It gives me serenity.
- I sow seeds by my example and by my words on the importance of “the inner life.”
- I tell people that God lives in them and it leads to conversation.
- I am trying to free myself from intellectual slavery and live more spiritually.
- Today's excessive use of technology is distancing people from their inner life. People are more tense, hyper-vigilant and overly influenced by the outside world.
- I can't force someone to be interested in spirituality or the inner life.
- I realize that I must first live the teachings of “The Urantia Book” myself before making them known to others.

Thank you for the beautiful Sunday.
Fraternally,
Yvon Belle-Isle

**A second group** elaborated the following for us: (Each of the comments also came from a different participant)

- First, you have to have the desire to pass them on. Being a trucker, I developed a greater tolerance towards others. In addition, I realized that I should be more tolerant of myself. All the love I gave to others turned back on myself.
- My attitude has changed towards service to others. I made a commitment in my study group to help people at the end of their lives by listening first.
- I too have accompanied some people at the end of their lives. I told them that if God exists everywhere, he is therefore in us.
  - This service made me realize that life is very fragile.
  - I also met a person who was afraid of going to hell. I told him what happens after death and the path to the world of mansions. The interview ended with a smile.
  - At first it was my job to accompany people at the end of their life, now it is an honor. My salary is the smile that expresses that the person leaves with peace within them.
- I tried to pass on the teachings, but there was a lot of resistance. On the other hand, my son started reading. It is through my way of life that I passed on the teachings.
- Can we talk about the teachings of “The Urantia Book”? In my reading group, I asked each reader to put their book on a tablet. Then, we talked for two hours about spirituality without reading the UB. What a beautiful experience...
- Hearing all these testimonies, we can say that every thought, word and action in order to serve others we do it for ourselves first. Serving others values us a lot. Is it selfishness? Wanting to go to heaven, is it selfishness?
- I think unconditional love comes naturally to the mother. Having children is essential to experience this.
  - I try to apply it in my life.
  - But, it is the love conditional on a given situation that I live every day.
  - Being a reader, do I apply it in my personal life?

It was a pleasure to see your devotion, drive and sincerity in serving each of us.

Thank you for sharing this day...
Thank you for this divine sharing.
Looking forward to seeing you again.
Roger Périgny, representative of our round table

I will finally leave you to meditate on the findings of **a third group** led by Normand Laperle that afternoon.

- <ins>We can start a dialogue with the other person with a question.</ins>
  - We need to develop the ability to ask the right questions.
  - Jesus had become a master in this art.
  - This way we don't start with our conditions and definitions or anything that is important to us. We don't impose ourselves.
- <ins>Advantages of proceeding by questions:</ins>
  - We make the other person think.
  - We bring the other to a new consciousness.
- <ins>This is how we liven up the discussion...</ins>
  - by giving importance to the person.
  - by exploring his point of view.
  - discussing each other's conditions.
- Example of a question to ask: “Q When you are on the other side, how will you communicate with other people?” (Telepathy, other...)
- When answering someone else's question, always personalize your response and dialogue. (Use “I”)
- About personal involvement:
  - If we don't find a personal activity to engage in...we're wasting our time.
  - Imagine all the opportunities we have to share.
  - We must take advantage of the opportunities that are offered to us or that present themselves to us.
  - In action, the more I give, the more I receive.
  - If we get involved, it will necessarily open other doors. (God leads us).

<ins>Disparate sentences:</ins>

- We cling to a thought because we “need” that thought.
- Phrase to say when speaking to young people: “The “Urantia Book” was written for you.”
- People are NOT looking to “know the spiritual world,” they are looking to know “how to live.”
- If you don't seek to meet God, you will end up going backwards...to what you were.
- It is important to be able to “recognize spirituality in others.”
- We are not used to meeting a person who has ideals and who is driven by passion.

And the last pearl heard in this group:

- “For evil to succeed, good people must ignore it.”
