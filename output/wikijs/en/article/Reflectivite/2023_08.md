Hello dear readers and friends of the association,

As I mentioned in my message from June, this summer period which is often accompanied by travel is an opportunity to meet new people and sometimes, the privilege of sharing the truth that lives within us.

Who says vacation for some, can mean a relaxation of the activities of daily life. But for those who are on the path of spiritual progression, certain activities always remain present in daily life. I am referring here to the daily periods of meditation/worship as well as prayers. ***The Urantia Book*** warns us against periods of spiritual fasting, which like fasting from food can lead to destroying hunger.

**Foreword**

The majority of people on our planet know Adam and Eve and many interpretations are still present today about their coming, their activity and their fate in the Garden of Eden.

[_The Book of Genesis_](/en/Bible/Genesis) refers to them as the first humans on our planet and talks about the origin of their creation. Several graphic reproductions showing them naked have been produced, and this allegory is still current today for most people who have an idea of Adam and Eve. This allegory of nudity has become a modern expression indicating a person dressed in an Adam's costume and an Eve's outfit.

It would be logical to think that Adam and Eve failed in their mission as Material Son and Daughter of Satania on Urantia, but one must consider the aspect of confusion, disorder, tumult and spiritual quarantine that prevailed on our planet caused by the Lucifer rebellion. The context of their mission proved delicate and the Lucifer rebellion was very present when they arrived on Urantia. The choice of Urantia of our Creator Son Michael for his seventh bestowal on our planet was due in part to the failure of the Adamic couple. (<a id="a67_534"></a>[UB 119:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p7_2)) The privilege of our Creator Son to bestow himself on Urantia made our planet a prominent place and a center of interest for the entire local universe of Nebadon.

## The Christ Experiment's — The School of Ambassadors

<figure id="Figure_4b" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/Reflectivite/Ambassadeurs.jpg">
</figure>

**The Ministry of the Master**, training offered by the School of Ambassadors will open up new perspectives for sharing what you know about the book, in a natural way and without offending people who want to know more about divine reality.

Here is the testimony of students;

It is a very powerful course which reminded me of all the riches of divine teachings and particularly those of the Master! My inner life has gained in intimacy with the Father and with the son and my desire to do the will of God has been consolidated!

It is a step forward towards the responsibility of brotherhood among us through the example of Jesus and thanks to the love that the Father gives us.

This course is transformative. It gives us the taste to serve in fraternity and in the love of the Father who is the supreme reality. It is transformative, but at the same time it leads us to want to do the will of God.

## The infinite Father

_Eric Tarissan_
Quebec

Following a conversation with a friend who pointed me to booklet 42 on energy, the mind and matter, I was struck by the inspiring fifth paragraph which I commented on with parentheses and which I also completed by summarizing in a few words the presentation I made last May on “The Infinite Past and The Eternal Worlds”. So here, from another angle, is the Infinite Father.

## Fun game

Here is a fun game concocted by our friend André Pominville. It is a grid to complete entirely devoted to terms used in ***The Urantia Book***. The letters are shared when the words cross.

The solution to this grid can be found on the following page.

Good luck, and have fun!

## Theme — Thought that becomes sounds and words

_Samuel Heine_
Reunion Island

Have you ever meditated or thought deeply about this extraordinary human faculty that is speech or the faculty of expression? The thought that becomes sounds and words. Incredible! Don't you think so? Words are vibrations that have power, strength. This morning, I meditated on the power of thanks and gratitude (smile). “Thank you” God for the present life and for the eternal and extraordinary future that awaits us!

In fact, I am more and more filled with gratitude, life is beautiful!

Let us learn to be more optimistic, more positive and much more amazed by the greatness of God.

It will make us laugh at human stupidity, laugh at the self-created illusion we have trapped ourselves in. It's good to laugh at yourself!

> “On Jerusem the ascenders from these isolated worlds occupy a residential sector by themselves and are known as the *agondonters,* meaning evolutionary will creatures who can believe without seeing, persevere when isolated, and triumph over insuperable difficulties even when alone.” (<a id="a208_287"></a>[UB 50:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p7_2))
