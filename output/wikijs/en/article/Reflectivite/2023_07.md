Hello dear readers of your newspaper Réflectivité!

For this month, our president, Gaétan Charland, is taking leave of his usual post, because he and Line are very busy completing their move to Boucherville. We wish them all the courage and energy needed to carry out this event! As announced in the previous issue, our association will change its postal address. It will be communicated to us very soon!

## Evolution of the human being

**Introduction**

The subject that is treated in this document is very delicate and many would have preferred that it not be the subject of the revelations of the _Urantia Book_. The revelators must have asked themselves this question but decided to include this subject which was very controversial for us at the time we received it. If they did it it was surely because it was very important and that it concerned our plan of ascension and growth.

Let us not forget that truth for us is relative because it is conditioned by space and time. What appears shocking to us today was not shocking a few thousand years ago and may not be shocking in any future but for other reasons. We live in a time where certain behaviors that we adopt may be considered naive and candor (angelism) by future generations.

## The Christ Experiment's — The School of Ambassadors

<figure id="Figure_4b" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/Reflectivite/Ambassadeurs.jpg">
</figure>

**The Ministry of the Master**, training offered by the School of Ambassadors will open up new perspectives for sharing what you know about the book, in a natural way and without offending people who want to know more about divine reality.

Here is the testimony of students;

It is a very powerful course which reminded me of all the riches of divine teachings and particularly those of the Master! My inner life has gained in intimacy with the Father and with the son and my desire to do the will of God has been consolidated!

It is a step forward towards the responsibility of brotherhood among us through the example of Jesus and thanks to the love that the Father gives us.

This course is transformative. It gives us a taste for serving in brotherhood and in the love of the Father who is the supreme reality. It is transformative, but at the same time it leads us to want to do the will of God.

## Hypothesis on the constitution of our soul

The revelators teach us that our soul is the product of the relationship of the human mind with the incessant work of divinization of the Thought Adjuster. This is good, but somewhat insufficient to fully understand the process set in motion to arrive at this new, potentially eternal cosmic reality!

**Absolute Reality of the Adjuster**

In order to fully understand what our soul is made of, we must look deeply into the causes of its emergence. Let us begin this investigation with the highest cause of its reality, the Thought Adjuster!

## Divine “Download”

My dear morontia sisters and brothers... I would like to speak to you about a subject that is particularly close to my heart... the divine “download”.

The first time I heard this term was during my first video meeting with Guy Perron, Agnès Lazar and a few other morontia friends... it was my first UBIS course.

Guy complimented me on the quality of my answers and spontaneously, in all naivety and out of concern for honesty towards my divine Adjuster... I replied that I was cheating with my Adjuster... that I was “downloading” the answers. This seemed to surprise him and he asked me to clarify... So I simply told him that when I had made all possible human efforts to answer a question and the answer was still not clear in my mind... then I asked my Adjuster to cheat with me and provide it to me during my sleep... the next day, I woke up and the answer was clear and limpid in my head and I only had to quickly transcribe in one go what my Adjuster dictated to me!

I pointed out some apparent inconsistencies in this text regarding the pains coming after birth: before the pains came, she gave birth to a male child. Here is the full text that Jesus chose when he spoke in the synagogue at Capernaum:

## Material inertia and growth in wisdom

Hello my Urantian sisters and brothers, I have just finished reading the Réflectivité of June 2023 and I particularly appreciated the clairvoyance of Jean Lapierre and Claude Flibotte on the subject of the brake of material inertia and the importance of the rapid growth of experiential wisdom.

If I may, I would like to humbly offer a few pieces that seem to me to be part of this great puzzle!

Exhibit #1: [UB 195:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_2) But paganized and socialized Christianity needs a new contact with the uncompromising teachings of Jesus; it languishes for want of a fresh vision of the Master's life on earth. A new and fuller revelation of the religion of Jesus is destined to triumph over an empire of materialistic secularism and to reverse a world-wide tide of mechanistic naturalism. Urantia now quivers on the very brink of one of its most astounding and exciting epochs of social adjustment, moral stimulation, and spiritual illumination.

## Our future in relation to the Supreme

<figure id="Figure_8" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">

_Claude Flibotte_

Do we realize what our participation in the actualization of this new deity that is the Supreme represents for us? When we have become, in Paradise, perfect finaliters, by a technique of experiencing finaliter transcendence, we will then be connected to the spiritual gravity circuit of the Eternal Son, we will become experiential personalities of God the Supreme ([UB 117:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p5_3)).

At present, our finite creature mind prevents us from knowing the Father as infinite and absolute, yet in relationship with the Supreme, He will compensate for our inability to make limited contact with the universe of universes. Revelators suspect that being fused with our Thought Adjuster, He will reveal to us, upon attainment of the seventh spirit stage, the divinity and nature of God the Supreme, the equivalent of the revelation of the Infinite to an absolute being ([UB 117:6.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p6_18)).

## Fun game

Here is a fun game concocted by our friend André Pominville. It is a grid to complete entirely devoted to terms used in _The Urantia Book_. The letters are shared when the words cross.

The solution to this grid can be found on the following page.

Good luck, and have fun!

**Horizontal**

- 2 Elder sister of each believer of the Father's family in Nebadon (name given specifically by André Pominville)
- 6 By himself, when can man make a wise decision on temporal matters and rise above the selfishness of his personal interests?
- 7 Creation, which requires an Adjuster and a human.
- 9 Science of the great laws which govern the physical universe. Science which studies the structure, origin and evolution of the universe as a whole.
- 10 Doing it AS A GROUP makes all participants better.

**Vertical**

- 1 Devoid of the sixth and seventh adjutants.
- 3 Through it, man ends up reaching the best.
- 4 Faith enlivens religion and obliges it to live heroically (with exceptional strength of soul)
- 5 The year 1955 marks the full \_\_\_\_ of the Kingdom. [UB 176:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_3)
- 8 Elder Brother of every believer in the Father's family (in English).

This activity allows several readers of different levels of understanding to exchange and study together the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. It promotes spiritual progress by allowing its participants to find practical applications to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ in their daily lives. This important approach allows us to keep a broad point of view on the concepts of truth. You wish to participate or form a study group; we will be happy to assist you. If you wish to have your study group appear in this list, contact the person in charge, via email association.urantia.quebec@gmail.com or at 450-565-3323.
