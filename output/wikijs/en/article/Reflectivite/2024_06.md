Dear readers and esteemed members of the association,

While spring has barely begun, summer already seems to be just around the corner. It is undeniable that time flies by at a dizzying speed. This perception of time varies from one person to another, but it is commonly accepted that the older we get, the more time seems to escape us at a frantic pace. This phenomenon, which I call relative time, could be the subject of a conference in its own right.

Rather than dwelling on the theory of the relativity of time, let's focus on how we can make the most of this time that is slipping away from us. Many people dedicate their retirement to volunteering, finding meaning and a reason for living. As a student of revelation, it would be a shame to let this precious time slip away without giving back what we have so generously received.

Since the dawn of time, man has sought to know the origin, history and destiny of the universe in which he lives. Science, philosophy and religions have tried to provide valid answers but in vain, always leaving man dissatisfied. By presenting the concept of I AM and its diversification, _The Urantia Book_ reveals to us a rational explanation of the genesis of reality but these concepts are judged by some readers as too intellectual and having little or nothing to do with our daily lives.

In this series of three presentations based on the Introduction and papers 104, 105 and 106, I will endeavor to show that what is “above in eternity” conditions the becoming of what is “below, here on Urantia”, thus giving a new and enlarged perspective of our universal career.

Georges was born in Paris, France, in 1947. He was part of the team that spent fifteen years revising and correcting the French translation.

Georges became a Trustee of Urantia Foundation in September 1995. In 1999, he and Dorothy Elder launched the Urantia Book International School (UBIS), the first online school dedicated to the in-depth study of The Urantia Book. Today, Georges is Urantia Foundation's International Vice President, Chief Translation Officer, and Director of UBIS.

## Election of a new AUQ vice-president at the 2024 AGM

_Robert Cadieux_

Hello dear friends,

At the 2024 general meeting of our association, on May 5, I was elected to the position of vice-president which had become vacant. I thank the members for placing their trust in me. I also thank André Pominville who held this position for the last 2 years and who maintained a primary interest in working within the board of directors. For my part, I am new, but not quite since I was the secretary from 2015 to 2020 and here I am now vice-president. It is an honor and a great responsibility, because I have a strong desire to maintain this living dynamic that stimulates me. I am the youngest arrival in a well-established team that works wholeheartedly for the emancipation of this formidable revelation of the time. I will do my best to help and serve spiritual progress.

The Urantia movement with its readers and those who labor to spread the good news of the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man has an irresistible appeal to sincerely searching souls for truth, and I, like you, am one of them.

## The CHRIST EXPERIMIENT'S — The School of Ambassadors

<figure id="Figure_6" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/Reflectivite/Ambassadeurs.jpg">
</figure>

**The Ministry of the Master**, is a self-managed training offered by the School of Ambassadors opening new perspectives for sharing what you know about the book in a natural way and without offending people who want to know more about divine reality.

Here is the students’ testimony:

It is a very powerful course which reminded me of all the riches of divine teachings and particularly those of the Master! My inner life has gained in intimacy with the Father and with the son and my will to do the will of God has been consolidated!

It is a step forward towards the responsibility of brotherhood among us through the example of Jesus and thanks to the love that the Father gives us.

This course is transformative. It gives us a taste for serving in brotherhood and in the love of the Father who is the supreme reality. It is transformative, but at the same time it leads us to want to do the will of God.

## The importance of organizational unity

Many members of various Urantia organizations, as well as students of the revelation, as well as our members, may wonder why the unification of our two Urantia organizations, Urantia Association International and the _Urantia Book_ Brotherhood, is so important, so crucial. A recent survey conducted by Urantia Association revealed that an overwhelming majority—92.3 percent of respondents—are in favor of unity. While many of us pray for unity within the Urantia movement, we may not fully understand what this unity will require of each of us, and of the two associations involved in this unification process.

Unity is not simply a matter of concern for the welfare of the organizations involved; it has a significant impact on the mission of revelation in the world. Why is this so? To answer this, we must ask the right questions. Consider what the young Jesus pondered when faced with important decisions: “As the years went by, this young carpenter from Nazareth increasingly measured every institution of society and every use of religion by the invariable test: What does it do for the human soul? Does it bring God closer to man? Does it bring man closer to God?”

## What is faith?

<figure id="Figure_9" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Reflectivite/Mark_Blackham.jpg">
</figure>

_Mark Blackham_
Port Alberni, Vancouver Island

We often think of faith as a religious doctrine: the beliefs, rules, and rituals embodied in an organized religion, such as the Christian faith, the Muslim faith, or the Buddhist faith. Faith can also refer to different branches or sects of these religions, such as the Catholic faith, the Sunni faith, or the Theravada faith.

When used in this way, faith defines a system of religious rules, ideologies, and traditions. If you want to affiliate with a particular religious group, you must believe what they believe and do what they do.

But when faith is defined (or confined) in this way, it is not spiritually productive. Whenever we accept dogmatic teaching as the whole truth, it can inhibit our spiritual sensibilities; it can restrict our thinking and, therefore, inhibit our search for enhanced spiritual meanings or blind us to the full extent of spiritual realities.

secretary of the AUQ

On May 5, 2024, our annual general meeting of the Urantia Association of Quebec took place at the Hôtel le Dauphin in Drummondville. We would like to thank the 25 people including the five participants on Zoom for attending this meeting. The agenda was rather busy. The report on activities for the year 2023 was given, as well as upcoming projects for the year 2024. Marc Belleau, our treasurer, presented to us, always with his usual great professionalism, the financial report for the year 2023.

There were two elections during this assembly. Claudette Gonthier will continue her role as secretary for a new term. Robert Cadieux was elected without opposition to the position of vice-president.

This meeting took place in fraternity. The love was palpable in the room for this in-person meeting long desired by all participants. The relational exchanges were numerous.

For several years, Fellowship President Sue Seccombe has been discussing with our President, Enrique Traver, ways for the Association and the Fellowship to collaborate. In October 2023, the Fellowship General Council approved a resolution establishing a “Committee on Unity” to explore and make recommendations regarding “the details and options...of next steps on unity between [our] two organizations.” The Fellowship selected their Committee members, who were approved at their General Council meeting in February 2024.

In February, the Association approved the creation of a Special Committee on Unity, granting it the authority to continue discussions with the Fellowship with a view to unifying our two organizations. The members of our Committee are Gaétan Charland (Canada), chair of the committee, Michael Zehr (United States), Andrés Rodriguez (Colombia), Chris Moseley (United Kingdom), and Susan Owen (United States). The committee met virtually on April 29 to get to know each other and discuss the benefits and challenges of unity with the Fellowship. A second meeting was held on May 15 to get to know each other better and discuss expectations for this endeavor. No date has been set for the first meeting with the Fellowship.

## Thoughts on the soul of Jesus and his destiny!

Hello dear readers! In the introduction to the Urantia Book in section (<a id="a227_72"></a>[UB 0:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p0_2)), it is written that this revelation was given to us to expand our cosmic consciousness and enhance our spiritual perception. It is precisely for this purpose that I share with you my thoughts on the destiny of the soul of the human Jesus and the mystery of its possible location. It was after reading booklet 189 on the resurrection of Jesus that I asked myself many questions.

## Who is God?

Recently I saw a book called “THE 7 QUESTIONS.” I picked it up, opened it, and on the first page there were the seven questions. The first question was, “Who is God?”

And here is what I replied to the person to whom the book belonged:

What a deep, existential, eternal and interesting question!

For as long as I can remember, church and family have always been present in my life. Also having a brother and sister ten years older than me, I had, even before I began to think, the example of the perfect family who go to church and behave as good citizens of this world. Therefore, for as long as I can remember, at least unconsciously at first, God seemed a mystery to me. Who was he really? What was the nature of his identity, his essence and his personality?

_(Editor's note: in order to open our thoughts to the opinions of our brothers and sisters from other countries, we will offer you, on occasion, texts or conferences previously published in another language, but translated into French. Happy reading!)_

It was an honour and a privilege to be involved in organising this conference for Urantia Book readers from Australia and New Zealand. It was well attended with people coming from Sydney, Newcastle, the Central Coast, Melbourne, Canberra, Hobart, Adelaide, Western Australia, New Zealand and the USA. Thank you all for coming! We had a great time catching up with old friends and making new ones, engaging with each other and delving deeper into our favourite topics!

The problem we wanted to try to address at this conference was the way we, as readers, talk about the revelation of The Urantia Book with people less familiar with it. And despite being strong believers in its teachings, we seem to lack some of the basic principles and adequate tools or experience to convey its concepts in an engaging way to new readers. We hope that the conversations started at this conference have been helpful and that the topic will continue to be addressed.

I felt the need to translate from English and share with you this beautiful reflection from Trudi Cooper, a fellow beginner student at Urantia University with whom I participate in the TEP (Teacher Education Program) training.
<br style="clear:both;"/>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<span style="color:green;">PRAYER</span> vs <span style="color:purple;">WORSHIP</span><br>
By Trudi Cooper
</p>

<span style="color:green;">PRAYER</span> is supplication.

<span style="color:purple;">WORSHIP</span> is praise.

<span style="color:green;">PRAYER</span> is for the one who prays.

<span style="color:purple;">WORSHIP</span> is for the Creator.

<span style="color:green;">PRAYER</span> goes no further than necessary to get an answer.
