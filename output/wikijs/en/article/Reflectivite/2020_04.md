## Word from the President

_Line St-Pierre_
president@urantiaqc.org

In these unprecedented times, everything is changing around us and the word “adaptation” is undoubtedly the password for all physical, commercial, social, family and spiritual activities at present.

The Board of Directors met via videoconference on March 15 and **we have decided to postpone the activities of the Annual General Meeting (AGM) and the May theme to later dates** and this of course without prejudice.

Changes will be communicated to you in the Réflectivité and by news memo as they occur.

We have been working on the statement of belief of the _Urantia Association of Quebec_ (AUQ) which will be posted on our website and I am presenting to you these few lines that **we wanted to submit to you in the afternoon during the AGM**, in order to stimulate a discussion and have your comments on **the following statement**:

As members of the Urantia Association of Quebec (AUQ):

- We believe in the Fatherhood of God and in human brotherhood.
- We believe that a divine particle inhabits the mind of every human.
- We believe that through living faith we are transformed.
- We believe in the effectiveness of prayer and worship.
- We believe in eternal life after death — as taught by Jesus.

I remind you that on **Monday, April 6th** for many students of the fourth part of the _Urantia Book_ around the world, we will gather in spirit to commemorate the celebration of the **memorial supper** which the Master invited us to repeat 2000 years ago.

Although we are not there in person, we can certainly use the technology at our disposal, Facetime, Skype or ZOOM with our phones, tablets, and computers and have this experience with 2-3 people and even in larger groups.

At our home, the study group will meet virtually to have a bite together and raise our glasses in honor of Jesus our brother, creator of our universe and share on the beauty of his incomparable teachings which do us so much good.

As in the March Réflectivité, **I invite you to send me a text of your experience of the supper of remembrance** which will be published in the May Réflectivité and which I will translate into English so that it can be shared on the site of [TheChristExperiment.org](https://thechristexperiment.org/) for the benefit of all lovers of Jesus in the world who will read the comments of this meeting

Creativity has no limits and that is what Chris Wood, president of the Urantia Association International (UAI) demonstrated to us **on the weekend of March 20-21**, when he had the brilliant idea of giving us **24 hours of consecutive live lectures** by students of the fifth revelation.

You can imagine that for several hours my interest was in sitting there listening to speakers from Australia, New Zealand, Europe, Canada, the United States and Israel. What a wealth of perspectives we witnessed!

It is therefore with great joy and excitement that I announce to you that, in collaboration with the Urantia Association International, on Saturday **April 25 from 9 a.m. to midnight**, a **French-speaking online event will be organized that will last 15 hours and where 15 one-hour conferences will be offered by students from Africa, Switzerland, Belgium, France and Quebec**.

The program is taking shape day by day and I will let you know about it in the coming weeks via a mass email.

**On April 25th**, you will only have to click on the https://zoom.us/j/341447854 link to access the conferences.

To love is to serve.

## Invitation for the “Daily Bread” mailing list

_Richard Lachance_
Quebec

Hello dear brothers and sisters,

For your information, there is a daily subscription of short inspiring texts from the book **“The Little Voice”** by Eileen Caddy, **augmented with referenced excerpts from The Urantia Book** and inspiring videos.

These are messages from our Thought Adjuster who speaks to us, instructs us and stimulates us forward in simple words on various subjects of daily life.

Several hundred people already receive these messages daily, which aim to start the day well. If you wish, your name can be added to this mailing list. Feel free: you can withdraw at any time afterwards. You can also participate in the dissemination of the message of love of our Good Papa God by inviting other people who could benefit from this “daily bread”

To join the list, send your name and email address to
RichardAiles2@gmail.com.

Example from February 1st:

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/Reflectivite/2020_04/001.jpg">
</figure>

A very stormy and raging sea was shown to me, with waves as high as mountains. Then I realized that beneath the surface there reigned a wonderful peace and calm.

I heard these words:

_Search deep within yourself and find that peace which surpasses all understanding; keep it, what happens outside matters little._

### What do we believe?

Where do you place your faith? Do you believe in Me? Do you believe that you can walk and talk with Me? When you live this spiritual life fully integrated and at one with Me, do you believe that it works, that it is a very practical life, and that there is no place in your life where this way of living does not work? Take some time to sort out and weigh what you believe, and above all, learn to get in tune with it.

Far too many souls forget to practice this way of living. They talk about it but have not yet proven to themselves or to the world that it works and that when you acknowledge Me in everything, call upon Me and seek My help, everything begins to fall into place in your life. When you obey My still, small voice within, you begin to unfold like a beautiful flower and see how practical and wonderful this life really is.

> _Few persons live up to the faith which they really have. Unreasoned fear is a master intellectual fraud practiced upon the evolving mortal soul._ ([UB 48:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_4))

> _Few mortals ever dare to draw anything like the sum of personality credits established by the combined ministries of nature and grace. The majority of impoverished souls are truly rich, but they refuse to believe it._ ([UB 48:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_6))

## Loneliness

[_Translated from Spanish_]
***Yosis*** (_friend and student_) from ***Chile***

<p style="text-align:center;">
Loneliness, such a dear friend<br>
Companion of my days<br>
Empty of agitation and full of harmony.<br>
<br>
I thank life<br>
That you gave me the privilege<br>
To value you and enjoy your company.<br>
<br>
With you, I learned to know myself<br>
In all my real dimension<br>
With my possibilities and also<br>
with my limits.<br>
<br>
Thanks to the hours spent with you<br>
Now I am able to appreciate even more<br>
The wonderful gift of friendship.<br>
<br>
Loneliness,<br>
if men knew you better<br>
They would seek your proximity<br>
rather than fear you<br>
Because you are not synonymous<br>
of suffering or abandonment.<br>
<br>
You lock up the silence of wisdom<br>
Understanding in the face of incomprehension<br>
Forgiveness in disputes.<br>
<br>
Loneliness,<br>
my dearest friend<br>
Without your company,<br>
the spirit cannot manifest<br>
Because the voice of God is weak<br>
and needs you to be heard.<br>
<br>
Solitude, companion of my blessed hours<br>
Stay by my side<br>
Even in the midst of the hustle and bustle of the crowds.<br>
<br>
Because you don't depend on circumstances<br>
You are a state of consciousness because<br>
it's not the same as being alone,<br>
than feeling alone.<br>
<br>
You, my friend solitude<br>
You help me stay alert<br>
<br>
For my time<br>
does not flow in vain.<br>
<br>
To be able to live life,<br>
As it deserves to be lived<br>
With joy, optimism and faith.<br>
<br>
Because it is in this life<br>
Where next to you, solitude<br>
I win my eternal home.<br>
<br>
Because, without a doubt,<br>
Life is<br>
the antechamber of immortality.<br>
</p>

## God manifests and reveals himself through the person

_Samuel Heine_
Reunion Island

“You were inside me and I was outside”

I believe that today man needs this interiority.

When it comes to living spirituality, people no longer want to obey rules, people no longer want to be intellectually overloaded with a sterile and heavy God, in a 2097-page brainwashing. [Smile]

As transmitters of the fifth revelation to our fellow man, this is truly a grave mistake that we must not make.

We must offer them a discreet, humble and accessible God within ourselves, not the all-powerful one who weighs us down, but the One who comes from within to make us live the new man, to bring us joy and happiness in the living brotherhood of the gospel of the kingdom, the leaven of a new world, the spring of a new era.

I am convinced that we are there, I hope and I believe in man.

For me, the right balance in our lives, the middle point between the two ends of the same stick, can be expressed “meaningfully” as a mixture of love, humility and wonder.

Here is the prayer “_Late I loved you, Beauty ancient and so new_” by Saint Augustine (354-430), Bishop of Hippo in Algeria, son of Saint Monica and Doctor of the Roman Catholic Church.

Confessions 10, 27;

> “_Late I loved You, Beauty ancient and so new; late I loved You. You were inside me and I was outside, and it was there that I sought You. My ugliness hid all that You have done of beauty. You were with me and I was not with You. What kept me far from You were the creatures, who exist only in You. You called me, You cried out, and You conquered my deafness. You showed your Light and your Clarity chased away my blindness. You spread your perfume, I smelled You, and I sigh for You. I tasted You, I hunger and thirst for You. You touched me, and I burn with the desire for your Peace. Amen!_”

God has always been there, but often it is we who are not there. [Smile]

Have a great day everyone, let's take advantage of the “confinement” to get to know our wife, husband and children better, let's take advantage of this to re-establish a harmonious and open relationship between us.

God manifests himself and reveals himself through the person, this is the great secret that Jesus showed us in the gift of self.

## Guardian Angel and Ministry

_Claude Flibotte_
Sainte-Julie

How to explain the work of guardian angels? Here is my idea of what it is!

> “_On the spiritual level, seraphim make personal many otherwise impersonal and prepersonal ministries of the universe; they are co-ordinators. On the intellectual level they are the correlators of mind and morontia; they are interpreters. . . ._” ([UB 113:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p3_5))

What exactly does this excerpt from a quotation mean? Let us look at it from the standpoint of God. The Universal Father is spirit. The Thought Adjuster is the Father's presence in us, and he is spirit. The Adjuster indwells our mind and imparts spirit values and directives to his human subject. Here we have a downward action from the spiritual to the material. The Infinite Spirit is spirit and the mother of the Divine Ministers and of the mind. The guardian angel is the offspring of the Divine Minister, he is also spirit, and he works upon the human mind by various influences. So much for the origins and the means employed!

Now let's look at the mechanics of the process. I do not understand Mandarin, so I need a translator to know the meaning of the message sent. The same is true for messages from my Adjuster. I need a translator to understand their meaning. I am a material being who knows the materiality of facts. The language of spirit would be inaccessible to me without the intervention of my guardian angel who translates for me the beauty of spirit truths. My angel does this for the Adjuster, but also for all spiritual communications from all sources. He coordinates all of this and translates it into mental language accessible to me most of the time unconsciously. He is a coordinator as well as an interpreter. When I have reached the first psychic circle, perhaps I will be able to communicate directly with my Adjuster because at that time my mind will be familiar with the things of the spirit.

In the majority of cases these messages come to us distorted, for the gulf between the spirit and material thought is immense. Let us take a case well known to all, Jacob's ladder. Jacob dreams of a ladder connecting heaven and earth, and he sees angels descending and ascending this ladder bearing a message from God. There have been several interpretations of this vision, which I will spare you. Now let us try to relate this dream to what we know of the work of angels, and make our own interpretation. God speaking to Jacob represents the spiritual messages of his Adjuster. The movement of the angels descending and ascending represents the mental translation of the divine message translated by them (the guardian angel) for Jacob's understanding and the attempt to elevate his thought to spirit realities. This is a beautiful pictorial way of illustrating part of the work of our guardian angel! In all this process, it must be remembered that our journey will take us from the material through the morontia to the spiritual. Today we are at the bottom of the scale of material reality of existence, but in conjunction with our Adjuster we are being promoted to a reality of spirit existence as a perfected finaliter!

## Upcoming activities

### Change of date of our 2020 AGM

Dear friends, members of the Urantia Association of Quebec,

The measures taken to counter the spread of the COVID-19 disease force us to **change the date of our 2020 Annual General Meeting (AGM)**.

We have moved the scheduled date from April 4 to **Saturday, June 6, 2020**, at the same location: Best Western Hotel in St-Jérôme at 420 boulevard Monseigneur Dubois.

The annual general meeting is an event that must be held every year.

However, the situation is evolving unpredictably and we will notify you if there are any further changes.

### Michael's Party — 2020

***Come and fraternize...***

**Sunday**, **<ins>August 23</ins>**, 2020, 11:15 a.m. you are all invited to the feast of Jesus on **Mount Royal** — near **Beaver Lake**, between the **restaurant** and the paid parking lot (around \$8).

As usual you will just have to follow the directions with the **concentric circles** from the parking lot.

**Bring** your own food, chairs and musical instruments.
