Hello dear readers of our newsletter Réflectivité!

Why a special summer 2021 issue, you ask? The reason is quite simple! I receive texts from you that do not really correspond to the mission of our publication, or they are too long to be published in the limited space we have.

I was wondering how to do justice to these texts that you have taken the trouble to compose in the hope of sharing them with other readers. The solution came to me this week in the production of a special issue. Following a consultation with Line St-Pierre in communications, Gaétan Charland, our president and Robert Cadieux, our proofreader, we came to the conclusion to produce this special issue in electronic format only in order to be free of the cost and space constraints imposed by the paper format. In addition, this publication in electronic format only will provide a well-deserved vacation for our great volunteer Gilles Bertrand, responsible for printing and shipping the paper copies.

So, it is with great pleasure that the whole team offers you this special summer 2021 issue!

Happy reading to all!

## Justice and Mercy

We live in an era characterized more and more by freedom of thought. It is therefore not surprising to see a proliferation of a variety of visions, sometimes opposing, on divine justice and mercy. Traditional religions sometimes opt for implacable justice, like the vengeful God of the Old Testament, while other ideologies offer us a God who can absolve everything and whose love is so compelling that it does violence to the very idea of justice and the free will of creatures. In reality, God in all his perfection wisely combines mercy and justice.

Our Heavenly Father is necessarily merciful to His creation; this is what characterizes His relationship with each of us. He created us incomplete, without knowledge, without experience, and asks us to respond to His invitation: “Be perfect, even as I am perfect.” He knows well that we will make mistakes along the way; this is the lot of those who rise from the imperfect spheres of time and space to the perfection of Paradise. We could define mercy as divine justice adapted to the particular conditions of each creature struggling in the universe. It is a credit of time granted to all intelligent beings to enable them to perfect themselves.

Recently, during our “Discovery” study group, while we were discussing “The Ordination Sermon” booklet 140:3, Line St-Pierre, from the AUQ Communications Committee, suggested that we read this text converted to the “I” and observe the effect.

I highly recommend it after experiencing it.

For best impact, I suggest you 1. Relax, 2. Collect yourself, 3. Then read this text slowly with the eyes of the heart.

Hello everyone,

We are evolutionary beings inhabiting a planet that has suffered many misfortunes, not benefiting like the so-called normal planets, from two great centers of cultures showing us the way for ages. In accordance with the plan of the Universal Father, we receive periodically, revelations of epochs and the last one, the 5th, was the UB. This revelation is what we needed, taking into account our very particular situation, and particularly our poverty on the spiritual level which asks to be raised.

If we take a brief look at the world of houses, we are informed of the following:

1\. Worlds 1 and 2 aim to root out the elements of the beast that remain within us;
2\. <a id="a103_4"></a>[UB 47:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p5_3) On the third mansion world the surviving mortals acquire a practical insight into true metaphysics. This is the true introduction to the intelligent understanding of cosmic meanings and universal interrelationships;
3\. <a id="a104_4"></a>[UB 47:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p6_2) On the fourth mansonia the individual ascender finds his place more properly in the collective work and class functions of the morontia life.

## Implantation of life on a planet

We learn in _The Urantia Book_ that the Life Carriers have implanted life on an evolutionary planet. The expression vital plasma is constantly used to explain the characteristics of life. This expression often leaves the reader perplexed.

**What is vital plasma?**

The dictionary is of little use since it reduces it to blood plasma. I doubt that it is blood plasma that carries the genotype of an individual or a race. Is it not the genes contained in the chromosomes of the egg and sperm that transmit genetic information? That said, what have the Life Carriers implanted or manufactured on our planet?

_550,000,000 years ago_ the corps of Life Carriers returned to Urantia. In cooperation with spiritual potencies and with superphysical forces, we organized and inaugurated the original patterns of life for this world and implanted them in the hospitable waters of the realm. <a id="a124_275"></a>[UB 58:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/58#p4_2)

This implantation of the original models of life (3 implantations) was based on the existence of salt in sea water. This is why the blood that circulates in our body is salty.

The Life Carriers of Satania had projected a sodium chloride life model... <a id="a128_75"></a>[UB 58:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/58#p1_3)

## God is in me

Not long ago, a Muslim friend told me: Samuel, “the Quran is in you” and I replied: yes, God is in me and can become alive in each of us, we must bring to life the divine, unique and original qualities in each of us (Smile).

In the modern era of overconsumption and especially in relation to what “others” say or write about; personal development, self-realization of the true self, wisdom, well-being..., we often forget that this is already available in each of us in an unlimited, unique and original way.

Once man has truly consummated an intimate and close relationship with the living God, a book like Urantia's “little and ought” enables us individually to build into our beings in a logical and reasonable manner the greatness of God's plan, it is this which enhances spiritual perception and expands cosmic consciousness as cosmic citizens.

This broadens and clarifies the framework of our thinking and automatically the framework of faith, of love in the natural spirit of cosmic brotherhood, this is visualizable, imaginable, coherent “and tangible” in the wonder and joyful gratitude of the soul for the glory of God (everything and always for the glory of God).

## Study on Guardian Angels

<figure id="Figure_18" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">

Guardian angels or guardians of destiny are probably the most misunderstood and misunderstood celestial helpers for most human beings. The vast majority of people living on our planet believe in angels and their personal guardian angel, but many of these beliefs are often far-fetched and not in accordance with the actual functions of angels. Much is said or has been said and much is written about angels; one only has to go to a store specializing in esotericism or go to a bookstore in the “spirituality” section to realize this. This means that we can have a very personal interpretation according to the image we have of angels and their functions. The purpose of this study is to better understand the function of the Seraphic Guardians in relation to the function of the Thought Adjusters. Their task is less recognized and yet so essential to the survival of the personality of its human associate.

Perhaps the best description of these seraphic bodies is in _The Urantia Book_, and several papers are devoted to them, and even then these seraphim seem to be unknown to most knowledgeable readers. These spirit beings are a creation of the Mother Spirit of the local Universe and number over 71,663,616 individuals as stated in _The Urantia Book_: <a id="a165_349"></a>[[UB 38:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/38#p6_2)] constitutes the largest operational organization of seraphim, an angelic host. It is rather difficult to elaborate and fully comprehend the very numerous work and functions of all the Seraphic Corps in our local universe. Some of these angelic beings are destined to serve in various capacities in their local universes, and others are destined to become guardian angels.

## Clarifications on words and their definitions

In order to start with a common basis of understanding of the terms used in the revelations, let us clarify together what the revelators are telling us! This research will provide answers to many questions that are sometimes difficult to find among the Urantia Papers. The words in bold are mine to emphasize their importance in the sentence.

**Mind and consciousness**

Mind is a gift from the Third SourceCenter. It is distributed through its daughters, the Mother Spirits of the local universes.

_The ***Third Source-Center***... As the Absolute Mind, it ***is the source of intellect*** throughout the universes_. <a id="a185_119"></a>[UB 9:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/9#p1_1)

_... When the ***Universe Spirit*** has attained her personal status, she exercises in the ***local universe a control of mental gravity*** just as full and complete as the Infinite Spirit would if personally present._ <a id="a187_219"></a>[UB 34:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p2_2)

## The faculty of imagination and visualization of our consciousness

Another little thought I had this morning that has nothing to do with the previous message is that; the faculty of imagination and visualization of our consciousness “always precedes words”, I have come to think that it is precisely imagination and visualization that have led man to speak, write and conceptualize on the basis of the material environment in which he lives.

This is why it is often difficult to understand certain things which are revealed in The Urantia Book, especially concerning that which is beyond space and time. This is why the adjuster (which is us) causes us to perceive and feel things which are difficult to express and yet can be “sensed visually and inwardly.”

I don't know if you will understand, but I find this faculty of the soul extraordinary. The seeker of truth born of faith and who has an intimate relationship with God is automatically in relationship with the spirit of truth, and it is in this sense and with balance that there is something transformative at the level of the soul when we immerse ourselves in the revelations contained in the Urantia Book.

## The human personality

Much discussion on UBIS revolves around the proper understanding of personality. I would like to share with you my very personal view on the subject!

_Human personality is the time-space image-shadow cast by the divine Creator personality. And no actuality can ever be adequately comprehended by an examination of its shadow. Shadows should be interpreted in terms of the true substance.._ <a id="a221_240"></a>[UB 1:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p6_1)

This may explain why it is so difficult for us to get a clear idea of what personality is. If, at the outset, we were to ask ourselves what specifically characterizes personality and what is its function?

## The phenomenon of the relationship

_Claude Flibotte_
Sainte-Julie

Hello dear students of the _Urantia Book_ revelation,

Have you ever stopped to think about being in relationship with others? In section 4 of booklet 105 alone, the word “relationship” appears 12 times! Within this booklet alone, it appears 33 times, and that's without counting the number of times it appears throughout the book. That is to say, the importance of being in relationship is paramount to our Universal Father! Taking into account the hypothesis of successive moments in the expression of the Father, one of the first things he did was to be in relationship with an equal to himself. This is how the Original Son appeared. Then, in this relational union, they desired to activate this creative relationship. This choice resulted in the appearance of the Infinite Spirit. We know the rest, the three of them united in the Paradise Trinity to fulfill their divine purpose.

If the importance of relationship was so to Deity, imagine what it is to us! We have the presence of the Adjuster within us. He is the presence of the Father within. Through our personal relationship with his divine presence, we have the opportunity to build our souls, thus ensuring our future existence, and the happiness of continuing our discovery of this most loving Father!
