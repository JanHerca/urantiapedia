Hello readers and friends of the association,

Here is a thought that has occupied my mind for several years. It originates from a passage in the Publication Mandate given by the revelators to guide us in our task of sharing ***The Urantia Book and its teachings***. “_The Book is given to those who are ready for it, ***long*** before the day of its world mission._”

I have wondered a lot about the deeper meaning of this statement. What exactly does “**those who are ready**” mean? Who are we, readers of _The Urantia Book_? Are we special people, chosen people, or people with a certain potential built into our personality? That to believe that we are chosen or special is tendentious and dangerous. I prefer to think that we have potential and that could explain many things. We find that many people are not ready to read The Urantia Book and that is so.

In our desire to share or make known the book, the cumulative experiences of refusals and rejections encountered are very conclusive and revealing. So the question arises, who are we, readers, students of revelation?

At the moment of our birth the universe Mother Spirit imparts the potentials of personality and heredity to Divinington, that celestial sphere wherein reside the Adjusters who are selected and trained to indwell the mortal mind.

So we inherit an experienced Adjuster specifically chosen for each of us and trained to help us express our full potential.

For those of us who know ***The Urantia Book***, we have the responsibility now to actualize that potential that classifies us as “those who are ready” for ***The Urantia Book***. Without our willingness to act, nothing gets done. If our choice is to do nothing, it becomes a tremendous loss to us, to our world, and to the Adjuster within us.

When we discover the truth, it sets us free. Do we need to know what it sets us free from? I would be tempted to say that it sets us free from ignorance, indolence, impatience, intolerance, and the fear of action.

Let us remember what Jesus said; once we have entered the Kingdom of Heaven, we must work to remain there. What great spiritual joy we felt in discovering the truth found in ***The Urantia Book***! And in that excitement, we attempted to share what we had found. We were met with countless rejections, snide remarks, and even ridicule. In fact, our real work had just begun; the long process of learning how to share ***The Urantia Book and its teachings***. Let us ask ourselves, which is more important, sharing the book or its teachings? Too often, we choose the easier way, sharing the book in the naive hope that it will one day be read by every human on this planet.

Let’s face it! According to Jesus’ teachings and the many examples he gave us, training to learn how to share the teachings is essential if we are to truly express that potential that prepared us for revelation. The best and most effective way to disseminate the teachings is undoubtedly to become a living example of the truths contained in the book.

The Urantia Association of Quebec offers you, under the **EDUCATION** tab of its website, access to different schools promoting courses on the teachings of the book and how to share them. It may be interesting to become scholars of the _Urantia Book_, but I sincerely believe that it is more important to become good sowers of truth. We must also add the study groups, very formative, which are there to allow you to share your learning difficulties as well as your successes.

So what will we do with the seeds of truth entrusted to our care? Will we be sowers or will we keep these seeds for ourselves?

Here are three quotes I read before a morning meditation that partly inspired this post.

As time went on, the young carpenter from Nazareth measured every institution of society and every custom of religion more and more by an invariable criterion. **What does it do for the human soul? Does it bring God closer to man? Does it lead man to God?** <a id="a52_258"></a>[UB 126:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p2_5)

HOW TO LOVE MORE?

“[...] You must change even more. You should become the apostle of the new commandment that I have given you tonight. **Dedicate your life to teaching your brothers to love one another as I have loved you.** ” <a id="a56_210"></a>[UB 181:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/181#p2_4)

As John Zebedee stood there in the upper room, with tears running down his cheeks, he looked the Master in the face and said, “I will do it, my Master, but how can I learn to love my brethren more?” And Jesus then answered, “You will learn to love your brethren more by first learning to love their Father in heaven more, and then really becoming more interested in their welfare in time and eternity. And all such human interest is nourished by understanding sympathy, unselfish service, and unbounded forgiveness. ... in human affairs there is no substitute for actual experience. Strive to live at peace with all, and especially with your friends in the brotherhood of the heavenly kingdom. And then, John, always remember not to contend with the souls you would win to the kingdom.” <a id="a58_787"></a>[UB 181:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/181#p2_5)

To love is to serve

The revelators teach us about the existence of Adjusters. These have at least two destinies: either to merge with their human subject or to be personalized. So, let us see together what they are and what distinguishes them subsequently according to their destiny.
<br style="clear:both;"/>

### Origin and nature

The Mystery Monitors are fragments of God (<a id="a77_43"></a>[UB 107:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p0_3)) that inhabit the human mind in order to divinize it, to make this individual like the Father. They are the actualization of the Father's love associated with the human soul and they will be the essence of the personality of the latter when he has become a finaliter (<a id="a77_355"></a>[UB 107:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p0_2)), a perfect spirit in supreme intention <a id="a77_439"></a>[UB 107:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p5_6)

All Mystery Monitors are of the same nature initially. They are the absolute essence of the infinity of the Universal Father. They are pure, unadulterated divinity (from the Father alone), unqualified and undiluted parts of Deity, in fact, they are God (<a id="a79_254"></a>[UB 107:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p1_2)). Let us understand, they are all that God is. The same attributes granted to God are also granted to his fragments (<a id="a79_415"></a>[UB 107:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p4_1)). They are absolute within the limits of the potential of their fragmented nature, that is, they are qualified (limited) in universality but not in their divinity nature in matters of fact, meaning, and value (<a id="a79_669"></a>[UB 107:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p4_2)). The reality of the Adjusters borders on absoluteness. They are existential in the sense that in the mind of God and being God, they always were, they are eternal. So let us really grasp the magnificence and the chance of being eventually unified with this individualization of deity! Since they originate only in the Father, they are a fragmentation of the hypothetical moment when the Father was pre-father, that is, before the actualization of the Original Son, instituting the personality of God as the Father of that Son, making the Father the father of all personalities (<a id="a79_1292"></a>[UB 6:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/6#p0_1), <a id="a79_1333"></a>[UB 10:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p2_1), and <a id="a79_1380"></a>[UB 10:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p3_5)). They are prior even before the existence of Paradise gravity (<a id="a79_1486"></a>[UB 107:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p6_6) and <a id="a79_1534"></a>[UB 11:9.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p9_3)). This is the explanation of the prepersonal nature of these fragments. As Deitypersonality, on the subabsolute levels, God fragments on the prepersonal level; on the personal level, he creates; and on the superpersonal level, he externalizes <a id="a79_1819"></a>[UB 0:2.2-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p2_2)

### Adjusters Classification

There are seven classifications assigned to Adjusters (107:2), but for the purposes of this study we will observe five classifications designating varying degrees of experience in their ministry in the cosmos. Virgin Adjusters are those who are serving for the first time in a human mind (<a id="a83_289"></a>[UB 107:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p2_2)). Advanced Adjusters are those who have served for one or more periods in creature fusion with an individualized portion of the Divine Minister of their universe (<a id="a83_496"></a>[UB 107:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p2_3)). Supreme Adjusters are those who have indwelt several fusion-capable humans but who have refused survival or those of both categories previously mentioned after much experience. Fused Adjusters designate those who have fused with their human subject and will become finaliters (<a id="a83_819"></a>[UB 107:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p2_7)). Personalized Adjusters refer to those who have served with the incarnated Paradise Sons and those who have been especially distinguished in their ministry but whose mortal has refused survival (<a id="a83_1059"></a>[UB 107:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p2_8)).

### Custom Adjusters

This type of Adjuster embraces the essence of the potential of all the attributes of Deity. They are the absolute quintessence in divinity of the universe presence of the eternal and infinite Paradise Father (<a id="a87_209"></a>[UB 107:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p4_1)). In addition, they have acquired through their many indwellings of a human or divine mind the inestimable experience of attempting to divinize an imperfect human mind. Through their immense service, and probably under the recommendation of the Ancients of Days (<a id="a87_516"></a>[UB 107:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p2_8)), these Adjusters receive from the Father the gift of personality. This is not the personality of the Father's infinity, but an individualization of personalization such as only the Father in his infinity can bestow. To some extent, this new personality may bear some resemblance to the personality of one of its former hosts (<a id="a87_887"></a>[UB 109:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p6_6)). Thus, these personalized Adjusters, like that of Jesus at the time of his baptism, retain their divine attributes. They are at once prepersonal, personal and superpersonal, in fact they are omnipersonal (<a id="a87_1137"></a>[UB 109:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p7_3) and 4). They are beings who come jointly from time and eternity. They combine the experience of the Creator and the creature (<a id="a87_1307"></a>[UB 109:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p7_2)).

### The Merged Adjusters

These are Adjusters who have fused themselves with the soul of their human subject. They have all the attributes of personalized Adjusters, but without the omnipersonality, at least as I understand it. All the experience and values of one eventually become the property of the other as one entity (<a id="a91_298"></a>[UB 110:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p7_4)). The Adjuster, being eternal, will require eternity and the successive Paradise experiences to transmit to his former human subject the full divinity of his experience. Through the experience of the last sleep of time and space and awakening on Paradise as a pilgrim of eternity (<a id="a91_623"></a>[UB 27:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p1_1) to 3) before the Universal Father, he will be able to acquire the past eternity experience of the Adjuster and to transmit to the Supreme Being as a sixth-stage spirit being a mind factor representing the ancient union of mortal mind and divine mind (<a id="a91_916"></a>[UB 107:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p5_6)). Formerly, in humans, this union had formed the soul, now it suprematizes the Supreme Being, the progressive actualization of a new deity.

Fusion means that the pilgrim and the Adjuster become one and the same person. There is no idea of communication between the two former entities. The pilgrim is divine, and the divine is the pilgrim. The finest example is the human Jesus just before his baptism. He had at that time attained the pinnacle of mental and spiritual balance possible for a human being. The revelators tell us that on the average we will attain this stage on the sixth mansion world.

### Conclusion

Our Adjuster indwells our material mind, and although he is a spirit, he must do his entire work of spiritualization on intellectual bases in order to bring forth through evolution the soul, our real self, our true identity (<a id="a97_225"></a>[UB 111:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_1)). This material mind has been loaned to us by the Divine Minister for the duration of our human life (<a id="a97_371"></a>[UB 111:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_5)). She bestows upon us her adjutant spirit circuits and her spiritual circuit, the Holy Spirit. The Father has given us the personality with free will and its unique function of unifying all that we are. The Father has also bestowed upon us the reality of the Adjusters, the very presence of the divinity of deity. All this, plus other spiritual aids, is at work to make us perfect beings, finaliters. So let us now set to work to fulfill our destiny by mastering our minds, by divinizing ourselves through the doing of the will of the Father as represented by the leadings of our Adjuster. The more we seek with the help of the intellect of all our strength of soul and heart to know this loving Father, the more we will love Him, the more we will love our brothers and sisters and the more we will become like the Father, that is to say divine! And, do not forget, it is not what the mind understands that ensures survival, but rather what it seeks to understand (<a id="a97_1380"></a>[UB 111:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_5)). So, let us not be discouraged, because as the revelators say, _the best way for a tadpole to become a frog, is to live faithfully each moment like a tadpole_ (<a id="a97_1585"></a>[UB 100:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p1_4))!

In conclusion, I perceive a personalized Adjuster as closer to his original status since he retains his omnipersonality, that is, prepersonal, personal, and existential superpersonality. As for the fused Adjuster, he seems to pass from the absolute existential level to the finite experiential level (<a id="a99_301"></a>[UB 107:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p2_7)). On the other hand, in the endless adventure of this pilgrim on the four levels of the absonite outer spaces and beyond into the infinite cosmos, will the Adjuster, through his unified host, regain the status of superpersonality and even a certain degree of absolute experiential personality?

## Virtual conference presented by Guy Antequera

Sunday, October 16, 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.

“**The Earth-Moon Distance**”, according to the teachings of the book and current scientific discoveries

Of all the attributes of God, his omnipotence, especially as it predominates in the material universes, is best understood. Viewed as a nonspiritual phenomenon, God is energy. This statement of physical fact is based on the incomprehensible truth that the First Source and Center is the primordial cause of the universal physical phenomena of all space. All physical energy and other material manifestations are derived from this divine activity. Light, we mean light without heat, is another nonspiritual manifestation of the Deities. And there is another form of nonspiritual energy as yet practically unknown on Urantia because it is not yet recognized. <a id="a109_657"></a>[UB 3:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p2_3)

This paragraph deals with energy; we read very well that a form of energy on Urantia IS NOT YET RECOGNIZED, so people have approached it and the establishment has not yet recognized it, it is obvious, it would replace all existing energies. Only Nicolas Tesla found it. Many researchers are busy finding what Tesla had discovered, the quest is exciting; Tesla said that the future belonged to him.
