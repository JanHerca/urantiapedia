As you may have discovered, we have automated the membership fee procedure for membership or renewal of membership card and thus, make your payment online. The Association has progressed with technology and wants to facilitate the transfer of responsibilities to others who will take up this challenge in due time.

We are committed to maintaining the interest of readers from all over the world who find themselves on the AUQ website and discover the many student works, local and international publications, our history since its beginnings, photos and videos of all its wonderful fraternal meetings as well as certain conferences recorded since the advent of the virtual.

But, it's been 14 months since there have been any in-person meetings. The last activity was in August 2019 at Villa StMartin during the Quebec congress, and of course our December social meeting.

Many of you remember the three, sometimes four themes per year, in addition to the picnic for Michael's birthday and the holiday meal that were organized each year! This condition requires us to act creatively to keep in touch with the student readers and fraternize with them. There is a core of readers, about thirty in Quebec, who follow and participate in everything that the association organizes virtually and which also benefits our French-speaking African and European brothers. Thank you for offering to give your time and knowledge by offering a conference and increasing the understanding of the teachings among your contemporaries.

I am pleased to announce that Conrad Lavallée will deliver the next lecture on February 28. On Saturday, February 13 at 1:00 p.m. I will pass the torch of the presidency to my successor at the Annual General Meeting. You will find the link in an insert of this publication, as well as the link for February 28.

While revisiting the photos section of our site, I counted the people who have served as presidents at the AUQ during the 20 years I have been involved. There has been Gaétan Charland, Guy Perron, Alain Cyr, Johanne Séguin, Maurice Migneault and me for the past four years.

It is very interesting to pause and reflect on the journey of our lives since we have had the book in hand and see where we have met challenges, made progress, and made progress. When I began reading The Urantia Book, I never could have imagined where this revelation would lead me in serving the Urantia brotherhood.

Whose turn is it?

Fraternally,

Dear brothers and sisters of Urantia, in this global period of trying times for a great majority of our fellow citizens of this world it occurred to me that we could unite our efforts in love for the good of all and thus do useful work. We know and know the power of prayer so I thought that with the participation of all of us, it would be possible for us to organize a powerful action of love, generosity and empathy. We all know that there is currently in our country as elsewhere a great deal of distress, distress in all its forms.

Would this not be an opportunity for all of us, Urantia believers, to act with the help of our adjusters and by our willingness to serve to demonstrate to our divine Father, that by the power of a strong, humble and sincere prayer, we will implore Him so that HE sends His light as well as His wisdom on all those who are in the shadow of this terrifying situation for many so that they are inspired to change their selfish and proud behaviors which seem to be the primary cause of this pandemic. Racism, hatred, lack of respect for disadvantaged individuals, for nature including animals, water, air, earth, etc.

Let us show love and solidarity to all our brothers and sisters of Urantia. I suggest a ZOOM meeting that could take place on Sunday morning, February 7 at 11 a.m. for a duration of 15 to 20 minutes. We suggest that we could do a few introductory prayers followed by the intimate and profound prayers of each of us. You can, if you prefer, simply join us in spirit at the suggested time without going through ZOOM. For any questions or to obtain the ZOOM access code, I cordially invite you to contact me or Line St-Pierre at:

## Dancing with God — <br> Living in Love in These Difficult Times

After more than 15 months without the possibility of meeting, I asked myself the following question, would it be possible to create the right atmosphere in an online retreat as we usually do in our in-person retreats?

The four of us, Katharina Becker, Doreen Heine and Carolyn Prentice from the United States, the Daughters of God, had to experiment first, and assess any potential inconveniences or technical difficulties before convening a small group in “the cloud”! With a little experience in this new way of doing things on Zoom, and more preparation on our part, our plan was put into action!

We invited women who had already participated in one of our retreats, to get a better idea of how the interaction might happen when we are virtual and looking at the screen without really knowing who we are talking to. Since these participants were already familiar with how in-person retreats work, they should be able to adapt their participation to the small screen.

The day before the retreat, just like we do in our meetings at the Foundation or elsewhere, we planned a small two-hour meeting as an icebreaker. We had an aperitif at home and interacted with the group online. It was very nice to see each other again, even through this small screen, and to keep up to date with the news and the latest news.

The next day, Sunday, December 13, from noon to 4:30 p.m., after informing them of the protocol of this platform, we spent time in prayer and meditation before regrouping in the first of the three circles of trust that we led.

The eleven participants had settled in a quiet place, in the comfort of their homes, without any disturbance from electronic devices. The intimacy of this group was experienced as if they were in a sacred bubble, thus fostering the authenticity of each one in sharing this union of souls. We presented and discussed the question: ***The Universe is supposed to be a dance of cooperation and love, so how can we find the courage to move forward and dance in these difficult times?***

This is how hearts were opened and other hearts received and were filled with love, that love of our Heavenly Father and His spiritual helpers.

One of the participants read us what the Catholic priest, author and theologian Henri Nouwen wrote:

**Listening is a form of spiritual hospitality,**
**Whereby you invite strangers to become friends**
**To know their inner self better,**
**And even dare to keep quiet with you.**

We were all grateful for the level of trust, respect, and vulnerability in our exchanges. Our individual contributions came from Spirit, which does not discriminate whether we are in person or on a virtual platform. Spirit recognizes the state of the soul. By the end of the afternoon, we all felt uplifted and supported in this sacred circle.

In this first meeting of the year concerning our weekly study group on the zoom platform, during a reading on the Thought Adjusters, we quickly found ourselves, in the middle of the reading, on a common tangent, that of clarifying and understanding emotions that for many had arisen in their minds. This following the events and the painful news about our current world situation. (Virus, social unrest, isolation... etc.)

Then while talking about anxiety, stress and insecurity that we were all experiencing, we started to give our tips, techniques and personal methods to help us counter all these negative emotions.

Then, seeing all the ideas the participants were expressing, we decided that it would be good to share some of them with our reader friends.

For my part, what helps me a lot is sharing with my partner every day, with my group of readers and my family. But what soothes me the most are my morning meditations, I do them in three steps, here they are:
1. A reading in my blue book (L.U.).
2. A time of silence and reflection on the subject read.
3. A viewing technique through my creative imagination.

Reading nourishes me, soothes me, guides me (1). Silence and reflection bring divine teachings and values into me (2). The technique of visioning and spiritual creative imagination relaxes me, because I feel like it is a wordless prayer, a moment of worship (3).

I would like to share with you my mental images. I envision a village where human civilization and culture are even more advanced than today. The humans I glimpse, men, women and children are of extraordinary beauty not just in their physical appearance, but in the grace they exude and in their attitude and actions.

Their fraternal commitment is alive in this community. They have learned to harmonize science, philosophy and spiritual wisdom in their everyday lives and their environment is truly proof of this. The beauty of this village overwhelms me. I would like to project myself there as their way of life is so efficient, equitable and harmonious.

I know and I am aware that what I imagine will become reality in a future that may be distant, but certainly certain.

Coming back to our meeting, each of us listened attentively to the tips and methods that several of us offered to the others. What a wonderful meeting we had! I think it is part of our meetings to take the time to exchange our ideas and support each other in what we are currently experiencing.

I kindly invite all members of reading groups to share and publish in Réflectivité their tips or solutions that they have recently experienced regarding this current topic.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Our friend and sister, Lise Routhier, at the age of 80, set off on the long eternal journey on January 11.
She leaves her handsome Pierre who lives with one of their adopted sons, Luc Desbiens at 273 rue principale est, Ste-Hélène de Kamouraska G0L 3J0

_In Paradisum_

It's just goodbye, Lise...
May the doors of the Kingdom of Heaven be open to you, as your own doors were open to love, sharing, listening, kindness, welcoming, mutual aid, respect for all those who knocked at your door, to all those you loved, through the friendship and fraternity that you were so good at showing us throughout your life!

Thank you for the beauty of your soul, the fidelity of your precious love!

Bon voyage through the Infinity and Eternity of the Kingdom of God!

_Louise Sauve_

This activity allows several readers of different levels of understanding to exchange and study together the teachings of The Urantia Book. It promotes spiritual progress by allowing its participants to find practical applications to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ in their daily lives. This important step helps to maintain a broad perspective on concepts of truth.
