## URANTIA ASSOCIATION INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS 2015

_Line St-Pierre_

_Communications Committee Urantia Association of Quebec_

_Theme :_

***“From the human to the Divine Revealing oneself to God”***

From July 30 to August 2, the Urantia Association of Quebec will host the 2015 Congress at Bishop's University in Lennoxville. Registration will be held on Thursday, July 30, and presentations and workshops will continue until Sunday, August 2.

The program and costs will be posted online from November and registration will begin at that time. We will keep you informed of developments.

We are looking for volunteers to greet participants at the Dorval airport on July 30th. We also need people to greet participants at Bishop's. We are also looking for musicians, singers, dancers and anyone else who can provide a performance for the entertainment component.

It is always very interesting to attend a Urantia Conference in another country, and to be received for a few days by readers in their residence in order to get to know each other and their culture better. You can experience this next August and welcome a participant or a couple into your home for a few days and get to know each other better. We are looking for hosts in Quebec and Ontario.

You wish to participate in this adventure with other readers, you have questions, please contact us at association.urantia.quebec@gmail.com $\square$

## Editor's note

_Normand Laperle_
_Lévis_

Regarding the international congress next summer, I would like to share my experience with other congresses of this type that I have attended. The most important thing is the fact that you meet people from all over the world and of all faiths.

Imagine going to another country to attend this kind of conference. You, who come from elsewhere, will want, among other things, to meet the people there, and to get in touch with their culture.

Traditionally, at such conferences, it is the regional people of the host country who are represented in greater numbers. Take advantage of it, while it is on your doorstep. You may not get another chance.

At the Lennoxville International Convention, people from elsewhere will want to meet people from here. That's you.

And if you volunteer, you'll also have a unique opportunity to engage in a “service to others” activity for a cause that's close to your heart: The Urantia Book, which attempts to “expand cosmic consciousness and heighten spiritual perception” ([UB 0:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p1_2)) on our little blue planet.

Another thing: I would like to congratulate the organizing team. It is not easy to prepare an “international” congress. And it is not over. We need you. It is time to show solidarity with your colleagues. It is we, Quebecers, who are organizing this congress. We are the host country. Your contribution will be appreciated.

Hélène Boisvenue's article summarizes what happened at our meeting in Drummondville.

I would like to add that it seemed like it had been a long time since we had a meeting in Drummondville, because there was a good turnout. We should do them more often.
I would also like to say, about this meeting, that among the seven testimonies that we heard, not one was alike. The life experience of each of us is absolutely unique. It is identity. And it is beautiful to see. $\square$

## Meeting in Drummondville of readers from Quebec, September 21, 2014

_Helene Boisvenue_
_Sherbrooke_

On September 21, at the Hôtel Le Dauphin in Drummondville, the Urantia Association of Quebec brought together readers of the Urantia Book for a discussion meeting organized under the theme: "Living and Sharing - How to Live and Share the Teachings of Jesus $”$. The members of the Association responded in large numbers and we counted 39 people present. The warmth of the embraces expressed well all the pleasure that we had in meeting up in this way to fraternize, strengthen our friendships and nourish our spirituality. Seven readers of the Urantia Book developed a specific subject related to the theme of the meeting and very generously agreed to present it to us.

1. **Gaétan Charland**, — as president of the Association in Quebec, demonstrated, with figures to support it, the relevance of forming numerous study groups of The Urantia Book. The audience was thus able to become aware that thousands of study groups must develop so that their influence is decisive and that cosmic consciousness can extend on our planet and spiritual perception can be elevated.
2. **Guy Perron**, — teacher in Quebec for the Urantia Book Internet School (UBIS), briefly presented the methodology of this training which takes place over four periods of two weeks each and which effectively relies on a process of questions to be answered based on texts chosen from The Urantia Book. Guy encouraged the leaders of the study groups to use this formula to energize their meetings.
3. **Guy Le Blanc**, — reader from the Quebec region, has developed over the years a certain expertise in speaking to children and introducing them to a taste for spirituality and an awareness of the strong potential they carry within them. Guy, through a few anecdotes and examples, demonstrated that it can be simple to approach the idea of God with children. For some time, he has been trying to use his expertise as an educator with the elderly and he challenges himself to love these people as much as he loves children.
4. **Line St-Pierre**, an associate trustee of Urantia Foundation, has organized a think tank for women readers of _The Urantia Book_ who are concerned about their underrepresentation in the Urantia movement and want to understand the reasons for this situation. In her presentation, Line described her experience with this group and stated that women have their own sensitivity to understand beauty, goodness and truth and that they must have the courage to bear witness to it. A few people within the Foundation in Chicago are pushing Line to organize such groups in the United States.
5. **Jean-Simon Yelle**, — father of a 5-year-old girl, became aware of the importance of guiding his child in his spiritual growth. This young parent identified four themes that could serve as a pillar for this necessary teaching: a) The fatherhood of God. b) The presence of God in us. c) Love as a support for life. d) Freedom. For each of these themes, Jean-Simon gave us appropriate vocabulary that resonates with the child. For example, regarding love, he pushes his little girl to become a superhero, that of love. We were all moved by the sensitivity and skill of this new educator who gave the parents and grandparents present the desire to get involved in turn.
6. **Maurice Migneault**, a reader from the Ottawa region, drawing on a triple experience as a host of a study group, presented the dangers that await us when, during our meetings, we fall into sterile debates. Maurice provided us with some behavioral tips to maintain harmony in the group.
7. **Normand Laperle**, — reader from the Quebec region and responsible for the monthly edition of Réflectivité, testified to the benefit derived from his participation in study groups. “I went from belief to faith,” he said. This spiritual experience that has permeated his entire life has colored his experience in the workplace and improved the relationship with his partner who suffers from a serious handicap. “With the Adjuster as a “partner,” he said, “every opportunity must be seized to go further.” In this context, the reward is instantaneous.

The Urantia Book states in Paper 100 that certain “habits of thought and action contribute to the economy of spiritual growth,” including, among others, “the recognition of the religious life in others” and “the sharing of spirituality with that of our fellows.” (Paper 100:1.8; p. 1095:3) Based on this teaching of the Book, one might conclude that those present at this fruitful gathering were able to benefit from this mysterious force generated by brotherhood and that this force will surely produce an elevation of our values.

The day ended with team discussions, a report of which will be published later. $\square$

## UNDERGROUND BOSS

_Louise Renaud_
_Quebec_

Watching the TV show “Undercover Boss” I saw so many beautiful things. The experience that these bosses allowed themselves to live, transformed them personally first, to then change the well-being of their employees and finally improve the company itself.

When we want something or a service to be done well and delivered well in a timely manner, without wasting time, energy or materials, we must demonstrate a certain efficiency and professionalism in carrying out the task at hand.

When a boss dares to place himself incognito in the place of one of his workers at the base of his company, the latter will really discover what goes on in the daily life of these employees.

To solve various problems or to correct all kinds of shortcomings, this bold character will go and do the usual work that any member performs daily. This boss will then see what the weaknesses are surrounding the exercise of this function. He will then be able to make the corrections, if necessary, for the smooth running of the company. These improvements will probably be very practical and fully justified.

This boss, disguised as a trainee employee, passes anonymously into this first line of exceptional observation. As a result, he meets clandestinely the staff carrying out their daily business.

Are these employees competent? Good? Efficient? Motivated? Are they safe? Do they have adequate machinery or outdated tools? What do they need to become more efficient? Some suggestions will be well retained, later the corrections will be made according to the boss's instructions.

In one program, we saw that an employer, touched by the determination of one of his craftsmen, allowed himself to soften his fate a little, not only by positively changing his work environment, but by increasing his remuneration, all this in favor of this efficient employee.

In another case, of one of these clandestine bosses, the first manager asked himself the question about a young employee who was not motivated. He wondered if this individual seriously wanted to stay in his company. He then asked himself what he could do to motivate him more? Instead of firing him, this affable boss took the time to meet personally with the young man to correct the situation and stimulate him.

I remember another big boss who noticed that a well-motivated employee who loved her job lacked the means to advance in the company, simply because the information required to facilitate access to higher positions had not reached this person. In fact, the company offered this training which was indeed accessible to any employee. The compassionate boss therefore immediately remedied the situation.

At the end of the broadcasts, there is a formal summons to the company's general office and there the workers discover the true identity of this supposed “new” intern. What a shock, this person was none other than the big boss!

The latter explains to the employees that he understands the particular conditions of their work and that he has already taken practical measures to resolve and improve the situation. All for the well-being of the employees and for better functionality of the company. This boss, by daring to live through these difficult times, has exercised concrete compassion and understanding and has allowed him to discover a new dimension and perception of his company.

Remember the young man who was not motivated, the boss having teenagers himself, saw the behavior of this young adult resembling his own children. He acted like a parent and gave him the opportunity to meet him and discuss his future.

---

After viewing a few of these broadcasts, I could not help but draw an analogy to the seven (7) bestowals of Michael of Nebadon. Why did he actually undertake this task? What did he personally gain and what contributions did these visits make to each of these worlds?

Did not these bosses act like Michael, who saw all his worlds as the home of his beloved children?

_The Urantia Book_ submits to us that the purpose of these incarnations in creature form is to enable these creators (the Michaels) to become, among other things, wise, compassionate, just, and understanding rulers. These divine sons are naturally just, but they become mercifully benevolent as a result of these successive bestowal experiences. They are naturally merciful, but these experiences cause them to become even more merciful and in a new way.

_The Urantia Book_ tells us that these bestowals are the final stages of their education and training for the sublime task of governing the local universes in divine righteousness and just judgment. ([See Paper 119](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119))

The attribute of bestowal is inherent in the Paradise Sons.

- A. The Sons Michael and Avonal have the responsibility to know well, to control, to master their local universe and for that it is necessary that they (the Michaels) approach closely the experiences of the life of the creatures who are subordinate to them.
- B. The Michaels have the desire, the opportunity and the duty to accomplish these seven effusions and this serves as their personal training.

But what astonishes me most and I had never paid attention to this detail, this service of bestowal comes directly from the Eternal Son of the Paradise Trinity, because it is he himself who showed the way in this practice by bestowing himself seven times on the seven circuits of Havona and the Eternal Son continues to do it through his Sons Michael and Avonal.

_The Urantia Book_ says that these seven bestowals are actually personal training for the Michaels and this training brings the Michaels many benefits.
1. The purpose of these incarnations in creature form is to enable these Creators to become wise, compassionate, just and understanding rulers.
2. One of these benefits is to receive full sovereignty over his local universe. Indeed, Michael makes a solemn oath not to assume his full sovereignty of the new creation (his local universe) until his seven creature bestowals have been successfully completed and confirmed by the Ancients of Days.

But it is through all this exercise that Michael has accomplished, not only for our planet, but also for other worlds, his grandiose and endless message.

Continuing, The Urantia Book tells us that the Michael Sons begin their work of universe organization with right and complete sympathy for the various orders of beings which they have created. They have vast reserves of mercy for all these different creatures, even pity for those who go astray and become mired in the quagmire of selfishness which they themselves have produced. But the Ancients of Days deem these gifts of justice and righteousness not sufficient. These triune rulers of the superuniverses will never confirm a Creator Son as universe sovereign until he has actually acquired the viewpoint of his own creatures by actual experience in the environment in which they have their existence.... In this way these Sons become wise and understanding leaders....

When our business leaders and I hope government leaders know this wisdom, will they venture into clandestine bosses?

Jesus appeared on this planet as Joshua ben Joseph, born at noon on August 21, 7 BCE and about 2,000 years after this event we learn from the 5th revelation that he was actually Michael of Nebadon! So, one might ask, was he the first model of an underground boss? $\square$
