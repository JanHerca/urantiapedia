## Word from the President

_Line St-Pierre_
president@urantiaqc.org

Does reading The Urantia Book make us immune to the problems and challenges that await us in the twists and turns of everyday life? Everyone experiences their share of adversities, and knowing the truth does not make the difficulties any easier to face, because no one is immune to the stress and anxiety that it can cause.

Living a healthy life and making the sincere and continuous effort to want to transform ourselves, as suggested in the booklets, contributes to our physical and mental well-being.

It is through the technique of daily prayer, meditation and worship that we come to exercise balance in our lives. We feel refreshed, enlightened, strengthened and above all, our faith grows and becomes liberating from all those shackles that bind us.

In return, the more we receive, the more we become dependent on these intuitions, gift truths, and it is in the choice of selfless service to others that the enhancement of these magnificent teachings takes on its full meaning.

## The position of vice-president at AUQ becomes available in February

_Normand Laperle_
_Vice-president_

Hello, I am ending my term as Vice-President of the AUQ at the time of the “Annual General Meeting” (AGM) in Drummondville in February 2018. The position is open for re-election.

If you're interested in getting involved—but are hesitant—read on.

The first time I applied for a position on the AUQ Board of Directors, I had some small fears. Here is the result of my experience “after” having held the position of Vice-President for a few years.

**<ins>Distance</ins>, during meetings with other members of the AUQ Board of Directors**

<ins>My fear</ins>: Most of the other members of the Board are from Montreal. I am from Quebec. It is very far to meet. I cannot afford the cost and time of transportation.

<ins>In fact</ins>: Physical meetings are not required for these meetings. It is always possible to meet via “Zoom” — a super easy-to-use computer application. You need a **computer**, ideally equipped with a **webcam**, all connected to the **Internet**.

You receive an invitation by email. You click on a link in that email. The connection happens automatically. An app opens and you see everyone appear on the screen. And it's free.

Goodbye to transportation, when it's an obstacle. You stay at home in your slippers.

**I also had some apprehensions about the fact that I knew nothing about the <ins>meeting procedures</ins> of the AUQ Board of Directors.**

We discuss, we propose, we vote, etc. For legal reasons, we must follow these procedures during our meetings.

A small example of these procedures can be seen at the AUQ's “Annual General Meetings” (AGM) in Drummondville in February of each year.

<ins>My fear</ins>: I know nothing about these procedures.

<ins>In fact</ins>: No one demands to learn these rules by heart. There is always someone in the group who knows them well enough. Over time, they are learned naturally, through use.

If you want to delve deeper into these procedures, you can do so by reading documentation on the subject — accessible and free.

We quickly realize that 99% of the time, during these meetings, we are in discussion. We are among friends, we help each other and we discuss.

**I also had concerns about <ins>whether my presence could benefit AUQ</ins>.**

It is a question of self-esteem. Self-esteem is all the easier to acquire when we are well surrounded. During certain meetings with “new readers”, I have often heard the following comment: “You other readers of ”The Urantia Book“, you have an attitude towards others that I have difficulty in understanding. You are a great listener and respect for others”.

My interpretation: We are very aware that we are evolving and that in this process we all have a lot of work to do on ourselves. Hence the listening and respect for others. There is also the fact that we are very committed to self-examination and the search for truth.

Why not take advantage of this favorable environment? In addition, we learn to express our ideas, to listen, to deal with others, the art of compromise, respect for the democratic process.

**<ins>Here are some specific tasks</ins> of the Vice President position.**

The vice president is said to be the person who supports the president and who can eventually replace him, depending on the circumstances. Phew!! That's heavy...

In the AUQ CA, what you have to understand is that the CA members form a group, and they support each other. When one person has difficulty, the others help. I know what I'm talking about, because I've experienced it. I'll tell you more about it later.

The AUQ Board of Directors is made up of four people: the president, the vice-president, the secretary and the treasurer.

In the AUQ CA, the vice-president is the one who prepares the general public activities. This can be a great challenge to take on and a great experience to live.

On the other hand, in reality, everyone pitches in, depending on each person's availability. It's the group effect I mentioned above that takes over.

We discuss in groups, the what, the how and who does what. We must not forget that - unlike private companies - we are an organization of volunteers. We are not professionals assigned to the tasks we do. We take into account the strengths and weaknesses of each person. If someone wants to live an experience, we give them space and encourage them in their approach. Also, if someone has difficulty, we help them.

That's how it is in the AUQ CA.

**ins The moral of this whole story?**

I discovered that it is a great opportunity for anyone who wants to surpass themselves, to improve in any area (organizing activities, speaking in public, etc.).

As readers of The Urantia Book, we all know that each of us is absolutely unique; that we are endowed with absolute free will, that we are responsible for what we are and what we become.

Up to you.

**<ins>My “very personal” experience</ins>**

Many people already know about my current life experience.

My partner had a third stroke in 2012. Since then, I have been taking care of her full-time, 24/7. At first it was demanding. I had difficulty making ends meet. Since then, a routine has set in and it has become easy.

I then took responsibility for the AUQ Réflectivité. (Collection of articles, assembly and delivery). Same thing: A very busy start to set up my working base. Then, the routine set in and it became easy.

Later, I joined the AUQ board as vice-president. I had been wanting to do so for a few years. At first, I got fully involved in all the tasks.

I really enjoyed organizing themes. It was very rewarding. My goal was for it to become routine, like the rest of what I did.

I also really enjoyed speaking in public. I made great progress in my self-confidence, and consequently I felt more and more comfortable. I asked to be able to lead a group discussion in order to build my skills at this level. The group accepted and they supported me in this process. I am happy with my progress.

But now my partner's condition has deteriorated slightly. Just enough for me to be — subtly — overwhelmed by the magnitude of all my tasks. I give priority to my partner. I have had what I believe to be the beginnings of burnout, and consequently the beginnings of depression. As they say: “no longer capable!”

Result: As I said above, the group helped me by taking over almost all of my tasks that, normally, would have been my responsibility.

I publicly thank the AUQ Board of Directors for the technical and psychological support provided. It is exemplary. I have nothing but praise for them. Thank you! It is appreciated.

Today, I am leaving the AUQ CA, but I am keeping the responsibility of Réflectivité. For the moment this system seems to be working well for me.

Later (since last September), I caught Shingles. I am still in my remission phase. I allow myself to think that this disease took advantage of a moment of great weakness to manifest itself. It also makes me realize how much my task as a natural caregiver demands energy from me.

Hence the reason why I am resigning. But if I could, I would have preferred to get fully involved and continue my progression in my position as vice-president for another term.

**ins I stay with...**

My primary motivation was to deepen my awareness of the “spirit of service” and everything that revolves around it. Nothing beats immersive experience. I've gotten to that point in my life.

It is only postponed until better circumstances - here, or elsewhere.

From this fall, I still realized that: “We don't know our (real) limits until we reach them.” This kind of fall is a first for me. I was taken by surprise. I didn't see it coming.
I still have a feeling of having served, of having helped, of having been useful, and of accomplishment.

I would like to take this opportunity to wish each of you an excellent 2018, with lots of enriching experiences and full of awareness that will make your soul grow.

To serve is to love.

## Project to help those interested in study groups

_Gaétan G. Charland_
_Responsible for study groups_
_Urantia Association of Quebec_
_Urantia International Association_

In order to improve the quality and number of French-language study groups in Quebec, an initiative was launched in 2017. It will now be possible for a reader wishing to form a study group or for a study group host wishing to find other ways to lead or improve their group, to participate in an already established study group, virtually.

Indeed, through a utility called ZOOM, it is now easy for anyone with a computer, tablet or smartphone to participate in a study group that will offer this option during their meetings. To do this, the group leader must preferably have in his possession a table or desktop computer with a camera and microphone as well as internet access fast enough to have a continuous video and audio stream.

Access via the ZOOM software is very simple, but requires a monthly subscription of $15 US for meetings lasting more than two hours. “Urantia Association International” can in some cases provide free ZOOM access to those who are hosts of study groups and want to participate in this project. For participants, there is no subscription fee and access is very simple.

If you are a study group host and would like to participate in this project by offering virtual access to your group, or for those wishing to form a study group or
For hosts wanting to improve theirs, you can virtually attend a group and see how it works by contacting Gaétan G. Charland at the following address: groupe.etude@urantiaqc.org

Today, distance, temperature or seasonal illnesses such as the flu are no longer obstacles that can prevent you from participating in a study group. You can access several virtual groups in different languages and schedules through virtual access from the comfort of your home using a simple tablet or smartphone. Consult the Study Group Directory for a list of virtual groups. http://urantiastudygroup.org
