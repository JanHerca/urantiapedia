president@urantiaqc.org

Hello dear readers and friends of the association,

I would first like to thank the members of the association and some readers who were present at the Annual General Meeting held on May 6. At this meeting, there were two positions open for nominations, that of treasurer and that of president. Marc Belleau and I were reappointed to these two positions respectively.

It is always a great honor and privilege to serve as a member of the board of directors of the Urantia Association of Quebec. In the universe we inhabit, service is a function that each of us must experience, because without service experience there is little opportunity for growth. When Jesus came to make his final bestowal on our planet, he committed himself throughout his life to loving service to his fellow human beings, and through his life he left us an exemplary way to live ours.

## The power of the mind

**Introduction**

The mind, this reality with which we can communicate and interact with our environment seems so natural to us in this world, but this power seems so mysterious to us at the same time. From the first words in _The Urantia Book_, the author tells us this: “_IN THE MINDS of the mortals of Urantia — this being the name of your world — there exists a great confusion..._” [UB 0:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p0_1). So, let's try to eliminate some of this confusion!

## The Christ Experiment's — The School of Ambassadors

<figure id="Figure_4b" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/Reflectivite/Ambassadeurs.jpg">
</figure>

**The Ministry of the Master**, training offered by the School of Ambassadors will open up new perspectives for sharing what you know about the book, in a natural way and without offending people who want to know more about divine reality.

Here is the testimony of students;

It is a very powerful course which reminded me of all the riches of divine teachings and particularly those of the Master! My inner life has gained in intimacy with the Father and with the son and my desire to do the will of God has been consolidated!

It is a step forward towards the responsibility of brotherhood among us through the example of Jesus and thanks to the love that the Father gives us.

This course is transformative. It gives us a taste for serving in brotherhood and in the love of the Father who is the supreme reality. It is transformative, but at the same time it leads us to want to do the will of God.

## My thoughts on the ordination of the apostles

Hello everyone,

The booklet that we will soon finish studying [booklet 140] is in my opinion one of the most misunderstood of the revelations. In the same way that Michael received advice from Emmanuel surrounding his last outpouring, the apostles also receive advice from Jesus. This advice even goes so far as to be instructions to follow in order to be his ambassadors on earth and not simply disciples.

As we have seen, Jesus asks them to act and behave as he himself behaves or would behave. This does not mean, moreover, that his other disciples could not also try to follow part or all of this advice (also ourselves). Let us not forget that Emmanuel had told Michael that his life on earth should be an inspiration for us (also for his whole universe) and not an example to follow. Jesus asks his Father to accompany them as he himself was. This booklet contains little or no teaching from the new gospel: the emphasis is on practical instructions that his twelve apostles had to follow absolutely. Another piece of advice from Emmanuel was: [UB 120:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p3_6) “ _5. As you may see fit, you are to identify yourself with existing religious and spiritual movements as they may be found on Urantia but in every possible manner seek to avoid the formal establishment of an organized cult, a crystallized religion, or a segregated ethical grouping of mortal beings. Your life and teachings are to become the common heritage of all religions and all peoples._”

## About the power to cast out demons

During a recent meeting of the “Discovery” study group led by Line StPierre and Gaétan Charland, we discussed the power that Jesus had to cast out demons from the unstable minds of certain individuals. This discussion originated from reading the following quote where it is said that even the seventy messengers trained by Jesus had succeeded in doing the same during their first preaching tour from Magadan.

_Editor's note: Muriel Saint-Pierre Tarissan, the mother of Éric Tarissan, died on April 22, 2023._

When my mother died at the age of 89, it was quite intense at the time, and I really regretted not having done more... two days later I wrote this little note (the title of which I later changed):

## Personality, origin, function and destiny!

From my study on personality, these three events emerged concerning personality, its origin, its function in relation to its constitution and its destiny.

**Origin**

1\. Personality is that quality in reality which is bestowed by the Universal Father himself or by the Conjoint Actor, acting for the Father. [UB 112:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_3)

It is undeniable that personality is a direct gift from the Universal Father. This fact is mentioned repeatedly in ***The Urantia Book***. However, it is unusual to hear readers of that book point out that personality is also transmitted by the Conjoint Actor acting for the Father as mentioned in quote [UB 112:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_3).

Hello everyone,

Like a sort of 'retex', a feedback.

What do we try with all our heart every day? To do His will, willingly or unwillingly.

Like the bee that makes honey which then attracts the bear, like a pot of honey at our level.

We are children of life, stimulated, taken by the hand, from the material to the spiritual.

(_Jean Lapierre_) Hello everyone,

On a few occasions in my communications with you all I have referred to Section 8 of Paper 118. I must say that I am still in the dark as to your own meanings of it.

Here it is:

**8\. Control and supercontrol**

In the creations of space-time, free will is hemmed in by restrictions and limitations. The evolution of material life is at first mechanical, then activated by the mind; finally, [after having received the gift of personality], it can be governed by the spirit. Organic evolution on the inhabited worlds is physically limited by the potentials of the original implantations of physical life made by the Life Carriers.

## Fun game

This month, I invite you to visit the website of the Urantia Association of Quebec. In the section “publications / readers' text / The mental

... go to the document entitled “The Mind” (anonymous author) most of the questions come from reading it. Be careful, the number 4 is used twice!

_Andre Pominville_

**Horizontal**

- 4\. Intellectual, social, moral and spiritual evolution passes through the ministry of \_\_\_\_ . [UB 65:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p6_10)
- 5\. The Master Spirits exercise a DECISIVE INFUBENCE in the following spheres of activity concerning the domain of the mind... name which Spirit the fourth sphere participates in?
- 6\. The Life Carriers participate in the emergence of human creatures... these human beings have a special, exceptional status. What is this status?
- 8\. What is the mind used for?
- 9\. The human intellect is the functioning of how many adjutants?

**Vertical**

- 1\. The adjutant mind-spirits bestowed upon the worlds by the Creative Mother Spirit, bring to life something... what?
- 2\. Do animals participate to a certain extent in the “intellectual” evolution of man? [UB 36:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5_13)
- 3\. The human intellect is the functioning of how many adjutants?
- 4\. Why does the mind exist? ... take man \_\_\_\_ and elevate him to the level of a divine spirit.
- 7\. The fruit of the mind?

This activity allows several readers of different levels of understanding to exchange and study together the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. It promotes spiritual progress by allowing its participants to find practical applications to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ in their daily lives. This important approach allows us to keep a broad point of view on the concepts of truth. You wish to participate or form a study group; we will be happy to assist you. If you wish to have your study group appear in this list, contact the person in charge, via email association.urantia.quebec@gmail.com or at 450-565-3323.
