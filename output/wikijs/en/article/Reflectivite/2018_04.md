## Word from the President

_Line St-Pierre_
president@urantiaqc.org

As readers and students of The Urantia Book, you may wonder what efforts the Urantia Association of Quebec undertakes for the dissemination of the teachings and the propagation of the Revelation and it is during the Annual General Assembly that we can inform participants of the work that is accomplished during the year and share our vision of future projects and actions.

It is with this in mind that the Board of Directors has decided to send this **special issue of Réflectivité** with the **2017 activity report** as well as the **2018-2021 strategic plan** on which we have worked many hours.

If after reading this Réflectivité you feel called and wish to participate in this service adventure with us, please provide your contact details at the link below.

**In the future, in order to better communicate with you, please send us your email address at association.urantia.quebec@gmail.com to update your reader profile.**

Last year we instituted a new tradition among our study group which is the “***Memorial Dinner***” and decided that this celebration would continue on the evening of April 6th each year, the day before the death of Jesus according to “_The Urantia Book_”. In this regard, beautiful testimonies received from people who gathered in pairs, and others in groups of more, were published in the May 2017 Réflectivité for the benefit of the community.

“_When the supper of remembrance is shared by those who believe in the Son and know God, its symbolism need not be associated with any of the childish and human misinterpretations concerning the meaning of the divine presence, for on all such occasions the Master is really present. The supper of remembrance is the believer's symbolic rendezvous with Michael. When one thus becomes conscious of the spirit, the Son is actually present, and his spirit fraternizes with the indwelling fragment of his Father._” <a id="a36_510"></a>[UB 179:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_6)

May His peace surround you in your search for the beautiful, the good and the true.

  - About 35 people present.
  - Organized by Julien Audet and Bertin Perron.
- **December 10**: The **Holiday Brunch** at the Best Western Hotel in Saint-Jérôme.
  - 32 people present.


### Book distribution

The Association financed the purchase and sending of **16 books to Haiti**.
There was also the purchase of **35 books** in Quebec offered by a reader from Trois-Rivières, Mr. Liguori Leclerc, which he had delivered to people of his choice.

### Study Group Committee

During 2017, a **rationalization of the list of [study groups published on the Quebec association website](http://urantia-quebec.ca/activites_liste_des_groupes.php)** was made by Alain Nielsen in order to remove inactive groups. At least five groups were removed and new groups were added for a total of **8 active groups and 3 groups looking for participants**.

Multiple **articles on the importance of study groups have been written and published** in Réflectivité and the Tidings newsletter to promote the growth and availability of study groups.

**Study Group Directory**

With financial support from AUQ, **a remodeling of the Study Group Directory website maintained by UAI, The Fellowship and Urantia Foundation** has been initiated and the launch of the new site is expected to coincide with the holding of the **UAI International Conference in April 2018 in Amsterdam**. The directory currently lists 401 study groups, including 87 virtual groups. We are still very far from the initial goal of reaching 1000 study groups. Several of these sites, 18 are in French and should encourage each reader to participate in a study group.

**Study Group Brochure**

The editing and **publication of a brochure for the promotion of study groups** was started at the end of 2017 and should also be published for the UAI congress. The translation into French and Spanish of this brochure should begin during the month of February.

**Guide for Study Groups**

The **Study Group Guide Revision** also began in 2017 and will continue through early 2018.

**Study Group Committee Meetings**

There were **several meetings of the UAI and Quebec Study Group Committee** held during 2017 with participants from several countries to develop methods and offer ways to improve the quality and number of study groups. From these meetings, a project emerged that consists of pairing an in-person study group with virtual technology to make it possible for readers wishing to form a study group or improve theirs to participate in a group that has acquired several years of experience. Currently in Quebec, one such group is available.

**Project for study groups**

In order to improve the quality and number of French-language study groups in Quebec, an initiative was launched in 2017. It will now be possible for a reader wishing to form a study group or for a study group host wishing to **find other ways to lead or improve their group by participating in an already established study group, virtually**.

Indeed, through a utility called Zoom, it is now easy for anyone with a computer, tablet or smartphone to participate in a study group that will offer this option during their meetings. To do this, the group leader must preferably have in his possession a table or desktop computer with a camera and microphone as well as Internet access fast enough to have a continuous video and audio stream.

**Access via Zoom software is very simple**, but requires a monthly subscription of $15 USD for meetings lasting more than two hours. Urantia Association International can in some cases provide Zoom access free of charge to those who are hosts of study groups and wish to participate in this project. **For simple participants, there is no subscription fee and access is very simple.**

**If you are a study group host** and would like to participate in this project by offering virtual access to your group, or for those wanting to form a study group or hosts wanting to improve theirs, you can attend a group to see how it works by contacting Gaétan G. Charland at the following address: groupe.etude@urantiaqc.org

Today, distance, temperature or seasonal illnesses such as the flu are no longer obstacles that can prevent you from participating in a study group. You can, from the comfort of your home, using a simple tablet or smartphone, have access to several virtual groups, in different languages and schedules through virtual access.

**See the Study Group Directory** for a list of virtual groups. http://urantiastudygroup.org

Over the past year, the AUQ Study Groups Lead has attended 2 conferences in the United States to promote the study groups and also to make the conferences accessible via streaming video.

**Internet component**

Several additions have been made to the association's website.

From now on **you can download the EPUB (electronic) version of The Urantia Book** in French, English and Spanish for your tablet, smartphone or computer from the Urantia Association of Quebec website by consulting the “The Book” tab on the home page of the site.

**You can also download the MP3 audio version of The Urantia Book** French version on the same page as the EPUB version. For the audio version, you will need a utility to decompress Zip files. Some operating systems already contain such a utility, for those that do not, you can download one for free by consulting the official Winzip website.

**Another addition to our website**

A page dedicated to financial contributions and the addition of FundScrip on this page.

New materials on reader's books related to the teachings of The Urantia Book are added regularly to the PUBLICATIONS section of the site. Many of these books can be used to assist in the study of the teachings in study groups.

### Réflectivité

**Ten (10) issues** of this important communication and dissemination link were published in 2017.

Normand Laperle, editor-in-chief, assisted by Gilles Bertrand, took care of collecting articles, editing, layout, handwritten transcriptions, proofreading, printing, and postal mailings for 70 people for each edition.

Every January, **a mass mailing of Réflectivité** is mailed to nearly 400 people in the database, to ensure that we maintain a connection with readers we don't hear from or see.

All this represents a considerable amount of work, the scale of which we are not aware of.

A big thank you to these dedicated workers.

### Women's Committee

In May 2017, at a regional conference in Birmingham, Alabama, Line was invited to present: “***How The Urantia Book Transformed Her Life!***”

In July, in Denver Colorado at the Fellowship conference, she led a workshop entitled: “***Spreading our wings — Stepping into spiritual leadership***”

In September, she facilitated a first **retreat in Boston** under the theme “***DANCING WITH GOD***”.

The following week, Line led a women's retreat entitled “***DANCING WITH GOD — EMERGING IN SACREDNESS***” at the **Chicago** Foundation.

She participates in monthly **video conference calls with American women**.

### Member Support

Line also **responded to numerous emails from people wanting more information** about participating in a study group, Association meetings, and certain concepts in the book.

Seven new people joined the AUQ and received a **welcome letter and membership card** after a telephone conversation.

In the tasks of this committee, Line also takes care of the mail and makes deposits of donations and contributions from members.

### Communications

Line keeps track of **correspondence from readers** who write to the association's address; **routine telephone communications** from readers requesting various information concerning “The Urantia Book” or the “_Urantia Association of Quebec_”. She regularly informs Normand Laperle of all **changes of address** of recipients of the paper format Réflectivité. For the AUQ files, she **forwards correspondence and responses** to the secretary who archives them.

She maintains the list of readers in the database, takes care of booking conference rooms when necessary and organizes the holiday brunch. Line also acts as the French-speaking contact person for the “_Association Urantia Internationale_” to follow up on correspondence requiring the use of French.

### Translation Committee

At its meeting of **March 5, 2017**, the Board of Directors formed a Translation Committee to draft and supervise **English to French translations of important documents**.

This committee, **under the responsibility of Jean Pierre Cadieux**, makes the translations into French that the AUQ believes are relevant to the interests of its members and the **French-speaking community in general**.

**Since its creation, the committee has translated some forty articles** for the publication “_Tidings_”, as well as the text of the video “_Urantia, Nebadon and the Master Universe_”

This committee lacks resources for all the translations that could be done.

**We are looking for collaborators** to translate from English to French or to proofread for corrections after translation. Those who can help are invited to contact us at the following email address: traduction1@urantiaqc.org.

### Finances

Under the good care of our treasurer: **Marc Belleau**.

**The structuring of the treasurer's files is now complete**. The files are all in the same place on the association's cloud instead of being archived on different web platforms.

We have also completed the Administrator's Guide to explain the various **procedures related to the accomplishment of the treasurer's tasks**. All the information is grouped in a single document. It will be easier to make the transition between a new treasurer and his predecessor.

In 2017, we started using the **fundraising tool with “_Fundscrip_”**. The system has now been up and running for 1 year. About ten readers signed up during the year and allowed us to raise $632 by purchasing gift cards.

I would like to thank those who were involved in the 2017 fundraiser. Some bought cards on a regular basis, which allowed us to make profits that will be used to support our projects. **I hope that more readers will use this tool in 2018.**

For more information, visit the Urantia Association of Quebec website.

### Be useful

**Line** is president of the Urantia Association of Quebec.

After reading the above, we realize that **her activities go far beyond her duties as president**.

**Line would accept help** from readers or members of the association who would like to get involved.

These people would be welcome and of great help.

Those who want to come and **support the actions of our association through volunteer work** can contact us. We will be delighted to integrate them into the AUQ's mission.

## STRATEGIC PLAN 2018-2021

**Urantia Association of Quebec**

### Preamble

There will come a day when many people will seek the teachings of The Urantia Book. That day will come, but it has not yet arrived, and this gives us time to prepare for it. It may be far away, as some think.

However, we must keep in mind that the pace of evolution has greatly accelerated over the past fifty years. New technologies allow us to communicate instantly, the exchange of ideas is much faster than before. By observing what is happening in the development of science and technology, we can agree that the pace of discoveries has increased and continues to increase.

We also observe, in some societies, awareness of respect for human rights, the environment, equity and justice, a rejection of dictatorships and old models of thought. These movements are indicators of growth in our society.

The struggle between materialism and the search for higher human and spiritual values is very real and society is increasingly moving towards the search for these values.

All of these elements must be considered in assessing the time we have left to prepare. Let us imagine that only 5% of the population of Quebec [8.215 million, according to Wikipedia] begin to seek out the teachings of The Urantia Book and we find ourselves with 400,000 people who will need a well-structured association and the support of experienced readers.

The purpose of this argument is not to dramatize the situation in which we find ourselves or to announce the imminent arrival of a global acceptance of the mission of the Book, but rather to direct reflection on the need to put in place a structure that will allow us to respond to the demand when it arises; we will never be sufficiently prepared.

We are like the workers in the second garden, waiting not for revelation - for it is already with us - but rather waiting for the day when it can enlighten all men and women of good will.

It is in this spirit that this strategic plan was developed.

### Introduction

The [publication mandate](/en/article/The_Publication_Mandate) ([link](http://urantia-quebec.ca/media/lecteurs/autres_1955_4_1513100921_1.pdf)) [On page 11 in this document] suggests that we create “_thousands of study groups_” and work to “_train leaders and teachers_” in order to prepare for the era when “_The Urantia Book_” will be sought by all of humanity.

The strategic plan should be in line with this mandate. It could be built along three major axes: service to readers, promotion of The Urantia Book and its teachings, and support for study group hosts.

The AUQ's goal is to ensure the propagation of the teachings of the _Urantia Book_ in Quebec, the promotion axes of the Book and its teachings, as well as support for readers, see to this dimension.

Also, it is important to support study group hosts so that they are encouraged to develop their skills and competencies.

New readers should be supported in their efforts to understand the teachings by groups headed by leaders who have a minimum knowledge of the concepts presented in the Book and some experience in group management. This is the objective of the host support axis.

Promoting awareness of the Book and supporting study group hosts are the pillars on which this strategic plan is based.

### First axis: Reader services

The reader service targets active readers, that is, those who are already in the movement.
Its main objective is to deepen the teachings of the Book and to develop fraternal links between readers.

### Second axis: Promotion of The Urantia Book and its teachings

This axis aims to promote the Book and its teachings, in order to make it visible and accessible to those seeking a renewed vision of the relationship between God and human beings.

### Third axis: Support for study group hosts

Support from study group hosts is a critical aspect of the strategic plan.

The hosts have direct and regular contact with the readership, **they are the link between the AUQ and the readers** and the means favored by the revelators to extend the revelation on Urantia.

Hosts are willing and passionate people, but may also lack confidence, knowledge and experience in managing a group.

It is important to **give them the tools that will allow them to become better leaders**. In addition, it is important to document and share good practices that take place in study groups.

In this sense, the Urantia Association of Quebec could become a resource center for readers who want to embark on the adventure of creating and maintaining a study group.

### MISSION OF THE AUQ

To help each person meet the challenge of establishing a better relationship with the divine within them. In this effort to increase cosmic consciousness and enhance spiritual perception, we desire that each human being comes to individually recognize the fatherhood of God and thus experience universal brotherhood.

### VISION

## Study groups and the Urantia Association of Quebec (AUQ)

Do you want to publish your study group on the association website or in the newsletter “_Réflectivité_”? Certain criteria must meet this requirement.

Study _The Urantia Book_ in its entirety and not just one of its parts. Other books may also be used in parallel to support the study, but _The Urantia Book_ should be the main object of discussion and study.

The groups are apolitical and therefore are not recruiting places for any association or organization.

Channeling — the idea of being able to communicate with celestial beings through any channels is not endorsed by the association.

Participation in a study group is free of charge.

If your group is published on the AUQ website and you observe a deviation from these criteria, you can inform the association's study group manager.

## HAVE YOU PURCHASED YOUR FUNDSCRIP CARDS? THIS MONTH?

Every time you buy ***Fundscrip*** cards, a percentage of your purchase is donated by the company to the Urantia Association of Quebec. A smart way to support the AUQ ***for the price of a stamp***.

## THE PUBLICATION MANDATE

> _Urantiapedia Note_: This document is also available on this website at this link: [The Publication Mandate](/en/article/The_Publication_Mandate).
{.is-info}

“We regard _The Urantia Book_ as an attribute peculiar to the progressive evolution of human society. It is not akin to the spectacular episodes of an epochal revolution, although it may seem to be timed to appear in the wake of such a revolution in human society. The Book belongs to the epoch immediately following the conclusion of the present ideological struggle. That will be the day when men will be disposed to seek truth and righteousness. When the chaos of the present confusion has cleared away, it will be more readily possible to conceive of the universe of a new and improved era of human relations. It is for this better order of things on earth that the Book has been made available.”

“But the publication of the Book has not been postponed to that future time which is possibly somewhat distant. An early publication of the Book has been offered so that it may be available for the training of leaders and teachers. Its availability is also required to attract the attention of wealthy people who might thereby be motivated to provide resources for translation into other languages.”

“You who have dedicated your lives to the service of the Book and the Brotherhood can hardly realize the importance of your actions. No doubt you will live and die without fully understanding that you are participating in the birth of a new age of religion in this world.”

“The future is not open to your mortal understanding, but you would do well to study conscientiously the order, the plan, and the methods of progression as these were carried out during the earthly life of Michael in which the Word was made flesh. You become actors in a subsequent episode in which the Word becomes Book. Vast is the difference between these dispensations of religion, but many are the lessons which can be learned by studying the preceding epoch.”

“You must study anew the time of Jesus on earth. You must take careful note of the manner in which the kingdom of heaven was inaugurated in the world. Did it evolve slowly and develop naturally? Or did it come with a sudden manifestation of force and a spectacular display of power? Was it evolutionary or revolutionary?”

“You must learn to possess your souls in a state of patience. You are in association with a revelation of truth which is part of the natural evolution of religion in this world. Too rapid a growth would be suicidal. The Book is being given to those who are ready for it, long before the day of its world mission. Thousands of study groups are to be organized, and the Book is to be translated into many languages. Thus the Book will be ready when man's battle for freedom is finally won, and the world is once more safe for the religion of Jesus and for the freedom of mankind.”

In Dr. Sadler's History of the Urantia Movement, this message is titled: “The Publication Mandate.”

This document was presented by William S. Sadler Junior to the Forum on April 4, 1955. For the greater intelligibility of the listeners, the pronouns have been changed, i.e., we have introduced “You.” For this reason, we have returned them in their original form. Copies of this document have been inserted in the minute book of the secretary of each committee in office of the Brotherhood. The committee chairmen have been provided with copies.

This activity allows several readers of different levels of understanding to share and study together the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. It promotes spiritual progress by allowing its participants to find practical applications of the teachings of The Urantia Book in their daily lives. This important practice helps to maintain a broad perspective on concepts of truth.

You wish to participate or form a study group; we will be happy to assist you. If you wish to have your study group appear in this list, contact the person in charge, via email association.urantia.quebec@gmail.com or at 450-565-3323.
