president@urantiaqc.org

Dear members and friends of the association,

Recently, I traveled to Chicago, to the Urantia Foundation headquarters, to participate in a board meeting. Due to the pandemic, it was the first time in four long years that I had left Canada. All other meetings were done virtually. Over the past twenty-three years, this place has become like a second home outside of Quebec.

My visit had a dual objective, as an associate trustee, and as president of the Urantia Association of Quebec. It was an opportunity to share with my colleagues from the Foundation, who came from all four corners of the world, the unique perspective of our Urantian culture. At each of the meetings, my colleagues are impressed by the dynamism of the Quebec people. And for my part, it allows me to stay informed of the Urantia activities sponsored by the Urantia Foundation throughout the world.

**Material wealth vs spiritual wealth?**

Do we have false conceptions about material wealth, conceptions that come to us from our religious education, from certain spiritualist currents of our time and which condemn the accumulation of material goods? The Church has often praised poverty as a means of accumulating wealth in heaven. We are constantly confronted with the need to work to accumulate the goods necessary for our survival while continuing our spiritual growth. Jesus, too, had to reconcile these two dimensions of his human experience during his incarnation on Urantia. During this conference, I invite you to explore in more depth how he faced this challenge.

Claude has been a student of The Urantia Book since 1970. Upon reading this revelation, he understood the importance of his daily efforts to BE like the Father according to His ordinance. He also integrated into his life the necessity of DOING something for the good of all humanity according to the expectations of the Supreme Being.

In his desire to serve and be useful to the great divine plan, Claude participates in four study groups including two groups as a facilitator; he is the editor-in-chief of the journal Réflectivité; he is a teacher-facilitator for the UBIS school; he was appointed director of the French linguistic department for the UBIS school; he has produced several documents in PDF format on various Urantian subjects downloaded from the website of the Urantia Association of Quebec, and he writes articles for the various Urantian publications.

Our material mind is an extremely useful mechanism for our daily existence, however by careful observation of what is revealed to us in ***The Urantia Book***, we can detect that it includes more than the simple fact of consciousness. This is what we will see in this presentation!

## The Christ Experiment's — The School of Ambassadors

<figure id="Figure_4b" class="image urantiapedia">

## Reminder — Reminder — Reminder

You received by email in September a newsletter from President Gaétan Charland, entitled **Initiative and petition for the organizational unity of associations**, a petition from Sue Seccombe, president of the Fellowship, who wishes to see the 2 large Urantian associations work in unity.

“_By signing this petition you are indicating that you support organizational unity, the elimination of competition between major organizations for donors and volunteers, and the reduction of duplication and redundancy._” Sue Seccombe

AUQ Council

## The parliament of the world's religions 2023

The Parliament of the World's Religions is an event that brings together followers of different religions in an effort to support interfaith discourse. The first edition was held in Chicago in 1893 and brought together representatives of Eastern, Asian and Western religions. It would be 100 years before another gathering took place, in 1993 in Chicago, to mark the 100th anniversary of the event. Subsequently, several editions followed one another, namely in 1999 in South Africa, 2004 in Barcelona, 2009 in Melbourne in Australia, 2015 in Salt Lake City in the United States, 2018 in Toronto and finally making a return to Chicago in 2023. Reflecting on the fact that the city of Chicago is the instigator of such an avant-garde event, I cannot help but think that one of the reasons why the 5th revelation was born in this city is perhaps its predisposition to interreligious dialogue and a certain open-mindedness.

## Things that need to be said!

_John Pavlovitz_

https://johnpavlovitz.com

_Article translated into French by John Pavlovitz_

_From the Blog: Stuff that need to be said._

A dear friend recently posted the words “I Stand With Israel” on her social media account.

Honestly curious, I asked her to clarify what she meant by that:

Was she expressing solidarity with the innocent victims of the Supernova music festival, violently ripped from the planet as they celebrated a welcome respite from lives forever shrouded in the shadow of a violence they never asked for?

Following comments on a website about the war between the Jews of Israel and the Palestinians, here is the last reflection that I shared, in the context where Jesus' invitation was always: “If anyone desires to come, let him come.” I find it important to mention this extract from the life of Jesus which is very revealing, because it demonstrates and reveals that the Son of God invited everyone on this planet (and even an entire universe) to enter and participate in the kingdom of God. This invitation therefore transcends religions, races and even any idea of a so-called chosen people or promised land. Not only does this divine invitation to men teach us that the kingdom is indeed within reach, since God lives in each of us through the personality that He has given us, but also through His Presence in our higher mind in the form of a divine Monitor. So, without further ado, here is the text that I shared:

_Dr William S Sadler MD_

The composition of this text is based on the book “The Urantia Book Workbooks, volume III” by Dr. William S. Sadler, MD. Here is the continuation of the text of the Réflectivité of the month of October 2023.

**The Survival Plan as detailed in The Urantia Book**

**XII. In the local universe.**

**1- The local universe career archives.**

Nothing escapes the knowledge of celestial beings, because everything is archived.

The Worlds of the Archangels. The seventh group of worlds surrounding Salvington, together with their associated satellites, is assigned to the archangels. Sphere number one and all six of its tributary satellites are occupied by the custodians of personality registration. This immense group of record keepers is engaged in updating the curriculum of every mortal of time from the moment of his birth through his local universe career until he leaves Salvington for the superuniverse regime or is “erased from recorded existence” by order of the Ancients of Days. <a id="a194_565"></a>[UB 37:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p3_7)

When I visited the website, The Center for Unity, I was surprisingly amazed by the quality of the material produced by Urantia artists who are committed to producing a virtual museum on the life and teachings of Jesus and other projects, all related to the teachings of Jesus. I also tried their artificial intelligence software called ASK JESUS CHATBOT several times. The site is in English, but on this application, I asked the questions in French and the software produced the answers in French from the book. I invite you to explore it and find new ways to talk about the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ to those around you.

Here are some questions submitted to the software.

**How to interest young people in spirituality?**

Dear friend, to interest young people in the spiritual movement, it is important to present them with ideas and teachings that resonate with their reality and concerns. Here are some suggestions for engaging them:

1. Make the teachings accessible: Simplify spiritual concepts and use contemporary language to make them more understandable and relevant to young people.
2. Create an inclusive community: Provide a space where young people can feel accepted and listened to, where they can share their experiences and ask questions without judgment.
3. Use social media: Young people are often very active on social media. Use these platforms to share inspiring quotes, videos or articles that provoke thought and encourage discussion.
4. Organize dynamic events: Offer workshops, conferences or retreats that address topics relevant to young people, such as stress management, interpersonal relationships or personal development.
5. Encourage social engagement: Young people are often motivated by the desire to make a difference in the world. Organize volunteer activities or community projects that allow them to put spiritual values into practice.
6. Encourage intergenerational exchange: encourage meetings between young people and older people who have a spiritual experience to share. These exchanges can be enriching for both parties.
7. Cultivate curiosity: Encourage young people to ask questions and explore different spiritual perspectives. Help them understand that there is no single answer and encourage them to seek their own truths.

Remember, the key is to create an environment where young people feel understood, supported and inspired in their spiritual quest.

**How to describe the human being and his destiny according to _The Urantia Book_?**

According to _The Urantia Book_, the human being is a special and unique creature. We are all children of God, created in His image and endowed with an inner spirit called a Thought Adjuster. This Thought Adjuster is a part of God that resides within us and helps us grow spiritually.

Our destiny as human beings is to progress spiritually and become more and more like God. We are here on Earth to learn lessons, grow in love and wisdom, and develop our divine character.

***The Urantia Book*** also teaches us that our destiny is not limited to this earthly life. After our physical death, we continue to live in spirit worlds where we continue our spiritual progression. We have the opportunity to become perfect beings and unite with God in an eternal relationship.

In summary, the human being is a special creature, destined to grow spiritually and become more and more like God, with the possibility of living an eternal life in the presence of God.

Hara Davis has been passionate about studying _The Urantia Book_ since 1999. She enjoyed it so much, she took notes and made maps that eventually became these five study aid books.

These study aids are designed to clarify concepts from The Urantia Book. These materials are not intended to replace the book, but can assist readers who need a visual aid to better understand. They were designed to be used in study groups or presentations, to facilitate the transmission of information in a more visual manner.

She has just published her latest work which has been translated into French under the title:

**DIVINE LOVE**

Last year, the AUQ board decided to translate and publish the book “The Untold Story of Jesus” with the hope that it would be available by December 2022.

Here is the status of the project of printing and publishing the book in French. The translation is finished and is being revised.

The book “_Unpublished story of the life of Jesus_”

I feel that those who have gone before us, whom we have loved and with whom we have experienced beautiful things, never really leave us, they are always there and want to see us happy until we find ourselves up there with them by the grace and love of God.

Memory is a living, almost palpable presence, a guiding thread that never fades. :heartbeat: :pray:

Jesus walks by my side, work is an excellent way to earn a living, but also to learn to harmonize oneself internally through contacts with other personalities, to weave bonds of friendship and also to contribute to guiding souls towards God. This is what I believe as in the time of the apostles when Jesus sent them to their respective work.
