**Doing divine work is natural or the dynamic of growth.**

_Helene Boisvenue_

The law of the Supreme is written in our nature and it translates into growth.

Learn by what process the creator-creature partnership operates so that physical universes are stabilized and vital meanings and divine values emerge. Let us develop our cosmic responsibility in this regard.

**The Supreme or the quest for perfection**

_Marc Belleau_

God trusts us to the point of placing in our inexperienced hands a portion of the development of the Supreme. How can we bring to full expression this infinitesimal portion of the Supreme that has been placed in our hands? Simply by responding to our heavenly Father's invitation, “Be ye perfect, even as I am perfect.”

In this workshop-congress, we will look at a definition of what perfection is at our evolutionary level, that of ascending creatures, and at the links that exist between our quest for perfection and the evolution of the Supreme.

**The Reality of the Supreme**

_Moustapha Ndiaye_

One of the most disturbing and complex manifestations of Deity, but at the same time, perhaps the most current in light of the eventful history and specificity of our planet, is the Supreme.

As the revelations teach us, the maximum of Deity that we can comprehend in this present universe age resides in the reality of the Supreme. Furthermore, we are taught that all Creatures will discover the Supreme at the same time, for its final completion will be that of the total Cosmos, including Deities and Creatures; spiritual, mental, and physical realities; and doubtless much else.

Since our Creator Son has personally attained the Supreme, we have the opportunity, and perhaps the responsibility, to concern ourselves with the novel aspects of the reality of the Supreme as they are involved in the destiny of our planet in relation to the illumination of the Fifth Epochal Revelation.

Let us recall for this reason that since the outpouring of the spirit of truth, we all have experienced Thought Adjusters, that is to say, also more qualified to engage the reality of the Supreme in our life.

**Supreme Worker: Torchbearer of Humanity**

_Johanne Seguin_

Here is a testimony-congress that will first address the immensity of gratitude for being a worker of the Supreme, a testimony of a woman, among the women of the 21st century, who opens the way to a greater awareness and social responsibility. A life, an experience as a mother, woman, professional, activist and environmentalist who works for the good, the good and the beautiful in partnership with spiritual designs.

**The connection between the Will of the Father, the Supreme, origin and destiny**

_Conrad Lavallee_

The author highlights, drawing on the teachings of the fifth epochal revelation, how our learning practice of the Father's will anchors us in the reality of the Supreme, connects us to the foundations of our origin, and directs us toward the cosmic realization of our eternal destiny.

To achieve this, he uses a geometric model of great simplicity, with mathematical relationships that everyone understands very easily, and which reflect in a way that facilitates understanding the conceptual relationships, principles, and the most advanced teachings found in the Urantia revelation.

## I missed you!

_Jean Sauve_
_St. Lucia_

Full of enthusiasm when I went to the thematic meeting in Drummondville on May 26, I was looking forward to this moment. I was looking forward to meeting some members of the association, I was looking forward to sharing with them some points on which we had already exchanged and which have since come a long way. I was looking forward to discovering new people that I do not know, I was looking forward to hearing points of view on the thematic subjects that would make me think, advance in my spiritual journey.

Each of the association's meetings, whether it be the Annual General Meeting, the themes, the Holiday Brunch, the Feast of Jesus on Mount Royal, are opportunities to discover and meet people who, I imagine, are walking in the same spiritual direction and with whom our discussions are likely to enrich us.

Arriving in Drummondville, I was surprised to see the number of empty chairs. I felt a certain disappointment, a sadness, wondering “what is happening?”

This setting immediately brought me back to the Urantia Book, to the “Parable of the Great Supper” [UB 167:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p2_2): “A certain ruler gave a great supper to which he invited many guests. At supper time he sent his servants to say to the guests: ”Come, for all is now ready.“ But the guests unanimously began to apologize. One said: ”I have just bought a farm, and I must go and inspect it; I beg your pardon.“ Another said: ”I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I must go and receive them; I beg your pardon.“ Still another said: ”I have just taken a wife, and on that account I cannot come.“ So the servants returned and reported this to their master. Then the master of the house was very angry; He turned to his servants and said, ”I have prepared this wedding feast; the fattened young animals are killed and everything is ready for my guests, but they have spurned my invitation."

At these times I think of God, our Father, who created everything, who gave us everything, even He gave Himself personally through the Thought Adjuster in each of us and He awaits our response to His INVITATION.

My purpose is to express my wish, to see you in large numbers, to know you, to appreciate you, to learn from you and your life journey. It is not intended as a criticism, but as an invitation.

**I can't wait for the next activity to shake even more hands.**

## THE 3 ASPECTS

_Pierre Sauvageau_
_St-Alexis-des-monts_

In all the information provided by “The Urantia Book” I have distinguished three levels of knowledge.

<ins>The first aspect</ins> is a form of knowledge that I would call objective: the description of the structures of the seven superuniverses, the different strata of the “morontial” worlds, the spheres of the central universe. I would add to this type of knowledge the narrative of the 800 pages devoted to the life of Jesus. It is very concrete: Jesus left at a very specific time, traveled this or that path, met people. This constitutes descriptive, objective knowledge.

Then, the <ins>second aspect</ins> concerns the words of wisdom scattered here and there throughout the pages. To this must be added the teachings of Jesus. I place here excerpts illustrating this wisdom:

- “_He knew well and taught his apostles that the sensual needs of humanity are not suppressed either by religious reproaches or by legal prohibitions. His rare condemnations were mainly directed against pride, cruelty, oppression, and hypocrisy_” [UB 140:8.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_21)
- “_The Father does not treat man, his child, on the basis of his virtues_” [UB 103:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p4_5)
- “_The keys to the Kingdom of Heaven are sincerity, more sincerity, and more sincerity. All men possess these keys. Men use them, elevate their spiritual status by decisions, more decisions, and more decisions_” [UB 39:4.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p4_14)

Finally, the <ins>third aspect</ins> is the most intriguing. The authors of the Urantia Book seem to answer the questions that people have asked themselves when reading certain passages of the Gospels. It is said, in chapter 11 verse 25: “_faith moves mountains_”. How many have come up against this obvious fact throughout the last twenty centuries: during all this time, no one has had enough faith to move mountains. A supplement from the authors of the “Urantia Book” makes us understand it better: it is about the mountains of difficulties. We find, in [Mark 11:17](/en/Bible/Mark/11#v17), a similar case: “_If someone strikes you on the right cheek, offer him the left cheek_”. Who does not frown at this idea? Why endure this without retaliating? What is the point? Is it at least effective? Very few people agree not to defend themselves. Here again an addition from the authors enlightens us: turning the right cheek was an expression of the Jews of the time meaning: “_to do everything possible to resolve the situation_”. Also, a passage from the book “Jesus spoke Aramaic” makes the passage of [Matthew 19:4](/en/Bible/Matthew/19#v4) “Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God”. Here again the expression “a needle” refers to the narrow entrance doors of the cities of the time and not to this fatal impossibility for a rich man to access the Kingdom of God.

So the question arises: what can these additions mean for someone who has not read the Gospels and has not asked themselves these kinds of questions?

## Policy for selecting articles to be published in Réflectivité

_Normand Laperle_
_Editor_

Good morning,

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you — sincerely — for the articles you send us.

No matter what you send, you are making known the pulse - what am I saying, the “soul” - of our community of readers of “The Urantia Book” here in Quebec and more generally of the planet Earth/Urantia.

Even if you just write a simple little note, an “I love you”, an “I think of you”; through you, this “I love you” - or something else - makes us know “we humans” at this time in our history.

No matter what you write, you are worth as much as anyone else. Don't hesitate to make yourself known, to share yourself as you are.

In its standard version, Réflectivité contains 4 pages, 2.5 of which contain “your articles”, those that you send to us.

When we have more articles to publish, we keep them in reserve.

Our “article selection policy” for publication is as follows:
We prioritize, in order:

1. Temporal topics — immediately relevant: recent or upcoming activities
2. Timeless topics—still relevant over time: commentaries on philosophical or spiritual topics.
  - a) Articles falling within the available space of the published Réflectivité.
  - b) Older items received are prioritized over those received recently.

If you submit an article and it takes a long time to be published, be patient, it will come...

Thank you for contributing to this sharing.
