## Word from the President

_Line St-Pierre_
president@urantiaqc.org

Our friend Maurice Migneault worked to update until 2017 the chronology of the Urantian movement in Quebec, part of which had been initiated by Pierre Routhier and additions were made by Johanne Séguin until 2012.

This document records almost all the activities and efforts made by hundreds of people since its inception. I say almost all the efforts, because many enterprises have been conducted by readers whose existence we do not even suspect.

This impressive document can be found on our website http://urantia-quebec.ca/a_propos_historique.php

In October, at a board meeting, we set the dates for future activities for readers next year and we very much hope that you will share with us your ideas and interests as to what you would like to do and see during these days, whether in Quebec, Drummondville, or elsewhere.

This weekend, from Friday, November 1st to Sunday, November 3rd, the Science Symposium will take place at the Urantia Foundation, which will be filmed and broadcast live by Gaétan Charland.

Experienced English language students will present a wide variety of topics from biology and chemistry to physics, consciousness, space and energy as they relate to the Book. These presentations will be available for viewing live on the Ustream channel at this web address until November 13: https://video.ibm.com/channel/KNfDjjGhsgF and will then be uploaded to the Urantia Foundation YouTube channel.

The schedule and description of the presentations can be found under the “_Upcoming_” tab at the following address: https://video.ibm.com/channel/KNfDjjGhsgF

Thank you to all who volunteer to serve the Revelation!

## When are we granted personality?

_Claude Flibotte_
_Sainte-Julie_

This question has come up often in our study group discussions. We know that it is a gift from our Heavenly Father <a id="a45_115"></a>[lire : [UB 112:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p1_1)], a statement often repeated in The Urantia Book. But when does the Father give us this wonderful gift?

Before we delve deeper into this question, let us pause for a moment to clearly distinguish between identity and personality. The following quote describes very well what identity is.

> “In the human organism the summation of its parts constitutes selfhood—individuality—but such a process has nothing whatever to do with personality, which is the unifier of all these factors as related to cosmic realities.” (<a id="a49_227"></a>[UB 112:1.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p1_18))

This identity or individuality we acquire at our birth through the possession of a physical body, once worked out by the patient work of the Life Carriers according to the specifications of the Creator Son, and the granting of a material mental circuit temporarily courtesy of the Divine Minister of our universe.

Personality, although indefinable according to the <a id="a53_51"></a>[lire: [UB 16:8.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_2)%] revealers, has the function of unifying the sum of the parts and activities which constitute the individuality in order to provide it with the qualities of identity and creativity.

> “_In aggregations parts are added; in systems parts are *arranged.* ***Systems are significant because of organization—positional values.*** In a good system all factors are in cosmic position. In a bad system something is either missing or displaced—deranged. ***In the human system*** it is ***<ins>the personality</ins>*** which unifies all activities and ***in turn imparts the qualities of <ins>identity</ins>*** and creativity._” (<a id="a55_439"></a>[UB 112:1.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p1_19))

Okay. Now that we have differentiated identity and personality, the question remains, when do we acquire this personality? The following quotation clearly shows us that it does not come at the same time as the Adjuster:

“***Personality*** _is a unique endowment of an original nature, the existence of which is ***independent of and antecedent to the bestowal of the Thought Adjusters***. Nevertheless, the presence of the Adjuster does enhance the qualitative manifestation of personality. At the time of emanation of the Thought Adjusters from the Father, they are identical in nature, but ***personality is varied, original, and exclusive***, and personality manifestation is further conditioned by the nature and qualities of the associated energies of material, mental, and spiritual nature which constitute the organic vehicle for personality manifestation.” <a id="a59_645"></a>[UB 16:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_3)

Now that this fact is established, I think the following quote gives us an excellent clue to the solution.

> “***Self-consciousness consists in intellectual awareness of personality actuality;*** _it includes the ability to recognize the reality of other personalities. It indicates capacity for individualized experience in and with cosmic realities, equivalating to the attainment of identity status in the personality relationships of the universe. Self-consciousness connotes recognition of the actuality of mind ministration and the realization of relative independence of creative and determinative free will._” (<a id="a63_512"></a>[UB 16:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_6))

It is self-awareness, then, that enables us to know that we are a person and not merely an animal without personality. This self-awareness means that this individual formerly counted as part of the animal kingdom has risen to the status of a human being through the use of the sixth adjutant, the adjutant mind circuit of worship, and even better through the practice of wisdom with the seventh adjutant mind circuit. This is the great distinction made between the animal who is conscious and in interaction with his environment and the man who is conscious of being conscious, thus transcending his animal nature and opening the way to divine potentials. This first potential is expressed by accessibility to the spiritual circuit of the Divine Minister, the Holy Spirit. We know that the Universal Father delegated the maximum of his creative powers to his Eternal Son and to the Infinite Spirit, and that they in turn handed over the responsibility of creating the universes, outside of Havona, to the Creator Sons and their companions, the Divine Ministers. The personality being of divine nature and originating from the Father would therefore be conferred on us through the Divine Minister acting on behalf of this same Universal Father.

In conclusion, personality is a gift from the Universal Father transmitted to man during his encircuitment in the Holy Spirit. Personality being of divine nature, it is a super qualification whose function is to unify the sum of the parts and activities of individuality. Its uniqueness being that personality is conditioned and qualified by the nature and qualities of the associated energies of a material, mental and spiritual nature which constitute the organic vehicle for the manifestation of personality. It is probable that personality is different for each universe which would explain its variety, while being original and exclusive (<a id="a67_644"></a>[UB 16:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_3)). The revelators describe the Urantian personality to us as follows:

> “_The Urantia type of human personality may be viewed as functioning in a physical mechanism consisting of the planetary modification of the Nebadon type of organism belonging to the electrochemical order of life activation and endowed with the Nebadon order of the Orvonton series of the cosmic mind of parental reproductive pattern._” (<a id="a69_340"></a>[UB 16:8.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_15))

---

> “_An international police force will prevent many minor wars, but it will not be effective in preventing major wars, conflicts between the great military governments of earth._” (<a id="a73_181"></a>[UB 134:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p5_10))

## How can they get the soulless babies back?

_Claude Flibotte_
_Sainte-Julie_

I have long wondered: If babies have no souls since they have not yet received an Adjuster, how can the seraphim retrieve them for resurrection in the probationary nursery?

### The Birth of the Soul

I conceived of the soul as originating in the human mind at the moment of the first moral thought, triggering the arrival of the Thought Adjuster and in the relationship between the two as mentioned in the quote:

> “The inevitable result of such a contactual spiritualization of the human mind is the gradual birth of a soul, the joint offspring of an adjutant mind dominated by a human will that craves to know God, working in liaison with the spiritual forces of the universe which are under the overcontrol of an actual fragment of the very God of all creation—the Mystery Monitor. And thus does the material and mortal reality of the self transcend the temporal limitations of the physical-life machine and attain a new expression and a new identification in the evolving vehicle for selfhood continuity, the morontia and immortal soul.” (<a id="a86_630"></a>[UB 111:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p2_10))

In fact, I was not entirely wrong in believing this, only I was mistaken about the real understanding of this quote. The word that must be given full attention here is “birth” of the soul. Let me explain, when I was born in the middle of winter in the year 1950, my life did not begin specifically at that moment. Long before, in my mother's womb, I had an existence as an embryo, at first, then as a fetus until my birth. So, at my birth I was already nine months old.

### What does the cherub get from a baby that died in infancy?

At birth, a baby inherits from its parents a physical body genetically formed by a combination of their genes. It is endowed with a mind provided by the Divine Minister of Nebadon as far as our universe is concerned. These two endowments assure it an identity of evolving existence in time. It is this **identity potential** that the cherub recovers, under the orders of its seraphim, to deliver to the Mansion World Teachers in the probationary nursery.

> “_The infant-receiving schools of Satania are situated on the finaliter world, the first of the Jerusem transition-culture spheres. These infant-receiving schools are enterprises devoted to the nurture and training of the children of time, including those who have died on the evolutionary worlds of space before the acquirement of individual status on the universe records. In the event of the survival of either or both of such a child’s parents, the guardian of destiny deputizes her associated cherubim as the custodian of the ***child’s potential identity***, charging the cherubim with the responsibility of delivering this ***undeveloped soul*** into the hands of the Mansion World Teachers in the probationary nurseries of the morontia worlds._” (<a id="a94_757"></a>[UB 47:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p2_1))

This “_undeveloped soul_” is actually an embryonic soul, just as I was at one time in my mother's womb. Human identity is a fetal soul before its true birth in its first moral decision and collaboration with the Adjuster.

### The condition for this baby to survive

However, there is a condition for this pre-soul to be recoverable. It is directly related to the spiritual progression of one of the parents. If one of them survives, or if both are resurrected, this fact demonstrates that this child would have also benefited from a good chance of survival as mentioned in 47:2.1 \& 2. If fortunately, this is the case, this baby will be resurrected at the same point where it was at the time of its death and will have the same chances as its parents to choose “_the way to heaven_” <a id="a100_518"></a>[UB 47:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p2_2).

### The solution came through spornagias

The reading that allowed me to distinguish between the birth of the soul and its previous existence as a **potential identity** came to me through reading the following quote:

> “***Spornagia*** _are the only creatures in all the universe of Nebadon who experience this or any other sort of reincarnation. ***They are only reactive to the first five of the adjutant mind-spirits***; they are not responsive to the spirits of worship and wisdom. But the five-adjutant mind equivalates to a totality or sixth reality level, and ***it is this factor which persists as an experiential identity***._” (<a id="a106_421"></a>[UB 46:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p7_5))

The spornagias are animal beings just as we are animal beings at the beginning of our lives until the functioning of the seven adjutant mental spirits makes us fully human beings.

Like the spornagias, the functioning of the first five adjutant minds is equivalent to a level of totality or sixth reality called **potentially experiential identity or soul embryo** since this is a potential human. It would be **this potential value** that the cherub recovers from the baby for its future resurrection.

One question remains, however: can **a baby that dies at birth** be considered to have sufficient identity to be recovered? The probable answer would be... yes. If I refer to the following quote, the five adjutant minds are most likely present in this baby at birth thanks to its uterine life and its potential status as a human being, because the five adjutants operate fully in the animal kingdom at the level of higher mammals.

> “_At first only the *spirit of intuition* could function in the instinctive and reflex behavior of the primordial animal life. With the differentiation of higher types, the *spirit of understanding* was able to endow such creatures with the gift of spontaneous association of ideas. Later on we observed the *spirit of courage* in operation; evolving animals really developed a crude form of protective self-consciousness. Subsequent to the appearance of the mammalian groups, we beheld the *spirit of knowledge* manifesting itself in increased measure. And the evolution of the higher mammals brought the function of the *spirit of counsel,* with the resulting growth of the herd instinct and the beginnings of primitive social development._” (<a id="a114_747"></a>[UB 62:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p6_3))

I therefore have full confidence in finding my little sister who died at the age of six months for this reason and because I believe in her resurrection in the probationary nursery since the arrival of my parents on the morontia worlds.
