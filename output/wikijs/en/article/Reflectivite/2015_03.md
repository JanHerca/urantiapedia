## A word from the president

_Maurice Migneault_
_Your new president_

urantiamaurice@gmail.com

No, that's not a picture of the Dalton brothers you see here, but of your new Board of Directors.

**Why change when everything is going well?**

The reason for the change is not only to offer those in office a rest, but also to allow them to work elsewhere, to live new experiences in the service. The change also promotes the inflow of new blood and in the long term, allows our collective potential to be better expressed.

**What should we expect from a Board of Directors?**

In an adventure such as ours, that of preparing humanity for the reception of the Fifth Epochal Revelation, it is important that everyone put their shoulder to the wheel. But if everyone puts their shoulder to the same wheel, the cart will not move forward, it will go around in circles. This is where a Board of Directors (and Coordinating Board) becomes useful to ensure that all efforts are well coordinated and harmonized so that their actions do not cancel each other out. One way to achieve this is to foster communication and exchange between individuals. In this regard, next summer, from July 30 to August 2, we will be hosting the Triennial Congress of Urantia Association International.

**The importance of communication...**

For an organ to be functional, all its cells must communicate with each other. For the body to be efficient, all its organs must communicate with each other, because the activity of one influences the behavior of the others. It is somewhat in this perspective that an international Congress takes on meaning. Such a congress promotes the harmonization of efforts, thus ensuring that everywhere in the world our progress is in the same direction, and above all at the same pace.

I am particularly sensitive to the importance of communication between us, of sharing our ideas and skills. I invite you to contact me to share your ideas or grievances that could improve the functioning of our Association. $\square$

## Newly elected members of the Urantia Association of Quebec

_Line St-Pierre_
_Communications Committee_

At the Annual General Meeting on February 15, 21 people gathered in Drummondville to elect a new president and treasurer. For the next two years, Maurice Migneault will serve as president and Marc Belleau as treasurer. The vacant secretary position was filled by Robert Cadieux until the new Annual General Meeting.

Congratulations to the new team! $\square$

You may have noticed on the AUQ website that we have problems with the internet links that give you access to the old Réflectivité.

This problem will be resolved very soon since the AUQ is on the verge of having a completely revamped website.

## Secretary of the Urantia Association of Quebec

_Robert Cadieux_
_Secretary of the AUQ_

Dear friends,

At our 2015 Annual Meeting, we were informed that the Secretary in office since 2014 had to resign. I agreed to complete the term.

I will act to the best of my knowledge to support the Board of Directors and the Urantia movement in Quebec. I am excited by this opportunity to get involved and serve. I am just a small cog in the great wheel of progression.

All together to advance the revelation. $\square$

## Being and doing

_Marc Belleau_
_Lasalle_

To be is the essence of our relationship with our Heavenly Father, which consists in becoming like Him, perfect as sons and daughters of God as He is perfect as the Father of creation. To do is the essence of our relationship with God the Supreme, it is action, service. It is through the involvement of the creatures of the grand universe in the divine plan that the Supreme can emerge and become factual. I do not have much difficulty in understanding what “to be” means; it is sometimes the “doing” that is deficient in my life. Yet, to be and to do are inseparable from each other and indispensable to our growth.

It is in this perspective that I decided to invest myself a little more in the service of the spiritual brotherhood by seizing a magnificent opportunity that presented itself to me, that of serving as treasurer of the Urantia Association. It is a great privilege to be associated with a team so devoted to the cause of the revelation. The challenge is great since this year a major event, the 2015 convention, will occupy a large part of our energies. I can assure you that I will take full advantage of this magnificent opportunity offered to me to enhance my skills and abilities, to serve God and his great family to the best of my knowledge and abilities. I take this opportunity to thank Marcel Laporte, my predecessor, for the service he accomplished during the last year. I would also like to thank Gaétan Charland whose devotion to the 5th revelation is no longer to be proven and who is leaving his position as president. Finally, I would like to warmly greet Maurice Migneault who succeeds him; I am convinced that he will be able to guide the destiny of the movement with a constantly renewed touch of humor. $\square$

## From English to French

**“Billion-Billion” \& “Trillion-Billion”**

1,000,000,000 \& 1,000,000,000,000

In the original “Urantia Book”, written in American English, the numbers billion and trillion do NOT translate to the same words in French.

- The word **<ins>billion in English</ins>** translates to the word **<ins>“billion” in French</ins>**. (<ins>1,000,000,000</ins> or 1 x 10^9^ )
- The word **<ins>trillion in English</ins>** translates to the word **<ins>“billion” in French</ins>**. (<ins>1,000,000,000,000</ins> or 1 x 10^12^ )

(Source: http://anglais-pratique.fr/index.php/rubriques/fauxamis/72-milliard-billion-trillion )

## Definition: Immanent ”

- From the Latin immanens, ‘which dwells in’.
- **Which exists within the being.** “_Divine immanence, an inner God that is part of each individual._”.
- <ins>Philosophy</ins>: Principle according to which the finality of the human being is contained in his very nature. “_A philosophy of immanence, which considers thought and matter on an equal footing (without confusing them)._”
- <ins>Immanent justice</ins>: Principle that the guilty act itself will one day or another punish its author.
- **<ins>Synonym</ins>**: constitutive, inherent, innate, intrinsic.
- **<ins>Antonym</ins>**: Transcendent.

“Immanent and transcendent forces.”

> The cross makes a supreme appeal to the best in man because it discloses one who was willing to lay down his life in the service of his fellow men. Greater love no man can have than this: that he would be willing to lay down his life for his friends—and Jesus had such a love that he was willing to lay down his life for his enemies, a love greater than any which had hitherto been known on earth.

## My visit to the Foundation

Last May, I had the pleasure of visiting the Urantia Foundation offices in Chicago.

A reader for over 35 years already, I had been dreaming of this visit for several years. Thanks to the good care and good contacts of Line Saint-Pierre and Gaétan Charland, I was able to ensure the possibility of taking a little tour of the property during my first trip to Chicago.

What a shock when I saw the house at 533 Diversey Parkway, Chicago, Illinois. I had always seen the building in black and white photos. To me, it was like standing at the gates of St. Peter's in Rome! Minus the thousands of tourists.

Unfortunately, my arrival in Chicago by bus on a Friday was later than expected, so I was unable to visit the foundation's offices that day. And since the offices are closed on Saturdays, I risked not being able to visit the interior.

As the attached photo attests, my prayers for help were answered. Joanne Strobel's husband, who works at the Foundation, generously agreed to come and open the doors of Dr. Sadler's venerable residence for a short guided tour that delighted me.

A short video clip was taken from this visit and can be viewed on YouTube at:

> Logic is the technique of philosophy, its method of expression. Within the domain of true science, reason is always amenable to genuine logic; within the domain of true religion, faith is always logical from the basis of an inner viewpoint, even though such faith may appear to be quite unfounded from the inlooking viewpoint of the scientific approach. From outward, looking within, the universe may appear to be material; from within, looking out, the same universe appears to be wholly spiritual. Reason grows out of material awareness, faith out of spiritual awareness, but through the mediation of a philosophy strengthened by revelation, logic may confirm both the inward and the outward view, thereby effecting the stabilization of both science and religion. Thus, through common contact with the logic of philosophy, may both science and religion become increasingly tolerant of each other, less and less skeptical. ([UB 103:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p7_6))

## Thanks to Lise and Pierre Routhier

_Maurice Migneau_

At the beginning of 2015, the legal address of the Urantia Association of Quebec, which was that of Lise and Pierre Routhier at 4071 rue Edna in Verdun, was changed to 569, rue Francine, Sainte Sophie, QC J5J 2H7 at the home of Line StPierre and Gaétan Charland.

Our two pillars Pierre and Lise have now moved to a retirement housing complex. They have done their part.

A big thank you and a provincial round of applause for these two hard workers who have contributed so much, and for so many years, to the foundations of the Urantian movement in Quebec. $\square$

## New birth of Cécile Desforges (1930-2015)

In peace, on the night of February 6, 2015, Cécile was called to undertake her ascension into the worlds of light.

Cecile had a constantly most inspiring relationship with the Divine in her heart (with her Jesus, as she loved to express it).

A special meeting will eventually be organized by his circle of friends.

Those who would like to be kept informed of the details, please send me your contact details. $\square$
