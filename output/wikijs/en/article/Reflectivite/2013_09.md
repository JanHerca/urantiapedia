## UBIS — Urantia Book Internet School

www.urantia.org/education/courseschedule-and-registration-information

EACH YEAR, YOU CAN register for an online course with the Foundation. It requires time and commitment on your part. Only twenty students per course will be accepted. Registration will be from September 2 to 15, 2013, and classes will begin on September 16.

For this term, the following 6 courses are offered in English:

- Religion in human experience
- The Paradise Trinity and its patterns of service throughout creation
- Discovering Faith, Hope and Love - From Jesus' Resurrection to His Ascension
- Our search for consciousness
- Time and space
- Personality-A unique gift from God

**A brief description of a UBIS COURSE**

A typical course is ten weeks long and is divided into three main periods:

1. The first week of pre-course: After registration the student answers the roll call, introduces himself to the class, and reads the introductions from the other students. The student receives instructions regarding the course from the teacher.
2. The eight-week course: The study period is divided into two periods of two weeks each.
  - The first week, the teacher posts six questions. The student is invited to log in and answer three of the six questions.
  - The second week is discussion week. The student is invited to plug in and add comments and ideas.
  These two-week periods are repeated three times for a total of eight weeks.
3. The synthesis week: During this week, the student receives a summary assignment and a questionnaire. The student is asked to answer both.

### COMMITMENT

Each UBIS course has been designed for beginner, intermediate or advanced students. Before subscribing, please consider whether you have the interest, and the time, to complete the entire period, which is ten weeks and requires a minimum weekly commitment of five hours.

The teachers/facilitators are all volunteers and have dedicated a large portion of their time to preparing the courses. Each student is expected to attend the course regularly. If you are unsure of your ability to meet the requirements of this course, please refrain and let someone else register. You can always attend a future course. UBIS offers courses three times a year.

Thank you for your cooperation.

## Michael's picnic

LAST AUGUST 18 AT THE PARC Angrignon in Ville Lasalle, for the first time in many years, we had a day without rain for our picnic. There were only 21 of us (present), but the others were surely with us in spirit. It was another beautiful fraternal gathering made of laughter, songs and relaxation, but the formula is getting old like all of us.

It takes a lot of energy to prepare such a meeting and it is Toujours Les Mêmes who take care of it, not having a replacement. The TLM thought that starting next year, we could change the Pique-nique de Michael for the Repas de la Souvenance and meet in a restaurant, sheltered from the wind and rain. This could be done in Drummondville, where our themes took place.

It is important to keep these opportunities for fellowship alive and thus give our celestial guides and our midwayer friends a moment to celebrate with us.

## THE URANTIAN EPIC

THE PAPERBACKS ON the history of Urantia take us far, far back in time, to the time when our planet was probably beginning its journey. It is, roughly, the year 1000000000 B.C.! A billion years...that is an unimaginable and probably inconceivable period of time for us. Even though “_Time is a name given to the arrangement of events in succession, which allows them to be recognized and separated_” <a id="a65_400"></a>[UB 130:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p7_4) the fact remains that time often exceeds our understanding.

Knowing our past, knowing where we come from, going back in time on our planet and seeing ancient images of strange and vanished worlds, of marvelous and incredible worlds, parade in our imagination, these booklets on our history have amazed me and have made me dream and travel more than once. You only have to stop and realize that, in our different biological fluids circulating in each of us, in our own physical bodies, there are artifacts, fossils, vestiges of our distant origins.

There have been many geological and climatic upheavals on our planet. I often imagine a vast expanse of water when I travel in my region (the Outaouais region), since this territory is the former seabed of the Champlain Sea, barely 10,000 years ago! Perched on the Canadian Shield, the Champlain Lookout, in Gatineau Park, overlooks the Ottawa Valley and when I go there, I can't help but imagine a sea as far as the eye can see, whales and seals... Our cold and white Greenland of today was once covered with a verdant tropical forest! North America was once covered with 6,000 meters of snow...who can imagine that! Recently, our planet has seen its Arctic ice melt at an accelerated and surprising speed. This phenomenon is not insignificant since... “_As long as the polar regions continue to be covered with ice, it is hardly possible for another glacial age to occur, regardless of future land elevations or modification of ocean currents._” <a id="a69_948"></a>[UB 61:7.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p7_11)

The appearance of life in the primitive oceans, the first flowering plants, the first placental mammals, the mysterious sudden mutations and the first humans have caused much excitement. Throughout this epic, many animal and pre-human species, some human races too, have not been able to adapt to the changes and meet the many challenges of their environments and are now extinct, extinct forever. Our history also has its share of tears and suffering. The needle of the compass of biological evolution points inexorably towards the eternal perfection of the Father. “_The meaning of life is its adaptability: the value of life is its aptitude for progress._” <a id="a71_660"></a>[UB 130:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p4_7)

With Andon and Fonta, the appearance of the first truly volitional and intelligent beings, the first humans to see the light of day on our world, our story takes a more personal turn. It comes closer to us, in every sense of the word, even though Andon and Fonta lived 1,000,000 years ago... With this memorable pair of twins came the spirits of worship and wisdom and the Thought Adjusters... It is astounding and reassuring to think that within each of us dwells a prepersonal fragment of the First Source and Center. Astonishing to think that “the greatest of the unfathomable mysteries of God is the phenomenon of divine indwelling in the mortal mind.” <a id="a73_657"></a>[UB 1:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p4_1) Yes, it does seem that our body is a temple.

Although our world is not a world without deplorable stories, 2000 years ago, it was still our world that Michael of Nebadon chose for his 7th and final bestowal. With all this baggage behind us including such a succession of varied events, many of which were wonderful and extraordinary, and others unfortunate, the creatures that we have become today can be proud. Proud but also grateful and indebted to all those who have gone before us, to all the celestial intelligences who have been working for so long, who are working so methodically and patiently on our world and for our world so that it becomes conducive to spiritual elevation. Yes, hard and long-term work, all this so that we can find God, understand him and recognize him.

> “_The religious challenge of this age is to those farseeing and forward-looking men and women of spiritual insight who will dare to construct a new and appealing philosophy of living out of the enlarged and exquisitely integrated modern concepts of cosmic truth, universe beauty, and divine goodness.. . ._” (<a id="a77_311"></a>[UB 2:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p7_10))

Let us roll up our sleeves with enthusiasm despite the magnitude of the task and the many inevitable obstacles and try to take up this challenge that is thrown at us to make our world a better world, a world of fraternity allowing men to live together despite the complexities of modern civilization, a world based on the recognition of the fatherhood of God.

## Self-awareness and the goodness of God

WHEN I WAS A VERY YOUNG child, I was very damaged, sexually abused. My body, my Being were raped, destroying what was most fragile in me, my esteem and especially my existence. I no longer existed. For years, I directed my energies towards others and into sport. It was through sport that I was able to overcome my desires for cigarettes, drugs and suicide. Cycling was my last support and it was in sports competition that I could identify myself.

Self-awareness is not always easy. It was at the age of 30 that I began to become aware that I existed, that I had a “body”. At that time, I was a foreign student at the University of Laval in Quebec. My student permit was ending and I did not yet have my Canadian citizenship, so I had to return to my country of origin, France.

I had to pack my bags, but I couldn't bring my bike. My bike was like a second skin. I was anxious, I cried at the thought that my bike wouldn't cross the ocean with me. My bike was me. Without it, I was nothing, because I identified with it. I lived through it.

When I arrived in France, I felt naked because my bike hadn't followed. I wasn't feeling well. So one day, I decided to take my courage in both hands to look at myself. I was afraid to be with myself. I was afraid to discover my interior. I had always felt disgusting, that deep in my heart, in my soul, I was filled with waste.

In order to recover, I went to a monastery: to the Bernardine Sisters where I stayed for five days, giving myself time to face my demons and learn to be with myself. On the third day, I felt ready to look at my interior. I lay down on the bed and said to God: “Go ahead, show me my interior!” I was so afraid, I cried, but when the darkness of my interior was swept away by the hand of God, I saw a treasure deep inside me and I cried with all my being.

It was from that moment that I began to learn to love myself, that the Being that had been broken into a thousand pieces like a puzzle, began to rebuild itself. The nun who took care of me told me that “I was a marvel.” Nature is a marvel of God's creation and I, not only was I part of its marvels, but also, I was one of them!

Since that day twelve years ago, I have been able to be in harmony with myself. Many of my wounds have been healed and I no longer need my bike or other artifacts to accompany me.

I am aware of myself, because my body, my Being, my soul belong to me again. All this was able to be restored thanks to God and to the courage to want to get out of it, me, the marvel that God has conceived.

## Love your enemies...

I THINK I HAVE FOUND AN EXPLANATION for this commandment. Those who want to harm us are often our best friends without knowing it. They allow us to reorient our lives.

So it was when the manager of the factory where I worked as a foreman destroyed my reputation. I was unable to continue my career in administration. Without him, I would be a less accomplished man, because I had to diversify my activities and my knowledge. Not only have I forgiven him, but I want to thank him, tell him that I love him and appreciate the great service he has rendered me.

It's easy to forgive when you love someone. So why should you forgive someone who does you a favor?

## The publication mandate

Collected by: Some members of the General Council of Urantia Brotherhood
For: The Urantia Brotherhood Executive Committee Archives
Presented: April 4, 1955

It seems appropriate, for the second time, to bring to the attention of the Executive Committee certain wise comments and recommendations which have been collected over the years and which bear upon the future problems of The Urantia Book. These comments might be presented in the form of a document entitled:

### The Urantia Book Synchronicity

(Originally called) The Publication Mandate

“We regard The Urantia Book as a manifestation of the progressive evolution of human society. It is not akin to the spectacular episodes of an epochal revelation, although it may seem timed to appear in the wake of such a revolution in human society. The Book belongs to the epoch which will immediately succeed the conclusion of the present ideological struggle. There will come a time when men will be disposed to seek truth and righteousness. When the chaos of the present confusion has cleared away, it will be more possible to design the architecture of a new and improved era of human relations. It is for this better order of things on earth that the Book has been made available.”

“But the publication of the Book has not been postponed to this possible distant date. An early publication of the Book has been offered so that it may be available for the training of leaders and educators. Its availability is also required to attract the attention of wealthy people who might then be induced to provide financial resources for translation into other languages.”

“(You) who have dedicated (your) lives to the service of the Book and the Brotherhood, can hardly realize the importance of (your) actions. No doubt (you) will live your life and die without fully understanding that (you) are participating in the birth of a new age of religion in this world.”

“The future is not open to your mortal understanding, but you would be wise to study in great detail the order, the plan, and the methods of progression as they were carried out during Michael’s life on earth, when the Word became flesh. You become actors in the episodes that will follow as the Word becomes Book. Vast are the differences between these dispensations of religion, but many are the lessons that can be learned by studying the bygone era.

“(You) must study the time of Jesus on earth. (You) can take very good note of the manner in which the kingdom of heaven was inaugurated in the world. Did it evolve slowly and unfold naturally? Where did it manifest itself with a sudden display of force, accompanied by a spectacular exhibition of power? Was it evolutionary or revolutionary?

“(You) must stir up your souls to patience. (You) are associated with a revelation of truth which is part of the natural evolution of religion in this world. Too rapid a growth would be suicidal. This Book is given to those who are ready for it, long before the day of its world mission. Thousands of study groups must be organized and the Book must be translated into many languages. Then the Book will be ready when man’s battle for freedom is won and the world is once more made more fertile for the religion of Jesus and for the freedom of mankind.”

(10.5) * In Doctor Sadler's History of the Urantia Movement, this message is entitled: “The Publication Mandate.”

[This document was presented by William S. Sadler Junior to the Forum on the above-mentioned date. For the greater intelligibility of the listeners, the pronouns have been changed, i.e., we have introduced “we” instead of “you.” For this reason, we have returned them in their original form. Copies of this document have been inserted in the minute book of the secretary of each committee in office of the Brotherhood. The committee chairmen have received copies.]

## DID YOU KNOW?

**Texts taken from old issues of Réflectivité**

THE FIRST ISSUE OF THE BULLETIN **Réflectivité** was released in November 1982. It succeeded the bulletin LAmbassadeur du Futur, and was published three times a year, in an 8 &half; x 11 in. format, and under the coordination of Guy Hévey.

**It was written on the first page:**

_The main thing is that this newsletter is truly “your” newsletter. But it is essential for this that you feel it that way and that you share the benefits of your writing with others. In the same way, it is vital that you inform “uninformed” readers of the existence of this newsletter so that it is also “theirs”._

_The “Urantia” movement is gradually expanding, both in Quebec and on a global scale. This bulletin is, after all, only one means among others to contribute to this double expansion. It is up to us to take advantage of it._ $\square$

## Leather Cases for The Urantia Book

A FEW MONTHS AGO, THE FOUNDATION got rid of some 120 cases for the Little Urantia Books.

The AUQ only had to pay the shipping costs and therefore can sell them to you for $5 plus postage.

Let me know your interest, either by email at line.stpierre@gmail.com or by phone at 450-565-3323. $\square$
