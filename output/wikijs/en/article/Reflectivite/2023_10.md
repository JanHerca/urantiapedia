Hello dear readers and members of the association,

Recently, we had the opportunity to attend a virtual conference given by Conrad Lavallée entitled “Divine Fatherhood/Mansion Worlds”. It was a very good conference highlighting our intimate relationship with God, a father-son relationship. This is a most fascinating subject that has attracted my attention for many years and I thank Conrad for his enlightening thoughts.

The Urantia Association of Quebec began its fall activities on the Zoom platform at the end of summer. With this conference of capital importance entitled Divine Paternity/Mansion Worlds, it was right to retain the services of our good friend Conrad Lavallée.

This conference whose central subject deals with the personality of God followed by our common relational experiences make them both capital themes which respond, as the presenter says, to the existential questions of life. Such was therefore this title judiciously chosen and presented on this Sunday of September 17, 2023.

_(Editor's note: Here is the full text of Conrad Lavallée's conference given on September 17, 2023 as part of the series of conferences organized by the AUQ.)_

**The implications of divine Fatherhood.**

The notion of personality — the personality of Our Universal Father.

Unique characteristics of the concept of personality in ***The Urantia Book*** <a id="a104_79"></a>[UB 112:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_2) — <a id="a104_125"></a>[UB 112:0.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_16).

It is not our physical body.

It is not our thought (conscious and unconscious).

She is not our morontia soul.

She is not (yet) our Thought Adjuster.

It represents the factor that unifies all of these elements.

It is unique, absolutely unique in time and eternity, there are no copies.
She is gifted with free will and a certain form of creative spontaneity.

It has three finite dimensions, three absonite dimensions, and one absolute dimension.

_Dr William S Sadler MD_

The composition of this text is based on the book “The Urantia Book Workbooks, volume III” by Dr. William S. Sadler, MD. Here is the continuation of the text of Réflectivité for the month of September 2023

**The Survival Plan as detailed in The Urantia Book**

**IV. Life in the flesh.**

**1- The ascension during the “era of light and life”.**

By the time a world reaches the fourth stage of light and life, more than half of the mortals leave the planet by transference, rising out of the world of the living.

## Three important subjects for me!

_France Tremblay_

My dear Urantian friends,

I would like to share with you my thoughts on 3 subjects that are particularly close to my heart.

<ins>First</ins>: unity within the Urantian movement. For several weeks, a petition launched by Sue Seccombe has been circulating on the internet in order to reunify the different factions within the Urantian movement.

To my great surprise, this petition does not manage to exceed the number of 500 signatories... and that across the planet!

Recently, I learned that this division had indeed been initiated by Caligastia and Daligastia!

Are we going to tolerate much longer the misdeeds perpetrated by these fallen brothers continuing to influence our planet... or are we going to emerge from our inaction and take action?

## The real question for those who have realized God

**Opinion**

The real question, filled with the greatest rewarding challenge for those who have realized God, is: How shall I go about bringing my fellow man to realize this? Too many today are imprisoned in superstition, fear, unbrotherly selfishness, and materialistic intellectualism to the limit. The true gospel of the kingdom as illuminated in Part IV of The Urantia Book calls for active ambassadors of the kingdom with far greater urgency than in the days of Jesus. It seems to me that humanity needs them.

This activity allows several readers of different levels of understanding to exchange and study together the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. It promotes spiritual progress by allowing its participants to find practical applications to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ in their daily lives. This important approach allows us to keep a broad point of view on the concepts of truth. You wish to participate or form a study group; we will be happy to assist you.
