> “_When you remember me, first look back on my life._” (Jesus, at the memorial supper)

## Celebration of the “Supper of Remembrance” at the “Maisonnia”

_Roberte Roussel and_
_Paul-Yvan Deléglise_
_Quebec_

Around mid-March 2018, we were reminded of the possibility of celebrating the _REPAS DE LA SOUVENANCE_ again. It was recommended by the AUQ to do so on Friday, April 6, 2018.

Some members of the reading group “_La Maisonnia_” then had a strong reaction to the fact that the meal would be on Friday and AFTER the civic holiday of Easter, a holiday that had become worldwide and rather pagan.

Some have even reported having to abstain from attending this ceremony devoid of its profound meaning!

Following this reaction, the group decided to bring the celebration back to the end of the afternoon, on Thursday, BEFORE Easter, as Jesus himself had set it. He who wanted to signify to us that his gospel would deliver us from slavery and give us back the freedom of the children of God.

Due to uncontrollable circumstances, we had to celebrate on Wednesday, March 28, rather than Thursday, March 29.

After a warm welcome, we discussed the way forward. Here is what was agreed: contemplation, reading of booklet 179, entitled “_The Last Supper_”, discussions and comments as the reading progressed, a sip of wine, at the time designated in the text, the meal.

The meeting went as planned, but at one point bread was served without us breaking it as Jesus did.

The ceremony was performed as closely as possible to the symbolism desired by Jesus and the meeting took place in joy and contentment.

We want and hope to relive every year this experience of Holy Thursday which connects us to all believers in Jesus, while thus responding to his invitation to what was his last meal with his apostles.

## What a beautiful moment!

On Friday evening, April 6, several members of our study group “_Discoveries_” gathered to celebrate the last supper of Jesus and his twelve apostles. A touching and nourishing evening.

While reading part of booklet 179, “_The Last Supper_”, we focused more on section 5 “_The Institution of the Memorial Supper_”.

What a beautiful moment! Several sharings, notably on the question “_what has reading The Urantia Book changed in your lives?_”, allowed us to welcome rich confidences, episodes of life that make us appreciate and love even more those with whom we walk towards our Father. What a beautiful moment! In addition to deepening our understanding of this text of the life of Jesus, we deepen our knowledge and understanding of the Master and his message of Beauty, Goodness and Truth. What a beautiful moment! This acquisition is reflected in an improved knowledge of the friends around the table, the bonds are woven more and tightened, but ultimately a better knowledge and understanding of oneself which, mobilized, pushes us more and more towards what attracts us. What a Beautiful moment! What a Good moment! What a True moment!

**Claudette**

What a joyous moment to be back with the Urantia Book reading group on this remarkable occasion of the “_Supper of Remembrance_”. I am learning to know Jesus better by reading the text, but also through the reflections and sharing of the group members. What a treasure! I thank you.

Jesus inspires me by: his courage to face what men had chosen to make him experience, by his forgiveness and kindness towards those who persecute him, by his respect and unconditional love towards his apostles and by his faith in our Father.

Thank you Jesus for being with us at this memorial dinner and thank you to our hosts for creating this moment of pure happiness.

## Israel

_Eric Tarissan_
_Quebec_

I was invited to make a two-week pilgrimage to the land of Jesus, a trip organized by Mrs. Diane Labrecque. This trip included two visits per day. Of course I could tell you about the Garden of Gethsemane, the Garden of Olives, the place where the last supper took place, the Palace of Pontius Pilate where Jesus was condemned and scourged, the Way of the Cross, Golgotha where he was crucified, the tomb where he was laid, the cave where he often went to pray with his apostles, the place where he left our world to make his ascension and the Wailing Wall. Not to mention Mount Hermon where he settled the “case” of Satan and Caligastia, the Port of Caesarea, the Jordan where he was baptized, the synagogue where he spent a few years studying and even teaching, to name just a few; but it cannot give all the intense impression nor all the emotion that overwhelms you to find yourself there, in the land of Jesus, walking in his footsteps. To relive with him how the Sanhedrin so unjustly judged and condemned him for having opened the door to all humanity... what am I saying, to a whole universe to teach us to know and love our true, just and good, equitable, benevolent and merciful Father.

To discover all the courage, all the humility and all the love that Jesus never ceased to have for us, his humble creatures - some of whom, at that moment, were very cruel, brutal, unjust and unconscious - when he told his Father to forgive them because they do not know what they do.

Because Jerusalem is a small village! You have Pilate's Palace a few minutes walk away where the last supper took place, and about fifteen minutes from the Garden of Olives. Everything is nearby. To find myself there, it was almost unreal. To imagine that Michael, our father/brother Creator was there 2000 thousand years ago, to find places almost intact, put me in an indescribable state. I was moved, touched to the depths of my soul.

And all this incredible, unforgettable, divine and unique experience of my life would not have been possible without all the titanic master work and so perfectly coordinated and prepared by Mrs. Diane Labrecque, this outstanding organizer and animator. She who, throughout the trip will have been able to open the doors of all these sites, historical places, chapels, Churches, Basilicas and Gardens; thanks to her constant good humor, her dedication and her professionalism.

Thank you Diane, thank you to each of the members of my group and thank you Father, for making all this possible, now and forever, and thank you, Michael, for your Spirit of Truth.

## CONVERGENCES

_Pierre Sauvageau_
_St-Alexis-des-monts_

After some time in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LCDS), I was called to be told that I was ready to receive the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods.

Although the name “Melchizedek” is found in the writings of Paul of Tarsus, “Jesus Christ is a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek”[^1], this name was then totally unknown to me. The characteristics of this priesthood are: “_to receive the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven_”[^2]. I was then far from suspecting that part of these mysteries would be revealed to me later when I made contact with the “_Urantia Book_” (U.L.). I wondered at length why this revelation had not been transmitted through the intermediary of the EJCSDJ.

In any case, this term “Melchizedek” abounds in the L.U. And it is a very particular thing to find the name of the initiator of Abraham, because very few writings in contemporary literature allude to this character.

However, this convergence between the EJCSDJ and the L.U. is astonishing, but does not stop there. I had other surprises of particularly new convergent concepts, such as the “dispensation of the fullness of times” [^3]. And I had other surprises of new convergent concepts in modern literature, namely the materiality of the spiritual world: "immaterial matter does not exist. All spirit is matter, but it is more refined, the elements are eternal [^4]. This concept caused a scandal among the religious of the 19th century. However, we find its corollary in the L.U.: matter and spirit unified by inherence in Havona [^5]. Let us also point out that in Joseph Smith, we find the idea that this earth in its sanctified and immortal state will be made like a crystal [^6]. This concept corresponds in the L.U. to this phase of light and life which awaits the earth in its ultimate development. Likewise this other idea of Joseph Smith that humans can become Gods who will build worlds which is in perfect coincidence with the concept of the L.U. on the body of the finality whose members will have jurisprudence in the present exterior worlds of the seven superuniverses.

However, despite the converging elements I have mentioned, a dissonant note caught my attention, namely a huge difference in the dissemination of the respective writings. As much as Mormonism galvanized the masses to such an extent that shortly after Joseph Smith's action, convoys, teams, caravans set out to conquer the American West.

In comparison, the progress of the Urantian movement is slow, because as we know, there are currently 444 study groups throughout the world, which represents approximately 4,440 individuals assuming 5 active members and 5 satellite members per study group. So, it is necessary to wonder about the meaning of this very slow progress of the Urantian movement after 65 years of existence.

Let us put forward the hypothesis, based on the book “The Prophecy of the Andes”, that a critical mass of 10% is enough for the entire human community to benefit from the positive ripple effect of the beneficial revelations of the L.U.

Still, it will always be astonishing that the “Book of Mormon”—written on gold plates buried in the Hill Cumorah in New York State—emerged from the earth in 1827 to later join the papers from heaven written, reworked, and deposited by a coven [^7] of celestial beings in a vault at 533 Diversey Drive Chicago from 1925 to 1955.

Are these two revelations from the northwest of America complementary?


## Study groups and the Urantia Association of Quebec (AUQ)

Do you want to publish your study group on the association website or in the newsletter “_Réflectivité_”? Certain criteria must meet this requirement.

Study “_The Urantia Book_” in its entirety and not just one of its parts. Other books can also be used in parallel to support the study, but “_The Urantia Book_” should be the main object of discussion and in-depth study.

The groups are apolitical and therefore are not recruiting places for any association or organization.

Channeling—the idea of being able to communicate with celestial beings through any channels—is not endorsed by the association.

Participation in a study group is free of charge.

If your group is published on the AUQ website and you observe a deviation from these criteria, you can inform the association's study group manager.
