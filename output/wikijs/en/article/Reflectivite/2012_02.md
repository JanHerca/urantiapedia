## The search for perfection or the quest for the Grail (Part 2)

In a previous issue of the monthly Réflectivité, we spoke of three levels of development: physical, mental and spiritual, and of the need to accumulate knowledge and experience.

We have come to the conclusion that this enables us to better adapt to the constantly changing conditions of our existence. To adapt means to learn from the situations that present themselves to us. Adaptation is the mechanism by which we learn to respond in a just and fair manner; this is what perfecting our human nature is all about. In this text we will see that God is constantly adapting to the changing conditions of his universe. Next we will reflect on the first level of perfection that we must attain—perfection of purpose—on the 7th circle (the outermost circle) of the central universe of Havona, our first encounter with perfection.

God is constantly adapting to the changing conditions of his creation. He is flexible in managing and administering the laws of a constantly changing universe.

> _. . . It should be made clear, however, that, *if,* in the divinity of any situation, in the extremity of any circumstance, in any case where the course of supreme wisdom might indicate the demand for different conduct—if the demands of perfection might for any reason dictate another method of reaction, a better one, then and there would the all-wise God function in that better and more suitable way. That would be the expression of a higher law, not the reversal of a lower law._ Paper 12, no. 7: The central universe and the superuniverses, the part and the whole, (<a id="a24_574"></a>[UB 12:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p7_3))

This ability to foster the expression of a higher law means that God knows and understands perfectly what is happening in a given situation. This knowledge allows him to apply laws perfectly adapted to the conditions of creatures. God is obviously the source of all knowledge; he knows without limits and his understanding is absolute. This is what allows him to act with justice; in this, God does not change. It is therefore the knowledge of the facts and the understanding of the situations in which we find ourselves that will allow us, too, to choose the most just attitude. Here is another example of God's capacity to adapt to the choice of the multitude of his creatures in the universe.

> _The determiner of the differential of spiritual presence exists in your own hearts and minds and consists in the manner of your own choosing, in the decisions of your minds, and in the determination of your own wills. This differential is inherent in the freewill reactions of intelligent personal beings, beings whom the Universal Father has ordained shall exercise this liberty of choosing. And the Deities are ever true to the ebb and flow of their spirits in meeting and satisfying the conditions and demands of this differential of creature choice, now bestowing more of their presence in response to a sincere desire for the same and again withdrawing themselves from the scene as their creatures decide adversely in the exercise of their divinely bestowed freedom of choice. And thus does the spirit of divinity become humbly obedient to the choosing of the creatures of the realms._ (<a id="a28_895"></a>[UB 13:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/13#p4_5))

God having granted free will to imperfect creatures, he must of necessity adapt himself to the choices of these creatures. When rebellion broke out in our system, he had to react to the decisions of his errant sons and remedy the situation by isolating that portion of the universe to which our planet belongs, by sending rescue sons to restore the situation, and in many other ways which would take too long to enumerate here. God had to deviate from the usual course of the universe; he adapted himself to that situation. Jesus of Nazareth also demonstrated flexibility and adaptation during his incarnation on Urantia.

> _Jesus had sought to live his life on earth and complete his bestowal mission as the Son of Man. His followers were disposed to regard him as the expected Messiah. Knowing that he could never fulfill their Messianic expectations, he endeavored to effect such a modification of their concept of the Messiah as would enable him partially to meet their expectations. But he now recognized that such a plan could hardly be carried through successfully. He therefore elected boldly to disclose the third plan—openly to announce his divinity, acknowledge the truthfulness of Peter’s confession, and directly proclaim to the twelve that he was a Son of God._ (<a id="a32_655"></a>[UB 157:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p5_2))

Jesus had to change his plan several times in order to adapt to the needs of humanity. He was flexible in his teaching methods in order to give the people of his day a vision of God adapted to their level of consciousness.

The success of our quest for perfection lies in developing our capacity to adapt to the different situations of our existence, in other words, to be able to find the most suitable solutions to the problems of our daily life. Knowledge and experience are the tools that allow us to achieve this. At present, this is our life on Urantia and later, it will be life on the mansion worlds, those of the spheres of the local universe and so on up to Paradise. Perfection, I would define it as being, like God, the capacity to do what is right in any of the situations we encounter.

> _Candidates for eternal life are practitioners of an invigorating and constructive technique for meeting all of the vicissitudes and harassments of mortal living. Every day a true believer lives, he finds it *easier* to do the right thing._ Paper 156, no. 5: The stay in Tyre and Sidon, the teaching of Jesus in Tyre, (<a id="a38_321"></a>[UB 156:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_13))

Adaptation is possible if we are willing to learn from the situations that come our way. Why not see the obstacles we encounter as opportunities for growth? In every situation in our lives, we can choose to learn rather than to endure; I believe this represents true cooperation with God. When our master Michael incarnated on earth, he had his share of mitigating circumstances throughout his life. The heavy family burden that fell on his young shoulders—Jesus was 15 at the time—when his father died in a work accident is a fine example of his ability to cope with the abrupt changes that came his way. The dignity he displayed during his unjust trial before men with twisted and deviant minds is another inspiring example of adaptation. He opposed the expression of evil with calm, faith, and compassion. The goodwill he displayed is the mindset that will allow us, too, to adapt more easily. Jesus was an inspiration to an entire universe, but more than that, he was a superb human model of resilience.

### The first date with perfection

All this research is aimed at the attainment of the first level of perfection which will take place on the last of the seven circles of Havona attainment (the outermost circle), when we shall have conquered the whole of the knowledge and experience required by the superuniverse to which we belong. This is perfection of purpose. It is the first stage to be attained, the first of many rendezvous with perfection.

> _When, through and by the ministry of all the helper hosts of the universal scheme of survival, you are finally deposited on the receiving world of Havona, you arrive with only one sort of perfection *— perfection of purpose.* Your purpose has been thoroughly proved; your faith has been tested. You are known to be disappointment proof. Not even the failure to discern the Universal Father can shake the faith or seriously disturb the trust of an ascendant mortal who has passed through the experience that all must traverse in order to attain the perfect spheres of Havona. By the time you reach Havona, your sincerity has become sublime. Perfection of purpose and divinity of desire, with steadfastness of faith, have secured your entrance to the settled abodes of eternity; your deliverance from the uncertainties of time is full and complete;_ Paper 26, no. 4: The tutelary spirits of the central universe, the secondary Supernaphim, (<a id="a46_942"></a>[UB 26:4.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p4_13))

In the dictionary, terms related to intention are given as synonyms for purpose: enterprise, idea, plan, program, project, resolution, and terms related to the idea of desire: ambition, call, appetite, aspiration, attraction, lure, need, desire, hunger, ideal, intention, quest, search, dream, thirst, wish, will. Intention and desire are complementary aspects that enable us to attain perfection of purpose. It is easier to understand the idea of desire, that insatiable hunger that impels us to want to know more and more about God and to love Him. But what about intention? Here we are not talking about mere will. We are told that, from the seventh mansion world, we must reflect on the route we will take to approach the Paradise Deities when our sojourn on the seven preparatory circles at Havona begins.

> _Immediately upon the confirmation of Adjuster fusion the new morontia being is introduced to his fellows for the first time by his new name and is granted the forty days of spiritual retirement from all routine activities wherein to commune with himself and to choose some one of the optional routes to Havona and to select from the differential techniques of Paradise attainment._ Paper 47, No. 8: The Seven Mansion Worlds, the Sixth Mansion World, (<a id="a50_454"></a>[UB 47:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p8_5))

Choosing an optional route to reach Havona and selecting between different techniques for reaching Paradise means that there are several ways to approach the Deities. For this reason, we will have to decide on the most suitable method to get there—we could perhaps say, the most correct way—and this constitutes the career plan that we will have to work out. It is difficult to know what it will consist of, but I imagine that it will be somewhat like the plans we work out for our professional careers during our earthly life. But let us leave aside such assumptions, for we are not there yet. Perfection of purpose, then, is that insatiable hunger for God that drives us to want to know more about him, coupled with an unfailing faith, a sincere attitude, and the development of a plan to reach the Paradise Deities. The first three elements we have just named—desire, faith, and sincerity—are the characteristics which we can begin to develop, even now, in order to advance on the path which will bring us to this first stage of perfection by working on the three levels developed in Part I of this text, the material, mental, and spiritual levels. The career plan of which I have spoken above cannot be worked out here on Urantia. It must await our arrival on the penultimate sphere of the mansion world when the fusion between the human soul and the adjuster has been consummated.

I believe that being perfect is doing the right thing and for this it is best to develop our ability to adapt to the situations that come our way. We have tools to achieve this: the willingness to face challenges, the accumulation of knowledge and experience. The more knowledgeable and experienced we are, the more our decisions are right and the more our decisions are right the more perfect we become. This perfection can never be absolute, it will always remain a quest for the Grail, something inaccessible. It is precisely this aspect that makes the achievement of perfection a thrilling and exciting adventure, a stimulus for our curiosity that makes us want to see what God has in store for each of us. Fortunately, there will always be something left to discover. The One who is at the helm of the immense creation is the master weaver whose inexhaustible creativity weaves the fabric of an eternally renewed reality. This thought alone takes my breath away and leaves me speechless before the infinite panorama that stretches out before me. Personally, I don't want to reach the end of this adventure, I want it to continue forever and ever, a bit like a film that we don't want to see end because it captivates us, excites us and keeps us on the edge of our seats.

## The biggest message

IT WAS IN THE SPRING OF 2011 THAT I launched a survey to find out what you found most important in your reading of The Urantia Book.

Take a few moments to formulate within yourself what your answer, your position, would be before knowing mine. That done, here is mine.

It was on the life of Jesus, Michael of Nebadon, that I focused my third reading, because I felt that I had not yet grasped the center of his message. By taking many notes, I finally noticed that what was repeated most often was the revelation of the Father's Love for his creatures.

I suppose this was to be the message that the apostles sent out on mission were to spread to their countrymen, thus freeing them from the nation of a vengeful, wrathful, evil God, etc.

Freed also from all those sterile and guilt-inducing rituals imposed by the priesthood of their time. What a newfound lightness, as if they were breathing for the first time, as if they were putting down a heavy burden from their aching shoulders.

Unconditional, understanding, receptive, joyful love like a real dad taking into account the evolutionary system, naturally including our faulty and painful experiences to progress towards the better. Helped, protected, guided, kept reassured about our adventurous future morontial career, secured about the present, future and final one of our earthly life, freed from animal fear, fearful apprehension and the crazy and futile infantile and useless anxiety often mentioned in the book with the counterpart of the simple invitation to do his Will, which is mainly to give back a little of this love received with abundance to our brothers and sisters who still struggle in this world of misery.

## The reasons for my devotion to the Urantia movement

IT IS UNIVERSALLY ACKNOWLEDGED that to maintain or acquire good physical health requires a minimum of daily exercise, as they say: hustle or bustle. There is no point in running a 20-kilometer marathon and then doing nothing for two weeks. Physical health is a balance between action and rest, and the same is true for mental and spiritual health. Growth and balance go hand in hand with dynamism and rest.

You cannot learn to speak a language without conversing and correcting your mistakes.

You can't learn to play a musical instrument just by reading sheet music.

We cannot demonstrate our love for God without loving our brothers through service.

Jesus said: “I send you out, not to love the souls of men, but rather to love men. It is not enough that you proclaim the joys of heaven; you must also demonstrate the spirit realities of the divine life in your daily experience. . . . This mission will find expression in the life you will live among men—the actual, living experience of loving and serving men, even as I have loved and served you. . . . As you thus draw near to your fellowmen in understanding sympathy and unselfish devotion, you will lead them to salvation through the knowledge of the Father’s love. . . . I ask that the lives of my disciples may even be lives of service, the expression of love for your brethren in the flesh.” _The Urantia Book_ <a id="a86_720"></a>[UB 191:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/191#p5_3)

It is through service that one acquires self-mastery, which is true freedom, and it is by becoming free that one gradually frees oneself from the constraints of matter. These are the reasons for my devotion to the Urantia movement. It is an effective way of practicing my scales on the keyboard of life, so that one day I may be able to play correctly this hymn to divine love.

## Hello members and friends of the association

AS EVERY YEAR, the Urantia Association of Quebec (AUQ) holds its annual general meeting to elect new council members and also publish the results of activities carried out during the previous year.

This occasion is an ideal opportunity to connect with other readers, learn about the future directions of the association, and get involved in fulfilling the mission of The Urantia Book.

Many of us have a very simple and abbreviated view of the mission of the AUQ and that of The Urantia Book. It is not that we are totally ignorant of it, but rather that we are often unable to grasp its greatness. In the Publication Mandate, a document containing directives on the dissemination of the Revelation, the Revelators inform us that: “You who have dedicated your lives to the service of the Book and the Brotherhood can scarcely realize the importance of your actions. No doubt you will live your lives and die without fully understanding that you are participating in the birth of a new age of religion in this world.”

Let us not be discouraged by these words, but let us rejoice that we are privileged to participate in the mission of a Revelation on our world. The opportunity is very rare on a planet to be able to participate in such a project, the revelations do not arrive every century, but are more often spaced several millennia apart. In fact, will we be able to say in other future lives that we participated or were simply spectators?

These are some of the questions one might ask after reading The Urantia Book. Is it true? Can it be? What should I do with this knowledge? What role can I play in this great project? What is it for? How can I use this knowledge? How can I participate? As many questions as there are reasons to do or not do anything with this knowledge, it is up to us to decide!

One of the reasons why the association exists is to follow up on these often unanswered answers. To give real meaning to these questions and their answers by allowing us to approach and tame the greatness of the mission contained in this Revelation. Alone, the work is too great and we could easily be discouraged by the immensity of the task, but in a group many things can be achieved and accomplished. An old saying goes: "If you want to go fast, go alone! If you want to go far, go in a group! In the association we want to go far!

One of the main functions of the association is to help create and support study groups. Not that these groups are part of the association as an entity, but on the contrary they must remain independent of any organizational policy. The association is there to support them by providing them with the physical and didactic means to promote their intellectual and spiritual growth. In a more concrete way, readers turn to the association to have the contact information of readers for study group meetings.

The association also organizes thematic meetings where study group members have the opportunity to make presentations and lead workshops. There are also other meetings organized for study group hosts to encourage them to improve the dynamics of their group and thus promote the emergence of leaders and teachers. Simply put, the association is there to promote the realization of the mission of The Urantia Book and provide for the dissemination of its teachings in society.

As president, my role is to keep the association focused on this mission that can often seem ethereal and escape us by its simplicity and scope. This is why the Revelators have left us simple guidelines so that the immensity of this project is accessible to us. I pray that there will be a greater number of readers in our province who will become more seriously and sincerely involved in this magnificent project by creating or participating in a study group or by getting involved in the association as a member of the council.

> _There is no adventure in the course of mortal existence more enthralling than to enjoy the exhilaration of becoming the material life partner with spiritual energy and divine truth in one of their triumphant struggles with error and evil. It is a marvelous and transforming experience to become the living channel of spiritual light to the mortal who sits in spiritual darkness.”_ (<a id="a112_385"></a>[UB 130:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p2_4))

Not only are you the salt of the earth and the light of the world, but you are also the sowers of truth.

To love is to serve.

## Election to the position of vice-president of the AUQ

HELLO, DEAR READERS, this is the second time that I have written an article about the end of my term as vice-president of the Urantia Association of Quebec.

How time flies! In my first article, I mentioned the circumstances of my accession to this position. This time, I will tell you about the joys I experienced during this second term in this position.

I thank God for giving me health and the opportunity to grow with such an extraordinary team. I am talking about the board of directors of this non-profit organization dedicated to the dissemination of The Urantia Book, as well as the training of leaders and teachers of the teachings of this fifth revelation. The team spirit and generosity of each of its members reaches levels that I have not encountered in any other organization in which I have worked during my life.

The criteria required to occupy this position are mainly the desire to learn and to serve the best of one's ability in the fraternity. Concretely, this has translated for me into participation in about ten monthly meetings with the administrative committee; participation, as coordinator and facilitator, for the organization of about three themes per year given either in St-Jérôme, Drummondville or in the Quebec region; an annual exploration trip and meeting of UB readers in the region; and this year, participation in an extraordinary conference on leadership in Chicago.

According to the rules of the AUQ charter, the term of the position of vice-president is two years. On February 5, my term will end and the position of vice-president of the AUQ will open. To apply, you must be a member in good standing of the Urantia Association of Quebec, and have paid your dues for the year 2012.
