## 2015 Sherbrooke International Congress

_Line St-Pierre_
_Program Coordinator_

Dear readers,

At the “2015 International Congress of the Urantia Association” which will take place at Bishop's University in Sherbrooke under the theme “_Progressing from the Human to the Divine_”, nineteen countries are represented to date.

You have less than a few weeks left to register, as July 20 will be the last day to book online. After July 20, it will be on a case-by-case basis by calling 450-565-3323.

As you know, all the conferences will be given in English and will be translated simultaneously; the Urantia Association of Quebec has requisitioned the services of professional interpreters to do this. Workshops, 40 in number, will be facilitated in English and others in French. Of course, for bilingual people, the workshops given in English are accessible to you. Each participant will be able to greatly benefit from this international meeting and share their understanding of the teachings.

Here are the titles of the conferences and the names of the presenters on Friday, July 31, the first full day of the program:
- **The Child and His Education** by: _Lourdes Burga-Cisneros Pizarro_, from Peru.
- **Children's Socialization Tools** by: _Chris Wood_, from the United States
- **Spiritual Unity in the Family** by: _Tamara Strumfeld_, from the United States

These three speakers are young parents under 40 with enthusiastic and enlightened parental experience.

This will be followed by the participation of the congress participants in the workshops, some of which are available in French.

**Creativity in Children** _Dominique Ronfet, France_

> “_First think of God as a creator, . . ._” ([UB 1:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p0_1))

What if, through the gift of Personality, we had inherited this capacity to renew ourselves?

How can we support our children in their creativity if we ourselves are not creators in our own lives?

Between testimonies, discussions and games, we will try to share our experiences and answer certain questions to better understand the creative process.

**Prayer and Worship**
_Moustapha Ndiaye, Senegal_

Along with Service, Worship and Prayer are fundamental, natural and universal pillars, although sometimes diffuse, as soon as we spontaneously and actively turn towards the search for an ideal in life. How can we identify, assume and share the emerging necessities born from the tendencies to serve, pray and worship, in ourselves, and in our children? This constitutes the primary purpose of Life. And in our children? This also constitutes the primary purpose of Life.

**Solute Worship Meditation**
_Guy Breton, Quebec_

The workshop should provide a good understanding of what solitary adoring meditation is like in the manner of Jesus, through the analysis of different texts and situations in which Jesus practiced this practice.

Once defined, we will explore a meditation plan that provides ample material for meditation.

Since meditating is not an easy thing, we will analyze and discuss facilitating support.

**The Parent/Child Relationship**
_Hélène Boisvenue, Quebec_

In the universe, few orders of personality benefit from parental experience. God wisely chose for human beings this privileged situation where adults must support the growth of their children, vulnerable and immature beings.

In this workshop we will explore how the parent/child relationship stimulates the highest potentials of human nature and also how a healthy parent/child relationship can depict the first of many revelations regarding the Father's love.

**Family and Society**
_Vanessa Fioamore, Quebec_

To demonstrate how the family influences the foundations of society.

To begin, we will explore the behaviors of children raised in a nurturing family versus the behaviors of neglected children. We will realize that happiness and mental, physical and emotional health are directly affected by the behavior of parents towards children.

We will define the foundations of society and together we will find the ideal behaviors to adopt for an enhanced society.

**The Worship**
_Guy Breton, Quebec_

It is well stated in “The Urantia Book” that true worship consists of choosing to conform to the will of the Father by responding to His invitation: “_Be ye perfect, even as I am perfect_.” [UB 7:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/7#p4_7).

A subject of capital importance for our spiritual growth.

Once defined, the workshop will answer many questions regarding worship in order to understand more deeply what worship is, the role it can play in our spiritual growth.

**Meditation in the style of Jesus**
_Guy Laporte, Quebec_

The hectic pace of modern life leads man to believe that he is too busy to find the time necessary for meditation.
spiritual and religious devotion. Is this your case? Whatever your answer, I invite you to participate in this workshop. Together, we will deepen our understanding of “Jesus Style Meditation.” We will outline its concepts, explore its relevance, demonstrate its important role, and explain the function of its practice.

**Service, a tool for growth**
_Sylvère Marcoux, Quebec_

We will explore what friendly service is to those we regularly encounter; how to help the most vulnerable, the elderly and children; how to extend our sphere of activity to obey Jesus' injunction to be perfect, as the Heavenly Father is perfect, He being the greatest of servants through the Thought Adjusters. It is through service that we can draw near to Him. We will also discuss the reward that follows in this life.

**The Soul, our future identity**
_Jean Annet, Belgium_

What happens to us after death? What is the soul and how can we prepare it for our future life? What happens to it here on Earth and after?

In this workshop we will see what the soul is, the elements that make it grow, understand its nature, its evolution, its fusion and its eternal destiny.

**The Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Truth**
_Hélène Boisvenue, Quebec_

In this workshop, divided into two parts, we will identify the differential origin of these two influences as well as their specific role. We will see how the Holy Spirit initiates in the consciousness a grasp of divine love, and how the Spirit of Truth empowers us to feel the love of God as Jesus manifested it.

We will explore our personal history and that of humanity to bring to light examples of the beneficial action of each of these two spiritual influences.

**The Thought Adjusters**
_Richard Lachance, Quebec_

“_Can you truly realize the true significance of the indwelling presence of the Adjusters? Do you truly appreciate what it means to have a fragment of absolute and infinite Deity, the Universal Father, indwelling and merging your finite mortal nature?_” [UB 107:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p4_7) if we will?

In this workshop we will seek together to learn how not to interfere with their work, but rather to let God do His work through us, His beloved sons and daughters.

**True Freedom**
Yannick Fioamore, Quebec

Explore the concepts of personal freedom as presented in “The Urantia Book.”

I will try to demonstrate how humans are all connected and that we are one. Using concrete examples (everyday acts that seem trivial to us), I will lead the audience to understand that in order to be responsible and part of an evolved society, their freedom stops where it restricts that of another.

Hoping that we will be able to find solutions that will allow us to act responsibly towards our brothers and sisters, and this on a daily basis.

**Spiritual life and daily reality**
_Robert Ezri, Quebec_

And Jesus said to Nathaniel: “Nathanael, our mission is to help men solve their spiritual problems and thus quicken their minds...” 148:5.4.

Can sustained spiritual growth influence the course of daily life?

As mortals we have everything we need to solve our problems; God who is omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent wants to partner with us. The ball is now in our court!

**The Human and the Divine: Partners in the Supreme**
_Marc Belleau, Quebec_

Our partnership with God consists primarily of two things: Being and Doing. In this workshop we will explore these two facets of our journey and see how they simplify the understanding of concepts related to the Supreme, particularly by relating them to activities in our daily lives. To do this, the workshop will consist of work periods, group reflection time, sharing of personal experiences and presentations.

**Divine Administration of Human Progression at the Planetary Level**
_Francine Fortin, Quebec_

Human experience is based on the following process: one's inner being is based on consciousness and personality, and one's social being is based on one's environment and living environment.

The aim of this workshop is to better understand, through each person's personal experience, the concrete implication of the Divine that inhabits us.

**A Return to Love: Expressing Agape Love — A Ladder to Heaven Even on Earth**
_Guy Perron, Quebec_

It is in loving others that we meet along the way that we best express our love for our Universal Father...depending on the type of love we manifest, is it selfish or selfless? Do I know that there are many levels of love?

Join us in this interactive morontia workshop where we will share some tips on how to improve the way we love and therefore the way we give and live.

---

<ins>Saturday and Sunday</ins> will also honour participants with _Kaye Cooper from the United States_ and her speech, “**Human Dignity**”, followed by _Doreen Heyne from the United States_ with “**The Art of Living**” and _Richard Lachance from Quebec_ with “**The Spiritual Framework**”.

<ins>Sunday morning</ins> we will hear from _Sue Tennant from English Canada_ with her presentation, “**Revealing Ourselves to God through Service**,” and we will conclude with _Jeffrey Wattles from the United States_ with his lecture, “**Our Cosmic Adventure and the Supreme Being**.”

In these two days of program, there will be more than 25 workshops in English which will be described in the printed program for congress participants, just like those you have just read in French.

This program was designed and developed by a handful of Quebec servants who have been touched by the fifth revelation and who are looking forward to meeting you at this exceptional event. $\square$

## Editor's note

_Normand Laperle,_
_Editor in Chief_

**Réflectivité**
**is taking a break in August.**

Exceptionally, Réflectivité will be closed in August.

**We would like to know your impressions of the congress** (...or anything else).

“A word never dies,” said the Innu poet Joséphine Bacon. I would add: “and even more so when it is shared.”

We always appreciate receiving your ideas in Réflectivité. Make yourself known by sharing them with us.

**We want to hear from you and read from you**. It is “you” who make Réflectivité live.

> “Land is the stage of society; men are the actors. And man must ever adjust his performances to conform to the land situation. The evolution of the mores is always dependent on the land-man ratio. This is true notwithstanding the difficulty of its discernment. Man’s land technique, or maintenance arts, plus his standards of living, equal the sum total of the folkways, the mores. And the sum of man’s adjustment to the life demands equals his cultural civilization.” ([UB 68:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p5_1))

## Did you know that?

**Every time you buy a “Urantia Book” (and others)** through the AUQ website, you arrive on Amazon, and the latter returns a small percentage (3 to 4%) of the amount of your purchase to the Urantia Association simply because you went through the AUQ website to get to Amazon.

Pass this on to all your friends who want to buy one of these books.
