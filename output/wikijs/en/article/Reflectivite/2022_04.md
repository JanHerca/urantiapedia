Hello readers and friends of the association,

Spring has finally arrived and many of us welcome this season with joy and pleasure in seeing nature awaken. For many, spring means the renewal of life. It is a season full of meanings that can draw their sources from the spiritual outlook we have on the seasons and the renewal of life. An endless cycle that manifests itself in many forms ranging from the material to the spiritual.

We often compare our lives to the seasons, of which many of us are now in the fall and some have begun to experience winter. As readers and students of the teachings of The Urantia Book, this analogy of the seasons to the cycles of life might awaken in us some awareness of the importance of the time given to us in order for our lives to have increasing spiritual meaning.

How did we feel when we discovered ***The Urantia Book***? Was it not like a renewal in our lives; a spiritual springtime when we emerged from the torpor of spiritual winter dormancy? Let us recall the joy and enthusiasm we felt while reading it. We were probably like those birds returning after a long migratory journey and sharing their joy with their morning song. But, quite quickly, we realized that our song of joy was not often received with the same openness that we had had when we discovered ***The Urantia Book***.

Have we stopped singing our joy? Have we lost our enthusiasm when our parents and friends refuse to take an interest in our discovery? Have we realized that perhaps we do not always have the right words and especially the right notes to express our spiritual joy? We must remember what the revelators say in the directives they issued in the [Publication Mandate](/en/article/The_Publication_Mandate): “_This Book is given to those who are ready for it, long before the day of its world mission. Thousands of study groups are to be organized.” “An early publication of the Book has been offered so that it may be available for the training of leaders and teachers_.”

To many ears, your singing may not interest them. A song is well received when the ears that hear it are eager for its message. But there are many ways to sing, and we must adapt our songs to the times in which we live. If we were to hear songs from the future, we would probably find them odd, because our consciousness would not be sufficiently evolved to perceive these new meanings of melody. There is a season for every time, and for us readers of _The Urantia Book_, we are in the springtime of revelation.

We must prepare the world for the coming season, so we must put in place the foundations and means necessary for the revelation to become a spiritual springtime for all. “_You must encourage your souls to be patient. You are associated with a revelation of truth that is part of the natural evolution of religion in this world._” ([Publication Mandate](/en/article/The_Publication_Mandate)). The time that is given to us, those privileged to discover _The Urantia Book_, must be used to prepare us to better share these teachings. The study groups that are being created throughout the world and the various Internet schools of The Urantia Book are means that are offered to us to learn to better live the teachings and share them.

The Urantia Association of Quebec provides you with a wide range of resources to help you better understand and serve the revelation. Visit our website at this address [www.urantia-quebec.org](www.urantia-quebec.org). Under the **Study Groups** tab, I have added video presentations on study groups to help those who would like to start or join a study group. [https://www.urantia-quebec.ca/groupes-etude/videos-pour-groupes-etudes](https://www.urantia-quebec.ca/groupes-etude/videos-pour-groupes-etudes). Also, under the **Education** tab, you will find information on the **Ambassador School** with its course, _The Ministry of the Master_.

In closing, I congratulate André Pominville, new vice-president and Claudette Gonthier, secretary for their election to these two positions at our annual general meeting on March 12. Thank you for your commitment to serving revelation in Quebec.

So, enjoy your spiritual spring and don't wait until winter before taking action.

To love is to serve

## Remembrance Dinner on April 6, Jesus among us

The Remembrance Supper is a symbolic meeting with Jesus every April 6 since 2017.

The tradition continues. Let us gather in small groups to share a bite to eat in memory of Jesus, to share our impressions of his life and his incomparable teachings and what he left in our hearts. Let us celebrate with friends, with family members or with our study group. For where two or three are gathered in his name, there he is.

The Remembrance Supper is the believer's meeting with Michael [UB 179:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_6)

I ask the host of this evening to send me his impressions to share with our brothers in a future newsletter.

## _The Urantia Book_ as a revelation

<figure id="Figure_4" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Reflectivite/Samuel_Heine_3.jpg">

_Samuel Heine_
Reunion Island

For me personally, I increasingly see ***The Urantia Book*** as a revelation that allows us to emerge from the foggy ignorance concerning our origins, our destiny, the purpose of existence, the Creator God and his will, the cosmic hierarchy and organization, the life and teachings of Jesus highlighted and his true identity revealed.

I think this makes things much clearer, it allows us to have a cosmic overview of our ascending and eternal career (beyond our planet earth). It is not always realized that the faith of men based on the information they had in the Bible or the Quran was very vague and unclear on these questions essential to the development of a balanced faith and a coherent vision that integrates us into the whole of God, cosmically speaking.

Thanks to Revelation and the method of Progressive Divine Wisdom, things become very clear (or should normally become so; _what is well conceived is clearly stated_).

This is truly a blessing that should fill us with joy, enthusiasm and wonder in faith and living service.

We can explain to our fellow men in very simple words that today we have received information from above that explains in detail everything for which we had no explanations and answers.

Once again on a personal level, without exaltation and with a loving gentleness linked to more balance and maturity, I talk about it more and more around me and I see the extraordinary results.

In all fraternal simplicity without entering into complicated and overly intellectual turns of phrase.

Concerning creatures, the worlds of creation and God the Creator, many things have become clear, simple and consistent.

We can talk about it around us as long as there is listening and a little curiosity. We do not need to talk about the _Urantia Book_ to share what we have received.

## Hypotheses about Paradise Island

<figure id="Figure_5" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">

> . . . ***Motion is not inherent on Paradise; it is volitional. But the concept of distance, even absolute distance, has very much meaning as it may be applied to relative locations on Paradise. Paradise is nonspatial; hence its areas are absolute.*** They therefore render many kinds of services which are beyond the concepts of the mortal mind. ([UB 11:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p2_11))

The part I put in bold has always left me wondering, and for many years I have wondered what the revelators wanted me to understand! So, I share with you my thoughts on this subject.

### Static, Dynamic and Paradise

The revelators tell us that the Universal Absolute unifies and coordinates the dynamic infinity of Total Deity and the static infinity of the Unqualified Absolute ([UB 0:3.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p3_21)). Paradise being undeified, non-personal, non-living, but eternal and absolute, I could almost see it as static since it is unchanging except for its lower Paradise activities. Paradise is a super machine created by the Father controlling the energy levels and representing all the absolute potential of cosmic reality in order to free it from the limitations of infinity ([UB 11:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p2_10)). It is the opposite of what the Eternal Son is, the absolute person of pure spirit, freeing the Father from absolute personality. Paradise exists without time and has no location in space ([UB 11:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p2_10)). How can I imagine this? Paradise is the abode of the Paradise Deities ([UB 11:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p1_1)), where all gravity circuits of all kinds converge ([UB 11:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p1_4)). Only beings perfect in spirit can access it. In the area of the Most Holy Sphere of high Paradise, where the presence of the Deities is found, no material structure or intellectual creation could exist, only that of the highest spirit ([UB 11:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p3_1)).

### Spatial condition of the mind

As finite beings, we are familiar with time and space. However, for spirit beings, it is quite different. Spiritual patterns exist only in relation to space. They do not occupy or displace space, nor do they contain it ([UB 118:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p3_7)). Could this statement explain the fact that Heaven, although material, has a location in the universe, but no position in space [UB 0:4.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p4_12)?

### Physical Nature of Heaven

Paradise is composed of a single form of materialization called absolutum. This matter is neither dead nor alive; it is the original non-spiritual expression of the First Source-Center ([UB 11:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p2_9)). The non-spiritual here makes the opposition between what is spiritual, conscious, even personal. According to this logic, Paradise not being spiritual, it would behave in a manner similar to spiritual models that do not occupy or move space. This characteristic would explain the fact that Paradise is non-spatial, but absolute. It therefore becomes possible to imagine that on its surface the distances are relative. Since movement is not inherent in Paradise, without the presence of a personality implementing any movement, everything is static there, like the Unqualified Absolute associated with the functions of the lower Paradise.

### A practical application on the surface of Paradise

This particular situation on the Eternal Isle provides possibilities unimaginable here below. Let us imagine that I am in Paradise and in charge of organizing an exhibition of the human history of Urantia. I set up my booths in the allotted area, but a sudden arrival of additional information graciously provided by the universal reflectivity service requires the installation of vast stages to illustrate human life in all ages. No problem since the initially allotted area is absolute, the simple fact of needing additional space, this space exists.

Another example of the strange aspect of being in Paradise concerns movement. I am on the outskirts of Paradise on the south side and would like to go to the Most Holy area to worship my Father. Being a finaliter and now a being of a spiritual nature, simply by desiring to go to that location, I am there instantly. I do not move since space does not exist in Paradise. I am where I need to be for the intended function.

Am I wrong? I don't know, but I'll tell you about it when I get back from Paradise!

> All this concept of atonement and sacrificial salvation is rooted and grounded in selfishness. Jesus taught that *service* to one’s fellows is the highest concept of the brotherhood of spirit believers. Salvation should be taken for granted by those who believe in the fatherhood of God. The believer’s chief concern should not be the selfish desire for personal salvation but rather the unselfish urge to love and, therefore, serve one’s fellows even as Jesus loved and served mortal men. ([UB 188:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p4_9))

## The School of Ambassadors

<figure id="Figure_6" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/Reflectivite/Ambassadeurs.jpg">
</figure>

**The Ambassador School** of THE CHRIST EXPERIMENT is the premier school of ministry, designed to equip readers of The Urantia Book with the skills necessary to effectively disseminate the fifth epochal revelation.

Comments from a student...

“I did not expect what I found when I took the “Ministry of the Master” courses. I am always looking for ways to communicate the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. It has been an adventure for me to learn new ways of doing things, just as Jesus did. It has helped me gain a different perspective on how to communicate with people who are not familiar with the ***Bible*** or ***The Urantia Book***.”

## Virtual Conference — The Spiritual Quest: God in Question(s)

Presented by _Mamadou Doudou Diagne_

Sunday, April 10 from **<ins>noon to 2 p.m.</ins>**

https://us02web.zoom.us/j/82154579457

God is not evident to human consciousness. And yet, we want to believe in Him, to know Him, and even to make Him known. This is why we must enter into a search, a quest, a spiritual quest by which we must make the effort to question God(s).

## Study groups

This activity allows several readers of different levels of understanding to exchange and study together the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. It promotes spiritual progress by allowing its participants to find practical applications to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ in their daily lives. This important step helps to maintain a broad perspective on concepts of truth.
