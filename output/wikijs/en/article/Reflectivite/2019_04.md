## Word from the President

_Line St-Pierre_
president@urantiaqc.org

Finally, spring has arrived and with it, the association invites you to some meetings prepared expressly for its readers and students of revelation.

In 2017, I invited you to participate in a new tradition, the Remembrance Supper, which has taken hold in certain study groups in Quebec, but also in many other places on the planet, particularly among students of the Urantia Book and all those who love Jesus, because many people know him and many other creeds study him.

This participation in the supper of remembrance was suggested by the authors of the site _The Christ Experiment_. It is during this meeting that we take the time to remember what the master is for us and to share a meal in all fraternity. This meeting takes place on April 6 each year in communion of souls in the world. “_For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them._”

These same people have developed a training, “Developing Leaders and Teachers of the Gospel of Jesus as Amplified in the Fifth Epochal Revelation,” which as you can read will be given in English starting May 1st. You can visit their website [www.Thechristexperiment.org](http://www.thechristexperiment.org/) for more information.

Beginning April 15, you can register for a free course in the Urantia Book Internet School (UBIS) https://new.ubis.urantia.org/moodle/ provided by the Foundation and facilitated in a caring manner by people who will accompany you in the process throughout this training. Registration begins Monday, April 15 on the Urantia Book Internet School website: https://new.ubis.urantia.org/moodle/.

From now on, the Annual General Meeting (AGM) will be held in April, on the 27th this year, to better facilitate travel for everyone who comes from all over the province to attend. This meeting will take place at the Hôtel le Dauphin in Drummondville.

**At the same location on May 26th** you are invited to the **thematic day** “_Religious experience, personal — practical_”, where you will be able to hear the speakers' presentations and participate in the afternoon discussions.

Your servants are preparing **the next <ins>Quebec Congress</ins>** which will be held from **<ins>August 9 to 11</ins>** at the **<ins>Villa St-Martin in Pierrefonds</ins>** in the suburbs of Montreal, with the theme: “_Le Suprême and I — partners in experience_”. We will keep you informed of all developments on this subject on the web page that will be published in mid-April with the related information.

## Annual General Meeting (AGM)

_Robert Cadieux_
secretaire@urantiaqc.org

Hello everyone, At the beginning of each year we are invited to attend our Annual General Meeting which will now be held in April, thus avoiding the complications of the weather for road conditions which were occasionally difficult in February.

**Date: Saturday, April 27, 2019**

**Location**: Hotel “ Le Dauphin ”, 600 Boul. Saint-Joseph, Drummondville, QC, J2C 2C1

Your presence is highly requested. Coming in large numbers invigorates and encourages us in our support of the Urantia movement and our hope of seeing religious renewal dawn in our society and for all the countries and peoples of our planet.

The morning will be devoted to the agenda of the general assembly and the election of the president and treasurer; then the afternoon will also be stimulating because we will discuss ways to update/activate our actions to communicate, person to person, our new actions, always renewed in the present; the revelation of the divine spirit that inhabits the human mind.

Where is the Urantia movement in the state of development of societies on our world?

We are the custodians of the text of the latest religious revelation to the humans of our planet, and we are becoming increasingly aware of its importance as societies advance rapidly technologically and politically while religions of authority advance slowly. _The Urantia Book_ warns us against advancing too rapidly for the assimilative capacity of common religious growth; against discarding old concepts without adopting better and higher ideals.

In view of this consciousness, we know nevertheless that we must participate in the emancipation of religious consciousness which is: “_a sincere effort to reach the border region of spirit consciousness — contact with the divine presence. Such an experience constitutes God consciousness_”. <a id="a63_292"></a>[UB 196:3.34](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_34)

This is a desirable theme to develop during the afternoon group discussions.

Thank you in advance for your participation.

## Membership 2019

_Marc Belleau_
treasurer@urantiaqc.org

Hello everyone,

Already the month of April and our AGM will be held on Saturday, April 27, 2019!

I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that it is time to send your annual membership fee payment.

Send your check to the following address: Association Urantia du Québec, 569 Francine, Ste-Sophie, QC, J5J 2H7, — or go to the Association website (http://urantia-quebec.ca/devenir_membre.php) to pay using PayPal (you do not need to have a PayPal account).

The cost of membership is $60 for the member and friend member categories.

I would like to emphasize the importance of supporting your association, because it allows us, among other things, to manage the multiple organizational aspects, whether it is the book sending program in Africa, the maintenance and updating of the website, the organization of themes, the printing of newsletters and various promotional documents for The Urantia Book.

Without your financial help, it is impossible to carry out all the projects put forward by the AUQ. Take a few moments to send your payment and at the same time, why not make a small donation!

## What's new on the AUQ website

It is now possible to transfer money directly from your bank account to that of the Urantia Association of Quebec.

Whether it is paying your annual membership, sending a donation, or paying for your registration for an activity organized by your association, Interac transfer remains the safest, simplest and least expensive solution. It is no longer necessary to use a security question to make your transfer, the amount is directly deposited into the association's account.

Simply write, **in the field** “**Recipient**” the address tresorier@urantiaqc.org and we will be notified that a deposit has been made. Don't forget to write the reason for the transfer **in the field “Comments”** to explain the transfer of funds.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Marc Belleau at tresorier@urantiaqc.org.

## The 2019 congress: a very special invitation!

The AUQ is pleased to invite you to the **“The Supreme and I, Partners in Experience”** conference which will take place this summer **from August 9 to 11, 2019 at the Villa Saint-Martin in Montreal**. It will be an opportunity to meet, to fraternize, but above all, to reflect on this somewhat unknown Deity that is the Supreme. Who is this being whose personality resides in Paradise and whose power accumulates in the great universe? What is his function, his reason for being? What is our relationship with him? What links us to this mysterious being, but very present and active in the universe? He is certainly essential to our life since we draw our existence and all that we are from the potentials that he makes available to us. Without him, we could not exist and even less grow. It is in our best interest to know and understand him.

Several activities are organized during these 2 days of congress. Conferences, discussion workshops, plenary sessions, musical activities, fraternal meetings are on the agenda, all this, in the enchanting setting of **Villa Saint-Martin, north of Montreal, directly on the banks of the Rivière-des-Prairies**.

For this occasion, **we will have the visit of African and Haitian readers and speakers**. They will come to share their thoughts on the Supreme Deity and tell us about the progress of the Urantia movement in their country. It will be interesting to listen to the story of the challenges they must face in an environment completely different from ours. A great opportunity to learn a little more about the life and culture of our colleagues.

Personally, I'm really looking forward to hearing them. Get your questions ready!

For more information, visit the AUQ website. We look forward to seeing you in large numbers!

**Location**: Villa Saint-Martin, 9451, Gouin boul. West, Montreal, H8Y 1T2

## The Book and Me

_Johanne Seguin_
_St-Adolphe d'Howard, QC_

The Book and I met in 1976 on the corner of a coffee table at a complete stranger's house. I was 17 years old. I had already been searching for spirituality for two years, sailing in this exceptional era of “Peace and Love” where the world was opening up. I had friends who were returning from India, transformed. Others who were leaving here and there in search of freedom. I myself lived in the spirit of the times, my head and heart attached to my soul, no longer touching the ground. Nothing held me back, matter did not interest me, only the spirit mattered. I read the Bhagava-Gita, the Tibetan Book of the Dead, the Bible, Shri Aurobindo, etc.

Today I consider myself privileged to have been born at that time and in that region of the world when we were freeing ourselves from taboos, outdated ideas and beliefs. As a woman, I took full advantage of this space that made me an independent and freedom-loving person.

The Urantia Book, Cosmogony, has been a wise counselor, a comfort, and a guide in my tumultuous life. You never really let go since then, but even after many readings, each time it was as if I was learning something new, as if we were both evolving together.

At the time, as I did not know English, I was unaware of its history and the existence of the Foundation. It was only in 2004 when my eldest son found a small ad in a local newspaper that I got in touch with the Association through Gaétan and Line. I worked with them for about ten years... What adventures; Vice-president, President, conferences, congresses, seminars. A decade of growth at breakneck speed.

At the same time, I was raising my family alone. I was studying, working as a nurse and manager, buying a house that I renovated, building 5 gardens... I won't mention the painful moments I went through, which some of me witnessed. Through all of this, I reconnected with matter, to live a more balanced life. A precarious balance, I admit, because I had to make heartbreaking choices to avoid exhaustion at the end of my baccalaureate in 2015. I retreated into my forest to recharge my batteries.

I also put aside The Urantia Book for a year... I needed to find myself again, to see now what I could do with all that. I wanted to no longer let the interpretations of others influence me and to listen to my own voice, that of my soul.

And I looked at the state of our planet, I became eager for international politics, environmental issues, I watched our world evolve. I became more aware of my diet, my ethical choices and the ecological footprint that I was leaving for future generations. I became an activist and a militancy. I can already see a new era dawning. Religions are being put in the dock for all the abuses and inconsistencies for which they are responsible. Corruption is being exposed, humans are busy recovering from their mistakes; it is one minute to midnight for the planet. Moral values are no longer the preserve of religions and philosophy, but are becoming intrinsic to our survival; the survival of our species.

The new prophets are environmentalists, agroecologists. The sanctuary is in the preservation of the beauty of the world. We return to the essential, the materialistic era is coming to an end, the spirit and sensitivity of many are refined. Our heroes are Pierre Rabhi, Greta Thunberg, David Suzuki.

I myself am only a hummingbird who can only put out fires one drop at a time.

I often remember a saying from Michael that went something like this: it is not those who are well who need a doctor, but those who are ill.

Life has brought me close to those who are doing badly; the most destitute, the most damaged, the most vulnerable.

I don't know about you who are reading this, but for me nothing is ever a given. I expect more from myself, I hope to do more than I already do. I try to reason with myself, to let go, to live in the present moment, but there is an impulse greater than me that regularly pushes me and I tell myself in the end that it must be the call of the infinite that feels very cramped in the finite.

I am happy to reconnect with you Urantia brotherhood and I look forward to seeing you again. I will happily join the conference this summer... I have only good memories of Villa St-Martin.

I say see you soon and may God bless you.
