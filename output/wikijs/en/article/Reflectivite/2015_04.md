## A word from the president

_Maurice Migneault_
_AUQ President_
urantiamaurice@gmail.com

In The Urantia Book, the themes of welcome, hospitality, and attitudes aimed at welcoming others are omnipresent. Consider, for example, Van's efforts to prepare the first Garden: “_Eighty-three years before the arrival of Adam and Eve, that they devote themselves to the proclamation of their advent and to the preparation of a garden home for their reception._” <a id="a22_364"></a>[UB 73:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/73#p2_2)

Let us think of the preparation for our arrival on Jerusem: “_The reception of a new class of mansion world graduates is the signal for all Jerusem to assemble as a committee of welcome._” <a id="a24_189"></a>[UB 47:10.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p10_1)

There are examples of this throughout the Book. This shows how important it is to develop this attitude, an essential function for good teamwork.

This coming summer, we will be hosting a major event; the _Triennial Congress of Urantia Association International_. For this occasion, we will offer participants a hospitality service coordinated by Louise Renaud and Gilles Bertrand of Quebec.

Thank you to all those who have offered to host readers from abroad for a few days in order to better share our respective cultures. And thank you to those who have the deep desire to do so, but who are prevented from doing so by specific reasons.

If you wish to participate in this program, you can contact Gilles Bertrand or Louise Renaud: tel.: 418-871-4564 email address: fidoquebec@gmail.com $\square$

## Editor's note

_Normand Laperle,_
_Editor in Chief_

**New AUQ website**

From now on, the problems of accessing Reflectivities are over. The AUQ has its new website at the following address: http://www.urantiaquebec.ca. Visit it. It is very beautiful. It is worth the detour.

You can also access Reflectivities directly via the following address:

http://www.urantia-quebec.ca/publications_reflectivite.php

Some people lead by example. I would like to thank Gaétan Charland for the hours he does not count, for the creation of this site ... and for the cause of “The Urantia Book”. I would add a special mention to his wife Line StPierre who also contributes, in an exceptional and selfless way, to this process.

**New Header for Réflectivité**

At the same time, the header of your monthly Réflectivité (at the top of page 1) has been changed. It was created by Gaétan Charland.

Well done Gaétan! Great work!

**Your Réflectivité is missing items**

Do you have an inspiration that you would like to share with your fellow Urantia Book members? Now is the best time to let it go.

Why? Because we don't have a single article left in the bank (not even a short text) for the May 2015 issue of Réflectivité.

## FAMILY AND SPIRITUALITY

_Conrad Lavallee_
_Gatineau_

At the Urantia Association International Convention this summer, we will be discussing the theme of the spiritual unity of the family. Here is a transcription, still relevant, of a text by Conrad Lavallée, published in Réflectivité, more than thirty years ago, in Vol. 2, Numbers 1, Spring 1984.

Let us pause for a moment to realize the importance of family and family relationships as an evolutionary experience.

- The family is the major context of the main problems, the main sources of joy, in short, the main concerns of our contemporaries.
- The family is a concrete material reality, but there is a spiritual and divine counterpart to this material reality.
- The earthly family is included in the spiritual family, of which it is the initial evolutionary milestone.
- The spiritual family: what is most important, both in time and in eternity.
- The family is a living dynamic reality whose members change and reproduce. It has an actual dimension, but also a potential dimension.
- It is to this potential dimension of the family, to this tension between the actual and the potential, that the fundamental aspirations of most people are linked.
- The evolutionary episodes of birth and death are included historically and constitutively, within, at the heart of family reality.
- Family reality enriches the concept of fulfillment with God as Universal Father and broadens the horizon of our interpersonal relationships to the whole universe, in time and in eternity, through universal Brotherhood.
- The spiritual family is a living, eternal dynamic reality. The episodes that concern it are cycles of spiritual accomplishment, experiential perfection, divine union, and cosmic realization. There is the initial anchoring in eternal life and the attainment of destiny in the successive ages or cycles of the Universe of Universes.
- In the earthly family we know that a Father is proud and happy to see his own children accomplish something that he would be proud to accomplish himself. And what can we say now, except that the human being is more than a mere instrument in the accomplishment of the divine will; he is a son of God.
- We can learn to live our present life fully and from this wonderful and very current perspective of eternal life.
- We can build, work and serve people at the level of interpersonal ties (family, in the narrow and broad sense) which have a potential for eternity, an impact on eternal life, to experientially bring out the supreme values of goodness, beauty and truth whose sum, substance is equivalent to LOVE. $\square$

## Our Father

(meditative version)

_Eric Tarissan_
_Quebec_

**Our Father**, thank you for being the Father of ALL, the Father of all our brothers and sisters in the universe;
**who art in heaven**, thank you for living in each of us, in our higher mind and making it possible to rise there;
**hallowed be thy name**, thank you for being both the Creator of ALL and for being the eternal destiny of ALL and ALL;
**let your kingdom come**, thank you for being able to participate, through my significant decisions, in the expansion of your Kingdom, in the advent of your reign by giving back your light, your conscience and your love;
**thy will be done**, thank you for this free will through which I choose to do your Will by giving you back, by bringing you closer to my brothers and sisters, and by bringing them closer to you by learning to love them;

**Thank you for refreshing each of our souls with your water of life** by living in each of us, thus co-creating our soul;

**Give us this day our daily bread, thank you for giving me today all these opportunities to serve my brothers and sisters, thus nourishing and building our soul by living and tasting more and more your light, your conscience and your love by giving them back;

**Please forgive my shortcomings** as I myself have already forgiven all those who have had shortcomings towards me or towards my brothers;

**Thank You Father for freeing me from temptation** by making it possible to rise higher and higher in Your presence and consciousness, always choosing to turn to You by freeing me and saving me from all evil;

**Thank You Father for delivering me from evil**, by freeing me through faith on a sevenfold level (freeing me from material shackles, from intellectual slavery, from spiritual blindness, from the incompleteness of the self, from this belligerent self, from psychological time and from the finite); making it possible to grow towards You in Your Peace, Joy and Love further and further away from temptation, self-image, defense mechanisms and any identification other than You, thus allowing me to realize my personality and become more and more real and authentic;

**Thank You, Father, for making it possible to become more and more perfect as You Yourself are perfect,** by doing Your will, thus co-creating our soul, realizing our personality, and progressing endlessly toward You. For I have made the total, irrevocable, and final decision to transfer my increasingly unified individuality from this body, from this material mind, into our soul (mine and Yours, dear Adjuster), whereby we shall merge in God's time and become a real and active universe personality: a cosmic citizen, a true man of God.

So be it $\square$

## My Meditative Techniques

_Normand Laperle_
_Lévis_

There are several meditation techniques. I have experimented with a few of them. Then, I ended up personalizing them. I also sometimes try to invent methods.

I find that each meditative method gives a different result. As a result, when I sit down to meditate, I then decide which method I am going to use according to my need at that moment.

### EXPLORATORY TEST

The following test was revealing for me. I sat in silence. I closed my eyes. I made inner silence. I waited... Without any expectation.

I repeated this experiment several times. It always gave the same result. Nothing ever happened. I always stayed in the same place in my mental space. In other words, this method got me nowhere.

I deduced that if I don't make an effort to move within myself, my center of consciousness will not move. If I don't lift the sails, I won't move forward. Without goals, I get nowhere.

The mind **must be given direction**, even if only in expectation.

**Today** my two favorite meditation methods are:

### MEDITATE TO FEEL PRESENT

This form of meditation is sometimes called “emptying the mind.” I have never noticed any “emptiness” inside me. Rather, I have noticed that **the mind no longer imposes itself** as my center, as what is most important inside me. My mind loses its dominant character and only transmits information. This is why I believe that this form of meditation is useful as an anti-stress, anti-depressive, anti-panic.

Ultimately I discover that the mind is not the person. By being centered in the mind I lose the “I” in me, my “center,” my “person.”

**Here is my method**

The purpose of this method is not to talk to the Adjuster or even have Him talk to me. The purpose is only to feel “the contact” and “feel in the presence.” That's all!

**What “presence” are we talking about?**

I remember moments when I felt inspired. A moment when the current was flowing. This memory is a landmark for me.

It is the feeling of this moment of inspiration that I will try to rediscover, but this time in a meditative state.

It is important to distinguish within me, **the observer** and the observed. As for the observer; the word says it, it is the part of me that observes; where my center is located, my center of consciousness. **The observed** is the part of me that I observe, what my attention is focused on.

I also want to talk briefly about “levels of consciousness.” The Urantia Book sometimes uses the terms “mental level,” “spiritual level,” “spirit level” as levels that one is meant to discover and experience internally. These can be thought of as “inner zones.”

At my humble little level of existence, here in matter, I can distinguish these different levels within myself, even if I imagine it is in a very limited way. I also understand, and feel, that there is a gradation within each of these levels. I also notice that I can move the observer that I am (my “center of consciousness”) from one level to another, even if it is in a “very” limited way. Try it! You should notice at least a little movement.

From this explanation, it will be easy to understand that I divide my inner world into three parts: my <ins>mind</ins>, my <ins>soul</ins> (these are my two dwelling places), and the <ins>Adjuster</ins> who inhabits me. The first thing I do, when I sit down to meditate, is to check my inner position. Is the observer in his **mind** (searching for solutions, reasoning, feelings, memories of all kinds ...), in my **soul** (personal growth concepts, ideals ...), or in contact with the spirit of the **Adjuster** who inhabits me (high-level inspirations at an eternal tangent)? Where am I? Most of the time, I am in my mind. No matter where I am, I begin to **gently move** the observer (my “center of consciousness”) **to the next levels**. I move...

I regularly check my inner position. If I started in the lower mental, after a while I will “feel” that I have reached the higher mental. Then I will feel that I am crossing into the soul (a zone clearly distinct from the mental, and **more neutral**). When I feel in the upper part of my soul zone, the “contact” is imminent...

When the “contact” is made, I know it. It is impossible to miss. The intense feeling of **mental neutral** is much stronger than in the soul level. There is a powerful current that passes. I feel a presence, with whom I am in contact, as if it were from one person to another.

My only goal is to stay in this place as long as possible. I repeat that I don't want to talk, and I don't want to be talked to. I just want to “feel present.”

### MEDITATE TO GET ANSWERS

This method is probably closer to what Jesus practiced. A kind of intimate dialogue between him and the heavenly Father. Jesus asked us to communicate with the Father who lives within us, in our own words, in complete intimacy.

This method has the advantage of being very simple.

**The purpose of this method**

The purpose of this method is to establish a constructive inner dialogue with none other than the indwelling Adjuster (the Father), about our personal lives and whatever concerns us.

> “_16. Jesus taught his followers that, when they had made their prayers to the Father, they should remain for a time in silent receptivity to afford the indwelling spirit the better opportunity to speak to the listening soul._” (<a id="a176_231"></a>[UB 146:2.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p2_17))

**The technique**

I sit, in silence, in a quiet place, which does not draw attention to anything in particular.

I let my mind wander as it pleases, while being on the lookout for the reception of constructive ideas.

I stare into space. I step out of complex logic. I taste the simple pleasure of existence. I completely detach myself from the weight of existence.

If I'm calm and receptive, it should sink in... I should have a nice little moment of intimacy.

For me it works.

### Conclusion

These two methods of meditation are complementary. One does not go without the other. The first method prepares the person to better use the second method.
