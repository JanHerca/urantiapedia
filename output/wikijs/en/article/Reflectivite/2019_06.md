## Word from the President

_Line St-Pierre_
president@urantiaqc.org

In this June 2019 Réflectivité, you will read the results of the 2018 activities of the Quebec Association and will be able to better familiarize yourself with what we do and what we wish to continue to do for readers and also to stimulate the appetite of other truth seekers.

Jesus said the harvest is great where are the harvesters? I have had this same reflection for several years. The desire to raise one's hand is lukewarm and we pray that other volunteers will put their shoulder to the wheel to advance the 5th revelation in the projects and activities that we have.

When a friend tells you: ...you really missed a good show last week; if you want to catch up, you can probably see that show again somewhere else in another city, but that's not the case when you miss a thematic meeting or any other meetings that we organize for you!

Last week, the turnout of readers in Drummondville was disappointing for the speakers who gave their time and heart in their superb presentation and disheartening for the event organizers.

Is it by reading a cookbook that we become a great cook, or by reading a medical book that we become a doctor? Does reading a spiritual book make us more spiritually advanced beings? Let us answer the question honestly.

Isn’t loving God and sharing our understanding of Him with people who read the same book part of brotherhood? What about our commitment to brotherhood?

As for a good show, let us be present in the lodges of the Urantia movement!

## Drummondville — Advocacy for growth

_Normand Laperle_
_Lévis_

The theme of the Drummondville theme this weekend (May 26, 2019) was: “***Personal religious experience - practice***”. By this title, I understand the spiritual experience that makes the soul grow with its direct impact on our lives.

If you were NOT there, I would like to try here to make you experience, through an inner contact, a little of the theme.

**<ins>Growth</ins>**

- **What<ins>pushes us to grow internally?</ins>**
- **What<ins>powers it?</ins>**

Stop for a moment. Close your eyes. **Go within.

Ask yourself: “What is it that motivates me to grow internally?”

To answer this question, do not rely on others, on books, **nor on the “Urantia Book”**. Do not look into what you already know.

Trust... your inner vision, your ability to “see” internally, the “observation”.

Place yourself in the very moment, the here and now. Search deep within yourself...

You are looking for a “drive”; the drive to live, the “drive to grow”. You let yourself be guided by sensations, by “feelings”. You are looking for the “inner contact”, the “experience” of growth. The words to describe what you will see will come later, after the inner discovery. Let yourself go into that. Take your time.

When you find it, you will have a sensation of “touching”... by awareness, as if you were rubbing against it.

**<ins>Sharing</ins>**

In Drummondville there was another experience to live. The experience of sharing. Sharing between people. Sharing what I am by MY simple presence and what the other is by HIS simple presence.

The more I discover myself - in the smallest corners - the more I discover that the other resembles me, the more I love myself and the more I love the other; which generates a drive towards the other, a desire to know and share.

“We humans” are surprisingly similar especially in our inner questions, problems and struggles; in our difficulties to resolve. We all have to go through the same inner trials. Where is all this going? We are moving towards mastery of what we are and become, by personal choice.

Which brings me to another realization: If others have the **same inner vulnerabilities** as me, the **same questions**; why not share our own vulnerabilities openly and help each other...between us? Decide to “**open up completely**” to the other. **Be totally transparent** in what I am. I accept myself. I love myself.

By exposing my vulnerability in an open way, I open myself, not only to the other, but also to myself. By exposing my vulnerability, the other will open his to me. Which opens up the opportunity for a spontaneous sharing-exchange with others at the level of being. We are all in the boat of **growth**.

How much more would our inner growth accelerate? There is more to gain than to lose. Let us not forget that inner growth is eternal. We must move towards this growth rather than resist it. Live, rather than survive.

It must be made a way of life.
In Drummondville, I saw beautiful sharing made by beautiful people through their vulnerability. I recognized myself in them. I feel united.

The real is beautiful.

Thank you for your openness to everyone who was there.

  - 14 books distributed in Ontario and the Canadian prairies.
  -To date, all federal prison institutions have received a copy of The Urantia Book.

### Study Group Committee

*Study Group Directory*

The Study Group Directory has been given a facelift with a new look and feel. It lists **over 480 study groups from around the world**, in multiple languages. There is also a **section for virtual study groups**, which have seen remarkable growth over the past two years; at last count, there were <ins>no fewer than eighty-four</ins>.

**Study Group Brochure**

A new study group brochure was created in 2018 and is expected to be published in multiple languages shortly. This brochure highlights the importance of study groups as a means of integrating and sharing the teachings of The Urantia Book.

**Guide for Study Groups**

The study group guide produced and published by Urantia Association International is currently being revised and an improved version is expected to be available by the end of 2019.

**Study Group Committee Meetings**

**Virtual meetings** for study group hosts were held **with a group of readers from Senegal** several times towards the end of 2018 and are continuing in 2019 **at a rate of one virtual meeting per month**. These meetings allow each participant to explore a variety of spiritual topics that can be used to improve the quality of study groups.

**Project for study groups**

Currently under consideration is the creation of **French webinars to help study group hosts** in improving the management of their group. One of these webinars has **already been produced in English and published on the Urantia Association International YouTube channel**.

**Internet component**

A blog designed and produced by a young reader from Quebec, Emmanuel Audy will soon be available on the association's website through a link that will be visible under the publications tab. This blog brings together the majority of articles published in the newsletter Réflectivité. These articles will be listed under different subjects and will be subject to advanced searches by theme.

### Another addition to our website

A **new tab** entitled “**Study Groups**” has been added to the association's website to highlight the importance of study groups in the mission of The Urantia Book. Within this tab, **five sections have been created** each reflecting a specific activity. Here they are in chronological order:

1. **Study Groups** — This section provides a description of what a study group is with the option to download a PDF document titled “<ins>Study Group Guide</ins>”
2. **Study Group Portal and Directory** — provides access to the link to access the study group portal on the internet. This directory was created in conjunction with Urantia Foundation, The Fellowship, and Urantia Association International <ins>to facilitate the search and discovery of study groups throughout the world</ins>.
3. **List of study groups** — provides a <ins>complete list of study groups available in Quebec</ins> and a <ins>list of potential groups</ins> that are looking for participants. Among these groups, there are some that combine two types of meetings, in person and virtual or one of both.
4. **Study Group Texts** — Here you will find <ins>some literature prepared by readers that can assist in the organization</ins>, management, quality, and effectiveness of study groups in learning the teachings of The Urantia Book.
5. **Study Group Videos** — directory of <ins>videos to aid in understanding certain concepts</ins> from the teachings of The Urantia Book.

In the tasks of this committee, Line also takes care of the mail and of making the **deposits of donations and contributions** of the members.

### Communications

- Line follows up on **correspondence from readers who write to the association's address**; routine telephone communications from readers requesting various information concerning _The Urantia Book_ or the Urantia Association of Quebec.

### Réflectivité

Every January, **a mass mailing of Réflectivité** is mailed to nearly 400 people in the database, to ensure that we maintain a connection with readers we don't hear from or see.

All this represents a considerable amount of work, the scale of which we are not aware of.
A big thank you to these dedicated workers.

## Did you know?

_Interesting quote:_

> “_Originally, the seraphim were definitely assigned to the separate Urantia races. But since the bestowal of Michael, they are assigned in accordance with human intelligence, spirituality, and destiny. Intellectually, mankind is divided into three classes:_” (<a id="a281_262"></a>[UB 113:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p1_2))

## Upcoming activities

**Michael’s Birthday — 2019**

_Come and fraternize..._

Sunday, **<ins>August 18</ins>**, 2019, 11am-3pm you are all invited to the feast of Jesus on **Mount Royal** — near **Beaver Lake**, between the **restaurant** and the paid parking lot (around $8 in 2018).

As usual you will just have to follow the directions with the **concentric circles** from the parking lot.

Bring your own food, chairs and musical instruments.

_Bertin Perron and Julien Audet._
