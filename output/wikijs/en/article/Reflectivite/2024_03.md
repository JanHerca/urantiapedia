Dear members and friends of the association,

Those of you who subscribe to our newsletter have recently received an invitation to complete a critical survey regarding the unification initiative between Urantia Book Fellowship and Urantia Association International. The purpose of this survey is to gather your valuable opinions and suggestions on the unification of these two entities, in order to facilitate the preparatory discussions that will begin shortly.

Towards the end of 2023, a petition initiated by Sue Seccombe, President of Urantia Book Fellowship, was sent to you. This petition, having collected over 650 signatures, led to the adoption of a resolution for the creation of a committee dedicated to organizational unity within Urantia Book Fellowship. This committee will be tasked with negotiating unification with Urantia Association International.

## Conference Spiritual unity and us

Sunday March 24 from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.

_Gaétan Charland, Quebec_

To participate in the meeting, click on the link below ten minutes before the 1 p.m. meeting.

https://us02web.zoom.us/j/81034771704

Although we have an idea of the definition of the word “unity,” we will explore the meanings of unity as spiritual, what it requires of us, lovers of this revelation, and how we can manifest this spiritual unity in our lives.

We will also examine why spiritual unity is fundamental to our organization and why, without it, organizational unity will not be achieved, which could compromise the success of our mission, the dissemination of _The Urantia Book_ and its wonderful teachings.

UBH BILL SADLER on BROADCASTING and SEPARATE READINGS of PART IV

Transcribed from a recording by David Kantor, Oklahoma City [May 20, 1961]

**BILL SADLER**: What I'm saying tonight is not a criticism. I'm simply sharing some thoughts with you, because, please, I've never been down this road before; I don't know how to do it.

**AUDIENCE MEMBER** [sardonically]: How many revelations have you released?

## On the importance of philosophy

_Francois Audet_
Gatineau

***The Urantia Book*** speaks often of philosophy, and this in all four parts of the book. The word “philosophy” appears 369 times, “philosopher” is found 64 times, and the adjective “philosophical” appears 123 times. For comparison, “mota” appears 40 times and “consciousness” 474 times.

Although one cannot swear to the importance of a concept by its number of occurrences, there is often a correlation. For philosophy, this importance is confirmed by numerous passages. We are told, among other things, that even after reaching Paradise, one will be instructed by primary supernaphim, masters of philosophy ([UB 27:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p6_1)): “Immediately after the supreme satisfaction of worship comes the rejoicing of philosophy. However high one rises and however far one advances, there remain a thousand mysteries that require recourse to philosophy when one attempts to resolve them.”

## My discovery of worship

Hello friends! In 2018 and after thirty years of reading and studying the _Urantia Book_ I realized that I had never been interested in worship. I read this word, worship, but I paid no attention to it even though it is found everywhere in the Book. I ended up understanding that I had prejudices against worship. I saw worship as something part of the old religions. A kind of submission to an authority like institutional religions. I tried to find another word that would suit me better like contemplation, admiration, wonder, etc. But in vain.

In my determined desire to understand what worship was (initially intellectually) I used the search engine and collected the passages from the Book that speak of worship. I added remarks and questions in blue. I began this process on a personal basis, but recently a friend suggested that I publish it.

Hello dear readers!

If there is a section of the _Urantia Book_ that is complex to understand, but nevertheless essential for the rest of the work, it is the introduction! Recently, I came across a simplified version given by William S. Sadler, Jr. several years ago. I thought it would be good to present it to you, because being written in simple and human words, the spiritual concepts of the revelators seem more accessible to me. For those who would like to consult the original text in English, you will find it at this [Web address](/en/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/A_Simplification_of_the_Foreword_to_The_Urantia_Book).

Treasurer tresorier@urantiaqc.org

Would you like to see your generous donation spreading the message of Jesus while serving a specific project?

I suggest you support the project to print the French version of the book “**The Untold Story of the Life of Jesus**”. We need $25,000 to print this book. To date, we have raised 25.53% of the funds, or $6,382.50. This beautifully illustrated book tells the story of the incarnational life of Jesus of Nazareth based on what is revealed to us in ***The Urantia Book***. You can make an Interac transfer using the following information: Urantia Association of Quebec with the treasurer's address, tresorier@urantiaqc.org. If you need help, do not hesitate to contact me by email. I will be happy to help you!

Fraternally!

This activity allows several readers of different levels of understanding to exchange and study together the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. It promotes spiritual progress by allowing its participants to find practical applications to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ in their daily lives. This important approach allows us to keep a broad point of view on the concepts of truth. You wish to participate or form a study group; we will be happy to assist you. If you wish to have your study group appear in this list, contact the person in charge, via email association.urantia.quebec@gmail.com or at 450-565-3323.
