## Word from the President

_Line St-Pierre_
president@urantiaqc.org

A chapter ended with the August congress where nearly forty students of the _Urantia Book_ met for a weekend at the Villa St-Martin in Pierrefonds to listen to speakers and share their thoughts and knowledge on the theme of the Supreme.

[See photos: http://urantia-quebec.ca/albums_photos.php.]

I noticed the arrival of new faces, others absent, faithful faces of students who follow the course of the events organized by the association. Beautiful friendships were formed and older ones were renewed.

Since the year 2000, I have participated in about thirty Urantia conferences around the world, and what I find most important is the connections I create with these people who have the same spiritual aspirations as me, to live these teachings as best as possible and to help others discover and deepen their relationship with God.

Applying these truths in our lives is what transforms us into living in accordance with the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of men, witnessing to the fruits of the spirit; loving and serving.

For the Board of Directors, a new chapter will begin at the end of the month, as we decide on the 2020 calendar of activities that will be published on the website. I invite you to visit our site where the filmed conferences and photos of the congress as well as those of the picnic have been added. I ask you to let me know your interests and projects for what the association could develop in 2020 and what you can bring to the AUQ.

On a personal note and one that may benefit all students of revelation who seek to do something with these magnificent teachings, I share this with you.

Last April I started an online course with the people at CHRISTEXPERIMENT.ORG who have developed a training called the Ministry of the Master. This school was formed to promote the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man, and the ministry of the Master is entirely dedicated to the edification of spirituality in the world.

Too often as readers of the Book we find ourselves promoting our good book by not respecting certain recommendations which are well indicated in the life and teachings of Jesus and frightening those to whom we speak about it by doing the opposite of what we want to accomplish.

The instigators of this training are four former Jehovah's Witnesses who have read and studied the Book in depth since the 1990s and who have led tens of thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses to read the fourth part of the UB by bridging what the Bible says about the teachings and what is written in The Urantia Book.

Between the four of them, they have 160 years of ministry experience and I assure you they are fantastic in their approach.

Here are the five most important links that have enlightened me the most in the decision to register for the training. When you click on the link, you will arrive on the English text and in the text you will find the FRENCH tab and the translated texts. The translation is done with GOOGLE TRANSLATION.

I was asked to translate the course because many interested people in the world only speak French. Their interest is to bring more light to those less enlightened by sharing the teaching as Jesus did by propagating the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of men.

I need help to make the French training available at the beginning of the year. Here is my address: line.stpierre@me.com.

## What a beautiful meeting it was

_Claudette Menard_
_Saint Lucia of the Laurentians_

What a wonderful meeting this 2019 congress was, on “_The Supreme and I, Partners of Experience_” at the Villa St Martin.

Three days filled with kindness, sharing of knowledge and experiences, love, in an environment where peace and beauty reign. Organizers and presenters who knew how to bring happiness and well-being to everyone.

Thank you to those who chose this theme, which made me grow in my understanding of the Supreme.

Line has already told me that reading the UB is important, and that participating in events is very valuable to complete the assimilation. I understood this weekend how right she was.

The united Urantian brotherhood is an unwavering force that shines with Love and Divine Light.

Thank you to each and every one of you, may divine peace grow and accompany us in our actions in order to carry out the Will of the Father, in the Supreme.

## Moment of gratitude

_Claudette Gonthier_
_Saint-Jerome_

I would like to highlight the colossal work of Line St-Pierre for the August 2019 congress and her team.

This congress was a success for the quality of the speakers and the conferences which allowed me to advance in my quest for spirituality by better understanding the Supreme Being.

By the choice of the place, the Villa Saint-Martin, a place imbued with prayer and peace. By the friendly fraternal atmosphere of all the participants which makes me say, “yes, we are all brothers and sisters”.

I left with sadness to have to leave friends who share the same quest, that of growing in perfection so that the Supreme Being grows in his perfection. We all work in partnership with the supreme.

I am grateful to be able to experience moments of emotion and prayer with these wonderful people.

Thank you, Heavenly Father, for making us who we are.

## AUQ Congress

_Johanne Seguin_
_St-Adolphe d'Howard_

The weekend of August 10th I participated in the Urantia Association of Quebec conference at Villa Saint-Martin. The theme was: “_The Supreme and I, Partner of Experience_”. It was indeed a supreme experience of fraternity for 3 days. It took off high and the landing was slow because I was so carried away by the love that circulated in this audience. That's when you realize the full force of everything and even if there were about forty of us you could multiply the fruits of the Spirit to the square. The speakers were superbly synchronized and at the same time so different in their approach from each other, but all contributed to a single goal: to express their experience of the Supreme and share it to edify. As much as I was drained by my year of work in mental health when I arrived there, I was filled and recharged by these three days. I realize the full power of brotherhood and its impact on my spiritual progress and I will henceforth devote more time to these privileged moments.

Thank you to the committee who works so hard to make these moments of grace possible.

## AUQ Congress 2019

_Claude Flibotte_
_Sainte-Julie_

I was present at the Urantia Association of Quebec conference which was held from August 9 to 11, 2019 at the Villa Saint-Martin.

What a magnificent experience lived during these three days in the company of brothers and sisters sharing the same spiritual ideology, namely the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of men put into action by and in the Supreme! In addition to the four speakers who presented the Supreme to us in a personal and grandiose way, the feeling of love and real brotherhood was palpable at every moment. Thank you to the administrators and volunteers for this magnificent event! Thank you to the participants who gave me a pure feeling of happiness!

God can be realized only in the realms of human experience; nevertheless, the true concept of the reality of God is reasonable to logic, plausible to philosophy, essential to religion, and indispensable to any hope of personality survival.” (<a id="a122_355"></a>[UB 1:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p2_7))


## Reflection of a congressman

_Jean Sauve_
_Saint Lucia of the Laurentians_

Participating in the AUQ Congress, from August 9 to 11, at the Villa Saint-Martin in Pierrefonds, brought up moments of reflection in me during and after these few SUCH nourishing days.

This theme “_The Supreme and I, partners in experience_” has remained “suspended” in my thoughts since. It was a rich and profound moment that these few days, filled with new knowledge, if not new understandings. Several speakers (Marc Belleau, Hélène Bienvenue, Johanne Séguin, Moustapha Ndiaye, Conrad Lavallée) offered various angles of what “_The Supreme and I, partners in experience_” is.

On the way back, one of the reflections questioned me, mobilized me. If I have been targeted to receive the 5th Revelation, then what should I do with it? Between putting it aside or putting it into practice, to the best of my abilities, WHERE AM I? Between doing the Will of the Heavenly Father, who loves me so much and needs me, and investing myself to the optimum, WHERE AM I? If I want to do the Will of the Heavenly Father, it is now, and now it is there, it is here, it is “right away”.

## AUQ Congress 2019

_Samuel Heine_
_Reunion Island (near Madagascar)_

From time to time, I watch and listen to “all the beautiful moments shared” during your 2019 congress.

Thanks for sharing this on [Youtube channel](https://bit.ly/3MJnXJU);

Line, I found you charming, beautiful, peaceful, joyful and very fulfilled. It warms my heart.

Gaétan probably has something to do with it? Smile.

Thank you both for your involvement in the “active and constructive” Service over all these years, for the fifth revelation, the fraternity and the friendship.

In the common desire to help each other fraternally in the search for eternal goods, may all the brothers and sisters of Quebec receive my spiritual friendship.

Thanks to them too.

Everything in us in the love of God.

## TIMELESS

_Pierre Sauvageau_
_St-Alexis-des-monts_

Many who have been touched by the beauty and truths of The Urantia Book become perplexed by the indifference of those to whom they attempt to sensitize themselves to the new modern revelation.

**The Urantia Book** makes the following observation: “_The man in the street is occupied [...] with things [...] Man believes himself too busy to find the time necessary for spiritual meditation._” <a id="a164_199"></a>[UB 195:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_7). Is this characteristic, identified by the midwayers, authors of the fourth part of the Book, really specific to our contemporary world?

There is reason to believe that this attitude transcends the ages because the philosopher **Heraclitus** wrote, 600 years before Jesus Christ: “the divine order, men are incapable of understanding it: man, taken up by his material concerns, hardly cares about it.” (Aphorism 39). From ancient Greece to the present day, the same behavior.

In the nineteenth century, the poet **Baudelaire** wrote in his preface to a work by Edgar Allan Poe: “Material activity exaggerated to the proportions of a national mania, leaves in the minds very little room for things that are not of the earth.”

From Heraclitus to Baudelaire, to the commentary on The Urantia Book, the same observation. Since religion is no longer an obligation, men and women wonder what use God can be? Religion has often been nothing more than a ritual of social convenience. The hold of the Church has fallen, there is nothing left of this superficial religion. It will always be true that there is an “impossibility of giving a man teachings about God if this man does not desire to know God” <a id="a170_470"></a>[UB 132:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p7_1). Whoever would be seated next to God and who does not seek him, would not even see him.
