## SERVICE, EXPRESSION OF LOVE (part 3)

WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PREVIOUS TEXTS WHAT SERVICE IS AND HOW IT FITS INTO OUR DAILY LIVES. I WOULD LIKE US NOW TO TURN OUR GAZE TOWARDS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MODEL OF SERVICE THAT CAN EXIST, THE ONE THAT SHOULD BE OUR INSPIRATION.

Although this idea may seem strange to some, I affirm that God the Father is in service to His creation. _The Urantia Book_ mentions this idea several times and in different ways:

> “_Has the triumphant Adjuster won personality by the magnificent service to humanity, or has the valiant human acquired immortality through sincere efforts to achieve Adjusterlikeness?_” (<a id="a22_190"></a>[UB 112:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p7_9))

> “_God is love, the Son is mercy, the Spirit is ministry—the ministry of divine love and endless mercy to all intelligent creation. The Spirit is the personification of the Father’s love and the Son’s mercy; in him are they eternally united for universal service._” (<a id="a24_268"></a>[UB 8:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/8#p4_2))

> “_. . .The true parent is engaged in a continuous service-ministry which the wise child comes to recognize and appreciate._” (<a id="a26_128"></a>[UB 84:7.26](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p7_26))

The Thought Adjuster is completely subject to our free will in all matters concerning our individual lives. He respects our pace, he exercises no form of coercion. When we are discouraged, he waits patiently for the circumstances of life to force us to think, make decisions and act. He is always there when we decide to turn to him, he is always ready to work with us when we make the necessary efforts to move forward. He is always there, within reach of our souls, when we need him. He is of boundless love and unfailing patience. His availability is what makes me believe that our Heavenly Father is at the service of each of us.

Another example is given to us by Michael of Nebadon incarnated in the form of Jesus of Nazareth, when at the Last Supper he knelt down to wash the feet of his disciples before going to the table. On this occasion he gave us this striking image, that of the God of our universe crouching in the position of the servant. There is no wiser, more daring lesson on humility and on the attitude we should have towards one another. In making this gesture, Jesus dispels all doubts we might have about the importance and necessity of service in our ascension to our heavenly Father. It is not a question of becoming the slave of those around us, or of allowing ourselves to be exploited by dishonest people, but rather of making the choice to place ourselves at the disposal of those who need our help. Let us recall, once again, this sentence taken from Jesus' sermon on the Kingdom in the synagogue of Capernaum:

> “_. . .that he who would be great in my Father’s kingdom must first become server of all._” (<a id="a32_95"></a>[UB 137:8.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p8_11))

God the Father is great because he is at the service of his creation. Of course, the service he renders to his creatures is in accordance with his nature. He is the creator and sustainer of the universes. He will therefore serve in these capacities. The same is true of the eternal Son and the infinite Spirit:

> “_In the administration of universes the Father, Son, and Spirit are perfectly and eternally interassociated. Though each is engaged in a personal ministry to all creation, all three are divinely and absolutely interlocked in a service of creation and control which forever makes them *one.*_” (<a id="a36_297"></a>[UB 8:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/8#p6_6))

The work of the heavenly personalities is the service of the great family of God. In the kingdom of heaven there is no room for idleness. God Himself is an indefatigable worker. His <ins>service in creating, sustaining, and controlling</ins> this vast universe, with its myriads of creatures, is undeniable proof of this. The heavenly Father is at the service of His creation, and if we would be like Him, we too must place ourselves at the service of one another, making ourselves available to our brothers and sisters. Thus we shall be able to fulfill His command: “Be ye perfect, even as I am perfect.”

If you have any comments, questions or objections about this text, please feel free to write to me. I will be happy to read them.

## Reader's Testimony

AROUND 1979-1980, I WAS MARRIED AND MY FIRST CHILD WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN HIS BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCE ON URANTIA; WITHIN 3 AND A HALF YEARS, I HAD BECOME THE FATHER OF 2 BEAUTIFUL BOYS AND 1 BEAUTIFUL GIRL!

Like everyone else, I worked to feed my family and life seemed outwardly quite normal to those who knew me.

In my search for success, I was fortunate to meet a co-worker with whom I worked very hard to build a business, but ultimately, both he and I realized that this wasn't really what we were looking for; the values deep within us didn't fit in this environment.

This very nice guy was telling me about a book in English that he said was “absolutely amazing” and he spoke about it with such enthusiasm that I got it to find out more. At the time, we were talking about the Urantia Cosmogony.

We had frequent discussions about this book; we read it separately and during evenings when we got together with friends, we tackled various passages that seemed simply fantastic to us or we discussed texts that we had difficulty interpreting.

Life went on and unfortunately, due to career changes, we gradually lost touch. For my part, I continued to read _The Urantia Book_ regularly and to discuss it occasionally with friends. All the sections interested me! I regularly found myself reading several booklets in different sections at the same time!

I got a book in French and gave my first book in English to a woman who worked for me and was retiring. I felt that this was what she was looking for and I have always imagined that this book is still alive today and in the hands of an avid reader.

Thanks to my book in French, my understanding became even greater, because I could concentrate better on the subject without having to look up the meaning of certain words that I was reading for the first time. There were periods when reading was less present; I was very busy with work, the children and their activities, etc.

Being a baby of the family, several of my relatives, mother, sister, uncle, aunt, etc. have already left life on Urantia and I realized that a few weeks before each death, I had a visceral need to take my Urantia Book and read certain passages! A little divine voice inside me served as a guide and encouraged me to read to better understand the passage that the loved one was about to go through.

Yet when I became aware of these forebodings, I began to dread reading the $L U$ for fear that it was an imminent sign of the death of a family member. I of course overcame this fear by understanding that in any case, it is wonderful for me to be able to prepare for this type of event and it is also an extraordinary time for the mortal to experience this morontia transition.

I then discovered the book online! How fortunate to now have access to a wealth of documents prepared by readers that allowed me to understand this wonderful book even more! I also have the pleasure of regularly consulting the document “Urantia Study Aids” written by Hara Davis that I obtained and which helps so much to better understand the scope and scope of the Urantia book.

I began to devour each of the texts written by Urantia enthusiasts; at work, during lunch time or sometimes very late in the evening, I was still as amazed as at the beginning by this wonderful story.

One day, by chance while doing some research, I see that the president of the association is a man named Gaétan Charland. Could it be my colleague who introduced me to Urantia almost 30 years ago? I take a chance and write to him... Of course! He is this fantastic man! What a joy to find him again and to see that we are still and always passionate about Urantia!

Although I am not actively involved in the activities of the association, I am proud to be a member of Urantia's readers and intend to remain so for the rest of my earthly life.

I am immersed in metaphysics on a daily basis and I can assure you that Jesus was the greatest of all metaphysicians who ever lived on Urantia. In reading each of his parables, in the beatitudes, in the sermon on the mount, in seeing each of his behaviors, we understand the true message of love delivered for all of us.

The Lord's Prayer is the most complete prayer that could ever exist, and the Sermon on the Mount (Paper 140) answers everything a Urantia resident could hope for as a guide to life.

All of Jesus' messages are clear when we understand the power each human has in meeting his or her Thought Adjuster.

I had the chance to work for a few years in a Muslim country, I had the chance to pray and discuss with Buddhists and Taoists, I received Hindu, Catholic teachings, etc. and the basic message is always the same: Love your neighbor as yourself and do not do to others what you do not want others to do to you. I also remember this sentence written by a reader: among all the gifts we have received from God, the free will that God has entrusted to us is sovereign.

But what have the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ brought into my life?

Like many, I have always had a curiosity on two levels, that is to say that my intellect thirsts for knowledge and the Being of light in me seeks answers that allow me to advance on the spiritual level. I read several books on personal growth, but I was not satisfied. I read and reread the Bible, but I felt that I was missing a large part of the story, the real story.

Although I always had faith, I was always looking for...

Reading UB has greatly met my expectations since fundamental questions such as “who am I” “where do I come from, where am I going” have suddenly become much more alive in my being. I felt deep down that reading would bring me answers or at least give me avenues for deep reflection in connection with each of the questions.

Obviously, far from me the idea that I understand everything, but what I really understood is that these questions are really not important! The simple way to say it is that I understood that there is nothing to understand! No matter what world I come from and in which I will be after my passage here, my existence is in freedom and my goal is to understand that the power and divine love are in us and that we must let them express themselves.

Reading the UB, I realized above all that we are all brothers, that we all come from the same Source. We are ONE, but everyone has the choice to live their life as they wish and that is perfect like that!

Today I am happy to be among the readers and my message is simple. Look inside yourself and above all, meditate, get in touch with the divine force that is there; have total faith and you will then live in joy, in universal and unconditional love.

## AUQ 2011 Annual General Meeting

ON SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 5, ALL MEMBERS IN STANDING ORDERS OF THE URANTIA ASSOCIATION OF QUEBEC WERE INVITED TO AN ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING AT THE HOTEL LE DAUPHIN IN DRUMMONDVILLE.

Participation in these meetings is highly desirable, because it allows us to redefine the goals of the Association and to make decisions in solidarity with the direction we want to give to the Urantian movement here in Quebec.

The meeting was opened by President Gaétan Charland, who, after verifying the quorum and a moment of silence, proceeded to read for adoption the agenda. The Vice-President, your humble servant, then proceeded to read for adoption the minutes of the previous annual meeting of February 6, 2010.

A review of activities for the year 2010 was presented by the Vice-President and the President. In this regard, in addition to the almost monthly meetings of the Board of Directors, here are the significant events that deserve to be highlighted: the theme on “the human ego”, the theme on “The dissemination of the teachings of the _Urantia Book_ $”$”, the theme “To love is to serve”, the development of a “Guide to Themes”, a prospecting trip by the Board to Saguenay, Michael's party at Angrignon Park in Montreal, the holiday dinner in Laval, as well as all the work related to the publication of Réflectivité.

The other report, that of finances, was presented by the outgoing treasurer, Alain Cyr. His presentation greatly enlightened us on the importance of the generosity of the Urantian workforce of Quebec.

This year, two positions were expiring, those of president and treasurer. The terms of these positions have a duration of two years and expire alternately with those of vice-president and secretary for a smoother operation. To apply the election procedure, Pierre Routhier, once again, accepted the role of election president.

The first exercise concerned the position of president. The outgoing president, Gaétan Charland, accepted with pleasure the renewal of his mandate for another two-year term. Then, for that of treasurer, the candidacy of Luciano Camellini was adopted.

This is a happy result! The reappointment of Gaétan Charland as the great helmsman of the Urantian movement in Quebec is a guarantee of stability and wise progress. The arrival of a new figure, in Luciano Camellini as treasurer, brings new energies and frees Alain Cyr for other possible mandates. Thank you to these mandarins in the service of the divine.

For the year 2011, the composition of the board of directors of the Urantia Association of Quebec is as follows: President, Gaétan Charland; Vice-President, Guy Laporte; Secretary, Maurice Migneault; President of the Communications Committee and Membership Committee, Line St-Pierre.

In the news chapter, Line St-Pierre announced that the first resolution of the year 2011 by the AUQ was the creation of a “WOMEN'S COMMITTEE”. At the head of this committee, it is none other than the former president of the AUQ, Johanne Séguin, who is responsible for guiding its destiny. The creation of this committee aims to encourage women (as well as young people) to greater participation in the Urantia movement in Quebec and elsewhere in the world. Bravo for this initiative.

This brief presentation concludes the annual general meeting portion that took place in the morning. In the afternoon of the same day, before a larger assembly, Gaétan Charland gave us a presentation on two themes. The first concerned the mission that the Association du Québec endorses. It can be found in detail on the Internet at the site “[www.urantia-quebec.ca](www.urantia-quebec.ca)”. Click on “mission” to discover the orientation of your association's approach.

The second theme was about the importance of study groups. Indeed, the mission of The Urantia Book involves study groups, which are the best means of training leaders and teachers. Gaétan's presentation focused on the importance of these and their reasons for being. What functions do they have? What are their characteristics? Do they have requirements? What relationships do they have with the training of leaders and teachers as well as with education? What influences do they have on the individual, the family and society? Many thoughts to bring us to the conclusion that: “**Study groups are one of the dynamic means by which divine wisdom can be expressed in the progressive evolution of cosmic consciousness in humans**”.

May this brief account of this very important day satisfy your curiosity, if not, there is no other choice but to attend in the future.

Vice-president of AUQ $\square$

## Teaching

I HAVE BEEN TEACHING FOR 25 YEARS. THE EXPERIENCE ACQUIRED HAS GIVEN ME THE KEY ELEMENTS THAT PROMOTE SUCCESS.

In reading The Urantia Book, it was the life of Jesus that impressed me the most. In particular the long journey he experienced before beginning his public life. What an example! His training began very early, it began at a very young age by learning religious texts. Then, his responsibility as head of the family led him to develop his leadership qualities very early. He then continued his training by traveling which led him to meet people from all classes of society and all conditions. Study, meditation as well as service to his fellow men were his formula for constant progress. His love of the Father and of men dictated his conduct.

When the time came to begin his public life, his training was complete. His long preparation had raised him to the status of master in his field, he was ready. His knowledge of man allowed him to avoid the pitfalls of communication. He knew perfectly the needs of the soul thirsting for truth. He knew the pitfalls and knew how to get around them. His love of God and men transcended everything.

Today, what steps are necessary to achieve the qualities needed to be effective as a teacher?

First of all, it is certainly to know one's subject or material thoroughly. In the field of spirituality, one must not only stop at knowledge, one must also integrate it. The master must know more than the student. This acquisition is inevitable and determines one's success in the field. Jesus knew all the Holy Scriptures perfectly, likewise the study (not only the reading) of _The Urantia Book_ is a primordial condition to then be able to speak wisely about it.

Then, to know well the nature of man, his needs, his beliefs, his fears, his origins, etc. This knowledge determines the right method. It is also learning to love God, to know Jesus and to love other mortals.

Jesus’ favorite method was to ask questions. He knew that before sowing a seed, it is wise to prepare the soil. He knew how to whet the appetite. He knew how to promote discovery. He trusted God and the Spirit of Truth. What wisdom! His example is inspiring.

In response to the criticism of revelation, be wise as serpents and gentle as doves. (<a id="a147_86"></a>[UB 140:8.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_13)). For this:

- Mobilize progressive attitudes towards challenges.
- Emphasize the truths we share.
- Ask questions and listen.
- Answer questions effectively. Jesus was as adept at teaching by asking questions as he was at answering them (<a id="a152_112"></a>[UB 132:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p4_2)).
- Build on the truth contained in what the other says. Illuminate the beautiful.
- Don't undermine a person's confidence in the scriptures that motivate his life.
- Have open attitudes in the discussion.
- Love...

All this knowledge of saying and doing is acquired only gradually. Mortals learn wisdom only by undergoing tribulation. (48:7; 556.14) Self-improvement requires courage and determination, but above all, steadfastness. And there is the unfailing aid of our Adjuster.

Finally, here are two questions: How does teaching play a role in the larger realm of service? And, in what ways could your study group become a place for teacher training?

## Dear Urantia Book Readers,

IN THE PAST, YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LOYAL IN YOUR SUPPORT FOR OUR ASSOCIATION AND WE THANK YOU FOR THAT.

The services provided by the Urantia Association of Quebec are numerous and could not be realized without the support of its many readers, whether this support is financial or through active participation on your part. Some of these services have to do with the translations or printing of the _Urantia Book_ or the sending of books to developing regions of the world.

Other services of a more practical nature are manifested in our province through publications, such as the newsletter Réflectivité or the Journal de l'AUI, the themes or the congresses every three years. We have also in the past four years made visits to different regions of Quebec, far from the big centers to meet readers and thus create bonds of fraternity. We will continue this activity in order to come to offer support to all readers of Quebec, because study groups are at the heart of our mission.

The Urantia Association of Quebec is part of the great UAI family and through this link, maintains a dynamic and interdependent relationship with the Urantia Foundation of Chicago. Through this relationship, the AUQ participates in the global effort to improve the spiritual status of our planet by participating in various dissemination projects.

This could not happen without your participation and presence as a member of the AUQ and thus offer you a partnership in the greatest adventure of our time. In the last mailing made by the AUQ, you received with the February Réflectivité a pre-addressed envelope and on the last page the membership form. Thank you for participating.

To love is to serve

Gaetan G. Charland
President AUQ $\square$
