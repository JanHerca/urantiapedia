## SERVICE, EXPRESSION OF LOVE (part 4)

IN THE PREVIOUS TEXT, WE PUT FORWARD THE IDEA THAT OUR HEAVENLY FATHER IS EFFECTIVELY AT THE SERVICE OF THE HUMAN SOUL, ESPECIALLY THROUGH THE PRESENCE OF THOUGHT ADJUSTERS. THIS IDEA MAY BE DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT FOR SOME. THE IDEOLOGIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY CURRENT IN OUR SOCIETY EXPLAIN, IN PART, THESE DIFFICULTIES.

I believe that our view of service is affected by the views of modern religions and the frankly materialistic behavior of our society. In our analysis, we must take into account the Judeo-Christian view that the institutionalized church has bequeathed to us. We have been educated with the idea that the Father in Heaven is a king seated on a throne, issuing his commands throughout the universe to myriads of heavenly creatures who bow down before him. The Father is indeed the ruler of our universe, but in making such a comparison, some make the mistake of associating his behavior with that of the human kings who have succeeded one another on Urantia. However, these latter do not stoop to service; rather, they have an army of people at their service. Jesus presented his Father using the image of a King ruling over a spiritual kingdom, for the Jewish religion at that time longed for a God who would sit on the throne of David. Although he tried to avoid any association with the concept of kingship, it was too difficult for the Jews of his time to shake off such ideas; revelation must always bend to the necessities and needs of the age it seeks to illuminate.

> “The great effort embodied in this sermon was the attempt to transfer the concept of the kingdom of heaven into the ideal of doing the will of God. The Master had long since taught his disciples to pray, 'Thy kingdom come, thy will be done.' At this time he earnestly sought to have them abandon the use of the expression, the kingdom of God, in favor of a more practical equivalent, the will of God, but he failed.” Paper 170 no. 2; 1860 no. 6
> 
> “Jesus desired to substitute for the idea of kingdom, king, and subjects the concept of the heavenly family, the heavenly Father, and the liberated sons of God, engaged in joyful and willing service to their fellow human beings and in the sublime and intelligent worship of God the Father.” [UB 170:2.11-12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p2_11)

We are, today, the heirs of these ideas and consequently, it can be difficult to accept the idea that the heavenly Father can serve his creation. But let us ask ourselves frankly, what is so humiliating about service that we think that God cannot indulge in it? there is absolutely nothing humiliating about serving! Only the distorted vision of our modern society can make us believe this idea. Indeed, many people today seem to see in service a certain form of humiliation. The vision of our society is the antithesis of that of the Master who devoted his entire life to the service of humanity. In his discourse on the kingdom of heaven, Jesus tells us that to be great in the kingdom of his Father, we must become the servant of all (_see note no. 4, part 3, Service: expression of love_). It is service that allows us to be great. It is therefore up to us to change our way of seeing by re-evaluating the value of service in light of the 5th revelation.

> “In the spiritual world there is no such thing as menial work; all service is sacred and exhilarating; neither do the higher orders of beings look down upon the lower orders of existence.” ([UB 25:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/25#p1_1))

Our era is characterized by material enrichment for the sake of spiritual gains. In a society where we must constantly work to overconsume, we have less time to devote to the service of the divine family. Listen to me, I have nothing against the production of wealth as long as it does not supplant the search for God and the service of the spiritual brotherhood. For some, the passion for service is totally non-existent and the goals have become purely monetary. We work more to enrich ourselves than to improve things. Well, I believe that service... is the opposite! We work first to improve things and then to provide for our needs. In reality, service is a state of mind where we do things in order to improve the conditions of those around us and to perfect ourselves. For people who are invested with the spirit of service, monetary remuneration becomes something secondary.

### Conclusion

Over the past few months, we have explored some aspects of the service of the spiritual brotherhood. We have seen that it is the expression of the love we have for God and our fellow men. It is a benevolent predisposition that is reflected in the concrete gestures of daily life. It is above all our attitude of availability and openness to others that determines whether we are at the service of our brothers and sisters. Subsequently, we have addressed the idea that the heavenly Father is at the service of his creation. If we want to be like him, as he has asked us, we must also put ourselves at the service of one another. We have also reflected on the conception of service in our modern society. This is in flagrant contradiction with the spirit of service as Jesus lived and taught it while he was incarnate in our world. It is important to become aware of the importance of service in our ascension and to restore its letters of nobility. Service is above all the expression of love, a love so great that it goes so far as to give one's life for one's friends. Jesus, for his part, gave his life even to his enemies. The supreme service, as he lived it, is the total gift of oneself to something greater than oneself.

> “On millions of inhabited worlds, tens of trillions of evolving creatures who may have been tempted to give up the moral struggle and abandon the good fight of faith, have taken one more look at Jesus on the cross and then have forged on ahead, inspired by the sight of God’s laying down his incarnate life in devotion to the unselfish service of man.” ([UB 188:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p5_5))

## Meeting of the Women's Committee

HERE ARE THE MAIN POINTS OF THE COMMENTS MADE AIMED AT DEFINING THE VOCATION OF THE WOMEN'S COMMITTEE DURING A FIRST MEETING ON FEBRUARY 25 AT THE VILLA ST-MARTIN IN PIERREFONDS.

Five torchbearers gathered on this memorable day, including Johanne Séguin, president of the committee, Line St Pierre, Madeleine Boisvert, Liette Ezri and Louise Charbonneau.

Why the formation of a Women's Committee?

This cell was created following a question from Line St-Pierre. What is the reason for the absence of women in the Urantia movement? Is Urantia too intellectual a movement? Yes, there are women, but few, not enough. It has been noted that in study groups, during themes or many other events in the Urantia movement, the participation of men was more important. What should be implemented to attract female readers, to arouse their interest so that they come forward when they are asked!

Trying to answer these questions raised many others. It will take several meetings and discussions to establish an action plan. First, we all agreed that this women's association had to be universal, without regard to race or religion; that those who wished to join us would be welcome, readers of the Urantia Book or not. One criterion was required: that they be spiritual people. The goals of this reflection group are: mutual aid, fraternity, sharing spirituality and the love we have for God. Continuing the spiritual journey with other women who wish to improve themselves. Changing the vision of reality through spiritualization. Realizing feminine expression in spirituality. Teaching future generations, especially young girls, the importance of spirituality in education. All these statements are the result of a short 3-hour meeting.

The power of women is such that their influence is limitless. Emotional, generous and loving by nature, living her spirituality on a daily basis, she naturally transmits her values to those around her. Women's lives are in service: with their family, their spouse, their children, the elderly, the sick, volunteer associations of all kinds, the workplace, etc. Women bring their energy, their skills, their heart to each of their actions. They find their place where a need is to be filled. Everything goes through them, from the material to the spiritual. They are a pillar in society. What a valuable candidate.

Awareness and knowledge of God imply a responsibility in our society for the woman who knows. Spirituality is a support, it brings encouragement and hope, it is essential to the balance and healthy development of an individual. It is therefore through service that it is possible to reach out to distress, to comfort, to relieve, to love.

Reflecting Beauty, Goodness, Truth, this is what the Women’s Committee wishes to convey.

A next meeting is planned for April 2 in Trois-Rivières.

## THE SOUL AND THE BUTTERFLY

IF NOBODY HAD SEEN WITH THEIR EYES A CATERPILLAR TURN INTO A BUTTERFLY, NOBODY WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THAT SUCH A TRANSFORMATION WAS POSSIBLE.

Let such a creeping creature nibbling on leaves become a superb winged creature gathering nectar from flowers.

Now suppose that a first person witnesses such an unimaginable feat and comes to tell other people about it... they would be considered very funny and have a lot of imagination, or that they are taking their dreams for reality. Skepticism would be appropriate.

As such transformations are common in nature, other more sublime transformations are the prerogative of humans becoming souls and this is the very first step for an endless life. This is quite a challenge for skeptics, because faith in God is the key and faith is simply the chance we give ourselves! Wanting to believe in a God of Love is already believing in it.

The caterpillar knows nothing about the process of becoming a butterfly, it just follows its programming, it has no choice. But if it had, it could say to itself: “I like to nibble on succulent leaves, flowers and their nectar mean nothing to me.”

It is not necessary for humans to know the process to build their souls, but they have the choice to seek Truth, Beauty and Goodness—the divine Light within them—and to spread the fruits of it to their fellow men. Thus, our human nature becomes the chrysalis of our soul, becoming our second nature released at the death of the body. It is indeed us... in a very different form, able to see and hear humans and angels.

As our Universal Father, God loves every human being with a selfless and unconditional love. This Love becomes the model that humans must be inspired by to love God and their neighbor. Jesus made this love a wish for his disciples and for us: “Love one another, as I have loved you.” It is the joy of giving freely, without expecting anything in return, not even a thank you or a sign of gratitude. It is the consecration of our life to God and to the service of our neighbor.

Those who make this choice to want to know God, our Universal Father, to love him, to love and serve our contemporaries also make the choice to be truly the happy ones on Earth. Be happy.

## Report on the Theme of March 13, 2011

ON SUNDAY, MARCH 13, A THEMATIC MEETING ORGANIZED BY THE AUQ WAS HELD AT THE HOTEL LE DAUPHIN IN DRUMMONDVILLE. THE THEME WAS “LEADERSHIP AND TEACHING.”

The observation of a somewhat reduced attendance can apparently be attributed to the surprise of the time change on the night of Saturday to Sunday. Great consolation, three newcomers were present. It is always encouraging to see the great family of readers of The Urantia Book grow.

Four presentations were planned. In great shape, Maurice Migneault spoke to us about “**The role of teachers and leaders**.” Then, a new figure as in the role of presenter within the framework of a theme, Michel Breton lifted his veil on “**Service, my leitmotiv**.” After the coffee break, Johanne Séguin, president of the WOMEN'S COMMITTEE, began her presentation with a 3-minute video course, taken from YouTube, namely: **humanplanet**. Then, supported by an excellent PowerPoint, she spoke to us about the subject of her presentation which was on “**Leadership, from theory to practice**.” At the end of the morning, your servant and host of this event, Guy Laporte elaborated on the theme of “**Teaching**.” These four presentations allowed us to see how varied and rich the points of view can be on the strong theme of this theme.

After dinner, three discussion tables were organized to work in a workshop. Everyone was able to express themselves on the many questions that the subject of leadership and teaching can raise. In conclusion, a plenary session allowed us to share the main opinions expressed in the workshop.

I hope that this brief report of this day devoted to an important part of the AUQ mission, namely to bring to life here the mission of The Urantia Book, will awaken in you the motivation to attend the next theme, FAITH and BELIEF which will take place on Saturday, May 14 at the Hôtel l'Oiselière in Lévis.

It's a date!
