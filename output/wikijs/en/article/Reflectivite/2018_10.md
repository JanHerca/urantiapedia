## Word from the President

_Line St-Pierre_
president@urantiaqc.org

> "_The reformulation of the religion of Jesus must develop a new and adequate symbolism._
> 
> _Modern men must find a symbolism appropriate to their new ideals, to their new expanding ideas and obediences. This higher symbol of a higher civilization must arise from religious life, from spiritual experience. This higher symbolism of ***a higher civilization must be based on the concept of the Fatherhood of God and contain the powerful ideal of the brotherhood of man***._ ” <a id="a23_385"></a>[UB 87:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_6)

In what a Bright Evening Star of Nebadon offers us, **I understand that the only true happiness for us on earth is our active participation in living the brotherhood of men, knowing that we all come from the same divine essence**. The Father's plan is already mapped out and the road to brotherhood is included in it, all that remains is to add our collaboration. We are responsible for all these gifts that have been placed in us in order to transform us and become the best version of ourselves for our spiritual growth and for our eternal happiness.

What is the meaning we give to our life, don't we all want to be happy and live a long and healthy life? What is happiness, where is it? Happiness is there, it is everywhere at every turn of our existence. It is located where our ideal of life is to sincerely want to participate in the infinite plan of serving fraternity, of seeing to the well-being of our brothers in God, by bringing a little more light to others, while thinking of the inner spirit that inhabits these personalities.

Our potential is limitless, but too often doubt taints our ability to act, focusing on our inadequacies rather than what we have to offer.

The intention with which we act will always be counterbalanced by the indwelling Adjuster and made into something greater, better, and more beautiful.

I wish us happiness!

## Goodbye Guy!

_Claude Flibotte_
_Sainte-Julie_

It is with sadness in my soul that I received the news of the death of **my friend** ***Guy Vachon***.

Although I am comforted by my faith in survival through our souls and know that I will meet Guy again on one of the mansion worlds, I already miss his presence!

He was like a spiritual father to me and for a few years, I enjoyed attending his study group in Brossard. This very prolific group had given rise, due to the large number of participants, to two or three other study groups scattered throughout the province, including mine at the time, in Saint-Basile-le-Grand.

I remember Guy's great erudition on the subject of revelation, but especially his immense generosity, his communicative smile and his charming bass voice that I was given the opportunity to hear on several occasions. Moreover, we will keep this voice for posterity, because during the French audio production of The Urantia Book, he kindly lent himself to the recording of fasc. 105, 107, 109, 111 and 113.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank Marc Belleau, Roselyne de Baets and the two other people whose names I do not know who recorded the fourth part of the book at the request of Richard Lachance's father. At the time, I had the pleasure of leading this team and lending my voice to a few of the booklets. For those of you who do not have these recordings, they are available on the [Foundation website](http://urantia-quebec.ca/), > The Book > Download the Book. Then scroll down to the “Download books in MP3 format” section.

My brother and friend Guy, I wish you a good journey to better worlds and I know that we will meet again to sing this song by Félix Leclerc... “It was a little happiness...”

Bye !

## The Economy of Suffering — In Ego-Making and Soul Progression

_Louis Prud'homme_
_Laval_

At the recent Urantian birthday luncheon of Michael, I shared with several people some thoughts and conversations I had had recently, including with a Buddhist friend.

Thoughts inspired greatly, but not only, by the teachings of “The Urantia Book.”

Line asked me to share these thoughts with the readers of Réflectivité.

So so...
I have been working with the public for a long time; as an artist, guide, waiter-bartender and more recently as a “Téo Taxi” driver.

In addition, I am rather sociable, so I meet a lot of people and often I meet lucid but pessimistic people. Not just paranoid young people or nostalgic grumpy old people. People who, even if things are not going so badly for themselves, are deploring “the state of the world”.

One of these customers I met by chance (a well-known “animorist”) pointed out to me after a few minutes of friendly conversation caught in traffic, whining about the various dramas of the day: Trump and ecology, Trump and racism, Trump and economic disparities, Trump... and the roadworks that will never end in Montreal.

So he told me, laughing, that it would take a “reset” button on the human race! I laughed with him, but I answered that it wouldn't change much since humanity is condemned to “pedaling in the mud” anyway.

Humans, male or female, cannot be satisfied with their fate, their condition and therefore do stupid things. It is in their basic program. **Man seeks either to <ins>accept his fate</ins>, or to <ins>shout about his fate</ins>, or to <ins>improve his fate</ins>; consciously or not**. And **<ins>that is where it is played out</ins>, in my opinion**.

It's not so much the adventures or tribulations of life that matter. “Social success” is not just about \$\$\$\$; it's **how YOU play the game of life**.

What matters is not so much hoping to see humanity, or anyone, get out of its “mud!”. “_Everyone has his own shit_”. (Not quoted as such in the UB!)

**What matters is how YOU pedal through the “mud!” How YOU face adversity.** It is better to fail while trying to accomplish something noble and generous than to succeed in running away with the pancake by crushing everything in its path!

“Don't be discouraged” by the world that seems to be running to its doom. **Play the part that is accessible to you; pedal as best you can!**

A common biped is not a Man, unless he claims the status!

In short... I did not get to a final sentence with my illustrious client; and I can only confess this same final sentence to readers of “The Urantia Book”, because it might seem illicit, but it is <ins>what is most lacking in this world</ins>: **the personal awareness of participating in a great cosmic adventure!**

So I didn't get that far with this illustrious “animorist,” but I discussed this anecdote with a Buddhist friend. He saw a parallel with the concept of samsara, which is a kind of cycle of suffering from which one cannot escape.

It is written in the “Urantia Book” “_What ensures survival is not so much what the mind understands, but rather what the mind seeks to understand_” <a id="a90_149"></a>[UB 111:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_5). There is a thought to be continued there. No?

I invite you to share your impressions on this same theme on this forum.

See you soon!

## Twenty years, that's worth noting

_Gaétan Charland \& Line St-Pierre_
_Découverte Group Hosts._

**Twenty years ago this fall, the Discovery study group** was created to meet the needs of students of the _Urantia Book_ in the Laurentians region. It was a modest beginning that began with the participation of four friends who to this day, are still present at the weekly meetings and who have contributed over the years to the smooth running of this group. We have explored together during these years and with the participation of many students, many concepts, ideas, truths, historical evolutionary, scientific, religious and spiritual facts.

We have also explored and discovered new methods of operation to avoid the monotony of sequential reading, but also in a deep desire to make the teachings studied practical and alive in each of our lives. Like all groups, there have been ups and downs, periods when the students were fewer in number, other periods when there seemed to be too many compared to the comfort, harmony and dynamics of the group. All these periods of study and learning have been enriching and have borne many spiritual fruits.

Today, after twenty years of existence, the Discovery group continues the exploration of the teachings of the _Urantia Book_ with the participation of more than fifteen people and still pursues its goal of expanding cosmic consciousness and enhancing the spiritual perception of the participants.

The study group has also followed technological progress by offering virtual access to its members who are remote or prevented for various reasons from participating in person at meetings.

The success of this longevity: the pursuit of a spiritual goal, respect in listening and sharing, the pleasure of discovering the truth together where it is found, the sincerity of the students in the pursuit of a spiritual life, the assiduity of the meetings, its frequency and the welcome.

Of course there are other factors that have contributed to the sustainability of this group, which is why the Urantia Association of Quebec offers training days for study group hosts.
