We are living in a time of both crisis and opportunity. While there are many reasons to be anxious, and to experience uncertainty about this global condition that concerns us, I remain hopeful that, like all things, this too will pass and certainly leave unforgettable traces in our lives.

We are adaptable beings, and for fun I like to say that we adapt to everything, even misery!

With living faith, this powerful reactor giving us assurance and inner peace in such a time, we are called upon to support, encourage and help our loved ones; a phone call, an invitation to a virtual meeting or a visit while observing the rules that are asked of us during the pandemic.

I know several students of the book who have been taking advantage of the opportunity offered to them by these numerous virtual fraternal meetings since the end of March. These activities are organized by dedicated people of the Urantia movement and allow readers to associate and share their joy, their anguish, their spiritual wisdom with other students from all over the world while benefiting from a new, enriching and sometimes transformative experience.

The AUQ also has to do things differently since we cannot be physically present at our scheduled meetings and hug each other. It is in this same spirit that I invite you on Sunday, October 25 from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. for one of its virtual meetings. You will find the details of this activity in the box entitled CONFERENCEWORKSHOP.

Looking forward to seeing you there,

Fraternally,

## A short history of COVID-19

_Alain Cyr_
Longueuil

The pandemic has put us all on pause for a while. For my part, I have been digging into the corners of my life experiences and $j$ 'pulling out some values. Here is an excerpt of my reflections.

The story begins in 1966, in elementary school, $7^{\text {e }}$ grade. During a literature class, the teacher asked the class to write an essay on the topic of my hobby, also mentioning that “everyone had a hobby, of some kind.” I felt a little diminished by the idea that I didn't have a topic. To me, there was nothing I could consider a hobby. But, since it was a “class assignment,” I set about inventing one.

For reasons I still don't know, $j$ 't talked about insects. I became an insect collector. Not being very knowledgeable in this field, I did some research in encyclopedias - learning and writing how, for example, ants live in society, and this, describing their mode of behavior. The descriptive addition on some other insects earned me a composition with the required number of pages. I was happy to be able to present a complete document, with a conclusion that recalled that every little thing is important, that everything is useful.

All students were asked to read their compositions in front of the class. I was rather admiring of the exhibition of several students, listening with interest to the details that described the art of their passions.

But I was shocked! Because the teacher, after analyzing everything, came to present to everyone what he had to consider to be the best composition of the group. He added that this finalist (it was a group of boys) was also the winner of a merit award. And there, he raised his hand and asked the class to congratulate Alain Cyr. All the students applauded warmly. I wanted to melt under my desk, because my story was fictional. I didn't think it was fair to the others who really had a hobby. And, to top it all off, he gave me a beautiful big book which, with illustrations, described a panoply of widely known insects.

Over time, I realized that Mr. Blue (that was his name) knew full well that I was not collecting insects. He had evaluated me according to my intention, with, certainly, the effort involved in the research. And that is, I think, what God the Father does for us as well. We are judged according to our intentions!

So this time of respite, of retrospection, will also have allowed me to see a little to what extent we can rebuild our lives. Despite our physical handicaps, it is in our heads that everything takes on its value. We cannot change our personality, but we can change our attitude, our behavior. And I found a method to improve myself. Every day, I offer my thoughts to my inner guide — this spirit in us that is of divine source. It does not answer me in audible words, but with feelings and inspiration and this gives me a joy of living that nourishes my soul on a daily basis.

“_Man is spiritually indwelt by a_ Thought Adjuster. [...] The Father desires that all his creatures shall be in personal communion with him.” <a id="a64_143"></a>[UB 5:1.7-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p1_7)

I think this short story has no end.

## Pandemic

First of all, I would like to say that I have no conspiracy theorist or conspiratorial streak at all, that my view of the pandemic is not all black or all white and that it evolves over time.

First of all, the means taken at the beginning (confinement) to counter the virus is unsustainable even in the short term and causes more harm than good.
<br style="clear:both;"/>

### Statistics

The contagion rate, the number of tests carried out, the rate of asymptomatic people, the real rate of infected people, the mortality rate. All data are linked to each other, but which do not allow us to have a real picture of the situation. Proportionally, COVID kills few people compared to other diseases. In Canada there are 200,000 cases of nosocomial infections in hospitals each year and 8,000 deaths, each year! 20,000 deaths due to lung cancer each year, and I could go on for an hour. That said, this does not mean that we should spare our efforts to stop the virus, but it does allow us to have a sense of proportion of the situation. Focusing on a single tree prevents us from seeing the forest.

So what is the difference between this pandemic and the SARS and H1N1 pandemics that we have had in the last 20 years? The response of the Chinese government is to say to lock down cities of several million inhabitants which had never been done before. I would not have liked to be in the shoes of the heads of state of other countries when the virus appeared on their territory. If they decide not to lock down the population to save jobs and their economy and 5, 10 or 20 thousand people or more die, you can be sure that they would have been criticized for not having done enough.

### Benefits of the pandemic

Humanity has a common problem to solve. People in confinement have been able to take a break and reflect on what is important in their lives. Sanitation procedures are improving in hospitals. There will be a revolution in institutions for the elderly. Teleworking will continue after the pandemic.

Maybe this is just practice for a next more severe global pandemic. Every situation brings new opportunities. I also think of the planetary government of the seraphim?

On a strictly personal level, the pandemic has only brought me good things (thank God). As a UB reader in our rather atheist society, I have very little contact with people who have God in their lives except in the two study groups I am part of, which corresponds to four hours per week. This spring and thanks to the pandemic I have been in contact with more UB readers than ever. I was on Zoom daily with a group in Europe, six times a week with a group in the United States (the [“Urantia café”](https://www.urantiauniversity.org/page-1804221)) and my two groups in Quebec. Although I already knew this a little, I realized the importance of being part of a spiritual family and how much the spiritual energy of the group propels us forward. I experienced a spiritual transformation like never before.

I end with this, I do not believe that this pandemic is a turning point in our civilization as some people think or wish. After a war, an economic crisis or a pandemic, the majority of people want only one thing; for everything to go back to the way it was before.

“_Certain economic adjustments and social changes are necessary if we are to_ avoid a cultural disaster. This new _social order that is coming will not settle in peacefully for a millennium_.” <a id="a99_193"></a>[UB 99:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p1_1)

## Reflection by Guy Breton

_Guy Breton_

[**Our brother and friend Guy Breton**, a student of _the revelation and suffering from brain cancer, received medical assistance to die_ on Tuesday, July 28, 2020 at 2:00 p.m. Guy placed himself in the hands of the Heavenly Father.

**Here is one of his last thoughts** before his passage to the other side towards the World of Mansions.]

"Life is a repetitive movement whose variety depends on the degree of consciousness, movement and physical form. Life can be lived in different states of wakefulness, full consciousness, semi-consciousness, _coma, unconsciousness and death_. I have been thinking about mental illness because the worst addicts of my life have been with people who suffered from mental illness.

The degree of consciousness depends on lived experiences and major human flaws such as _pride, envy, hypocrisy. The first thing a person with mental illness should recognize is that _his reality is not the true reality and be wary_ of himself, because his degree of malice is really related to what he is and the perception of his reality.

_I forgive all those who have deeply hurt me. It is a duty for human beings to try to elevate themselves_ and others by making efforts to grasp the true reality to diminish the negative effects of their lack of reality.

A big thank you to all those who _showed me your affection and support_. You really helped me through this big transition.

_Eric Tarissan_
Quebec

Hello Guy (Breton),
I bow before this faith, this serenity and this peace which inhabit you.

For some people it might seem ridiculous to say that the best is yet to come, but here I know you know what I'm talking about, obviously!

I am happy for you, to see that your life has been well filled, with love, your wife, your children, family and friends. Because although the family is truly the basis, the core, the cell and the very heart of society, it must be said that for the past fifty years, it has continued to crumble... and to become more and more difficult to form and to remain solid and strong.

You are therefore one of the few who will have had this privilege, on such a planet, of having been able to keep solid, strong and happy this beautiful, radiant and splendid family that is yours.

Family which, I am sure, must certainly be well enlightened about this divine family, in which we are all brothers; and in which we will all meet again, on the World of Mansions, with our loved ones, our families and friends, our angels and seraphim, and so many other benevolent, fraternal and friendly personalities.

Thank you for this news, I am deeply touched by your simplicity, your depth, your lucidity and your perfect and sublime authenticity.

Through the internet, you are an example and a model for me and, surely, for many others as well.

Time is simply what separates us from perfection!

However, the important thing is to remain present, where reality is: the love of our brothers and sisters, and that nothing can ever, thanks to God, prevent growth and continuity.

And every day I thank God for this eternal “present”!

This relationship is just a beginning, and even if there seems to be a horizon, we know that it is only an illusion, and that we will all soon be able to resume this conversation, with a joyful step, the soul at peace and full of the love of God! I love you my brother.

What courage, simplicity, lucidity, awareness and, above all, what faith in this approach towards God, our Father creator. I am touched Guy and, at the same time, reinvigorated in my own faith, to see you like this, like a child, advancing towards God with shining eyes, almost smiling, arms thrown forward... — as Agnès said, towards those who welcome you (on the other side), full of joy, kindness and love.

And I pray for each person, women, brothers, sisters, cousins, children, relatives and friends that God blesses you all with love and brings you, during this period, all the peace, comfort and love. This love that transcends time and space, as do all our relationships. Because this is the true wealth that neither time nor space can indefinitely stop — since we too, one day will find our relatives and loved ones again, to continue (under the skies of the world of mansions) to learn to know, appreciate and love each other; with the angels that before we could not see, and so many new personalities, all more loving and benevolent — continuing our journey together...

See you soon, Guy, I love you.

Your brother Eric
