Revisiting the life and teachings of Jesus always sets the record straight, at least that's what it does for me. And the amazing thing is that each time the truth becomes more illuminating and more obvious.

The two great motives of Jesus' mission on earth after his baptism were: to reveal the Father to humans, and to bring them to be aware of their sonship through faith.

Does knowing _The Urantia Book_ make us better sons of God? In any case, that is the goal. And then, does it make us sowers of truth in our family, with our children, with our spouse, with our friends, our work colleagues? That too should challenge us!

All humans are different and we cannot present these truths equally to all in the same way. With discernment and the help of the Spirit of Truth, we build bridges between their beliefs and what The Urantia Book says, we build on a truth already gained and elevate the spiritual conversation. We will gauge what needs to be shared, either by the dropper, the teaspoon or the big spoon. No one can receive these extraordinary teachings in a predetermined format.

This is the responsibility that has fallen upon us since we have had _The Urantia Book_ in our hands.

> Jesus ***. . . becoming the new and living way whereby all mortals may so ascend from humanity to divinity.*** (<a id="a36_114"></a>[UB 196:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p2_4))

## Annual General Meeting (AGM) Presentation of the 2019 balance sheet

_Normand Laperle_
Lévis

A 2019 AUQ Annual General Meeting (AGM) — by ZOOM — took place on Saturday, June 6, 2020, from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. This was a first for the AUQ.

Eighteen (18) people found themselves packed in like sardines...each on our computer screens to learn about what the AUQ had accomplished for us in 2019 and what it plans for the year 2020.

It didn't smell like human skin. It smelled more like ... the joy of meeting in this time of COVID confinement. Person-to-person meetings meet a fundamental human need. Look — in the next photo — at the smiles on people's faces. A contagious smile. I don't think it's an adornment. I see in it the desire to create a meaningful relationship, the simple pleasure of being together.

</figure>

In the end, there were elections for the renewal of the positions of Vice-President and Secretary. Jean Pierre Cadieux kept his position as Vice-President for another 2 years. The position of Secretary changed from Robert Cadieux to Claudette Gonthier.

</figure>

If you are interested in the taste of service, **<ins>next year</ins> it will be the turn to renew the positions of president and treasurer**.

Think about it. You don't need to have any experience already. You just need to have a sincere desire to push yourself—just a little bit. **The elders will be there to help you and support you in your accomplishments**. If you feel the call, it may be that your time has come... Others have done it before you.

## The Word of God!

_Robert Cedilot_
Varennes

In this time of pandemic, many of us, while being logical and normal, are asking ourselves all sorts of questions about what will happen next. Will we have learned something by going through this very exceptional period?

In my humble opinion, if we have the courage and the reflex to see the state of the situation now, I believe it is **our duty** to **search and find the best ways to change each of us personally**; it is there and only there that we will be able to make serious and effective changes for the good of our planet. It may even be a question of survival.

Life means very different things to each of us. But what exactly is life? It is also important to realize that life is not the result of chance, but was thought out, designed and planned by a Great Creator called God.

But who is this God and where does He live?
This Almighty God lives in the very center of the universe in the part we call the Island of Paradise. It is an immeasurable space that has existed forever and will always exist. This eternal island in its entirety is made up of pure energy that allows God to breathe all the reality of this great Creation.

At the same time this God is present in us with all his identity of love, intelligence, goodness, wisdom, peace, longanimity, benevolence, joy, patience, understanding, gentleness and all this in a spirit of sharing with his brothers and sisters.

In addition, this God of infinite goodness has given us free will as a bonus. By this gift, he shows us that he is not a dictator. We are free to believe in him through a living faith or to reject him, with no other consequence than to find ourselves in nothingness. It is utopian to believe that a God of Love could have created a hell to burn them eternally.

This almighty God has always had as his ultimate goal to instruct us through the prophets and the various revelations. He even sent his son Jesus who tried his utmost to deliver the truth to us and to invite us to do his will, so that we become like him, that is to say more and more perfect as He Himself is perfect.

> “***Jesus did not vehemently denounce even the Pharisees, as did John. He knew many of the scribes and Pharisees were honest of heart; he understood their enslaving bondage to religious traditions. Jesus laid great emphasis on “first making the tree good.” He impressed the three that he valued the whole life, not just a certain few special virtues.***” ([LU 140:8.22](/fr/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_22))

It is worth taking a moment of reflection, to fully realize the value of this gift called life. If we succeed in fulfilling his holy will, we will have the possibility of developing the consciousness of a human life dominated by the spirit of truth, a life of service, of endless love which will finally fulfill <ins>the great desires that we all have, for peace, joy, happiness</ins>, thanks to a brotherhood of sharing, wisdom, kindness, gentleness, benevolence, patience, temperance and understanding.

Some mortals have already begun to understand the reality of this inspiring and encouraging truth that <ins>the kingdom of God is not money, temporal power, meat and drink, but righteousness, sharing, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit and for eternity!</ins>

This kingdom of God already exists in the hearts of all those who seek this God of Love who wishes to bring all his children into his paradise to live an eternal superior life where we will all walk towards more and more perfection and which will allow us one day to have the capacity to see face to face this almighty God and thus to enjoy his eternal goodness. It is now up to us to make the right choice!

The ideal human state is one in which philosophy, religion and science are welded into a meaningful unity by the joint action of wisdom, faith and experience.

## Upcoming activities
