## Word from the President

_Line St-Pierre_
president@urantiaqc.org

During the last two meetings of the board of directors, the members of the board worked on the development of a 2018 activity calendar and the redesign of the 2018-2021 strategic plan.

We will focus on two areas of service, including reader support and study group host support, as our mission is:
- To help each person meet the challenge of establishing a better relationship with the divine within them. In this effort to increase cosmic consciousness and enhance spiritual perception, we desire that each human comes to individually recognize the fatherhood of God and thus live universal brotherhood.
- To promote this personal development, to create an environment conducive to sharing our spiritual life, the _Urantia Association of Quebec_ encourages the creation and maintenance of Urantia Book study groups, presents conferences and organizes thematic meetings.

With the help of committed AUQ readers, you can read the Tidings newsletter in French, informing you how other students are using _The Urantia Book_ in their country. **The latest issue** can be found at https://urantia-association.org/newsletter/tidings-septembre2017/?lang=fr\&print=true.

I particularly enjoyed the article by my friend Lourdes Burga-Cisneros from Peru entitled “***Passing the Torch of Light to Future Generations***” available at: https://urantiaassociation.org/2017/passer-le-flambeaude-lumiere-aux-generations-futures/?lang=fr.

All planned AUQ activities are listed **on our website** under the **activity calendar** heading at [www.urantia-quebec.ca](www.urantia-quebec.ca).

You are invited to the **Holiday Brunch** which will take place on **December 10th from 11am to 3pm at the Best Western Hotel in Saint-Jérôme**. This activity is an opportunity to socialize with other students and develop the fraternity found in the group. For a few years now, a small room has been reserved that can accommodate about thirty people and we meet there in joy, to eat, to sing in chorus accompanied by reader-musicians! The cost is $19.95.

Please **make your presence known** by calling 450-565-3323 or writing to association.urantia.quebec@gmail.com.

The year 2018 will be busy with these regional and international meetings of The Urantia Book. From **April 12 to 15**, Robert Cadieux, Gaétan Charland and I will participate in the ***10th International Congress of the Urantia Association International*** **in Amsterdam, the Netherlands**. Meeting students from other cultures and making new friends is always very enriching. Would you like to live this experience? Here is the address of the site where you will find all the details. [http://www.uai2018.org/index/fr](http://www.uai2018.org/index/fr).

From November 1st to 7th in Toronto, ***The Parliament of the World's Religions*** will be held. For this purpose, the International Association, Urantia Foundation and the Fellowship will hold a Urantia Book kiosk. Alain Cyr, Gaétan Charland and I from Quebec will represent the UAI with other students from elsewhere to answer questions from passers-by during this event that is expecting around 12,000 visitors of all religions. For the second time, I will live this unforgettable experience of great fraternity. To participate, you will find all the details of this gathering at: https://parliamentofreligions.org/parliament/2018-toronto/toronto-2018.

Recently it was brought to our attention that the [**French publication mandate**](/en/article/The_Publication_Mandate) did not accurately reflect the English text and therefore a small team of volunteers revised the French document which you can find at the following address: http://urantia-quebec.ca/a_propos_mission.php.

Have you already explored **our website** under the heading **readers' work**? There is a huge amount of student work and many books and images on different themes that The Urantia Book addresses. You can see it at: http://urantia-quebec.ca/publications_textes_des_lecteurs.php.

## Comment from a participant in the thematic day of October 15, 2017

_Gilles Bertrand_

**Spiritual Perception from the Angle of Lucifer's Rebellion**

The opening of this meeting was initiated by the words of welcome from our AUQ president, Line St-Pierre.

The thirty or so people then listened to the reading of the AUQ's mission. This very significant mission is stated as follows:

“Our mission (A.U.Q.) is to help each person take up the great challenge of establishing a better relationship with the divine within them. In this effort to increase cosmic consciousness and enhance spiritual perception, we desire that each human being comes to individually recognize the fatherhood of God and thus live universal brotherhood. To promote this personal development, to create an environment conducive to sharing our spiritual life, the _Urantia Association of Quebec_ encourages the creation and maintenance of study groups of ”_The Urantia Book_“, presents conferences and organizes thematic meetings.”

Then came a moment of silent contemplation.

Then, Gaétan Charland presented us with the menu for this thematic day, divided into two main themes: “_The perception of Reality..._” and the “_repercussions of Lucifer's rebellion..._” Gaétan also reminded us of the advantages of using the net (Zoom application) during study group meetings. This video system is also practical in case of bad weather, illness or distance.

Our first speaker was Jacques Loranger. He made us think through concrete examples that in general the perception of an object or concept could be influenced by countless factors, thus distorting the reality under observation. Jacques made us experience these debates and confusions that can also be observed everywhere on our still darkened planet. His many life experiences, particularly parental, surprised us all because at one point, he adopted with his life partner 5 children in need. This is perhaps where he began to reflect on the perceptions or actions of the people around him. Reality is often perceived differently for each of us and the family is a perfect example to illustrate this phenomenon.

The morning ended with a gripping interview with Robert Cadieux, our devoted secretary. He introduced himself personally and gave, among other things, a description of the events surrounding Lucifer's rebellion to begin Gaétan's work scheduled for the afternoon.

One of the subjects of part of his speech was that Lucifer questioned the reality of the Universal Father, the universal government of Michael, the Creator Son and attacked the universal plan of education of ascending mortals. Of course, reactions of all kinds were numerous at that time...

As you might expect, the table was then set for future discussions and the afternoon started off strong with the conference by Gaétan Charland whose subject was as follows: The Temporal Framework of the Judgment of Lucifer's Rebellion “_Be as cunning as serpents..._” said Jesus.

Gaétan took Chuck Thurston's (United States) place so to speak because he presented Chuck's article which we can find in the [AUI Journal of December 2012](http://urantia-quebec.ca/media/journal/journal_2012_12_0_20.pdf) (The full published article is available on the AUQ website).

By evidence of excerpts from the Urantia Book and other valid clues Gaetan estimated the possible end of the rebellion at the planetary level, between 100,000 and 800,000 years. Here is an interesting excerpt, taken from Chuck Thurston's article.

“_I think it is most important to examine this question in the light of the teachings given to us in The Urantia Book. Those of us who hold the Urantia revelation to be the final and best authority on this matter should do all we can to arrive at a common understanding._

_...the settlement of the matter cannot be completed until ALL sympathy disappears, including on the mortal level._ ”

The conclusion of this day was given by the participants who gathered in a circle to express their opinion or perception on the questions proposed to us by Marc Belleau, our treasurer at the AUQ. Group leader Marc was unable to complete all the questions as participation and interest were so high. Our discussions on our perception and spiritual growth were unfortunately shortened by the lack of time at the end of this Sunday afternoon.

Even though Marc maintained an effervescent pace in an attempt to elucidate or finish all the questions he had skillfully prepared, he was unable to contain all the enthusiasm of some interlocutors who took possession of the time allocated to the day's schedule, so great was the interest once again.

I would like to greet and thank the organizers of this most interesting theme and I invite everyone to take part in the next meeting of the Urantia Association of Quebec.

May God fill you with all his graces until our next meeting.

## Theme in Montreal, October 15, 2017

**Theme Perceptions and Spiritual Growth**

Good morning,

Let me introduce myself, my name is Robert Cadieux. I was born in Montreal on April 16, 1948, I am 69 years old. _The Urantia Book_ and I; we met in 1971, I was 23 years old and since then, the wisdom of the teachings contained in the Book inspires and guides me.

I am pleased to be here to talk and discuss about perceptions and spiritual growth. About our sensitivity to spirituality, about our personal dedication, about our commitment to having our mind communicate with spirit—with the divine within us.

Perception is a broad word. I tend to associate it first with spiritual perception; at the same time, perceptions are of all kinds. For example: do we perceive? Do we realize that we are at the dawn of the blossoming of the religion that will become world-wide? The religion that Jesus taught—the religion of personal spiritual experience?

The revealers have said in the Mandate of Publication: “You who have dedicated your lives to the service of the Book and the Brotherhood can scarcely realize the importance of your actions. Doubtless you will live and die without fully understanding that you are participating in the birth of a new age of religion in this world.”

For today's theme, we thought we'd take the angle of the 'Lucifer Rebellion'.

I, a simple mortal, have difficulty in perceiving how a personality of light, a brilliant being, a leader, an administrator with so much experience, who had been chosen from more than 700,000 personalities of his species as the most suitable to become the leader of a system that could contain 1,000 inhabited planets, could have gone astray, allowed himself to be invaded and possessed by pride. For us, he was one of the gods of the sky, the third Father that we can recognize after our biological father and the planetary Adam.

What was Lucifer's perception that he came to want to change the plan of progression? He had been created perfect and he succumbed to the pressure of the self and the sophistries of false personal freedom. Slowly, surreptitiously, the idea of wanting to change the cosmic plan, the divine law, settled into him.

I'm going to give a short summary of the beginning of the rebellion; how it happened. This will give us some ideas for discussing the theme of the day.

The Lucifer Manifesto was proclaimed at the annual conclave of Satania, on the Sea of Glass. The revolt took the form of the “Luciferian Declaration of Liberty.”

He presented his case in three sections:

1- **The reality of the Universal Father.** — Lucifer claimed that the Universal Father did not really exist, that the Father was a myth invented by the Paradise Sons to allow them to retain power over the universes in the name of the Father.

He denied that personality was a gift from the Universal Father. He even insinuated that the finaliters were in league with the Paradise Sons to introduce fraud into all creation, for they never brought back a clear idea of the actual personality of the Father as discerned on Paradise. He called respect ignorance. Wow!

2- **The Universal Government of Michael, the Creator Son**. — Lucifer maintained that local systems should be self-governing. He protested the right of Michael, the Creator Son, to assume the sovereignty of Nebadon in the name of a hypothetical Paradise Father and to demand that all personalities acknowledge their allegiance to this invisible Father. He maintained that immortality was inherent in the personalities of the system, that resurrection was natural and automatic, and that all beings were prevented from eternal life only by the arbitrary and unjust acts of the executive agents of the Ancients of Days.

Well! So he had lost faith.

3- **The Attack on the Universal Plan of Education for Ascending Mortals**. — Lucifer maintained that far too much time and energy was being expended in instructing ascending mortals so thoroughly in the principles of universe administration, principles which he termed unethical and unsound.

He argued that ascenders should enjoy the freedom to determine their own fate.

He defied and condemned the entire plan of mortal ascension sponsored by the Paradise Sons of God and approved by the Infinite Spirit.

And it was with this Declaration of Liberty that Lucifer unleashed his orgy of darkness and death.

Holy crap!
