_Gaetan G. Charland_
president@urantiaqc.org

Hello members and friends of the association,

During the past month I have sent you a message regarding a petition for unity in the Urantia movement. While most of you may not feel concerned about such an initiative, I would like to invite you to change your attitude by broadening your view of the Urantia movement and its mission.

Many of you may be more or less familiar with the story surrounding the 1989 separation between the Urantia Foundation and the Brotherhood. In fact, as I mentioned in my message about the petition, we Quebecers were largely spared from the conflict generated by this separation. There is no need to go back in time to explore the reasons for this separation. We could come away even more confused and discouraged by seeing the state of mind that prevailed at that time in the hearts of those who had embarked on this path of separation.

Dear friends and students,

For more than twenty years, UBIS has offered free online courses designed to provide readers with first-hand experience with the teachings of _The Urantia Book_.

Our approach is simple. You study the suggested readings based on your chosen course topic, answer the suggested questions, and then share your answers with each other. Classes are led by trained volunteers. You can participate in the class at any time of the day or week, on your own schedule. Plan on a minimum of three to five hours per week.

**Divine Fatherhood and Morontia Life**

by _Conrad Lavallée_, Quebec

Reflection, firstly, on the experiential transformations and profound spiritual impacts that result from the recognition of divine Paternity. Secondly, the presenter will draw attention to interesting changes that will characterize our way of life following our arrival in the world of houses.

## Jesus was what he said

_Samuel Heine_
Reunion Island

The greatest psychologist or psychotherapist of all time is once again Jesus (Smile).

Jesus was what he said, his message is what he is, and it is what he encourages us to be: “discover who we really are and access our conscious eternity”.

I think there are mainly two obstacles that prevent us from taking on the only challenge that is really worthwhile in a short life: either we are not yet ready and we will have to wait for maturity or a liberating inner crisis, or we do not read carefully enough and we do not put it into practice.

In all cases, our adjuster continues to point us in the right direction.

## Jesus Picnic 2023

<figure id="Figure_4" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">

_Robert Cadieux_
Montreal

The annual AUQ picnic to celebrate the birthday of Jesus 2029 years ago, August 21, took place on a superb, warm, sunny day, as usual at Mount Royal Park in Montreal, Sunday August 20. The location is ideal, under the tall trees and very close to Beaver Lake.

How I would like 30 - 40 - 50 of us to gather there to see each other in person, to fraternize by discussing the spirit that inhabits us and the revelation that brings us together and makes our hearts vibrate. We have this feeling of being a core of human brothers and sisters who are living the start of the next great religious adventure of humanity, precursor of what will be the religious future of our world on the way to the dawn of the great adventure of the eras of light and life. To get there, humanity must tend towards the triune unity, that is to say: a world government, a common language and a personal religion adopted by all, the religion that Jesus came to teach us, the religion of personal spiritual experience <a id="a134_731"></a>[[UB 155:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p6_8)]. Jesus came to reveal the Father to us and lead us to the Father <a id="a134_842"></a>[[UB 165:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p3_8)].

_Dr William S Sadler MD_

The composition of this text is based on the book [“The Urantia Book Workbooks, volume III”](/en/article/William_S_Sadler/Workbook_3_Topical_and_Doctrinal_Studies) by Dr. William S. Sadler, MD.

After reading this book by Dr. Sadler, I found it so interesting that I first decided to translate it into French, and secondly to share with you these pearls of knowledge and wisdom! In fact, it is more of a translation than a composition, because my contribution is limited to the text under each subtitle.

**Introduction**

Based on the revelations contained in _The Urantia Book_, it is possible to formulate certain hypotheses about the destiny of evolutionary beings similar to us populating the myriad of planets of the seven superuniverses. Taking into account the finality of perfection reached during each of the ages of the universe, it becomes possible, by following a certain logic and a bit of clairvoyance, to identify what we will become during these ages so far away!

**Absolute Level Reality**

In order to properly situate each of the levels of reality and their possibilities of progression, let us begin with the highest and most real, because it is from all eternity. At this level of existence, there are only three personalities, namely the Universal Father, the Eternal Son and the Infinite Spirit. They are the only persons possessing as attributes absoluteness, existentiality, eternity and infinity. These are the three personal expressions of the I AM constituting, by the union of their divinity in the Paradise Trinity, the absolute totality of the Deity. All possible realities are existent in spirit at this level. These three absolute deities know the perfection of virtues both pre-existent and post-experiential.

## Fun game

Here is a fun game concocted by our friend André Pominville. It is a grid to complete entirely devoted to terms used in _The Urantia Book_. The letters are shared when the words cross.

The solution to this grid can be found on the following page.

Good luck, and have fun!

**Horizontal**

- 3\. The primitive ocean was not \_\_\_\_ <a id="a193_43"></a>[UB 57:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p8_3)
- 5\. The awareness of having led a victorious life on earth is born from there \_\_\_\_ of a creature confronted with the terrible spectacle of human limitations, when at each recurring episode of its existence and without ever failing, it dares to proclaim this challenge: even if I cannot do this thing, someone lives in me who can do it and will do it, a fraction of the Absolute-Father of the universe of universes. <a id="a194_421"></a>[UB 4:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p4_9)
- 6\. Adj. [Speaking of a man, an animal] whose skull, elongated, has an anteroposterior diameter much longer than the transverse diameter. <a id="a195_140"></a>[UB 80:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p9_2)
- 7\. The adjutant mind-spirits grow in experience, but never become personal. They evolve in their function; and the function of the first five adjutants in the animal kingdom is, to some extent, essential to enable all seven to function as human \_\_\_\_. <a id="a196_258"></a>[UB 36:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5_13)
- 8\. I mentioned it in the August grid. <a id="a197_41"></a>[UB 86:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p2_3) If one event followed another, the savage attributed the cause and effect relationship to them.
- 10\. Pain and suffering are essential to progressive evolution. (unfailing changes due to a cause) <a id="a198_101"></a>[UB 86:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p2_1)

**Vertical**

- 1\. Cradle of morality. <a id="a202_26"></a>[UB 84:7.30](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p7_30)
- 2\. Moses made a heroic effort to exalt Yahweh to the dignity of a supreme Deity when he presented him as the “God of truth, without iniquity, just and upright in all his ways.” However, despite this high teaching, the \_\_\_\_ limited number of his followers made it necessary to speak of God as being in the image of man, subject to fits of anger, wrath and severity, and even vindictive and easily influenced by the conduct of men. <a id="a203_437"></a>[UB 96:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/96#p4_7)
- 4\. Heal or die “God is never the victim of antagonisms in his way of seeing. <a id="a204_80"></a>[UB 2:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p4_3), <a id="a204_121"></a>[UB 9:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/9#p1_8)” find a synonym please
- 9\. Man cannot hope to live up to his highest ideals, but it may be his intention to find God and become more and more like him. <a id="a205_131"></a>[UB 103:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p4_3)

This activity allows several readers of different levels of understanding to exchange and study together the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. It promotes spiritual progress by allowing its participants to find practical applications to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ in their daily lives. This important approach allows us to keep a broad point of view on the concepts of truth. You wish to participate or form a study group; we will be happy to assist you.
