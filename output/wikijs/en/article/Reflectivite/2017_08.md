## Word from the President

Line St-Pierre
president@urantiaqc.org

The summer season has begun and many study groups have adjourned for the holidays and will resume in the fall. From many years of being a participant in a study group, I know that it is a place of extraordinary intellectual and spiritual growth and progress. I have learned a great deal from the exchanges and shared understanding of the group members where everyone respectfully contributes to the growth of the group.

The adage that one becomes a blacksmith lends itself well to the following proposition.

The fervent and tireless servants of the small group “_The Christ Experiment_” suggest that we unite in spirit beginning July 1st by reading, either alone or in a group, one booklet per week of the Life and Teachings of Jesus. This idea, which they have called “PLANETARY UNITY INITIATIVE”, is intended as a way of fostering the association of thousands of committed individuals throughout the world to reintroduce “the real teachings of Jesus”, what they call “The Ministry of the Master”.

Progress is inevitable; this word is mentioned 667 times in the book and it is very important. Can I experience it?

Sons and daughters of God by faith, the study of The Urantia Book has contributed to the transformation of our being and by joining with the mass of students of The Urantia Book in the world and by being inspired by the teachings of Jesus we will strengthen ourselves to live, and see to the social, moral, economic and political reorganization of the world.

Who knows what the celestial beings have in store for us in the way of encounters and service opportunities to work more effectively with us as we seek to participate in the betterment of this planet!

## Comment on the theme of May 28

_Robert Cédilot,_
_Varennes_

Here I am at last. I wanted to attend this June theme but at the very last minute I had to make another choice, an important one too. Reading the report of this theme, I was able to happily see all the richness and depth of this meeting. I would have liked to be among you but it will probably be for the next one. I would like in turn to highlight the very fine participation of women in this theme because, as Normand says so well, [_ndlr: See Réflectivité \#306, June 2017, p.1_] we need your speech, we need you. Bravo to you Line Saint-Pierre, you are breathing new energy into our group and it is fantastic.

For my part, for several years I have been actively involved in the volunteer work of my community and I immediately understood the importance of getting in touch with these elderly people who need a presence so much, of listening to these people who are too often neglected, of opening my heart to them and above all of loving them. What a beautiful gift God gives me by putting all these people on my path because of course I do it for HIM according to His will, and there I am feeling from Him a joy as well as a deep peace and I believe that it is a small glimpse of paradise. I am a fulfilled man that is why I strive despite my human weaknesses to awaken my consciousness more to His presence in me, by thanking Him as often as possible. Also, as soon as I feel the right ground I introduce them to the presence of the Urantia Book and I admit that I have had some success on this side.

Also during this theme it is a question of attracting young people, it goes without saying that we have the essential need for a dynamic succession. The challenge is very great but I am convinced that by letting ourselves be guided by Our Father that He will know how to inspire us to find ways to attract them to Him so that they can in turn discover and finally know Him.

I invite you all to join me in this prayer. God make me your humble instrument of love, make me your channel of healing of minds and souls.

Fraternally!

## Parables in the manner of Jesus

_Paul-Yvan Deléglise_
_Old Lorette, Quebec_

_[Continued from the same title in Réflectivité \#306 June 2017, p.3]_

**II. The Parable of the Prodigal Son**

(Jesus' favorite parable)

After recalling the “parable of the lost son” (the lost sheep) <a id="a67_63"></a>[UB 169:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/169#p1_1), then that of the “lost silver coin” <a id="a67_144"></a>[UB 169:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/169#p1_4), Jesus said to the crowd: “_Now I would like to tell you the story of the brainless son._” <a id="a67_279"></a>[UB 169:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/169#p1_5)

He did this at length and in great detail.

Let us briefly recall this story: A rich farmer had two sons with very different personalities. The younger one was cheerful, carefree, lazy and shirking responsibilities. His older brother was serious, calm, hard-working and responsible. The two quarreled constantly. The situation became so painful that the younger one went to his father and asked him for his share of the inheritance. The father gave it to him.

This son squandered his fortune until he became poor and hungry. He decided to return to his father, ask for forgiveness and be counted among his hired servants.

The father had been very saddened by his son's departure and he still hoped for his return. Seeing him coming from afar, he ran to meet him, embraced him and, without giving him time to speak, he made a great feast and welcomed him back into his family.

**The central and essential Truth of this parable:**

> “_This was one of the most touching and effective of all the parables which Jesus ever presented to impress upon his hearers the Father’s willingness to receive all who seek entrance into the kingdom of heaven._” (<a id="a79_216"></a>[UB 169:1.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/169#p1_14))

He himself revealed the essential truth: “You have been taught that your admission to God comes after your repentance and as a consequence of all your works of sacrifice and penance, but I assure you that the Father accepts you even before you have repented.” <a id="a81_260"></a>[UB 169:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/169#p1_3)

The Urantia Book reminds us of this central truth in its first paper: “The Universal Father is the God of all creation, the First Source and Center of all things and beings. Think of God first as a creator, then as a controller, and finally as an infinite sustainer.” <a id="a83_268"></a>[UB 1:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p0_1)

> “_The divine nature can also be better understood by man if he regards himself as a child of God and looks up to the Paradise Creator as a true spiritual Father._” (<a id="a85_167"></a>[UB 2:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p0_1))

**Flight of speculative imagination:**

This parable of the Prodigal Son, a story of Jesus' preaching, can give rise to several “Flights of speculative imagination”. I was therefore tempted to make one of them, by asking myself the following question, transposing the parable into current social and family situations: Are we in the presence of a sexist parable that is unusable today?

I asked this question to my companion. She reproached me for spending my time on futile reflections. She confirmed to me that she herself understood very well the message of Jesus in this story of a father and his two sons: The father represented there is God himself, our Father, who does not have only two sons! His sons are innumerable, they are all the humans of the Universe whether they are women or men, girls or boys!

This parable was conceived in the Hebrew family and social context of the time of Jesus; to want to take it out of this context is to take away the message, the central and essential thought that it contains.

This parable was Jesus' favorite!

**III. The Parable of the Talents**

(This is the path of believers to the spiritual realm.) <a id="a99_56"></a>[UB 148:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/148#p6_10)

**Background**: On the afternoon of the Tuesday before Passover, as the apostles were returning to their camp in Gethsemane, Jesus announced to them the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple. He reminded them again of his imminent departure to his Father. He rebuked them for their concept of the kingdom.

The destruction of the temple of Jerusalem, which seemed indestructible to them, led the apostles to conclude that catastrophes, wars and even the destruction of the world were imminent. As for the reminder of Jesus' departure to his Father, it plunged them into deep anxiety and insecurity.

When evening came, the apostles and some disciples, desiring greater clarity, gathered around a campfire. Thomas then turned to Jesus and asked him: “Since you must return to complete the work of the kingdom, what will be our attitude while you are away?” <a id="a105_256"></a>[UB 176:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p3_1).

Jesus found, once again, that his apostles had failed to understand the spiritual nature of the kingdom to which he was inviting them. He looked at them in the light of the fire and answered Thomas: “Even you, Thomas, fail to understand what I have said. Have I not constantly taught you that your connection with the kingdom is spiritual and individual, that it is entirely a matter of personal experience in the spirit, realizing by faith that you are sons of God? What more shall I say?” <a id="a107_491"></a>[UB 176:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p3_2)

He added:

- That the fall of nations, the destruction of unbelieving Jews, or the end of the world did not concern those who opted for the spiritual kingdom;
- That eternal life was assured to those who have faith, a living faith, which increasingly manifests the fruits of the divine spirit...

Of all the speeches he gave to his apostles, this was the speech that threw them into the greatest confusion. Seeing this, Jesus asked them to let him tell them a parable, the parable of the talents.

**Brief reminder of the parable of the talents:**

This parable being very well known, here is a brief presentation:

"A certain master, going far away, entrusted his goods to his servants, who were to render an account to him when he returned. To one he entrusted five talents, to another two talents, to a third one talent.

_The first two doubled the stake by their work. They were congratulated and promoted. It did not matter whether the profit was two or five talents. Each had made it bear fruit according to the gifts received and according to his abilities. The congratulations were not based on the profit of the master but on the work of each, according to his measure._

_The third servant had done nothing and had buried his talent. He had been afraid or rather he justified his laziness by the rigor of his master. He was blamed for having done nothing. If with his talent, he had produced a second talent, just one, he would have had the same congratulations as the first two..._ ”

Cf. The Parable of the Talents. Bible text. New Testament.

**The central and essential Truth of this parable**

Even after his answer to Thomas, even after his account of the talents, Jesus provided elaborate clarifications on the deeper meaning of this parable. Here is one of the excerpts that respond to Thomas' question and the concerns of his apostles:

> “_You cannot stand still in the affairs of the eternal kingdom. My Father requires all his children to grow in grace and in a knowledge of the truth. You who know these truths must yield the increase of the fruits of the spirit and manifest a growing devotion to the unselfish service of your fellow servants. And remember that, inasmuch as you minister to one of the least of my brethren, you have done this service to me._” (<a id="a132_429"></a>[UB 176:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p3_5))

> “_And so should you go about the work of the Father’s business, now and henceforth, even forevermore. Carry on until I come. In faithfulness do that which is intrusted to you, and thereby shall you be ready for the reckoning call of death. And having thus lived for the glory of the Father and the satisfaction of the Son, you shall enter with joy and exceedingly great pleasure into the eternal service of the everlasting kingdom._” (<a id="a134_437"></a>[UB 176:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p3_6))

**Flight of speculative imagination:**

This parable does not lend itself to a speculative flight. But it previously caused me a certain unease: why was it that he, and he alone, who had received only one talent and who had not managed to produce another talent was treated so harshly by his master? I had to remind myself, finally, that our Father in heaven, infinitely good and infinitely just, does not judge us according to the talents received, but according to those we accumulate by our service to His children, our brothers and sisters!

Three days before his departure, the Master presented this parable to his apostles in order to support them in the great trial that awaited them. He thus answered the question: “What should we do when you are gone?”

Jesus was trying to say to the apostles and then to each of the believers: “This is the way!”

## Question from a reader

How do lonely readers get to grips with The Urantia Book?
Can we do it alone?
Answer anyone?...

## Inspiration of the moment

_(From an anonymous reader)_

Between two atoms there is a void;
Between two noises, there is silence;
Between two thoughts there is mental peace.

> “_It is not so much that man is conscious of God as that man yearns for God that results in universe ascension. What you are today is not so important as what you are becoming day by day and in eternity._” (<a id="a158_209"></a>[UB 111:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_5))

## If...

If you are alone, think of Him who Is
If you feel tired, drink the spring
Fresh Hope and Light Energy
who is everywhere.

If you feel Time weighing on your years,
Think of the Immensity of Paradise
Where time has no importance.

If you sometimes feel exiled among humans
Who only think about living
Without thinking about Life,
Let Life unfold its program
And rest your soul at the Source
Of the Future that is being accomplished.

_(Anne-Marie RONFET)_
