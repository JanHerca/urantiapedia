## Party at Michael, Montreal

_Melanie Olivier_
_Lévis_

As I open my eyes this morning, I remember that today is not a day like any other. I remember with an upward blink that 2024 years ago, a child, in the name of Jesus, came into this world to teach man brotherhood.

What a joy to celebrate with my brothers and sisters in faith the birthday of Jesus, son of Joseph and Mary. It is 9:30 am and the road signs indicate Montreal. I suddenly see “Lac aux Castors”, where our meeting is taking place. It is an intimate place. Out of the 35+ Quebec editions of this event, it is not surprising that this is the fourth year that Urantia readers, seekers of the beautiful, the good and the true, meet here, around this small lake of calm water surrounded by deciduous trees and small hills. It is neither hot nor cold, a perfect temperature for a precious meeting. The rays of sunlight pass through the branches and surround us with their warm arms. The squirrels come to watch us out of the corner of their eyes, hurtling down the bark with ease. One can only be amazed by this creation.

People abound, a mix of races and joyful sentiments can be seen. Several families have gathered to go canoeing, play frisbee and eat outdoors. Others have met at the “Café des Amis” to sip a fruity herbal tea by the lake.

Between us, harmony, simplicity and Authenticity are felt to the end of our hearts. Around a picnic table, we share the lively world of the material world like grapes, sandwich rolls, raw vegetables and homemade hummus. We sing to compositions by Félix Leclerc and Marc Gélinas. A few musicians share their talent with us by mutual agreement. We talk about who we are and what is most sacred in us, this humble voice that whispers our essence and asks for connection to the Other. It is sweet and it is the prelude to a great destiny as if with a flick of the eyelashes upwards we had a strange feeling that the Reign of Michael on earth had already arrived.

We quickly realize that it is five o'clock and that we are already leaving.

When Jesus, the master, said: “You are the salt of the earth, a salt having a taste of salvation...” (<a id="a35_102"></a>[UB 140:3.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p3_12)). We each continue our path with a nourished soul and creative ideas that abound. We consider ourselves lucky to have touched the good, the beautiful and the true today.

We thank the Creator.

## Picnic during the feast of Jesus in Montreal

_Robert Cadieux_
_Montreal_

_[Modified, in part by Normand Laperle, Editor-in-Chief, to adapt it to Réflectivité]_

_[The following text was composed and delivered by Robert Cadieux during our meeting on Sunday, August 20, 2017 at “Lac aux Castors” on Mount Royal, in Montreal._

_We sang several songs, among others. One of them stood out because of its lyrics inspired by “The Urantia Book.”_

_Here is the speech given by Robert (adjusted for Réflectivité), as well as the lyrics to this song.]_

Here we are gathered again to celebrate the birth of Jesus who was born on a day like today, August 21, 7 BC at noon, 2024 years ago.

Life is grand, and perhaps we are hardly aware of it, because we have little perception of true spiritual realities. However, through faith and through conscious awareness of the ministry of the spirit within us, we can become aware of it. I think it is partly this religious feeling that motivates us to come together, to be together on an occasion like today.

Physical death is only the end of a first stage, of an endless career. This is partly what Jesus came to teach us by coming to live human life himself in the likeness of a physical body. He came to teach us the consciousness of God in the evolution of human life and the continuation of life in the universal career.

Ultimately, we are here in our human life to develop our consciousness of God, which is everywhere, here as in Paradise; but God is also present within us. It is with this divine presence, our Thought Adjuster, that we are destined to merge and thus become an ascending universe personality. In the meantime, as a human living in a physical body here on earth, we are sons and daughters of God by faith—this is the prelude to our union with God.

How lucky we are to live here on earth, in Quebec, in a part of the world at peace, knowing that there are many problems elsewhere. These problems are still linked to power struggles and religions. The religious feeling that is very present in human beings leads them to create religions and to convince everyone that they should think the same way and have the same beliefs.

It is not easy to seek and find the truth in the tumult. However, we know that the truth exists and that it must guide us. Today, we celebrate the birthday of Jesus who is the representative of peace. During his apparitions, his first words were: “_Peace be with you._”

So, I propose here a song of humor and joy. Sometimes, it is not so much the lyrics of the songs that are important but the atmosphere that they give off and the joyful pleasure that they bring us. The lyrics of this song came to me while I was singing in the shower, and I remembered the hit song “Les millionnaires du dimanche”, and I imagined changing the lyrics of the chorus to “_Les agondontaires de la terre_”.

Agondontarians, in the Urantia Book, are described as humans who can “_believe without seeing, persevere in isolation, and triumph over almost insurmountable odds, even when alone_” (<a id="a66_183"></a>[UB 50:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p7_2)). And that is the case for us, earthlings who do not have a headquarters with a planetary Prince or material Sons and Daughters like Adam and Eve. We believe in God by faith, without material proof or direct testimony. That inspired me to write this song.

Here you go friends!

### The Agondontaries of the Earth

Performed by the Friends of Urantia on August 20, 2017, at the Jesus Day Picnic in Mount Royal Park in Montreal.

It's a beautiful day, it's good to see each other again
It's party time
From Michael our brother in the flesh
On the earth
We are here among friends, and that's good.
Our business
To have a picnic and sing this chorus
Of hope

**\{Refrain\}**
**The Agondontaries of the Earth**
**Have a planetary vision**
**For beneficial effects**
**To be shared between brothers**
**The Agondontaries of the Earth**
**Have extraordinary faith**
**An Appetite for Love**
**Joy and sweetness**

In Nazareth Jesus became aware
Of its nature
Becoming the brother-father of a family
Ordinary
Then, musician, tutor, traveler
Without borders
He amazed, taught, met
Everyone

**\{To the Chorus\}**

When Michael left Salvington
Towards the land
To complete its effusion missions
As a man
He came to show us the way
His message
That all men are brothers and that God
Is our Father

**\{To the Chorus\}**

> “_When man recognizes only the works of God, he is led to fear the Supreme; but when man begins to understand and experience the personality and character of the living God, he is led increasingly to love such a good and perfect, universal and eternal Father. And it is just this changing of the relation of man to God that constitutes the mission of the Son of Man on earth._” (<a id="a123_381"></a>[UB 149:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p6_3))

## Question from a reader

_[Published in Réflectivité \#307 — August 2017]_

**Question**: How do lonely readers get through The Urantia Book? Can you do it alone?

## Reader's response

_Guy Le Blanc — Saint-Antoine-de-Tilly_

My dear friend,

Your question concerns me. I discovered the URANTIA Cosmogony in 1972. I had been a researcher for a very long time and had read many books. After reading the Book several times, I began to study it alone. I meditated every day after reading it.

With my open mind, the search for understanding was not long in coming. I was no longer alone. I was being worked with.

Later I started looking for other people like me to share knowledge.

Today I still walk it alone, in wonder. On several occasions I find myself in the friendly company of reading groups. It does a lot of good for the mind.

At your pleasure, my brother.
