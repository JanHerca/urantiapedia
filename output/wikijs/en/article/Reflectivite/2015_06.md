## 2015 Sherbrooke International Congress

_Gaétan G. Charland_
_Event Organizer_

Hello readers,

There are only two months left until the Urantia International Conference 2015 which will be held at Bishops University in the Sherbrooke area. We have received some comments about the conference program, there seems to be confusion about its content and orientation. Some have told us that they are not interested in it, because according to their perception it will only talk about family and the education of children. I invite you to carefully reread the program and examine its content. You will see that yes it does talk about the education of children, but also about their growth to adulthood, which concerns us all.

_The Urantia Book_ places great emphasis on family, society and education within these entities, because this is where our entire life takes place, from child to adult. As adults we can play the role of parent, grandparent, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, godfather and godmother and also of man and woman, married or single. Each of these roles carries responsibilities and great opportunities, chances to learn and teach, by our example, by our words, by our exchanges and by our actions which all rely on the values and their meanings that we have acquired and integrated into our philosophy of life.

The purpose of the conference is to explore, learn and share how we can contribute to the spiritual and intellectual development of the individual at different stages of our lives, through family and society, whether we are teenagers, young adults or mature adults. It is not just about learning and listening, but also about sharing with other students our own experiences and experiences with the teachings of The Urantia Book and how we apply or have applied them in our families as parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, aunts and uncles.

There will not only be speeches, there will also be many workshops in English and French where you will be able to participate in enriching, rewarding and edifying exchanges. The simple fact of being in the company of people who have the same hopes as we do for our world should be a sufficient reason to justify your presence at this conference. What do we, readers from Quebec, have to offer to these visitors, readers who want to know us, who want to know how we live the teachings of The Urantia Book at home?

Will you be there?

## ERRATUM

An error has crept into the May 2015 Réflectivité.

In the article “***Why attend the Lennoxville Congress***”, it is written “_the next international congress marks a first in the history of the Urantian movement in La Belle Province. It is the first time that a similar event has taken place in Quebec._”.

In fact, there was another congress in Quebec before this one. Here is what the document “_Chronology of the Urantian movement in Quebec_” available on the AUQ website says about it (http://urantia-quebec.ca/a_propos_historique.php).

" <ins>From July 31 to August 5, 1993</ins>, international readers' congress in St-Hyacinthe, organized by the Chicago Fellowship.

_The organization of the event was under the direction of Brent St Denis. There was also among the organizers, the active participation of about ten readers, members of the G.A._ [Groupe d'Action des Lecteurs du _Livre d'Urantia_ du Québec (G.A.L.L.U.Q.)]. _The theme of this congress was: “A world to join”. Nearly a thousand readers from 15 countries attended this large bilingual gathering with simultaneous translations on the radio. This congress, for the first time, was held outside the United States. ”_

## A bit of history

Following the above correction, it is interesting to add the following information to give us some context:

**Urantia Association International (UAI)** was founded in August 1993 as a branch of Urantia Foundation.

**The Urantia Association of Quebec (AUQ)** was officially formed on July 20, 1997.

In 2003, the modern structure of the UAI began with the “International Service Bureau” (ISB) and shortly thereafter, in 2007, the current charter was adopted and the body thus became distinct from the Foundation.

> “_You cannot truly love your fellows by a mere act of the will. Love is only born of thoroughgoing understanding of your neighbor’s motives and sentiments._” (<a id="a59_161"></a>[UB 100:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p4_6))

> “_You are destined to live a narrow and mean life if you learn to love only those who love you._” (<a id="a61_101"></a>[UB 156:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_11))

## “Profane”

- All that is foreign to religion.
- A person **who is not initiated** into the mysteries of a religious cult.
- Ignorant person — uninitiated.
- A person who is ignorant of the rules and customs of an activity.
- The profane and the sacred.
- Laymen and specialists.
- Non-professional person — amateur, common man, uninitiated, non-specialist.
- A person who knows nothing about an art or a science;
- **In the UB**: Searching for “Profane” will give 11 occurrences.

## Difference between “Secular” and “Laïc”

- Both have the same definition, namely: “Not belonging to the clergy”
- The difference between “secular” and “lay” must be sought at the level of the attribute.
  - “Laïc” is used as a **noun**: “A lay person”
  - To designate a group of “lay people”: “Laïcat”
  - “Secular” is used as an **adjective**: “A secular school”, “Secular life”.

## “Secular”

- From Latin saecularis, ‘**relating to profane life**’.
- RELIGION: **Pertaining to secular life**, to temporal justice. “Secular tribunal”. “Secular authorities”.
- Who lives in the world, **who is not under the authority of any religious order**. “Priest, secular clergy.”
- **In the UB**, a search for “Sécul” will return 16 occurrences.

> “_The measure of the spiritual capacity of the evolving soul is your faith in truth and your love for man, but the measure of your human strength of character is your ability to resist the holding of grudges and your capacity to withstand brooding in the face of deep sorrow. Defeat is the true mirror in which you may honestly view your real self._” (<a id="a90_354"></a>[UB 156:5.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_17))

## Did you know that?

**Every time you buy a “Urantia Book” (and others)** through the AUQ website, you arrive on Amazon, and the latter returns a small percentage (3 to 4%) of the amount of your purchase to the Urantia Association simply because you went through the AUQ website to get to Amazon.

Pass this on to all your friends who want to buy one of these books.
