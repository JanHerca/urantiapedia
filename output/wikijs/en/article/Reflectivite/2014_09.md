## JESUS' BOAT FOUND?

_Gilles Brien_
_Laval_

_[Translation of an article by Saskia Raevouri on the site “Square circles” dedicated to the study of the “Urantia Book”. http://www.squarecircles.com/articles/JesusTheBoatbuilder.htm]_

In the last part of The Urantia Book devoted to the life of Jesus, we learn that Jesus worked in boat building before beginning his public work. He is even said by the revelators to have introduced revolutionary new boat building techniques. “Jesus worked with Zebedee only a little more than one year, but during that time he created a new style of boat and established entirely new methods of boatmaking. ... Within five years practically all the craft on the lake had been built in the shop of Zebedee at Capernaum.” (<a id="a23_521"></a>[UB 129:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p1_3))

Today, there is a kibbutz on the Sea of Galilee called Nof Ginosar. In The Urantia Book, this area south of Capernaum is called Gennesaret. Capernaum is where John Zebedee’s boat settlement was located, where Jesus worked for over a year. In 1986, during a drought that lowered the level of the Sea of Galilee, an ancient boat was discovered in the waters off the southern coast of the kibbutz. Experts called to the scene agreed that it was an ancient boat. Excavations began immediately, led by the Israel Department of Antiquities and Museums, assisted by archaeologists and volunteers.

Fragile and spongy, the boat was carefully cleaned of the mud that had protected it from deterioration over the centuries, before being “wrapped” in polyurethane foam and then transported to the Yigal Allon Center, a local museum. The excavation lasted eleven days. But the boat was immersed in a preservative substance for nine and a half years before undergoing a treatment consisting of impregnation with a special wax. In 1995, the pool in which the boat rested was emptied and the boat was revealed to researchers. A slow drying process followed. After careful study of the methods used in its construction, according to the official brochure at the museum, experts concluded that it was built by a master craftsman or skilled boat builder. The design of the rounded aft and forward, in a fine shape, is unlike anything that had been unearthed on similar vessels or that has been artistically depicted. The builder followed a common practice of boat building in the Mediterranean but with many deviations.

The frames made from naturally curved tree branches and the shape of the planks are unlike anything made or designed for recreational boating at the time. These revolutionary techniques suggest either a shortage of wood or the introduction of a new type of construction specifically suited to a relatively calm freshwater surface, such as the Sea of Galilee. The boat's planks were joined with mortise and tenon joints locked in place with tapered wooden pegs, then nailed to the curved wooden frames with iron nails. The nails, some with square, round, or octagonal heads, seem more suited to interior carpentry than to boat building.

Twelve different types of wood were identified, including oak and cedar, indicating that the builder made use of locally available material.

Measuring 26.5 feet long by 7.5 feet wide, the boat could carry 15 people and had one mast. The recovered boat had been repaired several times. Differences in the workmanship of the repairs and the original construction suggest that the work was done by different workers or even by different generations of workers.

Based on a study of construction techniques, carbon-14 analysis and ceramic chronology, the boat has been dated to the period spanning the first century B.C. to the first century A.D. Today, the boat rests on a specially designed steel cradle in the new wing of the museum. A little to the north of the museum were found fragments of wood that appear to be waste from shipbuilding activities, as well as the remains of two other small boats from later periods, indicating that this site may have been a place where boats were built and stored. As readers of The Urantia Book know, Zebedee's shipyard was located northeast of Gennesaret, in the same area. $\square$

## Editor's note

_Normand Laperle_
_Lévis_

Good morning,

This month, $j$ I feel like reporting to you on the activities of Réflectivité. I really feel that it is “your” Réflectivité. It is “you” who furnish it. It is made of what “you” provide it. The least I can do is to give “you” a report.

Let's start by saying that everything is going very well. We have not lacked articles to publish, but sometimes it has just happened. The ideal would be to have a small bank of articles for the quiet moments. A big thank you to Gilles Brien who has been a regular voluntary contributor, without there being any agreement between us. Without him, it would have been more difficult. I have had very favorable feedback about his articles.

You may be interested to know that Réflectivité has 200 subscribers in electronic version and 69 subscribers in paper version by mail, of which 20 are duplicates (they also receive the electronic version). We therefore have 249 unique subscribers. Sending one (1) paper Réflectivité, by mail, costs $1.36 (before tax) to the AUQ.

I also think you'll be interested in a little follow-up on the many requests $j$'ve made for you to send your articles to Réflectivité.

In April, I asked for your suggestions to improve Réflectivité. I did not receive any suggestions. It seems that you were satisfied with the excellent service you had before.

In May, I asked for volunteers to commit to writing one (1) article every 4 months, in an effort to remove the thorny threat of a shortage of articles. No one gave their name.

In June, I asked you to invent, to send us your original ideas. I received a few articles. A big thank you! Keep it up! We must not forget that Réflectivité is powered “only” by your contributions.

In July I asked for your thoughts on study groups. No one has responded to date.

In August, I asked for your inspiration bubbles. I haven't received anything yet.

The important thing is not “Réflectivité”. The important thing is to create a space for sharing, exchanging and fraternizing among us, readers of “The Urantia Book”.

Réflectivité is an _open door to the soul_ of our reading community.

## Michael's Feast of August 24, 2014 took place

**at Beaver Lake, Mont Royal, Mtl**

On the menu: Discovery of others, exchanges, sharing, friendship and songs.

## Insights into our development as humans

_Rolande L. Martin, 84 years old_
_Quebec_

This is what developed in me, upon reading my notes, taken during a conference given by Murielle and Isabelle, as part of a presentation of the adjutant circuits (our faculties or tutors) in vision of our body, consciousness and personality.

<ins>Internalize ourselves</ins>: What do I identify with? My work, my partner, my children? What I remember, when I was little, I identified with my mother. She was my role model. Until the day, around the age of fourteen, when I realized that her limits no longer met my expectations and my awareness. I was very disappointed, I was losing a point of support.

What are your qualities? Generosity, curiosity, honesty, a taste for life...

<ins>Observing myself</ins>: do you know that you are unique? Yes, but in the past I was looking for a model. Having been raised in the negative (not doing or saying this or that), it had created a repression in me, which I got rid of by clowning around, to escape internal tensions. Happy to get married to change my name, it also seemed an ideal, since remaining single meant not having found. It meant being left behind.

For one participant, her identification was through cycling competition. She had just left a religion imposed by her parents, “Jehovah's Witnesses.”

<ins>Inner Searches</ins>: Body-Consciousness-Personality, as God created us. We were presented with two packets of images and were asked to sort them. Physical, chemical matter..., beautiful, perfect and young bodies (no signs of wear and tear). This material encouraged us to explore together the development of the assets of the being.

So, we are aware of being aware. But what is guiding us? What does the awareness of our faculties consist of? Here they are simply listed:

**<ins>Orientation and intuition</ins>**: Moving in space and time. Walking, running, jumping, dancing, exploring, moving..... Intuitive reflexes.... To the point of listening to the little voice within us!

**<ins>Courage (action)</ins>**: In your opinion, it is courageous to do nothing? .... Thoughts on future actions. On the courage to break a bad habit or not let yourself be dominated by manipulative people. The courage to say no. The courage to respect yourself, to develop yourself.

**<ins>Adventure (knowledge)</ins>**: Think of children, transportation, electronics, in all areas everything progresses, everything moves forward. If we try to stay stationary, we regress. Tips to counter immobility: — Get out of the daily grind — Travel in your head — Change your habits — Learn about known or unknown places — Listen to the experiences of others especially in critical situations...

**<ins>Association</ins>**: It is fundamental and necessary for life. We like to be together (Protection, exchange of ideas, enrichment and pleasure of sharing). The animal associates naturally, but humans go about it in a more intellectual way. For me, it was difficult. Again this thing held back in childhood (repression and crushing), feeling small in front of others.... Finally, even lame associations brought me good, I found there the taste for research, the taste to go see further and see where it led me!

**<ins>Adoration:</ins>** or wonder. For me, it is seeing God as a loving father. I remember, I see myself small before the immensity of the universe, I do not understand everything, but I learn things every day. My desire is to grow to be like God. To adore is to know God and want to do his will. The faculty of adoration attracts towards the greatest. The impasse is moments of low tide, it is each time a feeling of retreat. Adoration helps me to grow and I leave to shine around me.

**<ins>Wisdom:</ins>** Wisdom is that choice that arises in thought. I choose what seems to me to be more in line with God's will, what will take me further. It is also the answer to the request that arises in me (us). It is this faculty that gives me awareness of myself (ourselves).

Finally, a word on the **<ins>choice</ins>** of **<ins>personality</ins>**. Personality is a gift from God unique to each of us. There is permanence in the presence of change. I can give you an example (for a material good) of a choice of personality. I want a car, more freedom, do I really need it? Do these different choices take me further in loving service?

**<ins>To serve and to love</ins>**: To serve in order to be more effective and to love is to give good to others.

Finally, **<ins>evaluation</ins>** is that human capacity that observes, analyzes and gives me a personal responsibility to do something.

So, thinking, learning to meditate in all places and in all circumstances, becoming aware of one's inner Presence, asking for help, claiming gifts, all this awaits us, we simply have to ask for them, our faculties (listed above) allow us to do so. $\square$

Chris Wood tells us that when he visited Colombia last January, he could not help but notice “their success in creating and promoting study groups.” He points out in particular the city of Bogota, with a population of 7 million, where there are 14 study groups. That is a ratio of one (1) study group for every 500,000 inhabitants.

On a purely personal note, he suggests that this report be used for comparison purposes. He calls it the “Bogota standard.”

This standard must be qualified, however. Certain situations can sometimes favor the creation of study groups. Other situations can discourage the creation of study groups. For example, many people on the planet are still illiterate. And the “Urantia Book” is not yet available in the native language of all countries on the planet. (14 translations have been completed, three (3) others are in progress.)

The “Bogota standard” can still serve as a “comparative standard”, a basis from which a comparison is made to evaluate potential.

How does Quebec compare? We have 18 study groups listed on the back of the Réflectivité. However, several are no longer active. On the study group web portal, only 10 are listed as still active. The population of Quebec is estimated at 8 million since the beginning of the year. This gives us a ratio of one (1) study group per 800,000 inhabitants. $\square$
