## _The Urantia Book_ and us

HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED why we among so many others found The Urantia Book? We truth seekers all know that there is no such thing as chance in the spirit world, so why us?

In the Publication Mandate by the revelators, given in the 1950s to the members of the forum, a sentence sheds some light on this question, here is what it says: “This book is given to those who are ready for it, long before the day of its world mission.” I would not want you to think that we have been chosen, or that we are special, I think rather that through our choices we have prepared ourselves for its discovery.

The discovery of a spiritual truth always brings its counterpart, a responsibility equal to its value, if not greater. This is a very great reality, which could make many people think, because if we have sought this truth it is because we surely wanted to do something with it.

During the first two years of reading The Urantia Book, I was constantly under the spell of discovery, page after page. At last, I had found an immense spiritual treasure that contained the answer to all my questions about the history of our world, about ourselves and our destiny; but now, after these two years of euphoria, fear came over me, realizing that from now on I could no longer plead ignorance in my favor.

It took me at least six more years before I finally decided to embark on the process of change that would allow me to progressively live the teachings of The Urantia Book. I will not tell you about my journey during these six years, let us say rather that they were disturbing years, filled with fear, doubts and also a lot of suffering. Why so much fear, doubts and suffering, because the responsibility for what I had found was beyond me, that is why it took me these six years of reflection.

I truly believe that our Divine Monitor and guardian angels have lovingly guided us in the discovery of _The Urantia Book_ and will continue to inspire and guide us so that we can make this truth ever more alive in our lives. But on our side, how will we and can we collaborate with them? These are two questions that could challenge many of us!

Let us recall the parable of the ten talents; will we bury them or will we make them grow? Will we help make this truth known? Will we share what we have been so freely given? Will we participate in preparing the mission of The Urantia Book? If we answer yes to these questions, how will we do it? This is a question that has fueled my reflections for several years.

Here is what the Publication Mandate says to this effect: “Thousands of study groups are to be organized and the book is to be translated into several languages. Then the book will be ready when man's battle for freedom is won and the world is once more made more fertile for the religion of Jesus and for the freedom of mankind.”

“But the publication of the book has not been postponed to this possible distant date. An early publication of the book has been offered so that it can be available for the training of leaders and educators. Its availability is also required to attract the attention of wealthy people who might then be induced to provide financial resources for translation into other languages.”

We Quebecers have been privileged, because the first translation of The Urantia Book into another language was French. Other translations had to wait many years. A translation can cost between two hundred and fifty thousand and five hundred thousand American dollars. How much for a translation revision and its edition, a little over forty thousand dollars and this without counting the countless hours of volunteer work generously given by the revisers, readers like you and me. Often and even very often we take all this for granted, without ever stopping to think how we could give back what we have received!

Did you know that Urantia Foundation does not make any profit from the sale of books? The sale price is often subsidized to allow the sale of these books in disadvantaged countries such as in the continents of Africa, South America or in the countries of Eastern Europe and closer to us in Haiti. Recently, we learned that the number of books available in French for sale throughout the world is less than three hundred. Georges Michelson Dupont, trustee of Urantia Foundation and responsible for translations informed us that a new edition of the _Urantia Book_ is planned for 2014, provided of course that there are the necessary funds to proceed with its printing.

The printing of this new edition cost $\$ US$44,000, and half of that amount was donated by our cousins in France; now the ball is in our court. If we want to participate in this important mission and help distribute _The Urantia Book_ in French-speaking countries, we must give back a little of what we have received thanks to the generosity of committed readers who have gone before us. Any amount of money is important and appreciated. I strongly encourage you to participate in this effort by donating generously to the Urantia Foundation French Language Translation and Revision Fund: http://www.urantia.org/en/faire-un-don or at the following address 533 Diversey Parkway, Chicago 60614 USA

How can we serve Revelation?

We can participate in a study group or if we wish, start our own study group; the AUQ can help you in your choice either by providing you with names of people interested in participating or by providing you with study group starting materials.

You could also get involved in the Urantia Association of Quebec, there are several tasks that could benefit from your help, such as the publication of the monthly Réflectivité, namely its editing, its articles and even its formatting, its printing and its sending by email and by post.

You could also fill a position on the board of directors. In February 2014, there will be elections for the positions of vice-president and secretary. This will all take place during the Annual General Meeting. Consult our event calendar at the end of this publication. You could start by participating in meetings organized by the association on a regular basis in different regions of Quebec when they take place.

You could contribute to sending the _Urantia Book_ or other forms of aid related to Urantia activities in Haiti. For a year now, the Urantia Association of Quebec has been sending books to Haiti. In 2014 we want to sponsor committed readers from Haiti to participate in the Study Group Symposium and in 2015 to participate in the UAI International Congress which will be held in Lennoxville, Quebec. All this requires funds and the Urantia Association of Quebec has decided to come to the aid of its distant and disadvantaged brothers and sisters. To do this we need your generosity.

Nearly thirty years ago, during my years of reflection or meditation on _The Urantia Book_ and my involvement in its mission, I did not know what to do, so I prayed to know how I could serve, the power was mine. I began simply by participating in a study group, located several kilometers from where I lived and I participated for many years. From this group, I met Pierre and Lise Routhier, who gradually gave an answer to my prayers by their example. Today I see that my involvement has been progressive, at the level of my capacities and my awareness.

I realize that for most of us it is difficult to fully grasp the value and significance of the Revelation and its mission for our world. After many years of involvement in the Urantia movement, I often find that we are at the very beginning of one of the most extraordinary projects we have ever been given the opportunity to participate in. In fact, its scope and magnitude are so great that it escapes us. We must not become discouraged by our task, our incomprehension, or our inability to grasp its grandeur, but pray for enlightenment as to how we can serve this Revelation lovingly to the best of our ability.

I invite you to meditate on these sentences from the Publication Mandate and perhaps draw inspiration from their content and act in accordance with your desire to serve.

“You who have dedicated your lives to the service of the Book and of brotherhood can hardly realize the importance of your actions. No doubt you will spend your life and pass away without fully understanding that you are participating in the birth of a new age of religion on the world.”

“The future is not open to your mortal understanding, but you would be wise to study in great detail the order, the plan, and the methods of progression as they were carried out during Michael’s life on earth, when the Word was made flesh. You become actors in the episodes which will follow when the Word is made Book. Vast are the differences between these dispensations of religion, but many are the lessons which can be learned by studying the bygone era.

The passage of time is the same for each of us, how we use it will determine our progress and our own evolution.

To love is to serve.

## Faith in my personal life

THE FIRST TIME I SEARCHED for myself the meaning of faith, I was about 16-17 years old and it was in the Bible that I found it first; (_Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen_) Darby version 1978.

The definition that has long fueled one of my deep meditations is that of the agondontarius: **A volitional creature that can believe without seeing, perseveres in isolation and triumphs over almost insurmountable difficulties even when alone**. How could I be all that? With perseverance and sincere will... I believed in it and I often stumbled. It was a distant goal, an unattainable ideal, it seemed.

And the more I read, the more I saw the gap between who I was and what it took to reach those heights of spiritual achievement.

So I asked and asked and asked again, and I hoped. I prayed a lot, meditated and worshiped... Giving thanks for everything in the smallest details every day. I made it a discipline, like a top athlete training for the Olympics.

And little did I know that everything I was longing for spiritually would emerge with patience and experience of the divine.

I wanted this unwavering faith, this strengthening tranquility, this lasting peace, this inexplicable balance, this absolute trust... And I felt so far from all that.

38 years later, I confirm that I received everything. Is it incredible? Impossible?

Perhaps, like many, I looked too far or did not listen hard enough?

I don't know how it happened or maybe a little... a great desire to be in relationship with my beloved Father and the upward movement of my soul? Still, faith grew when I let the fruits of the Spirit take full possession of the place... Faith is the sign that a divine spirit dwells within us.

38 years later, I am in full relationship with my God and this is just the beginning.

I who have cried out so much after him, who have asked so much in supplications of all kinds in suffering and in tears... Today, he does not speak to me in person or as a fanatic hallucination, but in my heart, in my soul, through my personality in the laws of the universe, the leaves of autumn and the changes of seasons. God rocks me like a child in the bed of life and I am infinitely happy... I have faith!

## Nothing for sale

I HAVE NOTHING TO SELL, I DO NOT HEAL, I have no power that you do not have yourselves, I do not seek notoriety, and I have no privileged contact with the beyond. If these are things that you are looking for, I am not the right person to contact. I have spent forty years of my life trying to understand the reason for my presence on this earth. I have been fooled and duped many times by the religions of men, their churches, their sects and their gurus. So I have learned that it is wise to be wary, which I invite you to do as well. My experience is worthless to you, you must make your own. The reason for my approach is simple: to share my discovery. One day, I found the most extraordinary, the most luminous, the most avant-garde, the most audacious, the most exciting, the most exhilarating, the most... book on our planet. You can be skeptical, that's normal, I was too, and a lot! The book I'm talking about is called THE URANTIA BOOK. Not everyone is receptive to reading it, but for those who are, a journey of 2097 pages divided into four parts awaits you. A description of the entire creation, from the infinite past to the infinite future. This book brings to man a new vision of time and eternity while offering him a new story of his origins, his history and his destiny. It allows the sincere seeker to glimpse his potential for growth in the endless discovery of God the Father. It harmonizes religion, philosophy and science today. Finally, it updates in detail the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth.

The first part describes the nature of Deity, the reality of Paradise, the organization and functioning of the central and superuniverses, and the personalities who administer them. The second part describes our local universe, Nebadon, whose creator, Michael, is known on Urantia (our Earth) as Jesus of Nazareth.

The third part tells the story of our planet; its geological development, the establishment of life, the biological, social and spiritual evolution of man, the disastrous consequences of Lucifer's rebellion, as well as the exciting story of Adam and Eve.

The fourth part is an account of the life and teachings of Jesus; his youth, his family life, his public ministry, his human personality and his divine nature, his relationship with his apostles, the painful account of his crucifixion and that of his glorious resurrection. Here we find the chronicle of his incarnate life in a much more detailed way than was hitherto available to us.

## Leadership, God and Me

_This speech was given at the 2011 Chicago Leadership Symposium_

WHAT BRINGS US TOGETHER IS THE LOVE we have for God and the willingness to learn to become better leaders of the spiritual truths contained in _The Urantia Book_. This requires self-mastery, in order to reach new levels of Being. It requires a great deal of self-discipline.

There is an inherent quality in our personality, that of being, “evolutionary in self-mastery.” _The Urantia Book_ says that:

> _The purpose of cosmic evolution is to achieve unity of personality through increasing spirit dominance, volitional response to the teaching and leading of the Thought Adjuster. Personality, both human and superhuman, is characterized by an inherent cosmic quality which may be called “the evolution of dominance,” the expansion of the control of both itself and its environment._ (<a id="a156_384"></a>[UB 112:2.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p2_15))

We come into the world ignorant, and need to learn everything about plants, trees, animals, human beings, the cosmos and beyond. We learn in the family, at school, at work, everywhere. But how do we learn to know God, his nature and how to do his will? The answer is simple, but not miraculous; it requires efforts to mobilize one's being and make the decisions necessary for our spiritual growth. We must learn to walk hand in hand with God.

> Spiritual development depends, first, on the maintenance of a living spiritual connection with true spiritual forces and, second, on the continuous bearing of spiritual fruit: yielding the ministry to one’s fellows of that which has been received from one’s spiritual benefactors. Spiritual progress is predicated on intellectual recognition of spiritual poverty coupled with the self-consciousness of perfection-hunger, the desire to know God and be like him, the wholehearted purpose to do the will of the Father in heaven. (<a id="a160_529"></a>[UB 100:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p2_1))

I have learned that the more I love God and seek to do His will, the more God reveals Himself to me. Prayer, worship, and service are part of the three-part technique for experiencing God, and this consistency is the same throughout our journey through the cosmos. From this day until I reach Heaven—and beyond—I will continue to learn, grow, and perfect myself. As God does my part, He will do His.

We read in the Urantia Book:

> _THE experience of dynamic religious living transforms the mediocre individual into a personality of idealistic power._ (<a id="a166_123"></a>[UB 100:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p0_1))

On my 30th birthday, a strange thing happened to me. I suddenly realized that I had everything to be happy, yet I felt empty inside and thought that if life was only this, I didn't want it anymore. That's how my quest began. I read spiritual books, I participated in personal growth workshops, I attended conferences in order to discover what was making me miserable.

When I remarried, The Urantia Book was not my thing, accepting that God was Gaetan's first love and I was his second love. So in 1999 when he asked me if we could host a study group in our home, I agreed. He told me it was a long-term contract—every Monday for the rest of our lives. In 2000, the IUA held an international conference in New York. I accompanied my husband, but informed him that I probably wouldn't be at all the presentations, and he encouraged me to do whatever I liked during that time. Surprisingly, I attended all the morning presentations and even the afternoon workshops. It was a real pleasure for me, getting to know people from all over the world who shared the same interest, the teachings of The Urantia Book.

It was during this period that I met and got to know my dear friend and brother Moussa Ndiaye from Senegal, with whom all the French speakers at the congress participated in a workshop on prayer facilitated by Moussa.

A year later, the Quebec association invited Moussa to the Living Your Faith Congress. He came to stay with us for a little over two weeks. One morning, while my husband was at work, I told Moussa how much I loved my husband and how much I wanted to help him in his spiritual work, but I didn't know how. I told him that if only I could have as much of that feeling of love that he had for God. After listening, Moussa said that great things would happen for me. I really thought he was saying this to comfort me, but six months later, while I was in Senegal for spiritual training with Gaétan and a friend, on the second day of our study, I felt the presence of God in me. When I was able to overcome my emotions, I opened my mouth looking at Moussa and these were the words that came out: “With what you are saying now and what I understand, I will never again be able to remain silent because I feel this great responsibility to share God, as you do.” I could not believe what I had just said!

That moment changed my life forever and gave it meaning and a sense of mission! Never after did I question my husband when he worked late and put so much effort into projects for others and for Revelation. I totally understood his love and dedication to God.

People have asked me how my spiritual life transforms me and leads me to serve others. The answer is simple. There are two cosmic laws: the first is that I receive God through the fruits of the spirit and the second is that I share God with others through those same fruits. And as I partner with God in the activities I am involved in, I allow Him to transform me. He knows exactly what I need to grow spiritually and serve others. In God's plan, every experience I have is a great opportunity to actualize my potentials.

I have been socially involved with people suffering from anxiety and panic attacks. Over the years in my local association, I have learned teamwork by accepting different responsibilities. My assignments: serving as secretary, as president of the membership committee, president of the communications committee, editor of our monthly newsletter Réflectivité and translator of the international letter Tidings. I have organized and coordinated spiritual formation workshops for 10 years so that readers in Quebec can benefit from the teachings I received in Senegal. Recently, I created the Women's Committee in our local association.

_The Urantia Book_ is filled with revelations that have inevitably touched many people. This next quote touched my soul several months ago and continues to shine light within me.

> _The religious challenge of this age is to those farseeing and forward-looking men and women of spiritual insight who will dare to construct a new and appealing philosophy of living out of the enlarged and exquisitely integrated modern concepts of cosmic truth, universe beauty, and divine goodness. Such a new and righteous vision of morality will attract all that is good in the mind of man and challenge that which is best in the human soul. Truth, beauty, and goodness are divine realities, and as man ascends the scale of spiritual living, these supreme qualities of the Eternal become increasingly co-ordinated and unified in God, who is love._ (<a id="a184_654"></a>[UB 2:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p7_10))

I am now wondering how this will play out in my future endeavors. I continue to pray to God for enlightenment. I am grateful for the life I live and blessed to work with my husband, share the same ideals, and assist him in his spiritual work, spiritually evolving and serving our fellow human beings. This prayer was answered 10 years ago.

> _When man goes in partnership with God, great things may, and do, happen._ (<a id="a188_78"></a>[UB 132:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p7_9))

## The Publication Mandate

(True copy)

Compiled by: Some members of the General Council of Urantia Brotherhood
For: The Records of the Urantia Brotherhood Executive Committee
Presented: April 4, 1955

It seems appropriate, for the second time, to bring to the attention of the Executive Committee certain wise comments and recommendations which have been collected over the years and which bear upon future problems for The Urantia Book. These comments might be presented in the form of a document entitled:

The Urantia Book Synchronicity<br>(commonly referred to as: The Publication Mandate*)

“We regard The Urantia Book as a manifestation of the progressive evolution of human society. It is not akin to the spectacular episodes of an epochal revelation, although it may seem timed to appear in the wake of such a revolution in human society. The Book belongs to the epoch which will immediately succeed the conclusion of the present ideological struggle. There will come a time when men will be disposed to seek truth and righteousness. When the chaos of the present confusion has cleared away, it will be more possible to design the architecture of a new and improved era of human relations. It is for this better order of things on earth that the Book has been made available.”

“But the publication of the Book has not been postponed to this possible distant date. An early publication of the Book has been offered so that it may be available to leaders and teachers. Its availability is also required to attract the attention of wealthy people who might then be induced to provide resources for translation into other languages.”

“You who have dedicated your lives to the service of the Book and the Embroidery, can scarcely realize the importance of your actions. No doubt you will waste away your life and pass away without fully understanding that you are participating in the birth of a new age of religion upon the world.”

“The future is not open to your mortal understanding, but you would be wise to study well in detail the order, the plan, and the methods of progression as they were carried out during Michael’s life on earth, when the Word was made flesh. You become actors in the episodes that will follow when the Word is made Book. Vast are the differences between these dispensations of religion, but many are the lessons that can be learned by studying the bygone era. You must study the days of Jesus on earth. You can take very good note of the manner in which the kingdom of heaven was inaugurated in the world. Did it evolve slowly and unfold naturally? Where did it manifest itself with a sudden display of force, accompanied by a spectacular exhibition of power? Was it evolutionary or revolutionary?

“You must stir up your souls to patience. You are partners in a revelation of truth which is part of the natural evolution of religion in this world. Too rapid a growth could be suicidal. This Book is given to those who are ready for it, long before the day of its world mission. Thousands of study groups must be organized and the Book must be translated into many languages. Then the Live will be available when man’s battle for freedom is won and the world is once more made more fertile for the religion of Jesus and for the freedom of mankind.”

\* In Doctor Sadler's History of the Urantia Movement, this message is entitled: “The Publication Mandate.”

[This document was presented by William S. Sadler Junior to the Forum on the above-mentioned date. For the wider intelligibility of the listeners, the pronouns have been changed, i.e., we have introduced “You.” For this reason, we have returned them in their original form. Copies of this document have been inserted in the minute book of the secretary of each committee in office of the Brotherhood. The committee chairmen have received copies.]


## Thematic report

ON NOVEMBER 24, representatives of three study groups met for an Inter-Group Thematic on the theme “How to disseminate the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ without acknowledging the source.” If we make The Urantia Book an imperative of our ministry, we will have a very narrow view of our brethren. Jesus did not reveal his divine nature to men until the very end of his life so that attention would be focused on the message and not on the messenger. For the same reasons, we can disseminate the teachings without acknowledging the source.

It is normal for participation in Urantia activities to vary. Our commitment must not be to the detriment of family, social, or personal harmony. It is sometimes necessary to take a break to meet other obligations. There were only six of us this time, but the important thing is to keep the bonds alive, because our efforts must extend over time, over long periods.
