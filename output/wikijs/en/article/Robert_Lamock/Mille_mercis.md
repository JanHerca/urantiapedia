Today, I intend to simply express through the word “thank you”, all my gratitude. It is spontaneous and it can have repercussions on the mental and spiritual levels beyond what one could perhaps imagine.

This “thank you” or rather these “thousand thanks” go to the Universal Father who gave his benevolent blessing to the Revelation Commission of the leaders of the Superuniverses, to them, and to the different authors of the papers, mandated by the same leaders, for having revealed to us through the Urantia Book the divine truth on the spiritual values and the cosmic meanings of the universe.

One evening, the idea came to me spontaneously to express my gratitude to them with a thank you. The intention was quite strong in the intention to say it. I thank them for having made divine and cosmic truths known to us with such precision.

I believe that it is a great privilege that the Book has met us, each of us, and that our mind has accepted it despite its complexity at times in order to be able to extract all of its quintessence. Of course, this requires reflection and time, but have not the authors of the booklets spoken to us many times about the need for perseverance in effort?

Firstly from the material mind by the encircuitment of the first 5 adjutant mind-spirits. Their names are: the spirit of intuition, understanding, courage, knowledge and advice. These spirits aim to gradually prepare the human being to live in society with the establishment of codes of conduct.

Then from the spiritual and cosmic mind:

1. Through the last two mental circuits-adjutants which are the spirit of wisdom and worship. They aim to develop spiritual intelligence and morality which are the first of the search for God in worship.
2. Through the spiritual circuit of the Holy Spirit to enhance our spiritual and pre-morontia values.
3. Through the Spirit of Truth of Christ Michael. Its purpose is to bring us great cosmic insight and to make us understand our interdependence with the experiential God of the 7 Superuniverses, God the Supreme.
4. Through the Thought Adjuster, our inner divine guide. He rectifies our thoughts with the highest divine concepts of eternity and infinity.

The authors of the booklets had great difficulty in conveying to us, in the English language of only 26 letters, mental and spiritual concepts that were as subtle as they were precise.

The more I study the Book, the more I measure its intellectual rigor, its mathematical logic and its great coherence throughout the fascicles. Of course, the Book in the eyes of the Beings of Light, represents only a tiny part of Universal Reality but it is the essential of all that we are allowed to understand at present. We are still at the guardian school.

In my thanks, I do not forget, of course, the Contact Commission and the Forum for their tireless work, although at the beginning, their questions were considered of little interest with regard to celestial beings. But subsequently, at the insistence of the revelators, they became relevant questions on all the essential questioning of human existence. The development of the majority of the Book is the fruit of the answers provided to the questions posed by the members of the Forum.

My thoughts go out to all those who, directly or indirectly, have enabled the Book to be distributed, to the translators for their considerable work, and to the reading groups. The Book has transformed me intellectually and spiritually in the sense that, being curious by nature, it has brought me answers beyond what I expected.

I really enjoyed the midwayer booklets about Jesus' earthly life because in them, Jesus revealed to us the unconditional Love of the Father of all beings and all things. He showed great generosity and perfect understanding for the humble condition of his most deprived creatures and helped them seek the kingdom of God in them and in us, the Immanent God, the Thought Adjuster. Reading the booklets about his life, I feel like I'm with him throughout his earthly pilgrimage. He gave us an example of life to follow.

Personally, I would have liked, I believe, that the 4 withdrawn booklets, due to excessive complexity or due to disclosures not yet authorized, be preserved. Perhaps with the help of our intellectual and spiritual assets, could we have understood a little of them? Who knows!!

All mental and spiritual circuits are energy circuits with their own characteristics. Just as in electromagnetic transmissions, the reception will be better if the receiver's circuits are well tuned (tuned) to the transmitter's own frequency, so in the circuits emanating from the Divine Minister of Michael, which includes the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Truth, the directives will be received in our mind according to our receptivity and sensitivity to the truths of universal reality. It is a question of “opening” these channels to our highest consciousness, our superconsciousness, to fully receive the answers.

As for the Thought Adjuster, He incites us through incessant attempts or even through spiritual flashes in rare circumstances, to penetrate our spiritual mind but the superposition of His mind to ours will be controlled by our desire to contact Him and following multiple connections and reconnections so that finally, we do His will.

Repercussions of human behavior on the evolution of the space-time universe.

In a human, if an organ is injured in one place, the injured cells spontaneously communicate their injury to all the cells in the rest of the organ to pass it on and transform it into a feeling of suffering in the mind of the entire body.

What is true for the human body, calls its truth for the 7 Superuniverses. Any physical act, motivated by our material mind, has consequences for good or for bad on the ecology of the earth; because of its coherence with the rest of the universe, the effects will be felt according to its degree of influence on the system, the constellation... and finally on the 7 Superuniverses with changes for things other than spiritual and the state of progress of the actualization of the Almighty.

As for spiritual thoughts and ideas, however minimal they may be, according to their weight of influence, they participate in the actualization of our Experiential God, God the Supreme. It is only in the era of Life and Light for the 7 Superuniverses that the emergence of the Supreme Being will come on the finite level of universal evolution with the corollary, the culmination of things other than spiritual (energy-matter, galaxies are almost totally stable because their formation is complete). The 7 Superuniverses being a living organism, it is normal that all acts and thoughts are correlated to ensure its growth.

To conclude, the Book is a gift from God, it is up to us to show ourselves worthy of it.
