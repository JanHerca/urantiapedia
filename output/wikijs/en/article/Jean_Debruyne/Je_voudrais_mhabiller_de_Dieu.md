**In the name of the Father**
_Hand on forehead._
_I would like to write God on all my dreams._
_I would like to put God on all my ideas._
_I wish the hand of God was on all my thoughts._

**In the name of the Son**
_Hand on heart._
_I would like to feel God deep inside me._
_I would like to sing to God with all the words of my love._
_I would like to plant God in all the gardens of my tenderness._

**In the name of the Holy Spirit**
_The hand that makes the crossing and the journey from my shoulder to the other shoulder._
_I would like to draw God all over myself._
_I would like to dress myself in God, from top to bottom and from one shoulder to the other._
_I would like the great wind of the Spirit to blow from one shoulder to the other,_
_and from one end of the world to the other, to the ends of the earth._

**Amen**

Jean Debruyne
