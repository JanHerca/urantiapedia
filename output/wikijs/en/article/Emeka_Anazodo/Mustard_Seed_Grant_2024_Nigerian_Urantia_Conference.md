_By Emeka Anazodo, Oke Eletu, Nigeria_

_Editor’s Note: Emeka, on behalf of the Urantia Peace Initiative, was a_ _recipient of the first round of Mustard Seed Grant awards in 2024. The following article is excerpted from his report on the 2024 Nigerian Urantia Conference. The theme was “Ubuntu—The Brotherhood of Man.”_

Awareness of _The Urantia Book_ has been growing in Nigeria. In 2022 the Urantia Peace Initiative hosted its first Urantia conference in Lagos, Nigeria, with the theme “Religion of the Spirit,” where we gave out 60 copies of _The Urantia Book_. Thanks to a Mustard Seed Grant from Urantia Foundation, we were able to host a second conference in Lagos last year, with the theme “Contagious Love,” which brought Urantia Book readers and leaders together from across Nigeria. A documentary on _The Spirit of Ubuntu,_ compiled by Pato Banton and Antoinette Rootsdawtah, was screened in Lagos in April of this year. These events have contributed immensely to a remarkable surge of interest in _The Urantia Book_ among truth seekers in Nigeria.

The theme of this year’s conference and presentation topics was carefully chosen, incorporating a rich tapestry of Nigerian religions and philosophies. The objective was to further the aims and consolidate the gains of last year’s event. To this extent the program was very successful. It provided fertile ground for many curious and spiritually inclined individuals to relish in the unique perspectives presented by _The Urantia Book_.

Presentations included “What is _The Urantia Book_?” by eighteen-year-old Maya Anazodo. Emmanuel Ajewole spoke on “The Goal of Human Civilization.” “My Experience with Practicing the Teachings of _The Urantia Book_” was presented by Shola Agagu, a visually impaired Urantia leader and music instructor who often speaks at local Urantia events.

Tosin Oyewole delivered a talk on “Ubuntu and the Spiritual Fruits” in which she explored the interconnectedness of Ubuntu philosophy and the cultivation of spiritual virtues in individual and communal life.

My own presentations included “Ubuntu—The Brotherhood of Man,” “The Need for Peace Initiatives in Today’s World,” and “The Art of Manifestation” which explored energy, mind, and matter as taught by _The Urantia Book_. We were also inspired and entertained by songs, poetry, and recitations by young readers.

The high point of the conference may have been a musical presentation of _Afro Blues_ by saxophonist Chike Martins, who weaves the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ into his beautiful blend of western and African jazz.

Attendance and enthusiasm were higher than last year. We registered 82 persons despite the fact that Nigeria was at that time at the peak of a transportation crisis fueled by an all-time hike in the pump price of petrol. Members of a study group created last year as an offshoot of the conference attended and made some presentations. Additional group leaders emerged, and vibrant new Urantia-based WhatsApp groups have been created.

Urantia Peace Initiative is grateful for the funding it received from Urantia Foundation’s Mustard Seed Grants Program.
