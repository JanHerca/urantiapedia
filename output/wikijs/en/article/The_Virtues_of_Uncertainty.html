<p>The Virtues of Uncertainty.</p>
<p>Long before reaching Havona, the faith-tested and much-traveled ascendant children of space and time “have learned to feast upon uncertainty, to fatten upon disappointment, to enthuse over apparent defeat, to invigorate in the presence of difficulties, to exhibit indomitable courage in the face of immensity, and to exercise unconquerable faith when confronted with the challenge of the inexplicable. Long since, the battle cry of these pilgrims became: ‘In liaison with God, nothing—absolutely nothing—is impossible.’” (291)</p>
<p>Regardless of whether we are among those who crave for certainty or have already joined the ranks of those who “feast upon uncertainty,” the fact remains that “in the mortal state nothing can be absolutely proved; both science and religion are predicated on assumptions” (1139), Hence, regardless of whether or not we are aware of it,  even in the case that we have learned to “live in the spirit,” a certain uncertainty is our real lot.</p>
<p>Escape from mental uncertainty is achievable in a number of ways. Through faith, we can enter into a higher life that “is lived in the spirit.” At the other end of the scale, we can shelter in the certainty of our faith in an authoritative religion, or else in some form of mental pseudo-certainty induced by a distracting dedication to things of this world. Said Jesus:</p>
<p>“Forewarn all believers regarding the fringe of conflict which must be traversed by all who pass from the life as it is lived in the flesh to the higher life as it is lived in the spirit. To those who live quite wholly within either realm, there is little conflict or confusion, but all are doomed to experience more or less uncertainty during the times of transition between the two levels of living. In entering the kingdom, you cannot escape its responsibilities or avoid its obligations, but remember: The gospel yoke is easy and the burden of truth is light.” (1766)</p>
<p>The certainty of the higher life in the spirit is brought about if, like Jesus, we have both total faith in the overcare of the Father and we  dedicate our lives to living as Jesus lived.</p>
<p>“Ganid, I have absolute confidence in my heavenly Father’s overcare; I am consecrated to doing the will of my Father in heaven. I do not believe that real harm can befall me; I do not believe that my lifework can really be jeopardized by anything my enemies might wish to visit upon me, and surely we have no violence to fear from our friends. I am absolutely assured that the entire universe is friendly to me—this all-powerful truth I insist on believing with a wholehearted trust in spite of all appearances to the contrary.” (1469)</p>
<p>The transition to life in the spirit need not be too traumatic if we are sincere about making the changes. “Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.” The Papers teach us that only those things that have spiritual value can contribute to the growth of our souls. Recognition that this is so should help to uncouple us from the “things of the flesh”—the distractions of the material world.</p>
<p>What has spiritual value? Jesus saw the Father as holy, just, and great, true, beautiful, and good. Our treasures in heaven are the qualities of God plus those actions we take in the service of our fellows that have as their basic motive, the spiritual welfare of those we serve—these are the things that bring growth to our souls and store treasures in heaven.</p>
