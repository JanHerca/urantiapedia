## The Spiritual Fellowship ...

“Can we really imagine a church where authority and power are shared by all the participants, where neither financial gain, nor power, nor prestige are of any real importance; where human resources are valued above all else; where, at times, anyone might be the leader, regardless of their title; where people are so bound by a clear purpose that they are held together despite all their obvious disparities and different needs, and march, as it were, in the same direction, toward the same goal, even though everyone knows it cannot possibly be achieved in our lifetime?”

Merlyn Cox

The provocative question proposed above by Merlyn Cox in his article, _More Lessons from the Birds and Bees_ in this edition of The Fellowship Journal. Merlyn's vision is one of a religious organization such as the world has never seen. Meredith Sprunger in his “Creative Outreach” column likewise suggests a religious organization that has never been seen before ... one based upon the teachings of the Urantia Papers. Each of these Urantians has a unique vision of what this religious organization will look like, what it will do, and how it will serve. The melding of ideas such as these will form the shared vision that will unite Urantians, because creeds divide, and goals unite.

To this end, the directors of The Spiritual Fellowship, and the Urantians who have taken early roles in this great enterprise, ask for your prayers. We also need your ideas and your energy. The challenges of forming a religious organization such as the world has never seen are formidable. And those who attempt this momentous task with us “_will doubtless live and die without realizing [they] are participating in the birth of a new age of religion on this world._” Even so, if you feel the call to join us, please do so. You may be one of the new Urantian leaders who have something to say that this day and this generation needs to hear.

## Content

***Editorials***

- **The Greatest Thing Richard Feynman Ever Wrote**
- **Ordination at Boulder ... a Day to Remember**

***Interface***

- **The Mix of Joy and Discouragement** Merlyn Cox
	“So it is this mix of joy and discouragement that seems to be the lot of those blessed with finding _The Urantia Book_ and bound by honesty and good will, if not a clear sense of calling, to seek to share it with others.”

***Articles***

- **The Inner Life Challenge** Joan Batson Mullins
	“The great battle is more often won or lost, day by day and minute by minute in the arena of the human mind. And it is here, in the present moments of our daily living, where we are most challenged in our inner lives.”
- **The Priceless Opportunity ... The Joy that Knows No Bounds** Tom Choquette
	“Service or ministry is the essence or fragrance of the Spirit. She is a wonderful lady and the spark of all that is life. She is represented on this planet by our local Universe Mother Spirit, and Her energy and nurturing are everywhere. To me She represents the way of Joy. It is through Her, and Her needs that I have been blessed with unlimited opportunities to serve. .”
- **More Lessons from the Birds and Bees (and other Living Things ... Such as How Dee Hock's “Revolutionary” Organizational Model was Inspired by Nature)** Merlyn Cox
	“In nature Dee Hock found there are countless examples where organisms adapt quickly to their surroundings, work with others, even those they compete with, in a kind of symbiotic relationship, not necessarily knowing what everything else in the system is doing and not needing to know-a kind of blending of selfinterest and other interest at the same time.”
- **The Scientific Integrity of _The Urantia Book_** Denver Pearson
	“It doesn't stand to reason that the revelatory mandates encouraged the placing of inaccurate science and cosmology in a revelation that was designed to 'reduce confusion by authoritative elimination of error”'
- **The Infinity of God — an Astronomical Approach** Bud Bromley
	“Incredibly huge as this known universe is, God created it, God sustains it, God fills it, inhabits all of it; and yet, God is probably incomprehensibly greater than even this immense chunk of which we know.”
- **The Real Gospel** Norm Du Val
	“The gospel that Jesus taught was that information which would satisfy our deepest spiritual hopes, needs and desires...”
- **The Turning Point — Part II** Arthur Nash
	“If nations, communities, individuals, were only living by the great principle which, glibly enough, has come to be called the Golden Rule, what a different world this earth would be!”

> “When the wind blows, you hear the rustle of the leaves, but you do not see the wind — whence it comes or whither it goesl — and so it is with everyone born of the spirit. With the eyes of the flesh you can behold the manifestations of the spirit, but you cannot actually discern the spirit.” _The Urantia Papers_, [UB 142:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p6_5)
