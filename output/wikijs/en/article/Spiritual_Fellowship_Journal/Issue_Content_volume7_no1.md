## The Spiritual Fellowship of Students of _The Urantia Book_ 

A Spiritual Leadership Network Interested in _The Urantia Book_ as a Resource in Living, Creative Service, Teaching, Preaching, and Writing.

### Guiding Network Principles

1. We believe _The Urantia Book_ can make a significant contribution to the stimulation of spiritual creativity in churches, synagogues, and other religious institutions and their people.
2. We believe that at the present stage of spiritual development it is wise for ministers, priests, and rabbis to use _The Urantia Book_ as a resource for preaching and teaching rather than referring to the book itself or directing attention to it. Almost every concept in _The Urantia Book_ can be associated with some theologian, philosopher, or scientist in the past or present.
3. We believe that, although one should not be secretive about interest in _The Urantia Book_, one should use discretion in recommending it to people. The light of enhanced truth can frighten and blind as well as guide and illuminate.
4. We believe _The Urantia Book_'s claim to a revelatory source and status is not germane to its usefulness in the presentation of spiritual truth. Truth has an inherent appeal, regardless of its source, and can be used to enrich one's preaching, teaching, and living.
5. We believe the Spirit of God works among us in a differential and evolutionary manner; therefore, we recognize that for whatever reason some clergy may not wish to read and critically evaluate _The Urantia Book_. This diversity should in no way stand as a barrier to our mutual respect, fellowship, and love.
6. We believe the leavening process of creativity stimulated by _The Urantia Book_ should be ecumenical in nature.
7. We believe _The Urantia Book_ will eventually be recognized by the great majority of the world's religious leaders as one of the most constructive spiritual messages our world has received since Jesus' ministry on earth.

### Network Recommendations

1. Read the entire _Urantia Book_ to get its sweeping universe view of reality. Many of us started reading the book at Part IV, The Life and Teachings of Jesus. If you should like to get a quick overall view of the book you might read “The Gift of Revelation,” a twenty-two page summary of the basic facts and truths of _The Urantia Book_.
2. Have the _Concordex_ of _The Urantia Book_ available to help in researching topics on which you are preaching or teaching.
3. Use the _Paramony_, which is a parallel and harmony of the Bible and _The Urantia Book_,to locate _Urantia Book_ material on the Biblical text you are using in sermon preparation.

## Content

***Editorials***

- **An Age of Transition**
	Thomas G. Gillespie, president of Princeton Theological Seminary, tells graduating seminarians not to be surprised if the church resists their spiritual vision, for the church today is an acculturated institution in need of reformation.
- **A Call to Revivial**
	Paul H. Sherry, president of the United Church of Christ, points out that our churches and our culture stand in need of spiritual revival. _The Urantia Book_ presents an enlarged view of spiritual reality that will someday bring a spiritual renaissance to our world.
- **Confirming and Enlarging the Biblical Message**
	Marti J. Steussy, Old Testament professor at Christian Theological Seminary, acknowledges that there are many Biblical pasages in need of further thought and clarification. _The Urantia Book_ is a seminal source of such clarification.

***Articles***

- **Thoughts on the Brotherhood of Man**
	Experiential evidence points to the fact that the family of God is a vigorous and substantial human reality, not just a theoretical ideal.
- **The Religion of Jesus**
	Bruce Jackson describes four key theological areas in which _The Urantia Book_ has the potential to revitalize theology and bring about a new reformation in the Christian Church.
- **Prayerful Problem Solving**
	Prayer is not a means to circumvent universe laws. It may furnish insights through which we use these laws to solve problems. Occasionally, superhuman help appears to alter the outcome of natural laws.

## _Urantia Book_ Resources

Clyde Bedell (1898-1985), a widely recognized author and speaker in the field of advertising, over many years compiled an index-concordance of words, concepts, ideas, topics, and themes found in _The Urantia Book_. He published the first edition of the _Concordex_ in 1971. The third edition came out in 1986 and has over 110,000 references. The _Concordex_ is an indispensable research tool for finding passages and studying topics in _The Urantia Book_.

Dr. Duane L. Faw, Professor of Law emeritus of Pepperdine University School of Law, spent six years compiling a parallel and harmony of _The Urantia Book_ and the Bible. The _Paramony_ was published in 1986 and contains 25,000 cross-references revealing the similarities and differences between the facts and concepts of these two great books. Dr. Faw has been a teacher of adult Bible classes for 40 years and a certified lay speaker in the United Methodist Church for over 25 years. The _Paramony_ is an essential reference tool for studying relationships between _The Urantia Book_ and the Bible.

The Uversa Press edition of _The Urantia Book_, the Pathways edition of The Life and Teachings of Jesus, the _Concordex_, and the _Paramony_ can be purchased from The Good Cheer Press, P. O. Box 18764, Boulder, CO 80303 (1-800-767-5683).

An exhaustive _Urantia Book_ Concordance was published by the Urantia Foundation in 1993. If your local bookstore does not carry _The Urantia Book_ or _The Urantia Book_ Concordance, they can be ordered from the Urantia Foundation, 533 Diversey Parkway, Chicago, IL 60614 (1-888-872-6842). The Urantia Foundation also publishes French, Spanish, and Finnish editions of _The Urantia Book_.
