\* _A contemporary Psalm based on Psalm 98. See also Psalms Today, p. 23._

O sing to the Lord a new song, for his spirit has brought about marvelous things!

Creator of universes, nations that arrogantly declare your nonexistence fall into chaotic confusion.

The people hunger and their atmosphere is filled with life destroying pollutants.

Their leader's disregard for freedom of expression. individual creativity, and humane treatment of those who dissent undermine their capacity to govern.

Disorder and ineptitude rule the land.

Let the people of the world rejoice, for materialistic totalitarianism is falling.

Its spiritual nakedness is laid bare.

The unseen agents and influences of the Most High will prevail.

The inexorable destructiveness of a Godless society is revealed for all to see.

This is the dark before the dawn of a new day.

Through your epochal enlightenment these people are rediscovering their rich spiritual heritage, and are being lifted to a fresh and enlarged vision of Reality.

A new era of creativity is dawning.

The decadence of materialism and secularism is passing.

A rebirth of spiritual beauty and divine harmony inspires our souls.

Greater aspirations of righteousness and justice stir our minds and hearts.
