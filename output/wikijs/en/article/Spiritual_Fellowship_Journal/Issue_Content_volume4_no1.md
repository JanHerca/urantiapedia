## The Spiritual Fellowship of Students of _The Urantia Book_ 

A Spiritual Leadership Network Interested in _The Urantia Book_ as a Resource in Living, Creative Service, Teaching, Preaching, and Writing.

### Guiding Network Principles

1. We believe _The Urantia Book_ can make a significant contribution to the stimulation of spiritual creativity in churches, synagogues, and other religious institutions and their people.
2. We believe that at the present stage of spiritual development it is wise for ministers, priests, and rabbis to use _The Urantia Book_ as a resource for preaching and teaching rather than referring to the book itself or directing attention to it. Almost every concept in _The Urantia Book_ can be associated with some theologian, philosopher, or scientist in the past or present.
3. We believe that, although one should not be secretive about interest in _The Urantia Book_, one should use discretion in recommending it to people. The light of enhanced truth can frighten and blind as well as guide and illuminate.
4. We believe _The Urantia Book_'s claim to a revelatory source and status is not germane to its usefulness in the presentation of spiritual truth. Truth has an inherent appeal, regardless of its source, and can be used to enrich one's preaching, teaching, and living.
5. We believe the Spirit of God works among us in a differential and evolutionary manner; therefore, we recognize that for whatever reason some clergy may not wish to read and critically evaluate _The Urantia Book_. This diversity should in no way stand as a barrier to our mutual respect, fellowship, and love.
6. We believe the leavening process of creativity stimulated by _The Urantia Book_ should be ecumenical in nature.
7. We believe _The Urantia Book_ will eventually be recognized by the great majority of the world's religious leaders as one of the most constructive spiritual messages our world has received since Jesus' ministry on earth.

### Network Recommendations

1. Read the entire _Urantia Book_ to get its sweeping universe view of reality. Many of us started reading the book at Part IV, The Life and Teachings of Jesus. If you should like to get a quick overall view of the book you might read “The Gift of Revelation,” a twenty-two page summary of the basic facts and truths of _The Urantia Book_.
2. Have the _Concordex_ of _The Urantia Book_ available to help in researching topics on which you are preaching or teaching.
3. Use the _Paramony_, which is a parallel and harmony of the Bible and _The Urantia Book_,to locate _Urantia Book_ material on the Biblical text you are using in sermon preparation.

## _Urantia Book_ Resources

The rich mine of universe knowledge and spiritual wisdom found in the 2097 pages of _The Urantia Book_ tends to overwhelm the reader with its encyclopedic profusion. A detailed table of contents helps make the book manageable, but one soon realizes that reference tools are needed to find information hidden in its pages.

Clyde Bedell (1898-1985), a widely recognized author and speaker in the field of advertising, over many years compiled an index-concordance of words, concepts, ideas, topics, and themes found in _The Urantia Book_. He published the first edition of the _Concordex_ in 1971. The third edition came out in 1986 and has over 110,000 references. The _Concordex_ is an indispensable research tool for finding passages and studying topics in _The Urantia Book_.

_The Urantia Book_ reader also discovers information in many sections of the book which parallels Biblical material. Numerous young friends of the editor did not become interested in the Bible until they read _The Urantia Book_. The two books are mutually enhancing. Recognizing this close relationship, Dr. Duane L. Faw, Professor of Law emeritus of Pepperdine University School of Law, spent six years compiling a parallel and harmony of _The Urantia Book_ and the Bible. The _Paramony_ was published in 1986 and contains 25,000 cross-references revealing the similarities and differences between the facts and concepts of these two great books. Dr. Faw has been a teacher of adult Bible classes for 40 years and a certified lay speaker in the United Methodist Church for over 25 years. The _Paramony_ is an essential reference tool for studying relationships between _The Urantia Book_ and the Bible. A long time scholarly reader of _The Urantia Book_ describes the _Paramony_ as, “a well-structured volume, indispensable for those engaged in serious hermeneutics, particularly of the gospels.” The _Concordex_ and _Paramony_ can be purchased from The Good Cheer Press, P. O. Box 18764, Boulder, CO 80303.

An exhaustive _Urantia Book_ Concordance was published by the Urantia Foundation in 1993. If your local bookstore does not carry _The Urantia Book_ or _The Urantia Book_ Concordance, they can be orderd from the Urantia Foundation, 533 Diversey Parkway, Chicaago, IL 60614. The Urantia Foundation also publishes French, Spanish, and Finnish editions of _The Urantia Book_.
