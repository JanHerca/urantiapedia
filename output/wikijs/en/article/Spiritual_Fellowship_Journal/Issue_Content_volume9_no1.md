## The Spiritual Fellowship of Students of _The Urantia Book_

A Journal Established to Promote Theological, Philosophical, and Polity Discussions Germane to An Appropriate Symbolism and Socioreligious Expression of the Fifth Epochal Revelation.

### Guiding Principles

An Appropriate Symbolism and Socioreligious Expression of the Fifth Epochal Revelation Should: [^1]

1. Be based on the Fatherhood of God and the brother-sisterhood of humankind.
2. Be the outgrowth of love.
3. Foster sentiment, satisfy emotions, and promote loyalty.
4. Facilitate spiritual progress through cosmic meanings, moral values, social development, and personal living.
5. Provide supreme goals of living that are both temporal and eternal.
6. Be based on the biologic, social, and religious significance of the family.
7. Symbolize the permanent in the midst of unceasing change.
8. Glorify that which respects and unifies the diversities of society.
9. Promote higher meanings, beautiful relationships, and the highest values.
10. Embody some masterful mystery and connote some worthful unattainable.
11. Be meaningful and serviceable to both the individual and the group.
12. Serve as the skeletal structure for dynamic personal experience.

### The Purpose of Religious Institutions is to:

1. Dramatize the loyalties of spiritual experience.
2. Magnify the lures of truth, beauty, and goodness — supreme values.
3. Enhance the service of unselfish fellowship.
4. Glorify the potentials of family life.
5. Promote religious education.
6. Provide wise counsel and spiritual guidance.
7. Furnish and promote group worship.
8. Encourage friendship, neighborhood welfare, and moral values.
9. Spread the gospel of eternal salvation.

### Religious Institutions Should Avoid Dangers, Such As:

1. Fixation of ritual and theology.
2. Developing vested interests and secular involvement.
3. Serving the institution instead of serving God and ministering to people.
4. Forming competitive sects and developing a “chosen people” attitude.
5. Developing authoritarianism, dogmatism, and false ideas of sacredness.
6. Venerating the past while ignoring present needs and timely spiritual interpretations.
7. Failing to hold the interest of youth and grow with the times.
8. Losing sight of spiritual ministry and the saving message of salvation.

## Central Objective

The central objective of a group of people interested in initiating a new religious organization based on the teachings of the Fifth Epochal Revelation should be to create a polity with maximum flexibility that would function with small groups or large congregations, utilize lay leadership and/or ordained clergy, have crosscultural adaptibility, and broad theological inclusiveness.

Such an institution would be “ a gathering of persons who have accepted a common purpose, and a common discipline to guide the pursuit of that purpose, to the end that each involved person reaches higher fulfillment as a person, through serving and being served by the common venture, than would be achieved alone or in a less committed relationship.”[^2]

## Content

***Editorials***

- **New Religious Movements**
    Throughout history advanced spiritual insights have largely failed to reform traditional religions but have resulted in new religious movments.
- **No Credible Theology**
    Present day theology does not speak credibly and creatively to the contemporary mind and soul.
- **Theology vs. Spirituality**
    When theology masters religion, religion becomes more of a form than a force. Spirituality brings power even when associated with a deficient theology.
- **Contemporary Theology Anticipates _The Urantia Book_**
    If theologians were open enough to seriously examine a new paradigm of reality, _The Urantia Book_, they might just find what they are so diligently looking for!

***Articles***

- **Disseminating the Teachings**
History demonstrates that only religious organizations, institutional religion, is effective in infusing spiritual teachings into civilization.
- **Meta-Values**
    Understanding how to work with Meta-Value energies is as important as anything we will ever learn.
- **Doing the Father's Will**
    Doing the Father's will is a multi-faceted enterprise that encompasses a complete lifestyle.
- **Understanding Evil in Human Experience.**
    The ultimate problem of theism is the enigma of evil. The paradigm presented in the Urantia Papers provides the best answer now available to humankind.
