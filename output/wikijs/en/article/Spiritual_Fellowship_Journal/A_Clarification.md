The Spring issue of the Journal carried an article “Understanding Evil in Human Experience” in which the following paragraph appeared:

The second major source of evil in human experience is centered in finite personalities. Much of the suffering experienced in our world is the result of human evil-the ignorant violation of universe law and spiritual truth, and in humankind's sinful behavior-knowing and deliberate infraction of natural law and the will of God. These innumerable human forms of evil and sin precipitate crime and violence, and are socially compounded, resulting in brutalities like Dachau and Auschwitz and in wars with mass destruction like Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

It has been called to my attention that some people reading this might assume that I was implying that Dachau and Auschwitz were in the same ethical classification as Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This certainly was not intended. Under _The Urantia Book_ definitions of evil and sin, Dachau and Auschwitz are sinful human activities; while Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and war in general, would usually be regarded as human evils (lack of perfection). My intent was to cite Hiroshima and Nagasaki as illustrations of mass destruction, not to equate them ethically with Daschau an Auschwitz.
