O come, let us sing unto the Lord a new song, for the ancient litanies to the tribal deity envisioned by our forebears no longer speak to our minds and hearts.

We rejoice that our Sovereign Creator has blessed us with an enlarged picture of Deity and Reality.

The Universal Father is not a parochial deity of wrath and anger but a God of love and infinite perfection.

He is not a humanlike being who can be persuaded or with whom we can make bargains and deals.

The Primal Father is Absolute Reality, and in his personal relationships with us he conveys only that which is true, beautiful, and good.

The Father of All is no respecter of persons, groups, nations, or planets, but offers the same gifts of the spirit and potentials of eternity to all.

To each he says, “Be you just and loving, and strive for perfection even as I am perfect, for you are my mortal sons and daughters.”

We thank you, Gracious Lord, for the splendor of your creation, for your patient and sure plan of salvation, and for the opportunity to be copartners with you in eternity.

We worship you in the beauty of holiness and are renewed for the soul building struggles of experience on planet Earth. (96)
