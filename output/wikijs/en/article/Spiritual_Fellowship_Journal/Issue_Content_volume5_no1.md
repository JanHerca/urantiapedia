## The Spiritual Fellowship of Students of _The Urantia Book_ 

A Spiritual Leadership Network Interested in _The Urantia Book_ as a Resource in Living, Creative Service, Teaching, Preaching, and Writing.

### Guiding Network Principles

1. We believe _The Urantia Book_ can make a significant contribution to the stimulation of spiritual creativity in churches, synagogues, and other religious institutions and their people.
2. We believe that at the present stage of spiritual development it is wise for ministers, priests, and rabbis to use _The Urantia Book_ as a resource for preaching and teaching rather than referring to the book itself or directing attention to it. Almost every concept in _The Urantia Book_ can be associated with some theologian, philosopher, or scientist in the past or present.
3. We believe that, although one should not be secretive about interest in _The Urantia Book_, one should use discretion in recommending it to people. The light of enhanced truth can frighten and blind as well as guide and illuminate.
4. We believe _The Urantia Book_'s claim to a revelatory source and status is not germane to its usefulness in the presentation of spiritual truth. Truth has an inherent appeal, regardless of its source, and can be used to enrich one's preaching, teaching, and living.
5. We believe the Spirit of God works among us in a differential and evolutionary manner; therefore, we recognize that for whatever reason some clergy may not wish to read and critically evaluate _The Urantia Book_. This diversity should in no way stand as a barrier to our mutual respect, fellowship, and love.
6. We believe the leavening process of creativity stimulated by _The Urantia Book_ should be ecumenical in nature.
7. We believe _The Urantia Book_ will eventually be recognized by the great majority of the world's religious leaders as one of the most constructive spiritual messages our world has received since Jesus' ministry on earth.

### Network Recommendations

1. Read the entire _Urantia Book_ to get its sweeping universe view of reality. Many of us started reading the book at Part IV, The Life and Teachings of Jesus. If you should like to get a quick overall view of the book you might read “The Gift of Revelation,” a twenty-two page summary of the basic facts and truths of _The Urantia Book_.
2. Have the _Concordex_ of _The Urantia Book_ available to help in researching topics on which you are preaching or teaching.
3. Use the _Paramony_, which is a parallel and harmony of the Bible and _The Urantia Book_,to locate _Urantia Book_ material on the Biblical text you are using in sermon preparation.

## Content

***Editorials***

- **The Question of Angels**
	Mainline Christian theologians have had little to say about angels; however, their existence has gained contemporary credibility primarily because they have been championed by the popular press and books in secular bookstore.
- **Science and Religion**
	Our culture is beginning to understand that scientific facts are never in opposition to spiritual truth and they often help us transcend obsolescent religious concepts.
- **The Lessons of History**
	We are living in one of the major transition periods of history. Our world needs a new vision of spritual reality that is relevant and meaningful to contemporary experience.

***Articles***

- **Eastern Orthodoxy and _The Urantia Book_**
	Parallels in Eastern Orthodoxy and _Urantia Book_ theology are examined along with issues in church unity.
- **A Urantia Church?**
	_The Urantia Book_ presents one of the most complete pictures of theology and religion to humankind. Many students of the book refer to its teachings as their religion. Increasingly the question arises, “Will _The Urantia Book_ inspire the organization of new religious institutions?”
- **The Science of Serendipity**
	The happenstance of finding valuable things by accident is fascinating. Can this faculty be cultivated? Carol Hay discovers that the growing edge of science furnishes insights for creating conditions where seredipitous events are more likely to occur.

***Columns and Features***

- ***The Adventure Has Begun***
	A layperson describes his ongoing dialogue with _The Urantia Book_.
