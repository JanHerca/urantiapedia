You have decided or are considering starting your own study group. In this presentation, we will explore the essential elements to consider for successfully setting up and sustaining your study group.

Before starting a study group, it is important to answer some basic questions:
<br style="clear:both;"/>

- Why create a study group?
- What is the goal I want to achieve with this group?
- Am I ready to devote several years to this project?
- Will the group be virtual, in person, or both?
- How many people do I want to accommodate?
- Where will the meetings take place?
- How often will the meetings take place?
- Will my family support my decision?

Answering these questions is crucial to ensuring the progression and success of your group.

Today, there are several study group guides published by different organizations to help you plan and start your group. There are also websites dedicated to listing study groups and offering you the opportunity to publish your own. However, before you check out these resources, you must first answer one fundamental question:

What is the goal I want to pursue with this group?

The purpose of your group must be compatible with the mission of _The Urantia Book_. This means that you must be well versed in this mission, which you can discover in ***The Urantia Book*** and the Publication Mandate. This purpose is both intellectual and spiritual. One of the goals listed in ***The Urantia Book*** is to expand cosmic consciousness and heighten spiritual perception. To accomplish this, a study group must explore and study both of these aspects.

You will find many answers to the pursuit of a spiritual goal and its application not only in the first three parts of the book, but more specifically in the life of Jesus. One of the proposed goals is to bring to life the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. Do not be discouraged if these goals seem intangible or out of reach at first. Patience and perseverance are essential. Becoming a host of a study group offers many spiritual and intellectual benefits, which become more tangible over time. These benefits are not limited to the host, but are also part of the experience of the participants.

## Important criteria for the success of your group

Here are some important criteria to consider for the success of your project:
- Have read ***The Urantia Book*** at least once or more times.
- Have participated in a study group for at least one year.
- Have visited or participated in different study groups.
- Have decided how to facilitate your group.
- Have determined the frequency of meetings.

Each of these criteria requires a desirable experience to sincerely achieve the desired goal.

## Reading The Urantia Book

Reading ***The Urantia Book*** in its entirety one or more times is an absolute must.

## Participation in Study Groups

Having already participated in one or more study groups is an important asset, especially if this experience has been spread over several years and with different groups. These experiences will certainly enrich your efforts.

## Group facilitation

Knowing ***The Urantia Book*** and deciding how to facilitate a group is crucial, provided that humility guides that facilitation. As ***The Urantia Book*** states:

> “. . . The pride of unspiritualized learning is a treacherous thing in human experience. The true teacher maintains his intellectual integrity by ever remaining a learner.”” (<a id="a67_177"></a>[UB 130:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p3_7))

## Frequency of meetings

Frequency of meetings is essential to achieving a goal in harmony with that proposed by ***The Urantia Book***. The regularity of meetings has an important impact on the goal sought. For example, your education required regular periods of study and learning. Similarly, to achieve a goal in harmony with that of _The Urantia Book_, a sincere effort is necessary to establish a frequency of meetings and a reasonable study program.

- Once a week?
- Once every two weeks?
- Once a month?

Each host should decide how to run and facilitate their group, consulting with potential or current members on operating criteria. You can get inspiration from guides available online or consult with study group hosts.

## Number of participants

At the beginning, a group can be made up of a small number of participants, for example three people. With time and good recruitment strategies, this number can increase. However, it is recommended not to exceed ten to twelve people to facilitate exchanges and sharing.


## Meeting protocol

Develop a protocol for meetings and make sure that all participants know it and adhere to it. This will ensure the smooth running of the group and avoid any slip-ups. You can draw inspiration from the various study group guides to establish your own.

## Immediate actions to start your group

- Draw up a list of readers to invite and contact them.
- Contact the Urantia Association in your area for help and support.
- Place an ad in local newspapers or on a bulletin board at your local library or bookstore.
- Decide on the location and frequency of meetings.
- Publish your group on the study group directory and on the website of your local or national association.
- Create a Facebook or Twitter page to advertise your group.
- Send the invitation.


## Conclusion

In carrying out this project, you will encounter several challenges. Approach them with discernment and wisdom, and they will contribute to the growth and health of your group. Consult the available guides for advice on organizing, facilitating, and maintaining the functionality of your study group.

Happy study group!
