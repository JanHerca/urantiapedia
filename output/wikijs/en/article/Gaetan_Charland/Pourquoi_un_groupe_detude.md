As a student of The Urantia Book and a long-time host and member of study groups, I have always been deeply interested in their value to the mission of The Urantia Book. Over the years, I have organized numerous activities to promote not only the creation of new study groups, but also to explore their role in disseminating the teachings of The Urantia Book. I firmly believe that study groups are ideal venues for training a new generation of spiritual leaders and teachers in harmony with the teachings of Jesus.

In this article, I will list some of the reasons why it is important for every reader to participate in a study group, as well as what I believe to be their mission, philosophy, and purpose. Together, we will explore many of these reasons, as many readers, old and new, often ask the question: WHY PARTICIPATE IN A STUDY GROUP?

This is a very legitimate question, and I will endeavor to give a reasonable answer, supported by _The Urantia Book_, particularly by the life of Jesus. These reasons will also be drawn from the directives issued by the revelators of _The Urantia Book_ included in the Publication Mandate. I will also share with you many testimonies from study group hosts and some of their members who have been deeply touched by their participation.

After reading _The Urantia Book_, we all realize the complexity of the concepts presented, whether organizational or scientific, as well as the depth and diversity of the truths revealed, whether cosmological, philosophical, theological, or spiritual. The language and words used to describe these revelations can often lead us to understand only a small part of what we have read. As a result, if we are isolated in our study, it is easy to construct and crystallize an incomplete perception of the truths revealed in ***The Urantia Book***.

Many study group hosts and members have often found that long-time readers have great difficulty integrating into a study group because of the crystallized concepts they have acquired over years of reading in isolation, compounded by the lack of sharing with other readers. This is one reason why it is important for readers to join a study group if they desire to deepen their understanding and participate in the mission of revelation.

Association with other readers in the context of a study group protects us from the crystallization of concepts and perceptions, helps us to clarify, broaden and deepen the understanding of the concepts and truths revealed in ***The Urantia Book***. It stimulates the intellectual and spiritual growth of the reader, encourages the sharing and integration of spiritual truths, strengthens our faith and confidence in a divine plan of eternal adventure, helps to reduce confusion of ideas, encourages spiritual brotherhood, contributes to the expansion of cosmic consciousness and enhances spiritual perception.

## Summary of the benefits of a study group:

- Protects against the crystallization of concepts and perceptions.
- Clarifies, broadens and deepens the understanding of concepts and truths.
- Stimulates intellectual and spiritual growth.
- Encourages the sharing and integration of spiritual truths.
- Strengthens our faith and trust in a divine plan.
- Helps reduce confusion of ideas.
- Encourages spiritual brotherhood.
- Helps expand cosmic consciousness.
- Enhances spiritual perception.

In the introduction to _The Urantia Book_, the revelators inform us of the state of our minds. Here is what a Divine Counselor tells us on this subject:

> “IN THE MINDS of the mortals of Urantia—that being the name of your world—there exists great confusion respecting the meaning of such terms as God, divinity, and deity. Human beings are still more confused and uncertain about the relationships of the divine personalities designated by these numerous appellations.” (<a id="a52_319"></a>[UB 0:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p0_1))

Who among us has not encountered difficulty in understanding what this Divine Counselor was telling us in the Introduction to the Urantia Book? Who among us, after several readings, does not still experience certain difficulties in intellectually understanding certain concepts, not to mention the appropriation of spiritual truths?

The revealers have also given certain directives to better supervise the wise and progressive dissemination of the revelation. Here are two of these directives given in [the Publication Mandate](/en/article/The_Publication_Mandate):

> “This Book is given to those who are ready for it, long before the day of its world mission. Thousands of study groups must be organized and the Book must be translated into many languages. Then the Book will be available when man's battle for freedom is won and the world is once again made more fertile for the religion of Jesus and for the freedom of mankind”. (10.5).

## Why thousands of study groups?

Almost all of the world's religions have been using study groups for hundreds of years as an effective means of studying and disseminating their teachings. This is how they have been able to spread all over the planet while minimizing obstacles of all kinds. The revelators have certainly observed how the world's religions have spread and suggested this method to us after seeing its effectiveness in our cultures.

Study groups are very easy to set up and offer a simple, step-by-step way to learn. They are a very wise strategy for disseminating the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ without encountering resistance from various religious groups or political systems in many countries of the world. They fit well into any culture, are free, do not require a special location to hold them or special materials to participate in, except a book and a willingness to join in a very important world mission.

As readers, we have a great opportunity to participate in one of the most important global projects underway today. But we also have a great responsibility to share what we have so generously received. One of the most accessible ways is to create a study group or, at the very least, to become a participant in one. It is difficult for us to imagine and fully realize the spiritual benefits of such an action or the positive influence that our participation in a study group can have on those around us. Too often, we underestimate the consequences of our actions and the intellectual and spiritual influence of revelation in our lives.

## Here's what the developers say:

“You who have dedicated your lives to the service of the Book and the Brotherhood can hardly realize the importance of your actions. No doubt you will live your life and die without fully understanding that you are participating in the birth of a new age of religion on the world.”

In the life of Jesus, we can see how He trained His apostles. If we look closely, the method used for training the apostles was very similar to the format of a study group, where everyone, after the Master's teaching, would come together in a group to discuss their understanding of the lessons they had received. All of this was done privately under the supervision of Jesus and lasted for several years. And even after all these years of training and teaching by their Master, they still had difficulty understanding His teachings.

## What readers are saying about their study group experiences:

I have heard a multitude of testimonies from readers about the benefits of a study group. Listing them all here would take several pages of text. For the brevity of this article, I will choose a few and summarize some of these many testimonies. Here is what they say:

The study group is one of the most precious moments of my week. It reconnects me with a fundamental reality, but so often eclipsed, veiled by the routine of daily activities. This fraternal meeting allows me to progress and maintain contact with the highest aspirations of my human life. It is a weekly meeting with my brothers and sisters in spirit with whom I walk, pray and deepen my faith as well as my knowledge of spirituality. It is a great privilege to feel understood and supported by this fraternity for which I feel a great attachment. The study group of the fraternity of readers of the _Urantia Book_ is for me like a spiritual bridge thrown over space and time.

Since reading ***The Urantia Book***, I know that God indwells me through the Thought Adjuster, but since I have been a regular member of a study group, I now feel the Presence of God in me and I live more and more according to His Will.

The study groups have helped improve my understanding of the 5th Revelation. Reading the texts and the discussions between readers bring me light and guide me in my daily actions. The meetings each week are necessary appointments, because reading these texts, by uniting in the search for God, creates a beautiful solidarity. This experience of fraternity encourages us to live it in our surroundings and through service.

Here are some more:

- The study group helped me deepen my understanding of the teachings.
- He made a huge difference in my life.
- It changed my perceptions of the _Urantia Book_.
- It opened me up to a better spirituality.
- He introduced me to the book again.
- He was a huge source of inspiration.
- He taught me the importance of brotherhood.
- I finally understood the significance of the message of the gospel of Jesus.
- I feel more and more like a son of God.

There are immense benefits to starting a study group or becoming a participant, it's up to you to discover them. Don't wait for the perfect time to start one or become a member, the time is now! Take part in the greatest adventure of your life, support the mission of revelation.
