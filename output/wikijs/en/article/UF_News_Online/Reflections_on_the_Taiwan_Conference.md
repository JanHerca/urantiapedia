_By Several Attendees of the Conference_

_Editor’s Note: In mid-March, on the heels of the long-awaited online publication_ of The Urantia Book _into simplified Chinese characters, representatives of Urantia Foundation gathered in Taiwan. They presented the teachings to an enthusiastic group of Chinese-speaking students of_ A Course in Light—_a series of lessons in spiritual development._

[Click here to read about the conference and its planners in the July issue](/en/article/Georges_Michelson_Dupont/Urantia_Foundation_Visits_Taiwan).

_The following article is a compilation of reflections on what this seminal Urantia gathering meant to some of the participants. Appreciations are extended to Mo Siegel; Gard Jameson; Georges Michelson-Dupont; Victor García-Bory; Gaétan Charland; Geri Johnson and her husband, Rob Mastroianni; and Tamara Strumfeld, who joined Urantia Book translator Richard Zhu and spiritual leader Vicki Yang in Taipei, Taiwan, for a two-day conference._

I believe it was God’s blessing that brought you all here to be with us. You came to reveal higher truths, to teach us that we are embarking on the most rewarding journey in life—to find God, and to serve others along the way. Your presence was a wake-up call!

My Outlook email signature reads, “Sharing is Creating.” That weekend I learned that “Sharing is Godlike—divine.” [UB 111:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p5_1)

It takes a strong mind to absorb such an enormous revelation of higher truth, and to undergo the resultant shifts in consciousness. The Tao Te Ching says, “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” In March of 2024, I took my first step closer to a divine revelation.

Reading _The Urantia Book_ and discerning its profound truths will be a monumental task, one that requires active commitment. I believe this revelation will change the world and lead us to a better future. Our actions will help convince others, and we must support one another along the journey.

I salute everyone who has ever been here, taking that single step in the journey of a thousand miles. Let us not just walk the journey, but dance! It is a dance for life.

When I learned that there are papers in _The Urantia Book_ that focus on Jesus, my interest was piqued. And when I learned that Jesus is also Michael of Nebadon, our Creator Son, I felt infinitely touched and wistful. My understanding has been expanded!

When I first heard of _The Urantia Book,_ I wanted to learn more, but reading the English text is not easy for me. I have been waiting for the Chinese translation. I am very thankful to the Universal Father that I can read the book and learn with others!

The conference was a sharing of unexpected gains! I didn't realize what a grand and rare opportunity this was until at the very end of the event, when a fellow student asked, “Have there been any miraculous inspirations in the long process of handing down _The Urantia Book_?” I was very touched by all the responses. They were powerful stories, and I felt a real sense of love and family. I felt so blessed and thankful that these people are involved in this mission!

I've heard a lot about this book, and now I've finally met it. Every moment of the conference was abundant and beautiful. This exchange not only raised our awareness and understanding of the reality of the universe, but also enhanced our minds, our senses, and our experiences.

This conference was like a meeting between the universe and the earth. Seeing every lecturer from every country, every student from every place, the convergence of energies filling the space, I felt as if I were in the Garden of Eden.

It was an eye-opening lesson to realize that Jesus is not just the Son or the Ascended Master we thought he was, but that his true identity is our Planetary Prince, who gave himself to his people for the good of his people We Earthlings are part of a larger universe, inhabiting the world recognized as “Urantia,” and possessing cosmic citizenship.

Spending most of one’s life re-reading a book definitely has value. I'm thankful for your hearts, love, and patience in spending so much time and effort just to give us a glimpse of what's going on in the universe. This also inspires us to be more patient with ourselves.

The topic of “Cosmic Consciousness” gave me the opportunity to more clearly know the Spirit that dwells within us, to recognize the Thought Adjuster, which helps us to awaken within us the desire to seek God's teachings, to fulfill God's will, and to be sustained! It has moved me to connect with my inner Thought Adjuster on a daily basis.

Today has been a very emotional day, and I can't say enough about it! I can only be thankful to the many brothers and sisters who have made the publication of _The Urantia Book_ possible, so that we, too, can be blessed by it. Getting to know God is a very personal journey!

Two men shed touching tears at today's Urantia Book workshop. We may not be able to fully empathize with the strong sense of mission and dedication that is behind these tears, but at least we know that it is because of their selfless dedication that we have the opportunity to know God better.
