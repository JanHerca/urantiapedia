Urantia Foundation launched its new website in 27 languages on July 8, topping off an ambitious four-year journey to update the organization’s primary outreach tool. The goal was to create a website suited for the 2020s with a user-friendly interface that offers a calming and intuitive experience, while retaining all the information from the former site.

The new [urantia.org](https://www.urantia.org/) has a streamlined navigation and an enhanced reading experience of _The Urantia Book_. A notable feature is the availability of free audiobooks in 12 languages! Users can enjoy simultaneous listening and reading while online, or they may download the files to their preferred device for offline listening.

Access the site in any of the 27 languages via the globe icon in the upper right corner of each page. The process of translating all the pages is an ongoing endeavor. The efforts of our volunteer translators were invaluable to this project. We are deeply grateful for their service!

This website is an ongoing, evolving project. The team is committed to continually enhancing the site with new content, additional translations, and overall improvements. We welcome your feedback; please send your comments to Tamara Strumfeld at [tamara@urantia.org](mailto:tamara@urantia.org).

**The following are some remarks that readers have shared:**
