_“Knowledge is possessed only by sharing; it is safeguarded by wisdom and socialized by love.”_ [UB 48:7.28](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_28)

Urantia Press has recently released the paperback edition of The Untold Story of Jesus. A generous donor has given 1,000 copies to be used for a free library giveaway program.

You can receive 3–5 free books to place in libraries such as public libraries, university libraries, hospital libraries, youth hostels, hotels, churches, cruise ships, nursing homes, coffee shops, and small roadside libraries. You just pay for shipping. To learn more, contact [jessica@urantia.org](mailto:jessica@urantia.org).

_“The great hope of Urantia lies in the possibility of a new revelation of Jesus with a new and enlarged presentation of his saving message which would spiritually unite in loving service the numerous families of his present-day professed followers.”_ [UB 195:10.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_16)

_“The time is ripe to witness the figurative resurrection of the human Jesus from his burial tomb amidst the theological traditions and the religious dogmas of nineteen centuries. Jesus of Nazareth must not be longer sacrificed to even the splendid concept of the glorified Christ. What a transcendent service if, through this revelation, the Son of Man should be recovered from the tomb of traditional theology and be presented as the living Jesus to the church that bears his name, and to all other religions!”_ [UB 196:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p1_2)

## The Fourth European Conference, Paris, France, 2025

**Urantia Association Presents**  
**The Fourth European Conference, Paris, France**  
**Theme: The Distributivity of God: Man as God’s Heir**  
**June 6 to 9, 2025**

It is good to tell people, “You are formidable and unique, and both the world and the Universe need you!” But can you really explain why? The Urantia Book offers us a new cosmology of the universe, one in which the Universal Father is the Architect-Designer-Creator. To this end:

_It would seem that the Father, back in eternity, inaugurated a policy of profound self-distribution. There is inherent in the selfless, loving, and lovable nature of the Universal Father something which causes him to reserve to himself the exercise of only those powers and that authority which he apparently finds it impossible to delegate or to bestow._ [UB 10:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p1_1)

Don’t miss this opportunity to study the fifth epochal revelation in the City of Lights! The Hotel CIS Paris Ravel venue is located in the heart of Paris amidst a verdant setting. The planning team is doing everything possible to make this conference well-organized and affordable.

Presentations will be conducted in French and projected onto a large screen in English. Registration materials will include a printed booklet in both languages. Depending on the needs of the participants, we will provide more languages.

For details, visit [https://europe2025.urantia.fr/](https://europe2025.urantia.fr/) or contact the planning team directly at [evenement\_2025@urantia.fr](mailto:evenement_2025@urantia.fr)
