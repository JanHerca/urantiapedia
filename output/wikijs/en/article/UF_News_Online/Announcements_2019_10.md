## Science Symposium 2019—Responding To The Biggest Questions In Science

The June 2018 issue of Scientific American included a special report entitled “The Biggest Questions in Science,” which was also published concurrently in Nature. What a fortunate coincidence that the editors of the two leading English-language scientific journals published a list of the most pressing questions facing the scientific community in time to be incorporated into the program for Urantia Foundation's upcoming Science Symposium 2019.

This list of questions includes: What is spacetime? What is dark matter? How did life begin? What are the limits of manipulating nature? How much can we know? What is consciousness?

Urantia Foundation is hosting its second Science Symposium at 533 Diversey over the first weekend in November. Presentations and discussions will be addressing many of these questions in relationship with Urantia Book concepts.

All presentations and discussions will be live-streamed to the public. The broadcasts will also be recorded for future viewing.

Watch for an email in late October containing a link to the program.
