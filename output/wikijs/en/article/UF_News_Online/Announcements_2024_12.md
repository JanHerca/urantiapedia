## Urantia Foundation’s New Library for Translations and Revisions

This library was created to preserve the best thinking of individuals or groups who have translated _The Urantia Book_ into their native language. This archive will evolve into a centralized repository that contains all past and future efforts to create quality translations and revisions. While most translations have been published by Urantia Foundation, this library also contains some brought to life by committed organizations and individuals. We anticipate that this collection will grow and be utilized by scholars, translators, and revisers.

## The Fourth European Conference, Paris, France, 2025

**Urantia Association Presents**  
**The Fourth European Conference, Paris, France**  
**Theme: The Distributivity of God: Man as God’s Heir**  
**June 6 to 9, 2025**

It is good to tell people, “You are formidable and unique, and both the world and the Universe need you!” But can you really explain why? _The Urantia Book_ offers us a new cosmology of the universe, one in which the Universal Father is the Architect-Designer-Creator. To this end:

> It would seem that the Father, back in eternity, inaugurated a policy of profound self-distribution. There is inherent in the selfless, loving, and lovable nature of the Universal Father something which causes him to reserve to himself the exercise of only those powers and that authority which he apparently finds it impossible to delegate or to bestow. [UB 10:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p1_1)

Don’t miss this opportunity to study the fifth epochal revelation in the City of Lights! The Hotel CIS Paris Ravel is located in the heart of Paris amidst a verdant setting. The planning team is doing everything possible to make this conference well-organized and affordable.

The number of participants is limited to 80 people, so reserve your spot soon!
