## Dancing With God ~ A Retreat For Women

**Thursday evening, September 12 through Sunday, September 15, 2024**

After an absence of five years, the Daughters of God facilitator team—Katharina Becker, Doreen Heyne, and Line St-Pierre—is once again hosting a women’s retreat at Urantia Foundation.

Throughout the weekend, participants will cultivate an environment of trust within a spiritual circle. We will explore and share our personal experiences and discoveries of how we answer this calling to dance with God, which is an open invitation to manifest God's love in the world by living a Spirit-guided life that shapes tomorrow through actions taken today.

We will delve into questions such as, “What has aided you in uncovering or persisting in the exploration of that life-nurturing sustenance that brings solace to our souls, that sense of unity, spanning from simple pleasures to the abundance of joy, enveloped in the harmonies of love?”

The retreat begins with dinner on Thursday evening and ends after lunch on Sunday.

If you would like to be a part of this event at Urantia Foundation headquarters, 533 W. Diversey Parkway in Chicago, contact Line St-Pierre at line.stpierre@gmail.com.

Let us share our spiritual journey together!

This book is better suited for placement in neighborhood “little libraries,” hospitals, coffee shops, libraries, hotels, cruise ships, and youth hostels. It also makes a wonderful gift to someone you love.
