_By Urantia Foundation staff_

Urantia Foundation launched a fresh new website in July 2024. Four years in the making, it was our biggest undertaking in 15 years. With _The Urantia Book_ now available in 27 languages, we needed the same number of translations for all of the pages on the website.

The number of work hours involved in translating a 27-language website was staggering. Without our volunteers we would never have been able to complete this remarkable project.

We extend our heartfelt appreciation to all of our volunteers for their hard work and dedication that brought our website to life. Their efforts will continue to be a priceless gift to readers worldwide for years to come!

We asked our volunteer website translators if they would agree to be acknowledged. While many preferred to remain anonymous, those that agreed are included below.

## Arabic: Amal Farhat of Lebanon and Canada

Amal writes, “With passion for the metaphysical, I have been researching the nature and evolution of the universe since 1994. I wrote _Trumpet Universe and Ascension to the Light_. I have participated in the international conferences of the European Society for Astronomy in Culture (SEAC) with Professor Mosalam Shaltout, vice president of the Arab Union for Space Sciences and Astronomy (AUASS) at the Alexandria Library in 2009 and in Athens in 2013. After two decades of researching, I came across _The Urantia Book_ in 2016, and a new universal vision compelled me to help with the Arabic translation. I am also an interior designer and an artist of oil paintings. A Lebanese/Canadian, I have lived in four countries and have three wonderful, successful children.”

</figure>

Hamid tells us, “I was introduced to _The Urantia Book_ by a friend. I was so fascinated by the beauty and depth of the concepts presented in the book that I could not stop reading it and talking about it with whoever came across my path. The Farsi translation project started in early 2000 and lasted close to 25 years. I hope that it provides enriching answers to Farsi-speaking truth seekers, as it did for me.”

## Finnish: Tapio Talvitie of Finland

<figcaption>Tapio Talvitie</figcaption>
</figure>

Tapio has been a reader of _The Urantia Book_ since 1993. He writes, “_The Urantia Book_ did attract and convince me of its divine truth by its distinct spiritual flavor that could not be mistaken. One of our lessons is that we all are brothers and sisters in spirit and our Father loves each of us equally.”

## French: Claire Mylanus of France

<figcaption>Claire Mylanus</figcaption>
</figure>

Claire writes, “I was brought up with values, art, literature, history, philosophy and without institutional religion. After searching in my youth for the meaning of life, through reading books about philosophy and religion, I came across _The Urantia Book_ in the ’70s, and it was what I had been searching for all those years. It answered all my questions with intelligence, logic, and great insight. An all-new and beautiful picture of the meaning of life with a cosmic vision unfolded in front of me—magnificent and loving!”

Mirela was born in Romania and came to Germany in her twenties. She lives in Saarland, Germany, where she works as a pharmacist. Mirela told us, “I found _The Urantia Book_ by chance on the internet in 2016, and it piqued my curiosity to learn about so many different topics in one book. My expectations were more than rewarded. This is the most important book that humanity can possess; it lifts and liberates. I wish more and more people would read the book. This would mean a huge leap forward in spiritual progress, brotherhood between people, and peace on Earth.”

I promptly purchased it through Amazon.com and read it through for one full year. Since then, I have attended eight international conferences, starting with the Philadelphia event in 2005, to deepen my understanding of the book. My life is now dedicated to the enlightenment of truth, goodness, and beauty.”
