Humans have an innate “love of adventure, curiosity, and dread of monotony.” <a id="a41_77"></a>[UB 14:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p5_10) Before having my son, Huck, I looked at my own life—the habits I had developed, routines I had fallen into—and I wanted to do something new. Ironically, embarking on a parental adventure led me into the monotony of parenting.

When I'm feeling burdened by having to repress my desire to satiate my desire for adventure (the Grand Canyon has been calling to me for months), I take comfort in knowing that my parenting experience has boundless value in enlarging my understanding of the relationship between God and his children. _The Urantia Book_ states, “A true family—a good family—reveals to the parental procreators the attitude of the creator to his children.” <a id="a43_439"></a>[UB 84:7.30](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p7_30) This statement has given me a purpose that affects me daily. Every moment provides me with an opportunity to learn about an ideal child-like attitude toward the Father.

A few months ago I was talking to a Buddhist and another reader of _The Urantia Book_. The Buddhist said that she did not want to have children because she wanted to focus on reaching Enlightenment. My immediate response was to nod my head, thinking that, like learning the violin, attaining Enlightenment would be put on the back burner upon having children. _The Urantia Book_ reader, however, asked her the question, “Do you not think that the experience of having children would help you reach Enlightenment?”

Yes, singing children's songs all day can be monotonous, and when I have a crying child and pureed peas in my hair, I cling to the knowledge that the overall effect of parenting will be enlightening.

I can't estimate how much time I have spent doing nothing of any spiritual worth, forcing my Thought Adjuster to wait until my Thursday night sitcoms are over, and fighting off—I am sure on too many occasions—my Adjuster's prompting. But God continues to love me and tirelessly encourages my growth. Like myself, Huck has a lot to learn about trust, and it comes easier for him in some situations than in others. He has recently begun walking, and I have been struck by how easy it can be to get him to walk where I want him to. If I get down on his level, point, and say, “Let's go this way,” he'll walk right alongside me. He does not know why we are going that way; all he knows is that he's been told “over there” is a good place to be. On the other hand, almost every diaper change comes with a fair amount of kicking and screaming. Wouldn't life be easier if Huck just accepted the diaper change and trusted that it was all for the best? Wouldn't life be easier if I just accepted God's will and trusted that it would lead me down the best path?

Hopefully l'll be able to look back on this experience with satisfaction and enjoy a long awaited friendship with Huck. From a universal standpoint, there will be one more Finaliter to embark on the glorious adventure in the outer space levels—one more Finaliter who will contribute to the growth of the Supreme. As beautiful as that is, what sustains me through the twentieth rendition of “Old McDonald” is the knowledge that, through this challenge, I will develop a greater understanding of how to be a child of God.

## A Moment in Time

Looking back over the many years of reading and studying my beloved Urantia Book, it seems to me that the revelation has certain components that are more relevant during different stages of mind development. During different times in my life, certain teachings have captured my attention.

I remember the tremendous joy welling up in my soul, when I completed my first reading of _The Urantia Book_ back in the summer of 1977. When I closed the book, I realized that after many years of searching for truth, I had finished what I deemed to be the greatest book ever published! How could it be that so many questions were answered by one book? A short time later I realized that a lifetime would be required to bring reality to what I had just discovered.

I remember how impressed I was with Rodan's philosophy and how very deep are the Master's words of insight and wisdom. How long would it take for these teachings to become part of me? I spent over ten years interpreting the ordination sermon, and after all my attempts at understanding these words, I found some meaningful understanding almost twenty years later.

Having a personal faith in life everlasting has been the main ingredient of my mind-set throughout this mortal life. Believing that this adventure will continue on throughout a universe career has taken me to a place of understanding that allows for successes as well as failures.

Making these teachings a personal understanding took many adjustments in comprehension and change in attitude. Most important, it means being able to speak of these in my own words. And so I wish to share three insights after my years of study.

The first is about the First Jubilee. Rather than telling you the insight I gleaned from this, I recommend that you study Paper 27, which will lead to an understanding and an appreciation of it and how important it is to have this experience while living our mortal life.

The second is in Paper 140, “The Ordination of the Twelve.” It has been my blueprint for happiness. I have found within these words more life and more value than in all the others. And how amazing is it to know that our Paradise Creator Son was giving advice to you, to me, and to all intelligent life. Capturing even a partial understanding of this message will improve the quality of life for any truth seeker.

The third is, for me, the expansion of maturity and the equivalent of soul growth. I think that we might be reading the most profound sharing of truth in Paper 118, section 1, “Time and Eternity.” In the summer of 1977 the statement, “and this represents our best concept of eternity and the eternal” made me tremble at the power contained within this section, and even today, as I review these passages, I experience a great sense of humility and gratitude.
