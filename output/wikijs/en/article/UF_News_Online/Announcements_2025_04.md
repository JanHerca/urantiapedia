**Presents**

**Science Symposium IV: The Evolution of Human Knowledge—100 Years Later**

**Thursday, November 6–Saturday, November 8, 2025**

The first 25 years of the twentieth century were full of exciting evolutionary advancements which transformed the scientific landscape and altered the course of human life. These included Max Planck's discovery of the quantum nature of energy, Albert Einstein's groundbreaking special theory of relativity, the first powered airplane flight by the Wright brothers, the invention of radio communication by Marconi, the pioneering of intelligence testing by Alfred Binet, and the accidental discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming

We also began receiving the Urantia Papers.

Have scientific discoveries conflicted with revealed concepts? Or do they confirm and reinforce them? We invite science enthusiasts who are longtime students of _The Urantia Book_ to provide an overview of the past 100 years within their discipline, and to share their knowledge of how we have progressed during that span of time.

If you have an interest in archaeology, astronomy, biology, chemistry, cosmology, genetics, geology, psychology, physics, or physiology, and would like to participate in the symposium, please respond with a topic you can research and present in a formal setting.

Participants will be asked to submit a written proposal by **April 15** and, if accepted, author a paper which will be published on the Foundation’s website. You may choose to present the results of your research in person at the Foundation or remotely via Zoom. Sessions will be live-streamed, recorded, edited, and published online.

Send inquiries and proposals to [joanne@urantia.org](mailto:joanne@urantia.org). We look forward to receiving yours!
