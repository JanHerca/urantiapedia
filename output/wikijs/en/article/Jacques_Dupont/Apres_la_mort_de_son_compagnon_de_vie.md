- It's a psychological upheaval.
- We see that all his gestures and decisions were conditioned by the presence and points of view of the other.
- We do not have any available reaction energy... The passage of time is necessary to foresee rehabilitation.
- Habits — customary gestures — numerous objects — are emptied of their meaning.

All these conditionings had dug their furrows in our thoughts, but, because we are “living beings”, the flow of time, the impulse of our will and our lucidity will slowly fill them to make way for new ones, adapted to the new life that we will have chosen.

- If time is the first fundamental element in our rehabilitation, the second is the deliberate acceptance of this imposed solitude, and this acceptance must be total.

The death of a loved one is the most extraordinary ordeal imposed on a human being; it is also the richest in lessons.

Refusing to seek to understand death is like the child who spiritually refuses the life lesson contained in the constraints imposed by his parents.

Live this imposed solitude — by rejecting distractions:
- It is becoming aware of the ephemeral nature of material ties: possessions, honorary titles...
- It is gradually finding what we were before: our conditions of balance, our opinions, our aspirations, our ambitions...and considering the panorama of our evolution.
- It’s discovering the childish side of one’s illusions.
- It is a revelation in self-understanding which leads to progress in self-control.
- It brings about a decantation and a re-evaluation in its scale of values.
- It is discovering one's individuality, one's uniqueness, which is a foretaste of the World of Houses where the notion of family is transcended, and where relationships are formed under the sole influence of spiritual affinity.
- It is a step in adaptation to Reality which, taken to the end, manifests itself by the awareness of filiation with our heavenly Father.
- It is to note that if we want to describe our states of mind to our neighbor, it is only with God, the Father of our soul, that we can intimately “share” these states of mind. This is what an anonymous American thinker explained in the Brotherhood journal last winter, who specified that “by giving the creature a unique personality, God wanted to ask each creature to experience from an absolutely unique point of view, His incomparable existence; a point of view that we can describe to another, but that we can only share intimately with God. And this is the sharing between the son and the Father.”

Experiencing this filial love for our common Father gives birth to authentically fraternal love for our neighbor — it is finding one's life companion as a brother or sister.

Death should be meditated upon frequently and regularly.

this meditation, in particular, allows us to approach true values.

But our material ego always spontaneously and profoundly opposes this meditation requested by the soul.

Jacques Dupont JUNE 1981
