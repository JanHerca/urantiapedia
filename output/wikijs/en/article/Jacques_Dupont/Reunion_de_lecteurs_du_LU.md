If we are all gathered here, it is driven by the interest that each of us has in _The URANTIA Book_.

The _URANTIA Book_ is the beginning of the fifth Revelation. It is a re-actualization of the Fourth Revelation, bringing to our minds and souls a host of new, unexpected and unsuspected knowledge:
- It is the satisfaction of the mind when it discovers the explanation of hitherto unexplained phenomena of nature.
- It is the satisfaction of the mind when it discovers the history of evolution going from seaweed to the survival of the soul, passing through the history of man.
- It is the satisfaction of the mind when it discovers the history of religion, from evolutionary religion to revealed religion - the true religion - which is to live a personal relationship with God, with the divine spirit which lives in each of us.
- It is the satisfaction of the mind to understand that we are endowed with a unique personality making us all different from one another, and that the only equality among men lies in the individual endowment of a fragment of the Father, our Thought Adjuster - that our personality is endowed with absolutely respected free will making us entirely responsible for ourselves.
- It is the satisfaction of the soul: when it discovers justifications for its faith in God, its love for the Father and for Jesus.
- It is the satisfaction of the soul when it is watered by the divine spirit which inhabits man, this spirit which is truly the water of life, (<a id="a45_144"></a>[UB 153:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p3_2)) which makes us feel the penetrating and constructive love that the Father has for us, provoking in us the need to belong to him - to be his daughter, his son, it is a need for total and eternal belonging.
- It is the satisfaction of the soul when it is nourished by the word of God poured out in the flesh and by the phenomenon of the Son of Man submitted to the will of God.

Thus The _URANTIA Book_ is of interest on both mental and spiritual levels, but its purpose is our spiritual education.

> _“Peace be upon you. You rejoice to know that the Son of Man has risen from the dead because you thereby know that you and your brethren shall also survive mortal death. But such survival is dependent on your having been previously born of the spirit of truth-seeking and God-finding. The bread of life and the water thereof are given only to those who hunger for truth and thirst for righteousness—for God. The fact that the dead rise is not the gospel of the kingdom. These great truths and these universe facts are all related to this gospel in that they are a part of the result of believing the good news and are embraced in the subsequent experience of those who, by faith, become, in deed and in truth, the everlasting sons of the eternal God. My Father sent me into the world to proclaim this salvation of sonship to all men. And so send I you abroad to preach this salvation of sonship. Salvation is the free gift of God, but those who are born of the spirit will immediately begin to show forth the fruits of the spirit in loving service to their fellow creatures. And the fruits of the divine spirit which are yielded in the lives of spirit-born and God-knowing mortals are: loving service, unselfish devotion, courageous loyalty, sincere fairness, enlightened honesty, undying hope, confiding trust, merciful ministry, unfailing goodness, forgiving tolerance, and enduring peace. If professed believers bear not these fruits of the divine spirit in their lives, they are dead; the Spirit of Truth is not in them; they are useless branches on the living vine, and they soon will be taken away. My Father requires of the children of faith that they bear much spirit fruit. If, therefore, you are not fruitful, he will dig about your roots and cut away your unfruitful branches. Increasingly, must you yield the fruits of the spirit as you progress heavenward in the kingdom of God. You may enter the kingdom as a child, but the Father requires that you grow up, by grace, to the full stature of spiritual adulthood. And when you go abroad to tell all nations the good news of this gospel, I will go before you, and my Spirit of Truth shall abide in your hearts. My peace I leave with you.”_

These fruits are the imperative conditions of pure love, under a cloudless blue sky.

Meditating on the application of each of these fruits in our everyday relationships with those close to us opens the door to the happiness of living.

Just as Jesus is one with the Father, so Jesus invites us to be one with him, therefore, for us, to be one with our neighbor, this is how we will love one another as Jesus loved us and still loves us.

It is when we are in this state of unity that Jesus is among us.

If we become aware of these facts, and decide to follow Jesus, we would be to the Fifth Revelation what his apostles and disciples were to the Fourth Revelation.

> “Peace be upon you. For a full week have I tarried that I might appear again when you were all present to hear once more the commission to go into all the world and preach this gospel of the kingdom. Again I tell you: As the Father sent me into the world, so send I you. As I have revealed the Father, so shall you reveal the divine love, not merely with words, but in your daily living. I send you forth, not to love the souls of men, but rather to *love men.* You are not merely to proclaim the joys of heaven but also to exhibit in your daily experience these spirit realities of the divine life since you already have eternal life, as the gift of God, through faith. When you have faith, when power from on high, the Spirit of Truth, has come upon you, you will not hide your light here behind closed doors; you will make known the love and the mercy of God to all mankind. Through fear you now flee from the facts of a disagreeable experience, but when you shall have been baptized with the Spirit of Truth, you will bravely and joyously go forth to meet the new experiences of proclaiming the good news of eternal life in the kingdom of God. You may tarry here and in Galilee for a short season while you recover from the shock of the transition from the false security of the authority of traditionalism to the new order of the authority of facts, truth, and faith in the supreme realities of living experience. Your mission to the world is founded on the fact that I lived a God-revealing life among you; on the truth that you and all other men are the sons of God; and it shall consist in the life which you will live among men—the actual and living experience of loving men and serving them, even as I have loved and served you. Let faith reveal your light to the world; let the revelation of truth open the eyes blinded by tradition; let your loving service effectually destroy the prejudice engendered by ignorance. By so drawing close to your fellow men in understanding sympathy and with unselfish devotion, you will lead them into a saving knowledge of the Father’s love. The Jews have extolled goodness; the Greeks have exalted beauty; the Hindus preach devotion; the faraway ascetics teach reverence; the Romans demand loyalty; but I require of my disciples life, even a life of loving service for your brothers in the flesh.” (<a id="a75_2347"></a>[UB 191:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/191#p5_3))

> ““Let me emphatically state this eternal truth: If you, by truth co-ordination, learn to exemplify in your lives this beautiful wholeness of righteousness, your fellow men will then seek after you that they may gain what you have so acquired. The measure wherewith truth seekers are drawn to you represents the measure of your truth endowment, your righteousness. The extent to which you have to go with your message to the people is, in a way, the measure of your failure to live the whole or righteous life, the truth-co-ordinated life.”” (<a id="a77_544"></a>[UB 155:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p1_5))

It is therefore up to us to become aware that our work is a personal work of self-knowledge and self-control — and **by the example of our life**, to spread the gospel of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of men.

The choice is ours — the free will of our personality is challenged.

Let us apply this mastery in our meetings - let us strive to dominate this characteristic of our human nature that we all possess to varying degrees, this impatience driven by pride meaning that “what I want to say is more important than what you say” - let us respect the personality of the other. Let us respect each person's point of view, without interrupting the person who is speaking.

Finally, if our meeting takes place at this spiritual level, Jesus will be among us. We will be imbued with a state of communion with the Father, with Jesus and with each other, a state which could be manifested by the sharing of the meal of remembrance, engendering in us the spiritual emotion of a bath of divine love.

The high significance of this commemoration prevents it from being a ritual because it requires a quality of fraternity between those present.
