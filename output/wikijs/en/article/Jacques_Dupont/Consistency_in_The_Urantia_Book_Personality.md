> From a paper by Jacques Dupont, Recloses, France
{.is-info}

Even for an author writing about recorded facts, consistency is difficult to maintain in a work as extensive as _The Urantia Book_. For hypothetical authors seeking to foist a fake revelation upon the world—hence relying upon their imagination— maintaining consistency would be a nightmare task. For authors presenting revelatory truth, even upon difficult topics where ambiguity intrudes, recipients of a revelation would justifiably have the expectation of a high degree of consistency.

The topic for this issue, “personality” would have a “top ten” rating for degree of difficulty in maintaining consistency. There are more than 1000 references in the book from which to form a judgment. Those presented are mostly from a paper by Jacques Dupont, which was written to elucidate the topic of personality, but not specifically from the point of view of consistency. Judgment on consistency is in the hands of the reader. It is probably easier to look out for inconsistencies than to attempt a consistency analysis. Now from Jacque’s paper:

A dictionary definition of “personality” is: _That which defines the individuality of a moral person._

And for psyche: _The function through which a conscious person understands himself as a self, a unique and permanent individual._

What is personality? One answer given in _The Urantia Book_ that needs to be kept in mind is: “_Personality is one of the ***unsolved mysteries of the universes***._” (<a id="a47_168"></a>[UB 5:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p6_2)) The book also tells us that: “_The Universal Father is the secret of the reality of personality, the bestowal of personality, and the destiny of personality,_” (<a id="a47_370"></a>[UB 0:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p5_5)) that, “_the personality of the spirit Son is the master pattern for all personality throughout all universes,_” (<a id="a47_524"></a>[UB 115:3.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_14)) and that, “_Havona is the home of the pattern personality of every mortal type._” (<a id="a47_654"></a>[UB 14:6.37](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p6_37))

We learn also that, “_the Creator-Son uses the creatures of Havona as ***personality-pattern possibilities for his own mortal children***,_” (<a id="a49_142"></a>[UB 14:6.28](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p6_28)) and the Creator-Sons themselves are, “_perfect personalities, ***even the pattern for all local universe personality***._” (<a id="a49_311"></a>[UB 1:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p5_6))

In _The Urantia Book_, personality and pattern are so closely linked that it would seem to be valid to assume, on occasion, that personality is pattern rather than personality has pattern. Perhaps that is part of the mystery.

We must be careful about how we interpret the word “pattern.” The master pattern for a car, for example, may still give rise to an enormous variety of cars that look and behave differently due to the addition, modification, or removal of components that leave the basic pattern unchanged.

The concept of personality as pattern may help with our understanding of other highly unusual characteristics attributed to personality in _The Urantia Book_—such as “changeless,” and “without identity.”

We Urantians have our unique personality bestowed upon us by the Universal Father prior to receipt of another unique gift from the Father, a pre-personal part of himself having divine personality that the book terms our “**Thought Adjuster**.” (<a id="a57_245"></a>[UB 16:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_3); <a id="a57_288"></a>[UB 5:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p6_6); <a id="a57_329"></a>[UB 112:0.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_15)) Herein may lie a clue to at least a partial understanding of this mysterious concept of a personality having no identity of its own.

The “pattern” of the personality bestowed upon us is capable of being expressed in many ways but in only one way that will become “perfection.” A task of the Thought Adjuster is to aid us to achieve that perfection while, at the same time, leaving intact the free will our personality confers upon us. “_The ***survival of identity is dependent on the survival of the immortal soul*** of morontia status and increasingly divine value. Personality identity survives in and by the survival of the soul._” (<a id="a59_504"></a>[UB 16:9.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p9_3)) The “identity” belongs to the living system that will be reconstituted on the mansion worlds, not to the personality. The role of the personality is to **unify that living system**. (<a id="a59_730"></a>[UB 112:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_2); <a id="a59_775"></a>[UB 0:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p5_11))

There are far too many statements relating to “personality” for us to be able to explore all of them. A selection follows that ranges over the whole of the first three parts of the book. The profound concept of “personality,” as developed in _The Urantia Book_, is quite different from the customary loose usage of the word. It appears on more than 1000 occasions in the book, 86 percent being found in Parts 1-3.

The abbreviated quotations given below may shed some light on the importance and meaning of the book’s “personality” concept while, at the same time, illustrating the remarkable consistency of its usage—despite the fact that many individual authors were involved in the writing of the Urantia Papers.

- Personality **is bestowed by the Universal Father** himself or by the Conjoint Actor, acting for the Father.(<a id="a65_111"></a>[UB 112:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_3))
- Personality (of mortal man) is **neither body, mind, spirit; nor the soul**. (<a id="a66_80"></a>[UB 0:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p5_11))
- Personality **is bestowed upon** the living and associated energies of matter, mind, and spirit, and survives with the survival of the morontial soul. (<a id="a67_154"></a>[UB 0:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p5_11))
- Personality is **integrating and supervising**. (<a id="a68_51"></a>[UB 103:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p5_5))
- Personality is **changeless** in an otherwise ever-changing creature experience. (<a id="a69_84"></a>[UB 0:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p5_11))
- Personality (human) and the Adjuster personality are **changeless**; the **relationship between them** (in the soul) is **nothing but change**. (<a id="a70_147"></a>[UB 112:0.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_15))
- Personality is basically **changeless**; that which changes is the **moral character**. (<a id="a71_91"></a>[UB 140:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p4_7))
- Personality **unifies** all other associated factors of individuality. (<a id="a72_74"></a>[UB 0:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p5_11))

- Personality or identity forms are **patterns** resultant from energy (physical, spiritual, or mindal) but are not inherent therein. (<a id="a74_135"></a>[UB 0:6.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p6_12))
- Personality: Paradise Sons of the order of Michael are perfect personalities, even the **pattern for all local universe personality**. (<a id="a75_138"></a>[UB 1:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p5_6))
- Personality: The **relative free will** which characterizes the **self-consciousness of human personality** is involved in:
	1. Moral decision, highest wisdom.
	2. Spiritual choice, truth discernment.
	3. Unselfish love, brotherhood service.
	4. Purposeful co-operation, group loyalty.
	5. Cosmic insight, the grasp of universe meaning.
	6. Personality dedication, wholehearted devotion to doing the Father’s will.
	7. Worship, the sincere pursuit of divine values and the wholehearted love of the divine Value-Giver. (<a id="a83_104"></a>[UB 16:8.7-14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_7))
- Personality is distinguished by two self-manifesting phenomena—**self-consciousness** and associated **relative free will**. (<a id="a84_128"></a>[UB 112:0.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_5))
- Personality imparts unique **prerogatives of choice** to the living system. (<a id="a85_79"></a>[UB 118:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p7_7))
- Personality: **Morality**, virtue is indigenous to human personality. (<a id="a86_73"></a>[UB 16:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p7_1))
- Personality is characterized by **morality**—awareness of relativity of relationship with other persons. (<a id="a87_108"></a>[UB 112:0.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_11))
- Personality **discerns conduct levels** and choosingly **discriminates** between them. (<a id="a88_90"></a>[UB 112:0.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_11))
- Personality is **unique**, absolutely unique. (<a id="a89_49"></a>[UB 112:0.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_12))
- Personality **responds** directly **to other-personality** presence. (<a id="a90_72"></a>[UB 112:0.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_13))
- Personality: capacity for **divine personality** is **inherent** in the prepersonal **Adjuster**. (<a id="a91_101"></a>[UB 5:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p6_6))
- Personality: capacity for **human personality** is **potential** in the **cosmic-mind endowment** of the human being. (<a id="a92_121"></a>[UB 5:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p6_6))
- Personality bestowal enables a mortal creature to become reactive to the constitutive recognition of the **three basic mind** realities of the **cosmos**:
	1. The mathematical or logical **recognition** of the uniformity of **physical causation**.
	2. The reasoned **recognition of** the **obligation of moral conduct**.
	3. The **faith-grasp** of the fellowship **worship of Deity**, associated with the **loving service of humanity**. (<a id="a96_117"></a>[UB 16:8.15-18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_15))
- Personality bestowal confers the **dignity of cosmic citizenship**. (<a id="a97_71"></a>[UB 16:8.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_15))
- Personality: the **experiential personality** of man is not observable as a functional reality until the material life vehicle has been **touched by** the divinity of the **Universal Father**. (<a id="a98_196"></a>[UB 5:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p6_6))
- Personality causes spirit to **strive for the mastery of energy-matter** through the mediation of mind. (<a id="a99_107"></a>[UB 112:0.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_6))
- Personality is independent of, and antecedent to, the bestowal of the **Thought Adjuster**. (<a id="a100_95"></a>[UB 16:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_3))
- Personality, **in the supreme sense, is the revelation of God to the universe of the universes**. (<a id="a101_101"></a>[UB 1:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p5_13))
- Personality **identifies man as a spiritual being**. (<a id="a102_56"></a>[UB 112:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p2_9))
- Personality **is uniquely conscious of time**, and this is something other than the time perception of mind or spirit. (<a id="a103_122"></a>[UB 112:0.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_16))

These few quotations present only a very limited portion of material in _The Urantia Book_ relevant to “personality,” but should be sufficient to demonstrate that the book is a work of intense and dedicated scholarship, not the dreamtime meanderings of a sleeping mind as proposed by Martin Gardner nor a slap dash book that Gardner claimed could have been written over a couple of weekends by one such as Dr W.S. Sadler.

A more in-depth study could include other related concepts such as “power-personality” that lead into consideration of the role of personality in the unification of God the Supreme and the Almighty Supreme in the Supreme Being.
