I want a buddy, an accomplice, a friend..., for him to be happy, for us to be happy together, fulfilled, alive, real, dynamic, new..., for it to be simple, real, joyful...
I know he is there, deep in my heart, like a little flower standing courageously and waiting...
Who is waiting for what?
That I am Me, Him...
Who awaits my good will, my connection, a look, a conviction...
He wants it so much...
One day he will convince me.
He knows himself well; he knows me too.
He is patient, respectful, serene, without constraints.
HE KNOWS.
And The Truth? It's seductive. It's dynamic. It's unambiguous.
It's definitely convincing.
He wants me to hand over the reins to him.
Finally, he wants it?! He wants my happiness, our happiness.
He wants us to be, Us, Gui, Me...
How to resist? Why resist?
It seems so simple: Team spirit, trust?!... Faith?!...
He will definitely convince me.
He must know that I already love him, without knowing him: O(a curiosity, my search, stealthily...
One step forward, half a step back... 迆, tumult of time, the attraction of
TRUE...
What does he actually want?
Let him take the reins? Why not?
He is so sure of himself, so bright, so true, so competent!!!
He will definitely convince me.
