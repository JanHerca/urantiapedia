There is always a beginning, an instant in time in which one wonders for the first time: What is the meaning of life? Where do I come from? Who am I and where am I going? What awaits me at the end of what we call life? I asked myself these questions one night while I was walking alone on a deserted street in my city. I had no answers that night and I really thought I never would. The mystery of the unknown wrapped me in a cloak of fear and hopelessness, because what future could there be for the man who walks through life, divorced from the knowledge of God? Such a man is an orphan not only of hope, he is also an orphan of the present and of any perspective of cosmic reality.

I was far from imagining that, unknowingly, several months later my questions launched in the form of a silent plea would not remain in the air. God is love and answers every prayer that springs from the sincere heart of any of his children. I didn't know him at that time, but without a doubt he did know me and loved me, and knowing him was discovering that each of my questions has an answer. I understood that being alive is the greatest of blessings, knowing God is knowing that life is an avenue of infinite possibilities, that walking with God makes man truly real and a citizen of the universe. What a great blessing for man to know that he can become a co-creator with his father. And I wonder if there can be a greater motivation for any personality in the universe. What a great love of our Father who gives us, evolutionary beings, almost material, the opportunity to collaborate with him in the vast project of his creation. Will you carelessly let this wonderful opportunity pass you by? The answer to such a question lies in the free will of each one of us.

But knowing God is equivalent to facing not a false security that can be transmuted into disenchantment; God is equivalent to knowing that you are a real being, a new creature that has to face increasing challenges, that the striving for perfection is not a static state of mystical contemplation. True mysticism is the continuous search for that internal harmony that fills you with peace in the midst of the turbulence of everyday life. Mysticism is pursuing beauty and practicing goodness. Mysticism is the embrace of higher and higher values, it is living life with the greatest possible intensity for the sake of a supreme goal of cosmic value. Jesus was not an exalted mystic, his strength lay in the perfect synchronization of his life to the will of the Father and the altruistic service to his neighbor.

Today, more than twenty years after asking myself the classic questions of the why of life, it does not mean that I already know everything. The search for truth is a path as long as infinity. For each rung you climb there are thousands to climb, each victory leads you to a new battle and each battle won translates into a greater understanding of the universe because each victory is a victory of God. That is one of the greatest discoveries that a mortal being can make: the certainty that we are not alone in our struggle in the ascent towards Paradise. The promise that “I will be with you every day until the end of the world” is not a mere metaphor; indeed He is with us in the presence of the Thought Adjuster. And what a joy when in future ages we can merge with that fragment of divinity; Without a doubt, new questions arise from here, questions not of disbelief but rather of curiosity, which drive me every day to have more faith and more hope in that great future for which our Father has created us. Who can penetrate the depths of the mysteries of God? When I think of this, I am overwhelmed with astonishment and I thank that loving father who, being a finite man, with a strong animalistic tendency, full of imperfection and limitations, nonetheless gives me the opportunity to penetrate those mysteries, but now from a new perspective. Now I can enjoy in advance that all my doubts will be evacuated as I ascend in my aspirations to become a finalist, that is, a completely spiritualized new being.

What does it mean to be a finalist? What duties and rights will we have when we achieve such a level of existence? What tasks will we be assigned? What shape are things on a much more spiritualized planet? (Like the worlds of Jerusem, for example) These and other questions I ask myself in my moments of meditation and, although the UB offers some information about our future, I think that we are far from recognizing the real value of such a high dimension of life. Experience is the only thing that can validate complete satisfaction, but to reach such a sublime experience it is necessary to live life every day as a mere mortal, a mortal on the way to perfection, a mortal with a yearning for transcendence, a mortal who somehow He has spontaneously consecrated his will to the will of the Heavenly Father.

Huge are the discoveries, just as enormous are the questions that will arise as we advance in time. New facets of God will be revealed to us, new goals and new values will be the motivation for our existence. Gone are the days when faith was the stick that awkwardly guided us in the thick mist of this materialized and relativistic world. Then we will walk an avenue saturated with wisdom and love in the very presence of the Father. What human being like us can even imagine feeling such a sublime blessing? Because then no task will be a burden, and it will have to be undertaken with such joy that, when it is finished, the soul and spirit will be left thirsty for new endeavors. Because there will be no greater motivation than dedication and adoration in service to the work of the Father.

All these reflections serve as a spur to my spiritualization. For each new question arises a new motivation to yearn for divine wisdom; knowing that every day I can know a little more about God is the force that makes me shake when apathy and laziness threaten to turn my life into a meaningless routine. Asking myself more and more profound questions makes me see how ignorant and how far I am from true knowledge, and then I immerse myself in the search and dwarf myself in the adoration of that immense Father in mercy and majesty to thank him for life, and for Thank you for that faith smaller than a mustard seed that you have placed in my heart, but without which my life would be without purpose.

But will we understand everything or will we know everything? Will the time come when we can tell ourselves “I have reached the end of all work and all search”? Is Paradise that place of ineffable happiness where we will only live in the static contemplation of our Father? Certainly not, those who propose such a theory are wrong, they ignore that the universe is movement, that creation is unlimited, that for every second of our mortal life, God's creation grows in an infinity that no being is capable of assimilating in its whole. Rest in the sense of inactivity is just a utopia, new and greater challenges await us. What will those challenges be? Will we have any task to accomplish in future creations? Will we be assigned some mission in evolutionary worlds like ours or in ours? The UB hints at some of that, and I particularly believe that it must be so, but when, how and what experiential meaning it will have for us is something that only belongs to the future, back in those distant ages in which the realities of God will leave from being a mere uncertainty, because by then we will be truly spiritualized personalities where faith will be united with knowledge and face-to-face experience with the different orders of highly spiritualized beings will be a permanent reality. Little by little, the mystery of God will be revealed to us, eternity awaits us, the infinite crossword puzzle of knowing our creator will demand the total consecration of our thoughts and our lives, because there will always be questions and the unknown will always spread out before our feet. . The road is ready to travel and with it the security of victory. It is true that at present such a reality could seem impossible to us, the rebellion of Lucifer and the lack of Adam influenced why we Urantians are now so little spiritualized beings, but that we are little spiritual does not mean in any way that our Father denies us the chance to meet him and enjoy his love. The path for seekers stretches before our horizon. Walking it will not be easy, but for those with dissatisfied minds and eager to know the truth, it will be encouraging to know that each day will bring new challenges for the spirit and mind.
