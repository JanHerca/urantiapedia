The life of Jesus in full swing in both its spiritual and human dimension. Each one of his teachings contains a universe of valid answers for an endless number of situations, although as a general rule his redemptive mission is emphasized, thus leaving other no less important facets somewhat relegated, which in one way or another help us in the spiritual development of our lives. lives.

Today, after more than two thousand years of scientific and technical development and evolution, the mind of modern man is still stranded in a sea of obsolete prejudices and taboos that places him at the same level as primitive times. Today humanity still suffers from the narrow-mindedness of false concepts, which damages and lacerates relationships even among those we call brothers.

The Gospel of Jesus, as it is not circumscribed to a specific era, country or race, has a cosmic and universal value that transcends the borders of narrow theological dogmas, dogmas that limit not only the development of society, but also the evolution of the mind and of religion itself. Jesus' conversation with the Samaritan woman, recounted in the Gospel of Saint John, is a reliable example of the universality of his teachings.

This narration is more than a simple conversation between a man and an ordinary woman; It is also the multiple symbol of various facets and aptitudes, a reflection of the society of all times, trifles that prevent us from objectively assessing our neighbor, to the point of considering him unworthy of our consideration, much less receiving the message of salvation. The Samaritan woman is the symbol of that social group that we consider lost, either because it does not have our same theological system, or because it belongs to that race considered incapable of assimilating our superior religion.

But let's see our teacher conversing with this woman, who represents not only another nationality, separated by a historical enmity and by two different interpretations of a religion (because Jews and Samaritans do not treat each other); a woman who also had a rather dubious reputation regarding her morals. No rabbi would have dared to have a conversation in a public place with a woman, especially if she was an adulteress. But here the Master, giving an example of love and humility in perfect harmony with his message of love, because Jesus knows man in his true dimension, saw in this woman something more than a simple villager; he saw a soul in need and yearning to know the truth. He saw the potential for survival and the intimate desire to restart a new life, governed by spirituality.

Although Christ was not a social reformer, he did elevate the feeling of dignity, love and justice, giving it a new and greater dimension. One of these cases was that of women, relegated almost to the level of an animal, where religion did not recognize their merits, much less opportunities. However, when we read the gospels we see the important role that women had in the ministry of their bestowal; even later, during the early days of Christianity, many women assumed the role of guides and leaders in the proclamation of the kingdom. Differences of creed, race, sex, religion or social class are elements that are still in force and unfortunately constitute obstacles when it comes, not only to transmit the message, but also affect our interpersonal relationships, an attitude that clearly denotes what little that we have understood of the message proclaimed more than two thousand years ago in Galilee.

The mission of Jesus was to proclaim the fatherhood of God and therefore the brotherhood. We have only one father and that makes us brothers, brothers by faith and by the desire for perfection, which is nothing other than living according to the will of the Father. Jesus did not come to bring a new religion; his effort is rather to demonstrate how religion has to be lived, redefined as man's experience with spiritual realities. That is why it has a cosmic and universal value. Jesus welcomed people of all races and social strata. Our Father gives each man the opportunity equally; It is up to us to decide whether to accept or reject such a sublime proposal. This is the only thing that determines whether we transcend or get lost.

The water of life continues to flow from that inexhaustible spring that is the gospel of the kingdom. Whoever is thirsty has nothing else to do than ask for it and, as the Master assured, he will be satisfied forever. That is my experience and that of all of us who have tasted the water of life and, like <a id="a52_306"></a>[la mujer de Sicar](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p5_2), our lives have been transformed. And if our lives have been transformed, it means that others will too.

“Here I am, I am at the doors and I knock”. This invitation is still valid, there is no other condition than to accept. Our Father expects man to open the door of his heart and that we have the willingness to surrender our will to Him, and surrendering our will to the Father is nothing more than the interior willingness to do everything that is ethical, everything that is beautiful. and everything that denotes kindness and love. This delivery is never a sacrifice, it is rather a joy that sublimates the soul and drives man to ever higher goals in a search for supreme values. When this happens, the miracle of the new birth takes place.

This call of love is not limited to a specific racial or social group, nor is it determined by gender or moral condition. God loves man and, accordingly, man must love God. When it really happens, a new creature is born and then it can say: behold, all things are made new. This is the religion that Jesus proclaimed and lived, and the one we have to live if we are consistent with our faith. This is the only way we have to show that we are children of God, and if we are children of a Father, therefore we are brothers. And if we are brothers it means that we have broken down the barriers of prejudice and taboos. GOD loves each of his children and we must love each other as brothers. When this happens we will be building the kingdom of love. May the Lord help us in such a sublime and noble task. Once again, let us look at the Master's example, not as a mere spectator, but to put it into practice and make it the model for our lives. The world is full of Samaritan women crying out for the water of life; it is up to us to take them to the well that never runs out.
