<p>More on Prayer</p>
<p>Prayer is not a technique of escape. Rather it is a stimulus to spiritual growth—even in the face of the apparently impossible.
Words are not relevant in prayer. They are merely the intellectual channel in which the river of spiritual supplication may flow.
Even when air currents are ascending, not even the eagle can fly except it outstretches its wings. So in prayer, it is the spiritual attitude that carries our prayer to the Infinite.
God answers prayer with an increased revelation of truth, an enhanced appreciation of beauty, and an augmented concept of goodness.
Thus, true prayer is always a reaching out to God in faith and self-forgetfulness.</p>
