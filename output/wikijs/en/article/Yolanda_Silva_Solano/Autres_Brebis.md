> “_“But I have many other sheep not of this fold, and these words are true not only of this world. These other sheep also hear and know my voice, and I have promised the Father that they shall all be brought into one fold, one brotherhood of the sons of God. And then shall you all know the voice of one shepherd, the true shepherd, and shall all acknowledge the fatherhood of God._” (<a id="a41_386"></a>[UB 165:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p2_9))

How beautiful this parable and also what an image! Jesus once again and with new words brings out the religion of the Spirit, the one that leaves us free to follow our path, without giving importance to the means by which it reaches us. In his words, there is not a crumb of intransigence or intolerance, there is no rite, nor conditions, the only valid thing is to listen to his voice without giving importance to which flock the lambs belong. I have always thought that in the worlds where we are going, we will find ourselves on the same levels with those who during our life, have disqualified us because they do not think like us.

> “_The apostles were a bit disconcerted by the open manner of Jesus’ assent to many of the Greek’s propositions, but Jesus afterward privately said to them: “My children, marvel not that I was tolerant of the Greek’s philosophy. True and genuine inward certainty does not in the least fear outward analysis, nor does truth resent honest criticism. You should never forget that intolerance is the mask covering up the entertainment of secret doubts as to the trueness of one’s belief. No man is at any time disturbed by his neighbor’s attitude when he has perfect confidence in the truth of that which he wholeheartedly believes. Courage is the confidence of thoroughgoing honesty about those things which one professes to believe. Sincere men are unafraid of the critical examination of their true convictions and noble ideals.”_” (<a id="a45_833"></a>[UB 146:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p3_2))

“_Do not make the mistake of judging the religion of others according to your own standards of knowledge and truth._” <a id="a47_118"></a>[UB 101:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p9_2) . because “The enlightened spiritual consciousness of civilized man is less interested in a specific intellectual belief or a particular way of life than in discovering the truth of life, the right and just technique for responding to the ever-recurring situations of mortal existence.” <a id="a47_449"></a>[UB 101:9.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p9_5).

In the image of Jesus carrying the least of the lambs. We should see ourselves there, because whenever we become aware that our strength is on the verge of exhaustion, if we surrender with trust and faith, I am sure that the Master will stretch out his arms and carry us on his shoulders so that we can go forward. For there is nothing surer than the popular saying; God squeezes but does not strangle. We must not conceal our weariness and weakness. For Jesus is quick to help us, always and whenever “Mortal man must; through the recognition of truth, the appreciation of beauty and the adoration of goodness, develop the recognition of a loving God and then progress through ascending levels of deity to the understanding of the Supreme. Deity, after being grasped as unified in power, can then be personalized in spirit to be understood and attained by creatures.” <a id="a49_869"></a>[UB 56:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p6_3).
