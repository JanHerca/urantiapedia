The “Personal Reflection: True, False, or ‘I Don't Know’” survey is intended as a personal soul survey tool, so to speak. The privacy and uniqueness of each person who takes the survey is respected, that is, the personal relationship with their concept of the Supreme (God, Yahweh, Brahma, etc.). The survey aims to be neutral regarding religion. No one is asked to turn in the results or share their responses, although you are welcome to do so if you wish.

Do the survey in a moment of silent reflection, with an attitude of complete honesty and openness to the One who is worshipped. Take the survey several times over the years, if you feel the urge to do so.

A key factor in keeping an open mind while thinking about claims is to ask yourself something like, “How likely is this claim to be true?” Or perhaps: “Is there a possibility that this statement implies something other than what I learned?”

Relax and enjoy life with your God!

**SURVEY**

There is no obligation to share responses. Consider them in private with care and honesty; seek solace with a humble heart during your moments of meditation alone. Choose the best answers

Date:

Choose an option (True, False, I don't know)

1. All those who have lived on Earth and have held beliefs or convictions have understood that they are true or that they will be true one day.

2. Every detail of the beliefs and convictions that I currently have will prevail throughout the world throughout my life and forever on Earth.

3. All truth from the Supreme Being has been revealed through all possible resources and it is not possible that anything else can be revealed.

4. My spiritual guide book (or law) is the final, absolute, complete and last source that will be sent to help humanity.

5. All teaching in my spiritual book is completely true and can be taken as definitive, that is, not subject to interpretation.

6. Since I know which religion I have chosen, I can correctly assume that what I believe about it justifies indifference to the teachings of other religions.

7. I can accept the fact (or the possibility) that, beyond my beliefs and those of other people, there is a gigantic reality that cannot be imagined or understood by humanity.

8. I believe that my Supreme Being is omniscient.

9. I believe that I am not omniscient.

10. I am not omniscient, and I would insult the Supreme Being if I said that what I believe is absolute, and therefore I would reject the possibility that there is much in His mind that I do not know or believe. I would be bold if I told the Supreme Being in my private thoughts that my favorite guidebook (my authority) is final and that He cannot add to our learning.

11. I have confidence when I turn to the Supreme in my prayers and meditations, and I trust that what I believe is complete; no new learning can come afterwards.

12. I would insult the Supreme if I demand to myself or to others that He (or She) is not able to teach humanity more things neither now nor in the future.

13. No scientific activity, new discoveries, theological discussions, or philosophical insights could change my mind about what I believe to be true, and no discovery after my death will change the course of humanity.

14. Regarding statement number 13, I think that no book, essay or document regarding the changes could be considered to adjust my thinking.

15. I am not aware of all the activities in the world and all the ideas and insights of others. There is no need to listen to the ideas of others or to evaluate their philosophy of life; no profit is desired.

16. Considering the answers to the 15 questions above, I am now able to accept that there may be something else to believe that would benefit me and others.

17. When I listen to others I try to listen to get deep values and meanings, which I recognize as beneficial for all.

18. It is possible that there are details of the Supreme that are for me, for humanity and for the Universe of Universes and that have not been revealed.

19. It is possible that, once my body dies, I can resurrect happily at a time and place in the Universe and learn more about the capabilities and gifts of my Supreme, and also receive and achieve with awakening what I failed to accept or receive here in this life.

20. The 19 questions above have been helpful to me and will probably be helpful again in future reading.
