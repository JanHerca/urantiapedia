We were all taught that on each of the worlds of Havona we would have a different mission to accomplish. A billion missions! We are sometimes less aware that on this planet each of us has a mission.

Likewise, we know that Jesus said to his apostles: “Go therefore into all the world and preach to all nations and races this gospel of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man,...” <a id="a40_189"></a>[[UB 191:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/191#p4_4)] (<a id="a40_236"></a>[UB 165:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p6_3)). However, on closer inspection, we see that the mission of the apostles differs somewhat from one to another. Chapter 2 on page 2047 deserves some attention. John is asked to renounce intolerance and to devote his life to proving that love is the greatest thing in the world. Peter is asked not to neglect the weak, the poor, and the young. Andrew is asked to trust others. James is asked to cultivate patience. Thomas is asked to cease doubting, to be strong in faith and powerful in the kingdom. Nathaniel is asked to devote himself to the welfare of his earthly brothers, to mix friendship with his counsel, and to add love to his philosophy. To Philip, to proclaim the gospel to the Gentiles. To Matthew, to teach all peoples the gospel of the kingdom. And what does he say to the Alphaeus brothers? Although he recognizes them as apostles, he does not call them to a teaching mission but simply to do the work they were previously doing as if it were for God: “_Continue to believe when I am gone and to remember your association with me after you have perhaps returned to the work you were accustomed to before you came to live with me._” <a id="a40_1426"></a>[[UB 192:2.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p2_13)]

The mission is not unique, it depends on each person's skills.

But it's not just the apostles. The case of David is interesting. He does not receive a mission from Jesus, he gives himself a mission, not that of preaching but that of facilitating the work of others. He organizes the camps and he organizes the message bearers. He was “the one on whom one could count” (cf. 2000) This is why Jesus said to him: “_David, my son, the others did what they were ordered, but it is from your own heart that you rendered service, and I have noticed your devotion. You too, you will serve, one day, with me in the eternal kingdom._ ” <a id="a44_563"></a>[[UB 182:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p2_10)]

And then there are women. The sociological context does not allow Jesus to make them apostles in the strict sense but he gives them the mission of proclaiming the emancipation of women and caring for the sick. (cf. <a id="a46_215"></a>[UB 150:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p1_3))

Nor can we forget the ordination of the 70. In fact, there were more than 150 sincere and proven disciples, (cf. <a id="a48_113"></a>[UB 163:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p1_1)) but only 70 received ordination and were sent out to proclaim the gospel.

Have things changed today? I don't think so. We are not all destined to “go teach the fifth revelation” to the peoples of the earth, but we are all called to reveal in our own way the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of men. The revelators of this fifth epochal revelation have asked that “study groups” be formed; it is not said that these groups must be identical in their operation.

Some want active groups for which the study of the book would only be a support for social action. Others want groups in which the spiritual element alone ensures the cohesion of the whole, almost meditation groups. Still others only seek the element of understanding or knowledge that the plurality of points of view could provide. And there are still many other variants which take into account the diverse sociological realities of places and countries.

However, we should not neglect certain references such as:

1. The way Jesus dealt with his apostles. Many months of teaching passed before they were allowed to preach: “He forbade them to baptize. He warned them not to preach publicly, but explained that later he would allow them to preach publicly.” <a id="a56_243"></a>[[UB 138:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p1_1)] Is it wise to act before having acquired some knowledge?
2. The fact that the fifth revelation constantly refers to the triple level of things, meanings and values, with the particular remark that the domain of values is that of individuals and not of the group as the following sentence discreetly observes: “In physical life, the senses reveal the existence of things and the mind discovers the reality of meanings; but it is spiritual experience which reveals to individuals the true values of life.” <a id="a57_447"></a>[[UB 100:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p4_4)]
3. The fact that the fifth revelation differs from the fourth in its cosmic approach. It is teeming with facts and meanings that are important in the face of the outdated cosmologies of most classical religions.

In conclusion I would say that the ideal would be this balance of which Jesus is the paragon, but that outside of the systematic, therefore intellectual, study of the book we should not really speak of a “study group”. We could, why not, speak of a “community”, “fraternity group”, “communion group”, “sharing group” or even for some an “action group”. Everyone must be able to feel free to adhere to the form that suits them best, but taking great care not to drag along against their will those who have made a different choice.
