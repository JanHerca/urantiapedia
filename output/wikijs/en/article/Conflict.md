"All conflict is evil." (<a id="a36_25"></a>[UB 111:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p4_11)) So announces the Fifth Epochal Revelation. Yet all around us, we observe _Urantia Book_ devotees in conflict.

"Well," we may say, "we do have to correct the misguided ones. And keep them in line when they disagree with us."

By what authority are such decisions made?

There is a little story in the book about the disciple John's reactions when he came across an unauthorized person teaching in the name of Jesus. John promptly "forbade this man to do such things." Only later did he report his action to Jesus.

The response of Jesus needs to be indelibly inscribed in the minds of all of us. He said:

"**This gospel shall presently be proclaimed in all the world. How can you expect that all who will believe this gospel shall be subject to your direction...in matters of this sort it would be better for you to reckon that he who is not against us is for us**."

Is it not amazing that we who know Jesus' word still manage to rationalize our actions--**and ignore him.**
