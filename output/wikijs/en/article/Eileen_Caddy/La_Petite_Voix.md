## Live happily

The more you receive, the more you have to give. Hold nothing back for yourself, but give, give, and keep giving, and in this way make room for more and more things to fill you.

Live in the Spirit, walk in the ways of the Spirit and become one with all life. I want only the best and the highest for you.

Never be afraid to rely on the best. Never feel that you are unworthy of having the best or that you don't deserve it.

This is your true inheritance, but you must claim it; you must accept it and rely on it. It is yours, it is My gift to you.

Do not let false humility prevent you from accepting what is rightfully yours; and do not just accept it, but exult with joy within, and give thanks forever.

Cherish it, and watch its wonder unfold in your life, knowing without a shadow of a doubt that all I have belongs to you.

I live as the joyful, tender, loving being that the Creator intended. God has granted me divine grace simply because I am a divine creation. So, I accept His goodness to me, and by living according to what I believe to be His Plan, I show my gratitude.

I live my life as the joyful, tender, and loving being God intended for my creation. Through grace, I expect unexpected blessings from God each day. My soul expresses itself with kindness, multiplying the love and joy that are mine.
