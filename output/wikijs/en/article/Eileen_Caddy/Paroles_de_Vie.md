Divine love is imperishable
and cannot be affected by conditions, situations,
or circumstances.
Love always remains the same.
Its action is exercised without fluctuating over time.
There is no point in talking about love.
It must be lived,
demonstrated,
expressed in life and in customs.
Love remains vain without actions.
Divine love knows no discrimination
no separation
but it includes everything
and wraps each one.
Divine love is agape.

When you can live constantly in love, appreciating all that each day brings, you will be able to understand the true meaning of life.
Because life is love. Love is life.
I am love and life,
all in one.

Love is unity and wholeness.
When you really love,
you are complete,
achieving oneness with all life.

My love for you lasts from eternity to eternity.
Move beyond self-criticism or self-condemnation
by raising you towards the certainty that you are made in My image and in My entire likeness.
Then contemplate this perfection which is the very essence of your being.

Just be what I am and live My life
knowing that I am in you.
Within My love you are safe.

My love flows through you like a vitalizing force.
It brings out the best in you.
It reveals all your gifts and all your talents.
My love makes your faith powerful, indestructible, and manifests your fullness.
When you are perfectly in tune with Me,
you experience the true meaning of the word freedom and your heart overflows with joy and gladness.

You can then see Me in each of your fellow men,
detecting this divine spark that exists in every being.
Look with eyes that truly see,
listen with ears that truly hear
and eternally thanks.
