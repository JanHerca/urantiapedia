“The former things have passed away,” and “all things have become new.” “While I was blind, now I see,” not “dimly as through a mirror,” but “face to face.” Yes, even in my flesh I have seen God. The hills have retreated and there is no horizon, but the light of heaven illuminates all things.

I have long sought you, O Jerusalem, but only now do my pilgrim feet touch the ground of heaven. There are no more uncultivated spaces. The fertile lands are before me, such as I have never dreamed of. Oh, truly “there shall be no night.” Her glory shines like the noonday sun, and there is no need of light, for God is her light.

I sit down to rest. In the shade of the trees I rest and find my peace in you. In your grace is peace, O Lord. In the world I was weary — in you I have found rest.

In the dense forest of words I was lost; the letter of truth contained fatigue and fear; but shade, water and rest are found only in your Spirit.

How far I have wandered from your Spirit, O Tender One and True, so far, so far! I was so deeply lost in the maze of words, words, words! But here I am returned, and in your Spirit I will always find my life, my peace, my strength. Your Spirit is the bread of life; in finding it, I will never be hungry again. Your Spirit is a spring; in drinking its water I will never be thirsty.

Like a weary traveler, I sought you, and lo, my weariness is gone. Your Spirit has pitched a tent for me; in its cool shade I stroll, and peace fills my Soul. Your presence has filled me with peace. Your love has placed before me a feast of Spirit. Yes, Your Spirit is my resting place, an oasis in the desert of the letter of truth.

In You I will hide myself from the noisy world of discussions; in Your conscience I will find respite from the malignity of men's tongues. They tear apart Your garment, O Lord of Peace, and quarrel over Your word, until it becomes words and no longer the Word.

Like a beggar I sought the new heaven and the new earth, and you made me the heir of all these.

How shall I stand before thee, except in silence? How shall I honor thee, except in the meditation of my heart?

You seek neither praise nor thanksgiving, but You welcome the heart that understands. I will keep silence before you. My Soul, my Spirit and my silence will be your dwelling place. Your Spirit will fill my meditation; it will make me, and keep me complete. O you, Tender Unique and True: I am back in you.
