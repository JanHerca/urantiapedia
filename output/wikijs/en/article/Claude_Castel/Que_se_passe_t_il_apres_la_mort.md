**Information taken from The Urantia Book**

_This text is composed in a way that is easily understandable for anyone who asks this question, even if they do not know The Urantia Book (and especially if they do not know it!) It is intended to calm fears about this uncertain future that is beyond death, and to make the Book known simultaneously._

After death, the material body returns to the elemental world from which it came but two immaterial factors of the surviving personality persist:

1. The divine Spirit (the Thought Adjuster) which indwells the human mind and remains therein until the measurable brain energies cease their rhythmic vital pulsations.
2. The Soul of the deceased, which is preserved by the guardian angel of the deceased person.

These two factors remain but separate, thus making the human person totally unconscious, therefore incapable of engaging in communications with anyone (<a id="a47_152"></a>[UB 112:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p3_7))

The soul is preserved by the guardian angel until the time of a new reunion with the Thought Adjuster. This operation reconstitutes the surviving personality and makes it conscious again at the time of awakening, that is to say on the day of repersonalization. Whether 5 days or 5000 years pass between death and resurrection, the passage of time has no importance because the sleeping survivors are totally unconscious and forgetful of their rest. (<a id="a49_450"></a>[UB 30:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/30#p4_6))

This resurrection takes place on one of the seven planets of progressive evolution called mansion worlds (Jesus of Nazareth spoke of the “many houses in the universe of the Father”) (John XIV-2) of our local astronomical System, in the colossal temple where personalities are reconstituted. This gigantic construction is the central meeting place of the guardian angels, the Thought Adjusters and the archangels of the resurrection. Each of the seven wings of this building contains one hundred thousand personal resurrection chambers and ends with circular rooms serving as revival chambers for a number of individuals going up to a million. (<a id="a51_644"></a>[UB 47:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p3_5))

On this new world, the resurrected human survivors resume their lives exactly where they left off when they were surprised by death on Earth. Equipped with a new body (like that of Jesus after his resurrection), they are first assigned a permanent residence. Then follows a ten-day period of personal freedom to explore the immediate vicinity of this new home, to consult the register of registrations, and to call upon loved ones and other earthlings who have previously arrived, including children. There are beautiful beings of varied talents, sociable companions, and charming guides. Intellectual training and spiritual development are resumed at the exact level where they were interrupted, for, since the defects of character are so numerous and varied, this new world devotes its major activities to correcting and healing the manifold legacies of earth life (<a id="a53_868"></a>[UB 3:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p2_5)). Eating, drinking, and resting continue, but the food produces no residual waste because this new body fully utilizes it. (<a id="a53_1032"></a>[UB 3:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p2_6))

Later, once they reach the capital of the Astronomical System, they will discover landscapes very different from those they have known on Earth. They will miss the assembly lines, but there are magnificent highlands and other extraordinary variations in topography and landscape. The highest peak is about 5,000 meters above sea level, but there are no earthquakes or rainfall. There are thousands and thousands of small lakes, but no torrential rivers or oceans or hurricanes. Condensation of moisture gives rise to a daily precipitation at the time of the minimum temperature that accompanies the decrease in light to its minimum point where the brightness is about that of our full moon on a clear night. The moisture needed by plants and other living creatures is also largely provided by the underground system of water circulation that unites the sparkling lakes. As there is no organic evolution on this world, there are no antagonistic forms of life, no struggle for existence, no survival of the fittest. Rather, there is creative adaptation that foreshadows the beauty, harmony, and perfection of the eternal worlds of the central universe and paradise (<a id="a55_1164"></a>[UB 3:1.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p1_10)). Human intolerance has completely disappeared. This is truly the heaven imagined by the majority of religious believers of the 20th century.

So it’s not yet Paradise, but it’s already infinitely better than on Earth!
