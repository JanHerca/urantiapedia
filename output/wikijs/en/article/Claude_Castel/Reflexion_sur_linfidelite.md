We are at a serious turning point in post-Christian Western history: the couple and the family are losing more and more credit and it is cohabitation and cohabitation without lasting ties that are taking over. The consequences of this sexual revolution, which affects married people, adolescents and children, are catastrophic. The family is increasingly flouted. Does man therefore violate certain laws that the Creator would have established, and which would be written in the Old Testament? No. Knowing today that humanity is an evolution of the animal world, we can ask ourselves the following question: did infidelity exist among primitive men whose major concern was fertility? Mating is universally natural but fidelity is a product of the evolution of morals that created marriage (<a id="a37_790"></a>[UB 82:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/82#p3_1)). The notion of infidelity only appeared with time, because among primitive races, relations between the sexes were not regulated, or very little, and license was practically total (<a id="a37_1014"></a>[UB 82:2.2-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/82#p2_2)). Physical attraction alone counted until the appearance of social groups and matrimonial codes which imposed fidelity in marriage.

But “when modern couples marry with the idea of conveniently divorcing in the background of their thoughts if their married life does not entirely please them, they are in reality entering into a trial marriage in a form far inferior to the honest adventures of their less civilized ancestors” (<a id="a43_295"></a>[UB 82:3.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/82#p3_15)). Because “it is the family that plays the major civilizing role” (<a id="a43_406"></a>[UB 82:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/82#p0_2)). The current period, in the West, therefore rather resembles a decadence producing only bitter fruits...

If mating is essential to the perpetuation of species, the notion of infidelity is not “natural”, because it depends on morals and not on laws established by our Creator.
