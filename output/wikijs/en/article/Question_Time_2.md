Ask yourself this question, reflecting carefully before responding:

First, **assume** that you have absorbed Urantia Book teachings and accepted the call to attempt to live your life as Jesus lived his.

However, after you made that decision, top scientists came up with completely convincing evidence that the universe and life are random accidents that simply had to occur—and the hypothesis that God created them is invalid.

**Would you still choose to go on living your life as if in service to God and your fellows?**

The interesting thing about this hypothetical situation is that all pressure attributable to the hope of reward or fear of punishment is now removed from your decision making.

The answer given also has interesting consequences. If your answer is yes, it follows that your decision to live as Jesus lived was your true preference—and a truly free will decision.

But if your answer is no (because there would be no point), then there must be another mode of living that is your true preference—one that you gave up in the hope of gaining reward or avoiding a threatened punishment.

Whatever your answer, never forget that you really are indwelt by your God-spirit who is always ready to help you to sort yourself out.

> Do not forget that you are commissioned to go forth reaching only the good news. You are not to attack the old ways; you are skillfully to put the leaven of new truth in the midst of the old beliefs. Let the Spirit of Truth do his own work.
