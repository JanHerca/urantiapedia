While serving a mission in Argentina for the Mormon Church, I had a dream. At the time I was working in a district of Buenos Aires called Mataderos. This is the district containing the slaughter houses. The discarded animal remains were burned, leaving a dark smoke over the neighborhood. The sewage system was poor and often overflowed allowing the gutters of the cobblestone streets to fill with blood. The scent of death was everywhere. I thought ofAuchwitz, as I dodged cars on my rusty bike.

One night after a late discussion with a prospective member family, I arrived at our apartment exhausted, and collapsed in bed. I began to dream. This was no ordinary dream. It was too vivid, and it refused to fade from memory like most dreams do. I remember that I was in a Mormon Temple. They have a special room known as the Celestial Room, an earthly representation of what heaven is like. Its clean with white walls, gold mirrors, curtains, and plush carpet. As I entered this room I saw in the distance an image of Jesus. I approached him cautiously, wondering if there was some mistake in allowing me this apparition. As I drew nearer it became clear that this was Jesus, and it was no mistake. Humbled, fearful, yet joyful and excited, I rushed toward him. In a spontaneous gesture of overwhelming love, I threw my arms around him. I relished this moment, thinking that my diligence in the face of such adversity had made we worthy of such an experience. As I wept, I noticed that His posture had not changed. He was rigid. I stepped back hesitatingly and inspected him. His expression had not changed. Puzzled, I reached up and cautiously touched his face. I gazed at my fingers in amazement — wax. Green and yellow under my finger nails. To my abhorrence, He was a statue — made of wax. I woke up, my bed was drenched in sweat. In the coming years, this dream often returned to haunt me.

About twelve years later, I had become dissatisfied with my church. It seemed so superficial, so caught up with appearances. I thought of how they wax apples in the supermarket to make them shiny and more appealing to the consumer. I was a waxed and shiny apple, but was I sweet or sower on the inside, I wondered? At this time, I had, perhaps by accident, discovered _The Urantia Book_. After reaching the last part dealing with the life of Jesus, I had a religious experience. No visions, no voices, no apparitions, or anything like that. In fact, I can't describe what I experienced. It was an out-pouring of love, a feeling of connectedness to God and all mankind. Yet, it was more, and I knew it was real. And afterwards, I knew that God was real, and good-infinitely good. My life had been changed, transformed. The shiny waxy outside was OK, I conjectured, but the flavor of the real thing was so much better.

At this juncture of my life, everything was new and alive. I saw God in everything and everyone. I began to search for references of my new God in Scriptures, books, poems, philosophy, Eastern and Western religions. He was everywhere, but you had to look. References that made Him out to be silly, manlike, jealous, pugnacious, and the like, were no longer tenable. This could not be the God that I knew. The Scripture passages that previously seemed fearful and forboding, now seemed quaint and foolish. My God is too good to be involved in homicide, mountain pushing, and war mongering. My God is a sweet and juicy apple, without the waxy cover.
