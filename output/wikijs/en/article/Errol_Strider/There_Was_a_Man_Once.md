There was a man once, truly that 
Who is known for the cross that he bore 
But who laughed in the market 
And slept on the floor 
Who designed riverboats in Capernaum 
Studied the ways of all men 
In order to rule in perfection 
With its trials, upsets, and demands 
A universe of 10 million planets 
Which the man, who upholds it 
Designed, fashioned and planned. 

There was a man once, truly that. 
Who embraced the mortal dilemma 
With a boundless trust 
And abiding faith. 
Who was immersed in a River Jordan 
Allowing himself to give in 
To life as we know it in fullness 
With its sores, its aches and injustice 
But which serves a great hidden purpose 
Which the man, who entered its bowels 
Could foresee what to us is so dim. 

There was a man once, truly that 
Who transcended all tradition and dogma 
Who forgave the sin 
And loved the sinner 
Who feared not one who attacked him 
But attempted to show them the truth. 
By example, he sat in their presence, 
With his words, his acts, and entreaties 
He sought to convince those around him 
That all men could live as he 
Secure, abandoned and free. 

There was a man once, truly that 
A man who broke from his elders 
Made friends with the poor 
Played with the kids 
Made choices like all other men 
To use power for good or for evil 
To be simple or prideful and vain 
Grappled with grief, failure, betrayal, 
But still to remain steadfast to the 
God, Who this man knew always as Father and friend. 
There was a man once, truly that. 

Who did not what others expected 
Disappointing his pupils 
Estranging his mother 
Rejecting requests of the masses 
When they wanted to make him king 
Yet allowed them to place down the palms 
As he rode on an ass to the city 
Where they rejected once and for all 
This true man, who understood them 
And forgave their blindness and gall. 

There was a man once, truly that. 
A man whom we all misinterpret 
Who knows all as his brother 
To the exclusion of none 
Who did not really die on the cross 
To wash away our sins 
But to reveal a God of mercy 
Who forgives, only loves, has compassion 
On his ignorant children who err 
So this man died only to show them 
How far love would go for them. 

There was a man once, truly that. 
Whose life on this beleaguered planet 
Was a model for all to behold. 
Who revealed our humanity to us 
What each person can actually become 
When we join with this man in knowing 
The Spirit that indwells our hearts. 
And as he rose from the darkness of death 
And appeared to those who knew him 
He showed us the path to aliveness... 
The deep forever mystery 
Of the timeless journey of love.
