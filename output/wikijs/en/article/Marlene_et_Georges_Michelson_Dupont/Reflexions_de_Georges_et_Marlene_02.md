Before being able to answer the question posed as the theme of the Light meeting in May 2007, namely whether the SELF or the Ego could be a hindrance to our spiritual progression, it was necessary as a preamble to clarify the meaning of certain words used in the Urantia Book such as Personality, Identity, mind, Ego, soul, and secondly to make an inventory of man's endowments by explaining how they work in order to know him better.

This clearing work having been done, let us dwell a little on the term “spiritual progression”.

This is what The Urantia Book calls “Supremacy”: the experience of mastery of matter by the mind under the guidance of the inner Spirit. Supremacy encompasses two experiences of a different nature but whose objective is the same: becoming perfect through evolution. Thus, for the Supreme Creators it is a question of leading the universes in their charge towards the status of “light and life”. They do this both out of love and the well-being of their creatures but also to accomplish the will of God the Father in time and space. This is the present task of Michael and his companion the Divine Minister and their contribution to the emergence of the Almighty Supreme.

For us mortal creatures, it is a question of becoming spiritual and immortal from a purely material and mortal status. The task would be impossible without the spiritual endowments we have inherited: the personality with its free will and the Thought Adjuster, that divine fragment of pure spirit which represents our safe conduit to eternity.

Every human life, from its conception until it has become perfect, writes a page in the history of supremacy and participates in the emergence of the God of time and space: the Supreme. Every creature endowed with free will is free to participate in the adventure to the extent that he achieves this mastery, to “do the will of the Father who is in heaven.”

The cycle is preordained. Supremacy is a universal experiential movement which plunges the entire master universe into a dynamic of irresistible progression born from the existential tension between the Potentials and the Actuals.

But the creatures that live there have the power to choose whether they want to participate or not. God has given us free will, he does not coerce or threaten us. He is a God of love and he desires man to become his partner in this adventure of time and space. “Be perfect as I am perfect.”

This is why he has provided his creatures with everything necessary to be able to fulfill their destiny:
- a universal framework for adventure: it is the universe, from our planet to Paradise.
- a vehicle to move around: it is the material body, then morontial, then spiritual, a consciousness sensitive to the Cosmic Mind to understand, act and react intelligently and a personality endowed with free will to be able to choose. He has also provided many aids on the path of our progression such as the Thought Adjuster, our true pilot, the Spirit of Truth of our creator Son, the Holy Spirit of the Mother Spirit as well as all the personnel of the Infinite Spirit, the tutelary personalities of the universes.

The very notion of progress implies the idea of time and space. This is why, for us creatures, we need a beginning in time, a birth in a place in space. This is the beginning of our life.

The Urantia Book defines life as follows: “Life is in reality a process which takes place between the organism (individuality) and its environment. Personality communicates values of identity and meanings of continuity to this association of an organism and an environment.” (<a id="a56_276"></a>[UB 112:1.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p1_13))

Since conception, and throughout human life, man constructs, in his mind and by a conscious and unconscious process of association of ideas, a set of reactions (one could speak of conditioning) to the environment to form what is commonly called character. For example, if we accustom a child from a very young age to sharing with his brother, this association of ideas will serve as a preferred response to the environment in similar situations. Thus the free will with which our personality is endowed will tend to respond in a recurring manner to similar situations.

To the extent that identity is “what we are”, the personality effectively communicates values “of what we are” to the environment. Fortunately this reaction is not fixed, otherwise all progress and growth would become impossible. Observation shows that the most important and decisive period in the construction of character is early childhood. This construction is greatly influenced by 3 factors: heredity, the family unit and the society in which the child lives. At least this is what child psychology teaches us.

If we cannot modify our heredity, on the other hand a loving, wise, intelligent and respectful family education should be able to prepare children for an adult life balanced between the material and legitimate needs of the Ego and life in society. The ideas and ideals instilled during this period are essential.

We saw in the first part of this presentation (see Link No. 40) that there exists in the mind, from the age of about 5 years, a fourth actor, the Thought Adjuster. It becomes decisive to the extent that it creates in us the embryonic human soul that survives. The presence in man of this Fragment, of this pure Spirit is the source of divine love. It installs, in the human mind, a tension, a need, of a spiritual nature which comes to superimpose itself on the selfish desires of the animal nature. We called it “the Supremacy” but we can also call it the desire to “do the will of the Father who is in heaven”. This is why we say of man that he is of a dual nature: his heredity is of animal origin but he receives God as an inheritance.

Thus the education of the Ego plays a primordial role in the construction of the being, for its later adult life and its potential spiritual career. The material, demanding and animal-based Ego is essential for the construction of the personality but it must be mastered in such a way as to respond more and more to the spiritual government. This is partly the role of education. Indeed, in early childhood, from zero to 12 months, physical and intellectual needs are primordial for the construction of the being. Eating, sleeping, growing, beginning to learn to walk and speak requires a mysterious construction energy turned exclusively inward and the satisfaction of the needs of the growing Ego. Parents have difficulty measuring how crucial this period is for the quality of the “mental framework” under construction? Yet it is thanks to the latter that their child will become conscious, understand, decide and choose. The child does not yet say “I” and self-consciousness has not yet appeared. Life, at this age, is entirely of an animal nature.

Then comes the transition period when instinctive consciousness becomes reflective. The bestowal by God the Father of personality and free will upon this being separates it forever from the animal kingdom from which it originated.

Finally we see that the Ego is a necessary scaffolding at the beginning of life but it is not destined to remain in place forever. It must make way for the morontia reality that is the soul and fade away from the personality but it must be mastered in such a way as to respond more and more to spiritual guidance.

This is partly the role of education. Indeed, in early childhood, from zero to 12 months, physical and intellectual needs are essential for the construction of the being. Eating, sleeping, growing, beginning to learn to walk and talk requires a mysterious construction energy turned exclusively inward and the satisfaction of the needs of the growing Ego. Parents increasingly measure the altruistic choices of the evolving Ego.

For the present age, the purpose of this whole human adventure is to “become perfect as God is perfect” by following the directions of His fragment in us. Doing “the will of the Father” is the way.

We will see you in the next “Link” to discuss this fascinating subject.
