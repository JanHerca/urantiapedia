<p style="text-align:center;">
When I can say, I want,<br>
Without my hands reaching out greedily<br>
Not to take but to offer<br>
And to serve with humility.<br>
<br>
When I can say, I love,<br>
Without my heart trembling with the desire to be loved.<br>
But would leave it, if quiet,<br>
Flow love, without ever closing.<br>
<br>
When I can say, I know,<br>
Without letting my mind touch appearances,<br>
But join my soul<br>
And hear his song, in the silence.<br>
<br>
When I can say, I'm leaving,<br>
Without my tears hiding the horizon from my eyes,<br>
Cloud my heart with regrets<br>
And fear, at the time of farewells.<br>
<br>
Then you can open your door wide to me,<br>
O Liberty.<br>
</p>
