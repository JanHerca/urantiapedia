It was as head of the Urantia office in Paris (Urantia France SA) that I had the chance, at the end of January, to spend a week at the Foundation's headquarters in Chicago. I then had the joy of meeting personally - finally each of the members of the team, in a human and professional rapprochement that breathed new life into our collaboration. Richard and Colette, from the Quebec office, who had come at the same time to take advantage of the opportunity, added their energy and good humor to the ambient emulation.

The Foundation still lives in the place of its birth: the venerable building at 533 Diversey Parkway, which saw the meetings of the Forum and the beginnings of the 5th Revelation, has changed little since 1905 — an absolute rarity in the United States, an architect's or decorator's dream, but a real headache for an office designer! The installation also smacks of improvisation and make-do; clearly the exponential growth of the activity puts the place and the people under severe pressure — but everything works! Nothing is lost and everything is on time. I was still able to enjoy the great comfort of being housed on site, since the second floor, the former apartment of the Sadler family, is entirely devoted to passing guests; ten people fit comfortably there! It is on this floor that is the large room where the Forum met, with the fireplace where the manuscripts are said to have been burned. A minute of silence... One flight of stairs lower are the offices proper, and on the third floor live Tonia and Steve, who therefore enjoy the immense advantage/disadvantage of always being on the job.

So who is this Foundation? At the helm is **Tonia** (Baney), precisely. As head of the executive, Tonia is the operational link between the trustees and the Foundation. Always on the front line, she is the one who puts in place the concrete means of implementing the policy decided by the trustees. Official representative, business leader, first person in charge, she has a lot on her shoulders...

Tonia is helped by **Sheila** (Schneider), a secretary-assistant with countless skills; a solid work ethic, a never-failing good will, without forgetting a contagious humor: Sheila is without a doubt the right-hand woman that more than one boss must dream of.

The fundamental task of the Foundation is to ensure the protection of the inviolate text of the Revelation. To this end, it owns the copyrights and logos, and **Mindy** (Williams) is responsible for the legal aspect that this intellectual property implies. Mindy also supervises and coordinates the activity of the seven official offices, based on their activity reports.

**Marcia** (Lansu), she ensures that the accounts are kept in good order. It is thanks to her that the Foundation knows exactly how many books are sold, in stock or in print, how many dollars are available... and how many would be welcome!

A sensitive point on which **Jay** (Peregrine) also intervenes, responsible with Tonia for fundraising. Jay is a professional IT specialist and devotes the second part of his time to the office's computer network and the website.

Supervised by **James** (Woodward) in collaboration with **Bob** (Solone) for the Hispanic readership, the Readers' Service is not the least busy: keeping the international database up to date, responding to the many letters and telephone calls, putting readers in touch who want it... the Readers' Service is the window on the world of the Foundation's office.

**Linda** (Jensen) “only” handles invoicing, an area that actually requires a full-time position, and **Matthieu** (Viglione), a graduate in French literature (Matthieu has grandparents from Toulouse!) and an impressive polyglot, takes care of all the necessary translations. Each of them is versatile and can intervene in all emergencies.

In the basement reigns **Steve** (Baney), the great leader of expeditions. In an anorak or T-shirt depending on the season, it is he who stacks, packs, unpacks, loads, unloads, the items intended for offices, fairs and other congresses around the world.

The little free electron **Cathy** (Jones) navigates several times a day between 533 and her office at the IUA, just a few steps away — when she is not inaugurating a new association on the other side of the world.

I was very touched to see to what extent everyone can be involved, committed, concerned by the Urantian cause. We don't count our hours at 533! Be sure that the smallest news from the smallest corner of the vast world is listed with interest and duly recorded to SERVE — the big word at the Foundation, absolutely.

During this week I had the great pleasure of being able to work with each one in particular, which gave a new impetus to my work, and to my relationship with the Urantian movement an additional touch of human warmth. The needs of each one in terms of collaboration and mutual help were able to be clearly defined, brilliant ideas emerged, and there is no doubt that the concrete results of this meeting will soon be felt in the results of the French office - I will in any case devote myself to it completely.
