There were many of us, this Wednesday, August 2, 2000, joining the WAGNER college in Staten Island, one of the five districts of New York City. That evening, after having resolved the material problems, inevitable in this world, I went to bed, tired from the physical transportation essential to participate body and soul in this new international conference of the IUA.

The next morning, we had to do some violence to overcome the jet lag; but this moment was quickly forgotten because pleasant discussions began at breakfast. It was, throughout the conference, American style: omelettes, sausages, potatoes, ice cream, fruit juice, ... and coffee, that is to say particularly copious. Honoring such a meal easily took us 45 minutes. However, one should never abuse good things, and from 10:00 a.m. we were invited to the CNP meeting which brings together all the presidents of the different IUA associations. All the nations were represented by around twenty meetings chaired by Seppo Kanerva, assisted by the CNP secretary Katlyn Salding.

As a preamble, Moussa N'Diaye, founder of the Senegalese movement, explained to us the difficulties he and his compatriots encountered in obtaining an entry visa to the USA. He was also the only representative of the group to obtain this visa. Upon his return, he plans to take protest action against his government. Seppo informed us that unfortunately other countries, such as those in the Eastern bloc (Russia and Bulgaria), also had these problems. In fact, the USA is slowing down immigration and each candidate from these countries must prove that their trip is not for the purpose of looking for work. I was particularly moved by the story of these Russians who, after having traveled hundreds of kilometers several times to attend the necessary appointments for the procedures, were refused by the Moscow consulate the right to enter the USA and therefore to participate in the conference. What will happen in France in 2002? Seppo asks us to check if similar problems are to be feared and for which countries.

We then proceeded to the election of the President and Secretary of the CNP. Seppo Kanerva and Katlyn Salding were unanimously re-elected as President and Secretary respectively.

As the new president, Seppo gave us an overview of the associations in place and the many to come. Here is a list:

| Senegal | 1 person |
| Mexico | 1 person |

| Chile | 2 people |

The associations cited are movements having official identification in the country of operation, operational autonomy and accepting the IUA regulations.

Then we began a discussion on possible improvements to the operation of the CNP: internal regulations, changes to structures, development of the website, access to the activities of each region.

First of all, the president recalled that the IUA is a worldwide federation of associations that study and transmit the teachings of the UB. Such action requires overall cohesion; thus everyone must respect the federation's regulations. For example, it would be inappropriate to mix the teachings of the book with other teachings, or even dubious practices such as channeling sessions. If an association persisted in these practices, it would isolate itself from the IUA. Furthermore, Cathy Jones (Administrator of the IUA) specified the importance of coherence between the teaching and our life - our actions in the movement and outside of it.

Then Seppo told us that the movement was taking off. The table above shows this - around ten nations should soon join the CNP. These presidents will represent several hundred members that the IUA will have to take into account, for example, for the distribution of its journal. Faced with this situation, the leaders of the IUA consider that the current structures are no longer suitable and they wish to modernize their operation, such as the supervision of the _trustees_. Indeed, the leaders of the IUA are currently under the supervision of the trustees. Ideas are circulating to replace them with a new management committee composed of seven wise men, each representing a part of the world. They would initially be chosen by the trustees for their skills and loyalty. This change would ultimately cut the umbilical cord with the Foundation. Seppo awaits your suggestions to prepare the new structure of the IUA that he will submit to the trustees.

In addition, the association will be increasingly called upon to manage the website, particularly with regard to improvements to be made in general, modules specific to each country and specific modules to be developed. From now on, the CNP needs your comments and your skills in this area. It calls on the presidents to think about solutions to be implemented in the near future.

Finally, we addressed the problem of information between nations. We travel more and more; however, too often, UB readers travel without knowing either the structures or the activities in place in the regions they visit. However, what riches these opportunities for such warm encounters represent! The CNP plans to create on its website a page summarizing all the organizations and activities present and to come in each nation (study groups, meetings, etc.). Consequently, each president will ensure that ad hoc information is transmitted to the CNP, and that it is kept up to date.

The CNP president and the representatives of the other nations had many other ideas to exchange but, being in the universes of time, Seppo had to stop the meeting for a group photo before inviting us to join the other participants for lunch.

The afternoon was devoted to various activities: the local organization welcomed the new arrivals, prepared the various meeting rooms and rehearsed the shows. At the same time, the trustees and some representatives of the IUA held their meeting. For me, the afternoon of this Thursday was free; I took the opportunity to go and explore one of the neighborhoods of Staten Island.

In the evening, after dinner, we were invited to a discussion with the trustees. They reminded us of the translations for sale, those to come, confirmed the progress of the revelation and specified the exceptional work in Senegal and Russia. Then, the free exchanges continued, often very late, as the participants were so eager to know each other and share their experiences. For my part, around $22 h 00$ I returned to my room, like many others, for a great restorative sleep.
