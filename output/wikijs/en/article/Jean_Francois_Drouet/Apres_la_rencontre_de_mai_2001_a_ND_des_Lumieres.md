For those who were unable to participate and expressed regret, for those who did not intend to, so that they regret it, and for the participants so that they remember the moments they loved.

Our meeting on Saturday morning began with fervent prayer for two seriously ill people.

During the months preceding the meeting, I had prepared a text that I then read, in order to nourish and broaden our reflection. It will be found below, with a final completed part, including a contribution to the symbolism that we are recommended, in 966, to research.

Because of the density of the text and the importance of the references to The Urantia Book, it is desirable to meditate on it with a broader reading of the book than just the quotes.

It would be futile to want to report on the discussion forums, and even more so the exchanges during meals, free time, during walks or evenings, where everyone discovers and welcomes the other, their life, their journey of evolution-revelation, their experiences. It is these exchanges which, more than anything, make such meetings rich.

This is what was unanimously expressed during the last assembly, where everyone was invited to communicate what, for them, had marked these days. All expressed their gratitude for this fraternal welcome, and in return, expressed their own love for all the participants. Which made us say in summary, how exceptional was in an assembly, this expression of fraternal love.

Our assembly ended, on this practically anniversary Sunday, with the reading of extracts from the story of Pentecost: 2058:1, (<a id="a47_127"></a>[UB 194:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_11)) and (<a id="a47_179"></a>[UB 194:3.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_20)) which introduced the final, silent and intense adoration.

It is true that we were, if not conscious, at least certain, of divine presences, that of our Adjusters, that of the spirits of the Son and the Holy Ghost, as well as of our seraphic guardians and certainly of other invisible friends.

## Communication

As a preamble, I offer you a parable which can give us food for thought: that of the head of a local resistance network, in France, during the war.

This manager had received very precise instructions from his superiors who organized the networks and coordinated them. He was also well aware that being established locally and in occupied territory, he could not have the same overall view as his superiors.

They had strongly recommended that he not take any initiative or take any action without referring to them. They had to judge the opportunities and say when the time had come to act, but always in accordance with the general action plan. They had cited the example of a premature initiative which had resulted in arrests and reprisals for the population.

Consequently, they had insisted on the importance of reliable communication despite the difficulties linked to the situation. All transmission channels had to be used and a perfect knowledge of the means of decryption was necessary, as well as the confrontation of the different information to establish their authenticity.

Finally, they agreed on the priorities: establish the network, train its members, and as they did not have sufficient military strength compared to that of the enemy, prioritize psychological actions.

You have been able to understand that this parable transposes quite well the situation which is in fact ours. We are in an occupied territory or more exactly, preoccupied by power and money, where the search for maximum profit and the primacy of materialism reign. We do not have to fight with the same weapons and we know the broad outlines of the action plan, thanks to The Urantia Book.

We are not isolated and left to our own devices: the supervisors, although they are in another territory, are revealed to us, as well as the coordinating and liaison agents who are the angels and the mediums.

In our previous meetings and at the international conference in New York, the emphasis has been on our first supervisor: our Adjuster. But we should not forget the two other components of spiritual governance which are inseparable. _All spirit influences function as a single unit, in human experiential evolution as a ministry of the Supreme_ <a id="a67_344"></a>[[UB 34:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_1) and <a id="a67_391"></a>[UB 101:2.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p2_12)]

The first, chronologically, is that of the Creative Spirit, at the origin of the universe by universal attraction, then responsible for the development of life by attractions of all kinds. As soon as the mind appears, the endowment of the adjutants by our Mother Spirit _conditions the course of evolution_ [401.5], with intuition first. For the human person, the spirit of wisdom, the highest of the adjutants, is _the secret of the impulse_ to undertake the spiritual ascending process <a id="a69_488"></a>[[UB 36:5.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5_12)]. From this moment, _the ministry of the Holy Spirit becomes more and more effective_ <a id="a69_619"></a>[[UB 34:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p5_5)]. _The Infinite Spirit and its co-ordinate Spirits lower themselves, ..., until they appear as angels to stand by your side and guide you through the humble paths of earthly existence_ <a id="a69_847"></a>[[UB 8:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/8#p4_5)]. Thus _the Infinite Spirit actually succeeds as a person in approaching very closely every being of the spheres of animal origin_ <a id="a69_1019"></a>[[UB 8:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/8#p4_6)].

As to the third influence, one would have to bring out a few hundred quotations from _The Urantia Book_. _This new teacher is the Spirit of Truth who will live with each of you in your heart, and thus all the children of light will be one and drawn to one another_ [1949.1]. _The Spirit of Truth, ..., is the spiritual force which ever draws all truth seekers to Him who personifies truth in the local universe_ [377.6]. _At every crossroads of the struggle for progress, the Spirit of Truth will ever speak and say to you, “This is the way”_ <a id="a71_543"></a>[[UB 34:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p7_8)]. _His spirit, shed abroad upon all flesh, is a mighty world influence which uplifts man and impels him to progress. The urge toward spiritual progress is the ***most powerful motive force*** in the world. Believers who learn the truth are the only progressive and dynamic souls on earth_<a id="a71_874"></a>[[UB 194:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_4)].

Certainly, we have a handicap: in our material territory, we are almost deaf to the language of the spiritual realm. How, under these conditions, can messages reach us? The Urantia Book teaches us that we benefit from liaison agents and interpreters. <a id="a73_251"></a>[UB 113:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p2_10) and following, it details the activity deployed by the seraphic guardians, in collaboration with the midway creatures and even the physical controllers. This is to say the possible range of their interventions. As an illustration, allow me a personal example, all the more telling because it is exceptional.

Not far from my home, there was a stop sign with no visibility on one side. One day, before it was redeveloped, I arrived at this stop sign and stopped. A quick glance, no one. But instead of leaving, I didn't move. The time to realize and be surprised, I understood the reason for my immobility,... seeing a car go by at high speed. Without this intervention, it is likely that I would not be here today!

The daily actions of our invisible friends are not often as spectacular, but if we are attentive and put them into an overall picture, we can detect them and recognize their importance for our evolution. Very often, these actions guide our paths and can avoid dead ends. This can be uncomfortable when the proposed orientation does not correspond to our own ideas of the moment. It is up to us to accept to let ourselves be guided by our friends who act from the _outside towards the inside_ and are also _manipulators and stimulators of the mind_.

This is how our history is traced and our experience is acquired, made possible by our faith. A faith which is strengthened by each experience. This is how our recognition is recorded, in the double sense of the term, the act of recognizing and thanksgiving, recognition of the guidance from which we benefit.

We must go further in our approach to agreement, our inner conviction and our ultimate desire to merge with spiritual guidance.

Like the resister who tries to tune his receiver as best he can to pick up low intensity messages, we must seek this resonance agreement which opens our life to the spiritual dimension.

Thus, little by little, our spiritual deafness will diminish to arrive at clear hearing. But there is a double condition: to be born of the spirit and to live of the spirit.

Responding positively to spiritual impulses causes us to be born of spirit.

Our intention _to espouse the divine directives_ contains in germ our development of spiritual personality <a id="a89_107"></a>[cf. [UB 34:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_4)]. Thus is expressed _THE SUPREMACY OF THE POTENTIAL OF INTENTION; the potential always has supremacy over the actual. In the evolving cosmos, the potential represents that which is to be, and that which is to be is the development of the intentional decisions of the Deity._ <a id="a89_429"></a>[[UB 102:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p5_1)].

Our intention then becomes **creative force** in response to the driving force of the spiritual impulse; a creative force capable of achieving the development of the newborn to the spiritual adult. Remember the pattern of creation and the reversal of perspective that results from it.

Recently I had two dreams (I use the word dream to distinguish common dreams without much meaning). In the first, I was playing pétanque; I had a wonderful partner, so good that to win, I only had to play one last easy shot.

In the second, I arrived in a city, in which I did not know the path I should take. I told myself that I should trust someone from the city, who could serve as my guide. I started to follow a car that was taking an underground passage and thus, I arrived in the city center, facing the ocean, not far from the place that I knew was my goal.

Do you not also have to trust our spiritual guidance? In <a id="a97_57"></a>[UB 34:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_9), we tell you: _There truly exists within you a conspiracy of spiritual forces, a confederation of divine powers, whose exclusive goal is to deliver you definitively from material slavery and material handicaps._

Remember: _the positive always has the advantage over the negative_ <a id="a99_68"></a>[[UB 102:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p6_7)].

Instead of trying to establish a list of material obstacles, which you will not be able to abolish by your own strength, don't you think it is better to listen to spiritual voices, to seek and follow the paths they suggest to you?

It’s not about everyone pretending to be Joan of Arc!

But, thus guided and born in spirit, we have to live in spirit, daily, with our loved ones, in our places of life, work and social relations, without forgetting study and religious relationship, constant and fervent.

In no case are these spiritual suggestions a substitute for our personal search which must be carried out to the end of our possibilities. It is this phase of evolution which allows us to open ourselves and welcome the phase of revelation with a view to _effectively acquiring a morontia personality_ [1111.2], and to becoming morontia temples ourselves <a id="a107_354"></a>[cf. [UB 34:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_7)].

The equation, which becomes adequacy, is as follows: evolution + revelation = co-birth and spiritual knowledge and consequently, awareness of a coincidence between our thought and a truth; more precisely, a resonance occurs which leads to awareness.

In medical imaging, we use MRI. In this case, we do an experience of **MRI** Mental Resonance Agreement which is an evolved form of intuition.

I spoke of a truth, not of the Truth. The first is a **personal** facet of the second that can be considered as a divine Infinity. The reception of this facet depends on the person through their own experience. _It reveals itself to you through your personal experience_ <a id="a113_271"></a>[[UB 176:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p3_7)]. This remark allows us to humbly put our approach into perspective, and should allow us to avoid the intransigent attitude of those who believe they hold the truth. It implies welcoming other approaches and a pedagogy that respects the paths of each person.

Our meetings and written or verbal communications are therefore privileged means of discovering new facets, to complete and enrich our own vision.

All this wealth received, how can we not seek to transmit it? Each according to his talents and his vocation [cf. parable 1916]. From receiver, we must become retransmitter and also catalyst. Just as in chemistry, where the presence of the catalyst, by indirect resonance effect, accelerates reactions, our presence, even discreet, must facilitate spiritual resonance between our loved ones and God.

But if we want to be spiritually effective, we must respect the two phases of our work, illustrated by the parable of the talents, with their double paradoxical aspect.

Firstly, it is from the material, that is to say our daily tasks, that the spiritual must be constructed, for each person, thanks to the cement of love.

But it is from a spiritual foundation that a new civilization can be built, collectively, including in its material aspects: _the only technique to accelerate the natural tendency of social evolution consists of exerting spiritual pressure from above_ <a id="a123_252"></a>[[UB 52:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p6_7)].

This double work can be called by the neologism: **creaction** and symbolized by two inverted triangles, in the shape of a star of David. But one condition is still necessary for these achievements.

When you have a large building to construct, it is obvious that if each participant does as they please, the project will take an abnormally long time, the construction will inevitably be poorly done and will not hold up. Everyone knows that complete coordination is essential between the architect, the site manager, the team leaders and all the workers.

Let us also remember the coordination of the resistance networks from the beginning.

What is already necessary at the material level is even more obligatory when all levels of reality are at stake: following the divine plan must be a categorical imperative for us.

In our symbol, the star of triangles is taken in the spiritual order represented by three circles of which the three centers, the three dual intersections and the triune intersection symbolize the divine septenary being actualized by the Supreme.

May we all be among those who accomplish this actualization!
