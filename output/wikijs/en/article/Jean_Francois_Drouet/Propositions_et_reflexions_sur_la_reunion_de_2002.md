Basically, it's very simple; we only have one obligation: to conform our entire will to that of God (<a id="a34_101"></a>[UB 111:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p5_2)), which is equivalent to following the divine plan (<a id="a34_197"></a>[UB 4:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p1_2)).

For this, three levels of knowledge are necessary, in order:

1. Know the divine law (<a id="a38_24"></a>[UB 111:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p6_6)), the cosmic law (<a id="a38_86"></a>[UB 12:6.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p6_12)).
2. Know the Divine plan as Michael wanted to apply it to our time
3. Recognize its application both in our own lives and in collective developments and share this knowledge.

Since the coming of Michael and the publication of The Urantia Book, the acquisition of this knowledge is no longer utopian. It is even this which is the essential objective of his plan and which must be the driving force of evolutions.

## 1) The creative Trinity

For any construction, it is necessary to know the rules for using the materials used. Morontia and spiritual constructions are no exception to this rule. This knowledge is all the more essential since the laws that govern these levels are less immediately understandable than those, more apparent, of our physical environment.

The task is difficult, but as the creator is unique and his law immutable (<a id="a48_75"></a>[UB 4:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p2_1)), we can hope to find the principles common to even multiple and differentiated achievements.

## 2) Michael's divine plan

Michael designed a “catch-up” plan for Urantia some 37,800 years ago and since its announcement (<a id="a52_97"></a>[UB 119:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p7_2)), our universe has been closely following its progress.

And certain unexpected and unprecedented events, such as the birth of secondary midwayers, are part of this plan (<a id="a54_114"></a>[UB 77:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p6_2)). We owe him the transmission of the _Urantia Book_ (<a id="a54_209"></a>[UB 77:8.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p8_8)). Among other things, because if we know one of the actions of a secondary midwayer, there is no doubt that the 1110 other midwayers have been and still are active.

To the extent that we wish to work for the Kingdom, our invisible associates can have an action comparable to a sort of GPS or GMS (Median and Seraphic Governor, in the form of discoveries (for example, that of the Urantia Book), events, meetings etc.... with a fortuitous appearance or even intuitions.

But this governance in no way affects our freedom. We remain drivers, free in our direction and our decisions. It is the same with the other GPS: the Spiritual paternal governance of our Thought Monitor.

Revelation and guidance allow us to become aware of the path to follow. More than an important step forward, this leads to a reversal and a broadening of perspective.

Primitive man tried to know and control his environment through magic (<a id="a62_71"></a>[UB 88:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/88#p4_3)). Modern man still proceeds by experience in an approach that he describes as scientific. Through analysis and Cartesian reasoning, he tries to find explanations for the phenomena he observes. But he still moves forward by trial and error.

On the other hand, if he reaches this awareness, he acquires a global vision, a cosmic consciousness. His path will then be in full light, which will allow him to progress much more quickly, with assurance and in peace.

This allows it to find its unity, with happy consequences on health (<a id="a66_69"></a>[UB 100:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p4_3)), on the quality of sleep, longevity (up to 500 years on evolved spheres! (<a id="a66_188"></a>[UB 49:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p4_6)). In this case, we can also think that the supply of violet plasma, even insufficient, can lead to benefiting from positive energy. Extreme examples could be explained in this way, such as those of Thérèse Neumannn, Marthe Robin or Jasmuheen (see her book: Vivre de Lumière in which she talks about 5000 similar cases).

Even though we have handicaps on Urantia, this should not be construed as limiting our evolutionary development or our individual spiritual progress (<a id="a68_150"></a>[UB 55:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p6_7)) and <a id="a68_197"></a>[UB 55:11.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p11_6)).

Conversely, not following the plan constitutes an evil which has the certain effect of delaying its individual and collective accomplishment (the example is that of Eve's fault (<a id="a70_178"></a>[UB 75:4.3-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p4_3) and <a id="a70_226"></a>[UB 148:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/148#p2_5)). And this evil, by the disjunction it causes, is fraught with consequences (cf. <a id="a70_351"></a>[UB 75:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p4_7) to <a id="a70_396"></a>[UB 75:8.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p8_2)). See also the parable of the mason and the great architect.

But if Michael conceived his plan precisely after Eve's fault, it is because it is intended to alleviate these harmful consequences. He must even go further, and if the universe attentively follows its unfolding, it is because it must serve as a model.

And we are co-responsible!

## 3) The human experience

Through our experience, we have a double recognition to accomplish: that of our evolution and our progress, but also that of the help which was given to us to allow this evolution. This last recognition allows us to avoid the pride of the self-made man.

Isn't this double recognition the essence of our human experience since it allows us to be comforted in the path we have to follow? It is essential for us, but also important for those with whom we have to share it.

We can have inner intuitions, but the non-spiritual part of our being demands to be comforted externally, since for us as for St. Thomas, the most convincing proof is physical. Experience can bring it to us, but let us not be mistaken; faith must precede. It is a necessity for there to be spiritual construction.

An obstacle can arise in the face of these recognitions and these steps of faith: intellectual reasoning. It is not simple, since, in our materialistic world, the single thought wants everything that is not physical to be classified as irrational and everything that is not explained to be cataloged as supernatural.

Fortunately, the reversal and broadening of perspective allows, by viewing all levels, to reconcile spiritual, morontial and material. Not only does it abolish the obstacle that primary reasoning seemed to oppose, but at the same time, it allows an educational approach.

Global evolutionary reasoning is more easily accepted than a revelation that is difficult to believe at first glance. It can constitute a first step towards a progressive revelation.
