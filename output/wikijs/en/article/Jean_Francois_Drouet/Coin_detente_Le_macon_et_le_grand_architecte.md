In a Chinese province there lived a mason.

He had worked for several contractors and had given them complete satisfaction.

One day, he met a young woman who worked with the greatest architect in the region. They liked each other, loved each other and got married.

A few months later, a happy event occurred and this gave the mason the idea of building his own house, instead of continuing to rent.

He spoke about it to his wife who was delighted with the project and suggested that he call on her boss. He himself knew him by reputation and his wife confirmed that he was a great master in Feng Shui for the choice of land, the location and orientation of the house, the layout of the environment and the interior arrangements.

But he knew that he would have to wait a long time, first for him to be available for each of the choice stages.

— Listen, he said to his wife, up until now I have worked for others, it is time for me to work for myself. I have nevertheless acquired good experience and I am quite capable of managing on my own. I have already spotted a plot of land which is right next to the complex that your architect is developing.
They took the car to go see the owner of the land. He was angry because he felt his wife's reluctance and on the way out, he hit the terminal and scratched the car. Then on the way, they took the wrong path.
“You see, you're getting angry, that's all. First of all, I have my ideas about my house and there's no reason for your great architect to impose his on me.”
— You are unfair, because if my architect, as you say, respects the great laws of nature, he also takes into account the aspirations of each person.

Finally, they arrived at the owner's house and, after discussion, concluded the purchase. Very quickly, after having surveyed the land, he began the plans and by evening he had practically finished.

The next morning he woke up with a severe headache.

— I don’t know if it’s what we ate last night, but I have such a headache!
— That surprises me, I ate like you and I have nothing.

—Or else I am under a harmful influence. I will go see our doctor.

The latter, after taking his pulse, then carefully examining and questioning him, said to him: "My goodness, I don't find much; the Chi circuits are good, at least at the body level. But, believe my old experience, pain is always the sign of a cut in the circulation of energy, and it's not just bodily energies. It is possible that without wanting to and without knowing it you have broken your harmony with the great Whole. I will still try to relieve you.

Indeed, after an acupuncture session, he felt better.

The following days, he had almost finished the diversion trench, when he felt a pain in his kidneys. The day being almost over, he stopped and returned home.

But the next morning when he woke up, the pain was much more acute, especially when he wanted to get up. Sensing that his wife was going to talk to him about signs again, he took the lead.

— This time, the cause of my pain is very clear and completely physical. You're not going to be able to talk about a sign of destiny or something!
— Not so sure; firstly because the initial cause, in this type of case, is to be found in the general state which does not only depend on food but also on the mind.
— You know very well that our morale affects our health. The invisible is often at the origin of the visible manifestation. Lightning is due to the slow and invisible accumulation of electrical charges.

But excuse me, I have to hurry, if you want me to go see the doctor so that he can come and see you. Especially since the architect asked me to go directly to his office this morning. I wonder if it's not to talk about your projects.

Indeed, the architect was aware of the work undertaken by the mason.

— What your husband is undertaking is incorrect in many respects. The location and orientation of his construction contravene the rules of the art. Even if he did not want to call on our services, intervening as an extension of the space that we are developing, the least correction would have been to make contact. We would have given him the benefit of our advice. The worst thing is the diversion of the source, while we intend to favor this area of the presence of living water. Failing to revise his project, he will go to trial. Nevertheless, let him think about it, for his own good and that of those around him. Give him the Feng Shui book and tell him that my door is always open.

_The rest of the story?_

_It is not written because it depends on the free will of the mason._
