## International Outreach

The international outreach efforts of the Fellowship over the past year(s) have been exciting, uplifting, and indelible for those participating in these multifaceted activities.
Individuals, couples, and small groups representing the Fellowship have traveled to more than ten different countries in Central and South America, to Africa (Zambia, South Africa), and to at least six countries in Europe. Already this year there was a conference in Mazatlan, Mexico and extensive travel throughout Ecuador assisting study groups, speaking on radio programs, and doing television interviews. Projected for this year are activities in Argentina, India, Lithuania, with a possible outreach trip to Africa. And, for those who attended IC05, you are aware of the inspiring Korean activity. Also, the Chinese translation is only a few years away and already the ideas and discussion for an outreach of that magnitude are beginning to heat up.

The Fellowship is considering our proposal for an International Reader Service person, a funded position, to foster and strengthen the social infrastructure of the emerging Spanish readership. Many of us feel Latin America will soon show itself to be leaders of this revelation.

The Heart of America Society (thank you Ken Raveill), The Urantia Foundation, and the Fellowship worked together to translate, publish, and distribute the “Urdu Sampler”—five selected papers from the Book in a format where the left page is in English and the right page is in Urdu, the primary language of Pakistan. Wouldn’t it be fantastic if a “sampler book” was available in every language in every country?

## Buck Weimer New International Chair

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2006_Fall/Buck_Weimer.jpg">
</figure>

At the recent mid-year meeting of the General Council, Buck Weimer was elected the International Committee Chair following the resignation of David Kantor from the position. As a member of this committee, Buck has frequently traveled to various countries making contacts with those who will spread the revelation in their own areas. The above is his report of committee activities.

## Initiating the Companion Study Group Project

Many readers with whom we speak feel very isolated in their own country due to the lack of a large readership or express a sense of disconnectedness from other readers; again, this is especially true in Third World countries. We would like to organize and facilitate a project of matching willing study groups from Third World countries with willing study groups in First World countries as Companion Study Groups. Language differences can present an initial problem, but one that can be overcome with patience and the use of all the resources available today. The material, intellectual, spiritual, and social interactions between the study groups, and the individuals therein, could be enriching to all participants and give a tremendous boost to the growth of the worldwide Brotherhood and Sisterhood of humankind. If you personally, or your study group, would enjoy being involved in something like this, please contact us.

We on the International Fellowship Committee know this revelation is not currently for everyone; The Urantia Book is for future generations. We also know the slow growth we’ve all experienced in our many years with the book is somehow “natural”, and probably managed by our unseen celestial friends; so what we do is neither speeding up nor slowing down the growth process. What we do feel is a duty to all our brothers and sisters around the world to provide the revelation to those who are ready for it. Search within yourself to find your level of involvement in this great mission; as an ambassador, a teacher; messenger, or with individual prayers. For more information contact me at weimer1@hotmail.com.

## A Campus Outreach Experience

For the goals we’ve set ourselves, The Urantia Book Club at the University of Colorado, Boulder, is a great success. We have an attractive, eye-catching display and great posters that cause the UCB students to pause and look as they flow by. We have Urantia Books on exhibit and free fliers as handouts. And of course we have ourselves, the geezer group, perched on chairs in the background, ready to pounce at a moment’s notice. We’re meeting our goals because they’re rather simple—exhibit the book in an appealing manner so that the word Urantia becomes a familiar (if only subconscious) part of the campus life for those thousands of young and attentive minds transitioning through the halls of learning.

Still, things would a lot better if UCB wasn’t the only campus in America having a Urantia Book club. Numerous propositions and studies and meetings for various forms of outreach have come and gone over the decades; this one is simple and it fulfills its objective.

Anyone living in proximity to a campus and interested in outreach could obtain permission to set up another “booth,” find a chair and a table of their own at the nearby student commons, sit with a friend next to them and watch Adjuster infused youth flow by. At our website, www.urantiabookclub.org you’ll find all that’s needed for getting such a project underway; and you’ll get as much of our help as we’re able to give.

We also need better handouts that are aimed at enticing a new, young audience. We’ve taken it upon ourselves to reformat some of the old pamphlets, but we need new material—handouts that are interesting and captivating, that address the things people in their late teens through late twenties are interested in such as, how The Urantia Book has changed lives, issues it has clarified for you, the support it has provided in times of need, attitude adjustments, reality checks, and improved relationships. How does The Urantia Book affect your religious life, your family life, your social life? How does it fill the void of having been brought up with no religion? We need words from the heart more than we need quotes from the book because the book means nothing yet to the audience we’re focusing on.

Please write and offer your suggestions to Don Green at dsgreen1@comcast.net.

Best wishes from the UCB geezer group: Don Green, Stan Hartman, Kristen Michaels, Eric Shaveland, and Larry Watkins.

## A Leap of Faith

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/The_Mighty_Messenger/2007_Spring/Pato_Banton.jpg">
</figure>

International recording artist and devoted supporter of the Fifth Epochal Revelation, Pato Banton, has decided to take a leap of faith and dedicate his life to work in harmony with all branches of the Urantia community to raise the social awareness of the truths of The Urantia Book and to heed the Master’s call to go forth preaching the gospel of the kingdom, the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man.

Pato will be taking time out during his extensive tour schedule to provide grass roots moral support for Urantia study groups by personal inter-association. On February 1, Chicago-area readers of all affiliations gathered at the Urantia Foundation offices to enjoy dinner, a study group, and prayer together, followed by music by Pato and the Mystic Roots Band.

Anyone interested in hosting a meeting with Pato in their area, please contact: Norman Ingram (Central Outreach Facilitator) at norlastar@aol.com or 562-698-2122.

## Pipeline of Light Report

February 14, 2007

Dear Friends,

As of this writing, 921 Pipeline books have been placed into 57 countries around the world. You may enjoy reading comments from people who received books through your generous donations to the Pipeline of Light.
- **Italy**: I’m very, very glad about this news! Thanks! Yesterday I received the parcel with the book. WOW! In the evening I was already reading it... Thank you! Your book is the best gift I could receive for Christmas!! THANKS!!
- **South Africa**: Good news!! This week the ten books donated by the Pipeline of Light and Urantia Fellowship to Johannesburg, will be placed in ten reference libraries, one in each of the ten regional districts in the city. We are very excited about our progress and we can’t thank you enough. You have been an inspiration and such great help and support to us here in Johannesburg.
- **Egypt**: (It took several days for the book left for them to be dropped off at the main library, as several of them were fighting over it to look at it.) Kindly be informed that Mubarak Public library accepted The Urantia Book and it is available now for public. They thank you very much for the valuable book and of course me, I thank you very much. I will get back to you soon for some inquiries about the book.
- **Philippines**: I just received The Urantia Book that I had requested from you and I am probably the first and only person in my country who had a copy of this book. Again thank you very, very much for granting my favor. May the heavenly Father grant you more blessings.
- **Zambia**: I write to acknowledge receipt of the above mentioned Books and secondly to thank you for supporting this local authority and your commitment shown by personally delivering the Books. Kindly encourage other well wishers to emulate your good gesture. We wish you God’s blessings for the educative reading material.
- **Republic Of Guinea**: Father Louis writes thanking you all for the Ubooks for N’Zerekore. The UB refugees readers are returning home to Liberia and Sierra Leone from Guinea. They will be spreading the good news. We will keep you posted as to their progress and please pray for these brothers, sisters, and the UB orphans.

We continue to have difficulty getting books safely into the hands of the people who need them. If you have plans to travel internationally and would be willing to carry books with you, please contact me at mklimesh@covad.net. If we have a contact in the country to which you are traveling, it would greatly save on shipping difficulties and costs if you could carry books with you for personal delivery. We need 4-6 weeks lead time prior to your departure to make arrangements. Please let me know if you can help.

If you would like to contribute to this work, donations can be made online at: www.urantiabook.org/support or by mail: The Urantia Book Fellowship, PO Box 4583, Grand Central Station, New York, NY 10163, or by Paypal through the Mind, Body and Spirit church at www.squarecircles.com.

We deeply appreciate your continuing financial help. Michelle Klimesh, Pipeline Coordinator

## Reach Out for Outreach

The Outreach Committee is looking for volunteers to help in the following areas:
1. Public Outreach Host. Booths at Expos, book fairs, campuses, etc. The tasks would include booking of the event, design and make (or request) booth, obtain booth materials such as pamphlets, books, etc., and sign up volunteers to help at the event.
2. Develop promotional materials. Are you a good writer? Creative? Good at PhotoShop? We can use many types of informational materials to reach out to a wide variety of people who would be open to the revelation.
3. Speakers Bureau. This involves ongoing refining of speaking skills and a willingness to speak in public settings. A booking agent(s) is needed to promote our speakers and find speaking opportunities for them to share their message with a broader audience.
4. Media development. We are creating a media division to do everything from video introductions to The Urantia Book that can be viewed on the web to full length movies on spiritual subjects. Would you like to see the parables brought to life with professional actors and made available to the general public? This is possible through bringing together those with film and editing skills, script writers, actors, financial investors, administrators and anyone interested in helping.

For more details, contact the Outreach Committee Chair, Thomas Orjala at: tomo@imbris.net or call (208) 640-0660.
