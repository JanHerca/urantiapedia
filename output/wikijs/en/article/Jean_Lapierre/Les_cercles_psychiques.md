This paper is about the psychic circles (Paper 110:6) and their relationship to what is important in mastering them. I believe that the mastery of these circles has been largely misunderstood, and this is due, I think, to our Judeo-Christian monotheistic heritage where the emphasis was placed only on God the Universal Father, the Source and Center of All. This monotheism was good, because it allowed for the cleansing of a host of gods; it was anarchy. However, monotheism must not be made a dogma, because that would obscure, among other things, the Eternal Son, the Infinite Spirit, the existential Trinity, the two experiential Deities, etc.

On a material world and also on the worlds of houses, the conquest of the seven psychic circles concerns the potential for spiritual growth of a personality before its fusion (<a id="a23_176"></a>[UB 110:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_8) to 10). We deduce that this conquest of the seven circles can also be done on our material world, that is to say, reach the first psychic circle (the fusion could also be done, but it is exceptional at present). In this booklet, however, we are told that an individual of the seventh circle can know God and be conscious of his filiation with Him as well as the one who is in the first circle (<a id="a23_614"></a>[UB 110:6.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_16)).

But what is the salient element which advances an individual from the seventh to the first psychic circle? We are taught that individuals in the lower circles (seventh and sixth) are much less conscious of their experiential relationship with the Supreme Being, that is, of their cosmic citizenship. In other words, persons in the higher circles grasp the meanings and realize the values of a progressive approach to the morontia consciousness of the existence of an embryonic relationship between the morontia soul and the as yet unfinished Supreme Being (<a id="a29_557"></a>[UB 110:6.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_17)). We are told that the seven adjutants who had a growing influence upon the human mind from the seventh to the third circle are now of diminishing influence, and their ministry from the first circle onward may be said to be increasingly akin to the intelligence of the morontia stage (<a id="a29_888"></a>[UB 110:6.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_20)).

We can thus conclude that ascenders having reached the seventh or sixth circle, at the time of their physical death, will have to make on the worlds of the houses this increasing quantitative experience in the understanding of the supreme meanings and values that their colleagues of the material worlds have already accomplished on their native planet (<a id="a31_354"></a>[UB 110:6.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_18)).

All this does not take anything away from the Universal Father, but on the contrary allows us to know and understand Him more through experience. Let me explain. The Universal Father (the First Source-Center) being Absolute and Infinite, therefore one can only realize one's filiation with Him (impossibility of understanding Him entirely). A divine plan fortunately allows us a gradual approach to the knowledge and understanding of the Universal Father. This plan includes great levels of experiential approach, the first of which is that of supremacy which will be realized when our Mother God the Supreme will be completed (106:2). This experiential approach to knowing and understanding the Universal Father will always continue to be realized in subsequent ages of the universe with our Mother because she will be part of the first experiential Trinity to understand God as Ultimate, the second experiential Trinity to understand God as Absolute and the Trinity of Trinities towards a gradual, but always incomplete understanding of the infinity of God (all of this is well revealed in Paper 106).

I apologize somewhat if I have dragged you into these unimaginable future times; I wanted to show you that both now for psychic circles and for this immensely distant future, The Supreme Being (eventually he will become God the Supreme) will always be extremely important for our growth, this will never cease. She is our Mother and it is she who is essential for us to know and understand God more always, always, always.
