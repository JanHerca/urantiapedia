Hello everyone,

Our planet has experienced rebellion and the Adamic fault which caused many misfortunes. However, we are taught that the benefits which followed the rebellion weigh more in these positive effects? Here is a non-exhaustive list, perhaps you could find others?
<br style="clear:both;"/>

- This has helped to trinitize mortals who have resisted this rebellion and have become Mighty Messengers. We know that they play an extremely important role, particularly at the headquarters of our superuniverse.
- We are agondontaries and this inherent quality will remain for eternity in service.
- We benefited from the 4th epochal revelation (the bestowal of Michael on our planet).
- We have been granted the 5th epochal revelation (***The Urantia Book***). This revelation is the equivalent of the teachings of the mansion worlds up to the 5th and beyond regarding our relationship in eternity and infinity.
- The 24 Urantia counselors who directly represent Michael and Gabriel on Jerusem come from our planet. <a id="a29_104"></a>[UB 114:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p3_5)
- Michael himself has become our planetary Prince.
- An invisible planetary government has taken over the two cultural centers that we should have had on our planet if everything had gone normally.
- The ascenders of our local universe who come from very advanced planets, before continuing their ascension towards the minor sector, must provide service on planets such as ours.
- etc.
