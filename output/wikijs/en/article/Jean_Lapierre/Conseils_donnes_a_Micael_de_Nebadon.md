Hello Gaétan,

Thank you again for your solid conference on Luciferian thought on March 19, 2023. It makes us realize that he is very often behind harmful events that are happening even now on our planet. I would like to draw your attention to a logic of the following facts:

When Emmanuel gave his advice to Michael before he undertook his seventh and final bestowal to become Master Son of his universe, he told him in particular this: <a id="a24_162"></a>[UB 120:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p2_3) “... _When you have succeeded in terminating the Urantia secession, as you undoubtedly will, I counsel you to accept from Gabriel the conference of the title of ‘Planetary Prince of Urantia’ as the eternal recognition by your universe of your final bestowal experience; and that you further do any and all things, consistent with the purport of your bestowal, to atone for the sorrow and confusion brought upon Urantia by the Caligastia betrayal and the subsequent Adamic default._”
<br style="clear:both;"/>

The important elements are these: (1) The son of man ends the secession of Urantia; (2) He does so; (3) Michael becomes our Planetary Prince; and (4) Michael will take steps to compensate for the affliction caused by Adam's rebellion and failure. I have often wondered what this compensation could be. It could not be the Spirit of Truth and the general arrival of the Thought Adjusters because with the bestowal of an Avonal son these two gifts always accompany this operation. I have come to the conclusion that this compensation is **The Urantia Book**. Indeed, even if the revelations contained in this book are the fifth epochal revelation, this revelation cannot be considered as a revelation mainly expanding those of the fourth epochal revelation because the fourth had not yet reached its full maturity (an epochal revelation normally expands the revelations of the previous one when the latter has reached a certain ceiling).

The revelations of The Urantia Book are and will be a very powerful lever for eventually narrowing the present wide gap between scientific and spiritual development. I quote two passages on what may happen if this present gap is not corrected: <a id="a29_244"></a>[UB 118:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p8_6). The slowness of evolution, of human cultural progress, testifies to the effectiveness of that brake—material inertia—which acts so powerfully to slow down the dangerous speeds of progress. Thus time itself deadens and distributes the (otherwise fatal) consequences of prematurely escaping the successive barriers that limit human activity. For when culture advances too rapidly, when material achievements outpace the evolution of wisdom-worship, then civilization contains within itself the seeds of recession. Unless this civilization is supported by a rapid increase in experiential wisdom, such human societies will descend from the high but premature levels they have attained, and the “dark ages” of the wisdom interregnum will then witness the inexorable resurgence of the imbalance between self-freedom and self-control <a id="a29_1117"></a>[UB 118:8.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p8_7). Caligastia's iniquity consisted in short-circuiting the time regulator of progressive human liberation. He arbitrarily destroyed the restrictive barriers over which the mortal minds of that age had not yet triumphed by experience.

The new Planetary Prince of Urantia has permitted and authorized these revelations from the _Urantia Book_ to reach us, but their full effects will be seen mainly in the future and will prevent us, I believe, from experiencing an age of darkness such as Caligastia wishes.

Hello Jean,

Thank you very much for your very appreciated comments! I also agree that ***The Urantia Book*** is a compensation for the ordeal that our planet is undergoing because of Lucifer's rebellion. I also believe that the coming of Machiventa Melchizedek as a Son of relief (<a id="a53_269"></a>[UB 93:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p1_3)) as well as that of Michael as a Son of Bestowal before the coming of a Magisterial Son is also part of the compensations for our difficult situation. I am certain that if we looked for other compensations we would find several such as that of having the status of agondontar.

I would like, if you allow me, for your comments to be published in Reflectivity to stimulate the thought and awareness of readers about this interesting and important subject.

Looking forward to reading you.

Hello Gaétan,

You are right to cite all these compensations because they acted as such to soften our difficult situation. But, what I wanted to do was to specifically find a compensation that followed Emmanuel's recommendation and that would have been given to us once Michael had become our Planetary Prince. I thus eliminated all those that existed prior to his bestowal as well as those that were already inherent to his bestowal. There remained only ***The Urantia Book*** and the circuit of archangels recently installed on our planet still in quarantine (it is also possible that other compensations meeting my criteria will arrive in the future).

**_The Urantia Book_: an emergency revelation?**

Hello Jean, Gaétan and everyone,

Gaétan's conference dealing with “_Luciferian thought, revelation and us_”, on March 19, 2023, moved me because it made me review the harmful influences of false freedom which shape our world from the upheavals which followed the rebellion until today and for a long time to come, until each personality affected by its influences has firmly decided to adopt the true freedom of following the divine order by devoting themselves to sincerely doing the will of the Father with the aim of becoming perfect like himself.

It was while thinking about this and reading the comments of Jean Lapierre and his conclusion that ***The Urantia Book*** was given to us with Michael's approval to instruct us spiritually in compensation for the affliction of our lack of spiritual resources that I said to myself that it is also an _emergency revelation_ to stimulate us and to give birth in our human minds to the recognition of the urgency for us humans of Urantia (as Jean so rightly said) to progress spiritually in order to balance “_the current significant gap between scientific development and that of spirituality_.”

> Of all the perplexing problems growing out of the Lucifer rebellion, none has occasioned more difficulty than the failure of immature evolutionary mortals to distinguish between true and false liberty. (<a id="a88_205"></a>[UB 54:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p1_1))

> True liberty is the quest of the ages and the reward of evolutionary progress. False liberty is the subtle deception of the error of time and the evil of space. Enduring liberty is predicated on the reality of justice—intelligence, maturity, fraternity, and equity. (<a id="a90_269"></a>[UB 54:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p1_2))

> Someday man should learn how to enjoy liberty without license, nourishment without gluttony, and pleasure without debauchery. Self-control is a better human policy of behavior regulation than is extreme self-denial. Nor did Jesus ever teach these unreasonable views to his followers. (<a id="a92_287"></a>[UB 89:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p3_7))

Urantia is not devoid of proper and effective supervision by its system, constellation, and local universe rulers, but its planetary government is unlike that of any other world in the Satania system or, indeed, in all of Nebadon. The uniqueness of your plan of supervision is due to a number of unusual circumstances:

1. The modification status of life on Urantia.
2. The demands due to Lucifer's rebellion.
3. Disturbances due to the Adamic fault.
4. Irregularities arising from the fact that Urantia was one of the bestowal worlds of the Universe Sovereign. Michael of Nebadon is the Planetary Prince of Urantia.
5. The special function of the twenty-four planetary directors.
6. The installation on the planet of a circuit of archangels.
7. The more recent designation as Vicegerent Planetary Prince of Machiventa Melchizedek, formerly incarnated on Urantia <a id="a104_120"></a>[UB 114:0](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p0).
