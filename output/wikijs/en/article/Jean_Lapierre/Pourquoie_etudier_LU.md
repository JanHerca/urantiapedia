Hello everyone,

We are evolutionary beings inhabiting a planet that has suffered many misfortunes, not benefiting like so-called normal planets, from two great centers of culture showing us the way for ages. In accordance with the plan of the Universal Father, we periodically receive revelations of epochal periods and the last, the 5th, was the UB. This revelation is what we needed, taking into account our very particular situation, and particularly our poverty on the spiritual level which needs to be enhanced.

If we take a brief look at the world of houses, we are informed of the following:

1\. Worlds 1 and 2 aim to eradicate the elements of the beast that remain within us;
2\. <a id="a27_4"></a>[UB 47:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p5_3) _On the third mansion world, surviving mortals acquire practical clairvoyance in true metaphysics. This is the true introduction to the intelligent understanding of cosmic meanings and universal interrelationships;_
3\. <a id="a28_4"></a>[UB 47:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p6_2) _On the fourth mansonia, the individual ascender finds his place more exactly in the collective work and class functions of morontia life._

> _It is during the period of training on world number four that the ascending mortals are really first introduced to the demands and delights of the true social life of morontia creatures. And it is indeed a new experience for evolutionary creatures to participate in social activities which are predicated neither on personal aggrandizement nor on self-seeking conquest. A new social order is being introduced, one based on the understanding sympathy of mutual appreciation, the unselfish love of mutual service, and the overmastering motivation of the realization of a common and supreme destiny—the Paradise goal of worshipful and divine perfection. Ascenders are all becoming self-conscious of God-knowing, God-revealing, God-seeking, and God-finding._
> 
> _The intellectual and social culture of this fourth mansion world is comparable to the mental and social life of the post-Teacher Son age on the planets of normal evolution._ [LU 47:6.3-4](/fr/The_Urantia_Book/47#p6_4)

4\. <a id="a39_4"></a>[UB 47:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p7_1) _Transport to the fifth mansion world represents a tremendous forward step in the life of a morontia progressor. The experience on this world is a real foretaste of Jerusem life. Here you begin to realize the high destiny of the loyal evolutionary worlds since they may normally progress to this stage during their natural planetary development. The culture of this mansion world corresponds in general to that of the early era of light and life on the planets of normal evolutionary progress._

> _A real birth of cosmic consciousness takes place on mansonia number five. You are becoming universe minded. This is indeed a time of expanding horizons. It is beginning to dawn upon the enlarging minds of the ascending mortals that some stupendous and magnificent, some supernal and divine, destiny awaits all who complete the progressive Paradise ascension, which has been so laboriously but so joyfully and auspiciously begun. At about this point the average mortal ascender begins to manifest bona fide experiential enthusiasm for the Havona ascent. Study is becoming voluntary, unselfish service natural, and worship spontaneous. A real morontia character is budding; a real morontia creature is evolving._ (<a id="a41_715"></a>[UB 47:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p7_5))

**Conclusion**: The ascension plan including in particular the very first steps following our physical death is well done and progressive. We note that despite the current situation of our forties, we are not deprived. We have benefited on our planet from the incarnation of the Son Michael (4th revelation) and the UB (5th revelation) coming to clarify the true teachings of Jesus and also helping us to acquire a cosmic consciousness and an enhancement of our spiritual perception equivalent to that of the level of the 5th world of houses). And finally, this 5th revelation also revealed to us what had never been done before: the Supreme Being and our endless link with Him towards eternity (God the Universal Father, and God the Supreme who are perfected, are our parents: one is existential and the other is experiential).

Also, a very important point to remember is this:

> _The psychic circles are not exclusively intellectual, neither are they wholly morontial; they have to do with personality status, mind attainment, soul growth, and Adjuster attunement. The successful traversal of these levels demands the harmonious functioning of the *entire personality,* not merely of some one phase thereof. The growth of the parts does not equal the true maturation of the whole; the parts really grow in proportion to the expansion of the entire self—the whole self—material, intellectual, and spiritual._
> 
> _It is to the mind of perfect poise, housed in a body of clean habits, stabilized neural energies, and balanced chemical function—when the physical, mental, and spiritual powers are in triune harmony of development—that a maximum of light and truth can be imparted with a minimum of temporal danger or risk to the real welfare of such a being. By such a balanced growth does man ascend the circles of planetary progression one by one, from the seventh to the first._ [LU 110:6.3-4](/fr/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_4)

We have seen above that the 4th world of houses corresponds to the later culture of a world having received a Son Instructor of the truth and that the 5th to that of the primitive period of light and life. What an opportunity we have with the teachings of the UB! As the teachings of the UB correspond in large part to the teachings of the worlds of houses 4 and 5, we understand better why it is said that this revelation was given to us for the next millennium.
