In our study group, we realized that no sophisticated teaching was necessary to realize a certain awareness of the Supreme in our minds. This awareness emerges naturally to any sincere truth seeker asking existential questions. Our thinking goes that these meanings he will have of God will contain many characteristics more akin to the finite God we are given to study in The Urantia Book. So why study these revelations if the personal religion of a sincere and motivated truth seeker naturally leads him to faith and living truth because of the presence of his Thought Adjuster and the bestowal of the Spirit of Truth upon all flesh?

It is that in the revelations of Urantia we can deduce several reasons to justify the epochal revelations:
<br style="clear:both;"/>

1\. To expand our cosmic consciousness and enhance our spiritual perception <a id="a25_76"></a>[UB 0:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p0_2).
2. The institutional religions currently on our planet possess very few of the desirable characteristics described in booklet 99.
3\.

> Truth may be but relatively inspired, even though revelation is invariably a spiritual phenomenon. While statements with reference to cosmology are never inspired, such revelations are of immense value in that they at least transiently clarify knowledge by:
> 1. The reduction of confusion by the authoritative elimination of error.
> 2. The co-ordination of known or about-to-be-known facts and observations.
> 3. The restoration of important bits of lost knowledge concerning epochal transactions in the distant past.
> 4. The supplying of information which will fill in vital missing gaps in otherwise earned knowledge.
> 5. Presenting cosmic data in such a manner as to illuminate the spiritual teachings contained in the accompanying revelation. (<a id="a34_129"></a>[UB 101:4.5-10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p4_5))

4. The great gap in our societies between material and scientific progress compared to spiritual progress, which remains embryonic, results mainly from the rebellion of Lucifer and the Adamic fault.
