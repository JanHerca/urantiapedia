Hello everyone,

While studying this booklet last Wednesday, new meanings emerged in me which have continued until now. I share them with you this morning. Michael, before carrying out his last outpouring on our planet, received advice from his brother Emmanuel concerning this outpouring, this mission, its limitations and even additional advice. Booklet 140 on the ordination of the twelve is quite similar: Jesus gives his apostles (sometimes he also calls them ambassadors) preliminary instruction, recommendations, the reason for sending them into the world, that they had to show paternal love, his demands concerning their new birth and his demands also to get involved only in the spiritual domain to establish the new kingdom in the hearts of Jews and Gentiles.

We learn that Jesus asks his Father to accompany them as he himself was accompanied and to give them wisdom. In fact, he entrusts his twelve men to the care of his Father. He tells them:
<br style="clear:both;"/>

> _Now that you are ambassadors of my Father’s kingdom, you have thereby become a class of men separate and distinct from all other men on earth. You are not now as men among men but as the enlightened citizens of another and heavenly country among the ignorant creatures of this dark world._ (<a id="a29_294"></a>[UB 140:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p3_1))

These instructions, advice, and sometimes even demands, were not the gospel of Jesus, but useful instructions that the apostles received just as he himself had received from Emmanuel.
