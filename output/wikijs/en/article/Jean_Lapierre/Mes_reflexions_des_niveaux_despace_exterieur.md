Hello everyone,

Claude Flibotte wrote a very interesting article in the April 2023 issue of Réflectivité on the aggregates of matter in the levels of exterior space. He also mentioned that we will have to do service in this level of absonite space. We can ask ourselves when and under what conditions these exterior universes will be inhabited? Already, we know that there, all reality (physical, mental and spiritual) is, or will be transcended because these universes belong to absonite reality.

The purpose of my presentation is to try to understand this reality at the absonite level. This will not be easy because we are beings conditioned by time and space and in these external universes the transcendentals who will eventually live there are not independent of time and space (they are not absolute), but are not conditioned by it. It is interesting to note in Paper 12 (Section 3) that observations made by researchers from Uversa on gravity concluded that the action of physical gravity in the grand universe represented only a small fraction of the total gravity of the master universe. As for spiritual gravity, its action in the grand universe represented almost the totality of the supposed value of this spiritual gravity in the master universe. These two Observations on gravity coincide with what is revealed in ***The Urantia Book*** concerning the external universes.

These outer universes are extremely vast if we compare them to the superuniverses of the finite level. To give us an idea, in Paper 31, Section 9, we are told that at the Paradise and Havona levels, 4 Master Architects were exteriorized as planners and that at the finite level, 7 others were. In the 4 rings of outer universes, 28,000 Master Architects are exteriorized (respectively 70,490,3,430 and 24,010). This excerpt is eloquent on this subject:

> These seven groups of Master Architects total 28,011 universe planners. On Paradise there is a tradition that far back in eternity there was attempted the eventuation of the 28,012<sup>th</sup> Master Architect, but that this being failed to absonitize, experiencing personality seizure by the Universal Absolute. It is possible that the ascending series of the Master Architects attained the limit of absonity in the 28,011<sup>th</sup> Architect, and that the 28,012<sup>th</sup> attempt encountered the mathematical level of the presence of the Absolute. In other words, at the 28,012<sup>th</sup> eventuation level the quality of absonity equivalated to the level of the Universal and attained the value of the Absolute. (<a id="a34_728"></a>[UB 31:9.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p9_10))

## Continued from page 2

Here it is really personal and I venture to say that this 28012th attempt who is not a Master Architect, I believe he is the Unrevealed Consummator of Destiny who will be part of the second experiential trinity with God the Supreme and God the Ultimate, to experientially actualize and complete God the Absolute (we have here a similarity with the Supreme Being for the creation of Majeston)

If we continue our reasoning on transcended reality, let us examine 4 extracts:

1. Transcendentals are subinfinite and subabsolute, but suprafinite and supracreated.** Transcendentals externalize themselves as an integrating level linking the supervalues of the absolutes with the maxima values of the finites**. From the point of view of creatures, what is transcendental seems to have externalized itself as a consequence of the finite. From the point of view of eternity, it is an anticipation of the finite. <a id="a42_432"></a>[UB 105:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/105#p7_1)
2. ***Finis maxima***. **This is the present status of all experiential creatures who have reached their destiny—destiny as revealed within the confines of the present universe age**. The universes themselves may reach their maximum status both spiritually and physically, but the word “maximum” is itself a relative term—maximum in relation to what? What is maximum and apparently final in the present universe age may represent only a real beginning in terms of ages to come. <a id="a43_478"></a>[UB 106:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/106#p0_4)
3. _Transcendentals_. **This superfinite level follows the finite progression (anticipating it).** It involves the prefinite genesis of finite beginnings and the postfinite meaning of all apparently finite endings or destinies. <a id="a44_228"></a>[UB 106:0.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/106#p0_5)
4. The evolving Supreme will eventually compensate finite creatures for their inability to make more than a limited experiential contact with the universe of universes. Creatures can attain the Paradise Father, but their evolutionary minds are finite and therefore incapable of real understanding of the infinite and absolute Father. But since all that the creature experiences registers with and is a part of the Supreme, **when all creatures have <ins>attained the final level of finite existence</ins> and the total development of the universe has enabled them to attain God the Supreme as the actual presence of divinity, then, by the very fact of such contact, they will have contact with the totality of experience.** The finite domain of time contains within itself the seeds of eternity. We are taught that at the time when the fullness of evolution sees the exhaustion of the cosmic capacity for growth, **the entire finite domain will enter the absonite phases of the eternal career seeking the Father as Ultimate**. <a id="a45_1027"></a>[UB 117:5.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p5_14)

Here are the important elements that I remember:

1. The transcendentals exteriorize, integrate and connect the values of the absolutes with the **maxima** values of the finite. But since all finite personalities reach God the Supreme at the same time and God the Supreme is part of the first experiential trinity, this is why there are only masses of matter at present (the Supreme is not completed at present). I believe that the Transcendentals will be exteriorized at the same time during the completion of God the Supreme and that the ultimate trinity will become a fact. But, on the physical level it does not happen as on the spiritual level: as soon as a planet, a system, etc. anchor themselves in light and life, mobilizations of matter are exteriorized somewhere in the external universes probably.
2. Finite creatures will reach this level of finite maximum when they become seventh-stage spirits when the Supreme becomes perfectly perfected in God the Supreme.
3. This superfinite level follows the finite progression (anticipating it). This is the relationship with time and space. When the whole of the finite reaches the status of finite maxima, the absonite reality anticipates this state and the Transcendentals externalize themselves. However, the material absonite reality did not need to wait for the completion of God the Supreme to externalize masses of matter in the external universes.
4. Absonite personalities and us will be subject to transcendental growth.

In conclusion, we are currently observing clusters of matter in the outer spaces and there will be others (they are not populated by personalities). But, when the finaliters enter their seventh phase of spirituality to become finite maximas, these levels of outer space (at least the first) will simultaneously become inhabited by transcendentals who have become exteriorized. This will allow us to provide service to them in particular because of our acquired experiential evolution.

Hoping to have managed to understand a little!
