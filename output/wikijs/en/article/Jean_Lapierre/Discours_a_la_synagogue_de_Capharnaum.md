I pointed out some apparent inconsistencies in this text regarding the pains coming after birth: before the pains came, she gave birth to a male child. Here is the full text that Jesus chose when he spoke in the synagogue at Capernaum:
<br style="clear:both;"/>

> When Jesus stood up, the ruler of the synagogue handed him the Scripture roll, and he read from the Prophet Isaiah: “Thus says the Lord: ‘The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. Where is the house that you built for me? And where is the place of my dwelling? All these things have my hands made,’ says the Lord. ‘But to this man will I look, even to him who is poor and of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at my word.’ Hear the word of the Lord, you who tremble and fear: ‘Your brethren hated you and cast you out for my name’s sake.’ But let the Lord be glorified. He shall appear to you in joy, and all others shall be ashamed. A voice from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice from the Lord says: ‘Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child.’ Who has heard such a thing? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? Or can a nation be born at once? But thus says the Lord: ‘Behold I will extend peace like a river, and the glory of even the gentiles shall be like a flowing stream. As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you. And you shall be comforted even in Jerusalem. And when you see these things, your heart shall rejoice.’” (<a id="a23_1233"></a>[UB 137:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p6_2))

> When he had finished this reading, Jesus handed the roll back to its keeper. Before sitting down, he simply said: “Be patient and you shall see the glory of God; even so shall it be with all those who tarry with me and thus learn to do the will of my Father who is in heaven.” And the people went to their homes, wondering what was the meaning of all this. (<a id="a30_360"></a>[UB 137:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p6_3))

I make amends: there are no inconsistencies at all. Jesus spoke in a prescient way to this audience in this synagogue. He told them in essence this through this excerpt from the book of the prophet Isaiah:

- Heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool. Where is the house that you have built for me? And where is the place of my dwelling: (he refers to the kingdom of heaven which is not of this world but which can be started to be built here on earth. He asks them for accounts concerning this house that they have built.)
- Before she experienced pain, she gave birth; before the suffering came, she gave birth to a male child. (Here Jesus is referring to himself: He will be rejected, misunderstood and much suffering for this people will follow.)
- Can the earth produce its fruit in a single day? Can a nation be born in an instant? (Jesus says that his teachings will produce fruit but that it will take a long time)
- Behold, I will spread peace like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles themselves will be like a torrent. (his teachings are for all including the Gentiles and will be understood thanks to the Spirit of Truth)
- I will comfort you. You will be comforted even in Jerusalem; and when you see these things, your heart will rejoice.'” (In the centuries or millennia to come, you will see the accomplishment of these things, also including Jerusalem even if the Covenant was canceled.)
