Hello dear friends,

At the 2024 general meeting of our association, on May 5, I was elected to the position of vice-president which had become vacant. I thank the members for placing their trust in me. I also thank André Pominville who held this position for the last 2 years and who maintained a primary interest in working within the board of directors. For my part, I am new, but not quite since I was the secretary from 2015 to 2020 and here I am now vice-president. It is an honor and a great responsibility, because I have a strong desire to maintain this living dynamic that stimulates me. I am the youngest arrival in a well-established team that works wholeheartedly for the emancipation of this formidable revelation of the time. I will do my best to help and serve spiritual progress.

The Urantia movement with its readers and those who labor to spread the good news of the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man has an irresistible appeal to sincerely searching souls for truth, and I, like you, am one of them.

I discovered the Urantia Association of Quebec in 2012, this was the beginning of a continuing interest in knowing its founding members and those who continually work to make known and progress the flame of personal devotion to the treasures hidden within the God-conscious human personality.

God indwells us through His divine presence, our Thought Adjuster, and this is, in my opinion, one, if not the greatest revelation in _The Urantia Book_ that brings us enlightenment and spiritual freshness.

Even though ***The Urantia Book*** was published almost 69 years ago on October 12, 1955, we are told in: “The Birth of a Revelation” that the first 60 to 75 years of the book would serve to solidify its foundation and ensure the solidity of its revelatory presence. We, the white-haired readers and those who follow us are the vanguard, an innovative group in the spiritual field of the movement that has taken shape and is boldly developing on a global scale to promote the new religion of humanity, the religion of Jesus, the religion of personal spiritual experience <a id="a30_571"></a>[[UB 155:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p6_8)].

The Book, this new revelation, was given to us long before the age when it will be easier to establish a higher order of human relations on earth. Its publication was brought forward so that it could be used now to train leaders and instructors. We who know this must be the torchbearers, enlightening and instructing those who sincerely seek the truth.

Readers' associations, study groups and schools of spiritual progression such as: Progressive Divine Wisdom, Ambassadors' School and several other forums are at work to teach and advance the spiritual flame in the hearts of sincere believers in the divine presence in us, the sons and daughters of God by faith.

Together we are committed to responding to the call of Jesus and to His Father, our Father, to produce the fruits of the spirit as much as we can.

This is the meaning I want to give to my work and my involvement.

To love is to serve!


Praying together means growing together!
