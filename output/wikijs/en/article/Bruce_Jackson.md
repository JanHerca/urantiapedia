Dr. Bruce Jackson, a reader since 1979, taught college music and humanities for 17 years at Lincoln University of Missouri, and served as a college administrator for 12. He worked with The Spiritual Fellowship Journal for 10 years. A working musician since 1969, he is now retired and focusing on _Urantia Book_ projects and church music. He performs and composes jazz, popular and church music for his family band with his three sons. This native of Arkansas currently lives in Columbia, MO.

The UB found him in 1979 after reading the opening paragraphs of Paper 1 while listening to Oscar Peterson and Ray Brown. Within 12 hours he found a local bookstore and purchased the $25 copy that still sits on his desk.
