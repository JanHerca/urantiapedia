> What a transcendent service if, through this revelation, the Son of Man should be recovered from the tomb of traditional theology and be presented as the living Jesus to the church that bears his name, and to all other religions! Surely the Christian fellowship of believers will not hesitate to make such adjustments of faith and of practices of living as will enable it to “follow after” the Master in the demonstration of his real life of religious devotion to the doing of his Father's will and of consecration to the unselfish service of man. (<a id="a36_551"></a>[UB 196:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p1_2))

> If Christianity could only grasp more of Jesus' teachings, it could do so much more in helping modern man to solve his new and increasingly complex problems. (<a id="a38_161"></a>[UB 195:10.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_19))

> The hope of modern Christianity is that it should cease to sponsor the social systems and industrial policies of Western civilization while it humbly bows itself before the cross it so valiantly extols, there to learn anew from Jesus of Nazareth the greatest truths mortal man can ever hear--the living gospel of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. (<a id="a40_366"></a>[UB 195:10.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_21))

> Christian churches of the twentieth century stand as great, but wholly unconscious, obstacles to the immediate advance of the real gospel--the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. (<a id="a42_178"></a>[UB 195:10.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_8))

> Christianity is seriously confronted with the doom embodied in one of its own slogans: “A house divided against itself cannot stand.” The non-Christian world will hardly capitulate to a sect-divided Christendom. The living Jesus is the only hope of a possible unification of Christianity. The true church--the Jesus brotherhood--is invisible, spiritual, and is characterized by unity, not necessarily by uniformity. (<a id="a44_419"></a>[UB 195:10.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_11))

> But the Christianity of even the twentieth century must not be despised. It is the product of the combined moral genius of the God-knowing men of many races during many ages, and it has truly been one of the greatest powers for good on earth, and therefore no man should lightly regard it, notwithstanding its inherent and acquired defects. Christianity still contrives to move the minds of reflective men with mighty moral emotions. (<a id="a46_437"></a>[UB 195:10.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_12))

> The great hope of Urantia lies in the possibility of a new revelation of Jesus with a new and enlarged presentation of his saving message which would spiritually unite in loving service the numerous families of his present-day professed followers. (<a id="a48_251"></a>[UB 195:10.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_16))

> "The kingdom of God is within you” was probably the greatest pronouncement Jesus ever made, next to the declaration that his Father is a living and loving spirit. (<a id="a50_166"></a>[UB 195:10.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_4))

> The living Jesus is the only hope of a possible unification of Christianity. The true church--the Jesus brotherhood--is invisible, spiritual, and is characterized by unity, not necessarily by uniformity. (<a id="a52_207"></a>[UB 195:10.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_11))

> There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differsfrom another star in glory.
> [1 Corinthians 15:41](/en/Bible/1_Corinthians/15#v41)

> We know what happens to people who stay in the middle of the road. They get run over.
> _Aneurin Bevan_

## Our and Christianity's Problem

> Do not overlook the value of your spiritual heritage, the river of truth running down through the centuries, even to the barren times of a materialistic and secular age. In all your worthy efforts to rid yourselves of the superstitious creeds of past ages, make sure that you hold fast the eternal truth. But be patient! when the present superstition revolt is over, the truths of Jesus' gospel will persist gloriously to illuminate a new and better way. (<a id="a62_458"></a>[UB 195:9.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_1))

> But paganized and socialized Christianity stands in need of new contact with the uncompromised teachings of Jesus; it languishes for lack of a new vision of the Master's life on earth. A new and fuller revelation of the religion of Jesus is destined to conquer an empire of materialistic secularism and to overthrow a world sway of mechanistic naturalism. Urantia is now quivering on the very brink of one of its most amazing and enthralling epochs of social readjustment, moral quickening, and spiritual enlightenment. (<a id="a64_523"></a>[UB 195:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_2))

> Religion does need new leaders, spiritual men and women who will dare to depend solely on Jesus and his incomparable teachings. If Christianity persists in neglecting its spiritual mission while it continues to busy itself with social and material problems, the spiritual renaissance must await the coming of these new teachers of Jesus' religion who will be exclusively devoted to the spiritual regeneration of men. And then will these spirit-born souls quickly supply the leadership and inspiration requisite for the social, moral, economic, and political reorganization of the world. (<a id="a66_590"></a>[UB 195:9.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_4))

## Widening the field

> The religious challenge of this age is to those farseeing and forward-looking men and women of spiritual insight who will dare to construct a new and appealing philosophy of living out of the enlarged and exquisitely integrated modern concepts of cosmic truth, universe beauty, and divine goodness. Such a new and righteous vision of morality will attract all that is good in the mind of man and challenge that which is best in the human soul. (<a id="a70_447"></a>[UB 2:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p7_10))

## Understanding required

> The Christian religion is the religion about the life and teachings of Christ based upon the theology of Judaism, modified further through the assimilation of certain Zoroastrian teachings and Greek philosophy, and formulated primarily by three individuals: Philo, Peter, and Paul. It has passed through many phases of evolution since the time of Paul and has become so thoroughly Occidentalized that many non-European peoples very naturally look upon Christianity as a strange revelation of a strange God and for strangers. (<a id="a74_528"></a>[UB 92:6.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p6_18))

> By the time the teachings of Jesus arrived (in India), Christianity had already become so Occidentalized as to be a “white man's religion,” hence strange and foreign to the Hindu mind. (<a id="a76_188"></a>[UB 94:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p4_1))

> Siddhartha taught far more truth than has survived in the modern cults bearing his name. Modern Buddhism is no more the teachings of Gautama Siddhartha than is Christianity the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. (<a id="a78_212"></a>[UB 94:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p7_8))

> When you meet someone better than yourself, turn your thoughts to becoming his equal. When you meet someone not as good as you are, look within and examine your own self.
> _Confucius_

> Learning without thought is labour lost; thought without learning is perilous.
> _Confucius_
