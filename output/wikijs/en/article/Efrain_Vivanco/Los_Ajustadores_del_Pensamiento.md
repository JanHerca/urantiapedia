Dr.S.W. Sadler, son of Dr. Sadler, the main participant in receiving the documents that gave rise to _The Urantia Book_, says in his _Study of the Master Universe_: «_The Urantia Book_ is not written as a textbook, but as a symphony. Wonderful themes of truth-revealing concepts and movements appear and reappear as the long story revealed. Parts of this story are very melodious. The melody unfolds with such charming simplicity that the reader is entranced." [Preface, paragraph 6](/en/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/Study_of_the_Master_Universe/Foreword)

These beautiful and inspiring phrases convinced me that any part, any subject, any page of _The Urantia Book_ teaches us something of value for our spiritual growth.

And the topics are so many and so beautiful that I couldn't decide which one to try to write for my fellow readers of _The Urantia Book_; I finally decided on the exciting topic of Thought Adjusters, which is one of the most fascinating writings for my taste, which filled me with joy, knowing that what I have sought so much outside of myself I have always had deep within. myself, residing in my mind and working in my heart.

I refer to the fragments of the Universal Father, the divine spark that reaches the normal minds of all individuals around the age of six, when the human being makes his first moral decision.

According to _The Urantia Book_, man is constituted as follows:

1. The physical body, which is the material organism of man, the electrochemical organism of animal nature and origin. 2. The mind: endowment of the Infinite Spirit through the Spirit of the local Universe, which thinks, perceives and feels.
2. Spirit: The Mystery Monitor or Thought Adjuster, prepersonal in character but destined to share the personality of the ascending evolutionary soul at the time of soul-Adjuster fusion.
3. The soul: it is an experiential acquisition. Said soul does not come from anywhere; it is formed here and its parents are the Thought Adjuster and the mortal mind of man.

Just as we are human parents, so the Adjuster is the divine parent of our **true selves, our highest and advancing selves, our best morontia selves** (by which I mean the soul).

The substance of this new reality (the soul) is neither material nor spiritual—it is _morontia_. This is the nascent immortal soul destined to survive mortal death and begin the ascent to Paradise from the mansion worlds. It constitutes the invariable **personality**, the gift that the Universal Father bestows on the previous constituent parts of man as a whole.

This personality of mortal man is neither body nor mind nor spirit; nor is it the soul. Personality is the only unchanging reality in an otherwise constantly changing experience of the creature; and unites all other associated factors of individuality.

About the third constitutive part of man, the Mysterious Monitor or Thought Adjuster, I want to present to you a small summary or interpretation of what is said about it in _The Urantia Book_.

From _The Urantia Book_ we now learn that the Universal Father personally resides on the Isle of Paradise, his first creation and the very center of all that is; but who is also present in the minds of his countless evolutionary children of time and space as Mysterious Monitor or Thought Adjuster. Thus, the Eternal Father is both farther away than anyone and closer than everyone in the minds and hearts of his experiential creatures.

These Thought Adjusters are the reality of the Father's love living in the minds of men; They are likewise the passport, the ticket, so that the potentially eternal human soul can take the path from the dense material worlds to the worlds of residence, the true heavens that Jesus said that his Father had prepared for those of his children who wish to survive. .

We, the Urantians, despite having suffered two great setbacks, one with the rebellion of Lucifer, the sovereign of our local system; and the contumacy of Caligastia, our Planetary Prince; and the other with the lack of our biological elevators, Adam and Eve, we have been blessed in counterpart with two heavenly gifts: one the bestowal of the divine spark or Thought Adjuster, to reside in our mortal minds, and the other the bestowal of the Creator of the Local Universe, our Father Michael of Nebadon, in the physical form of Jesus of Nazareth.

Thus it can be said that, just as every mortal who has seen the Creator Son has actually seen the Universal Father, the one who contains a Divine Adjuster contains the Paradise Father.

One of the great objectives of man and his Adjuster is to become one, one personality, one identity, whose destiny is the Corps of the Finality on Paradise.

It is the Adjuster who creates within man that insatiable desire and unceasing longing to be like God, to reach Paradise, and there, before the actual person of Deity, adore the infinite source of divine gift.

The Adjuster is man's possibility to achieve eternity; and man is the Adjuster's possibility for personality attainment.

Mystery Monitors are not thought assistants; they are thought adjusters. They work with the material mind for the purpose of building, through adjustment and spiritualization, a new mind for the soul on the morontia worlds.

The Adjuster is the mark of divinity, the presence of God. The “image of God” does not refer to the physical resemblance or narrow limitations of the endowments of the material creature, but rather to the gift of the spirit presence of the Universal Father in the exalted gift of the Thought Adjusters to the humble. creatures of the universes.

Thought Adjusters possess countless qualities; Since analyzing them one by one would take us a long time, let me just name them:

1. They are divine in nature.
2. They are absolute within the potentialities of their fragmented nature.
3. They are not created, but fragmented (absolute fragments of Deity).
4. They are prepersonal (before personality).
5. They possess mind, will, courage and wisdom.
6. They take on the personality of the human in which they reside.
7. They are called the pilot light of the evolutionary human.
8. They are pure spirits and pure energy.
9. They are full of love for the human where they reside and full of wisdom to lead the human mind and soul towards the Universal Father.

So can we really understand the true meaning of an Adjuster indwelling us? Can we really imagine what it means to have an absolute fragment of absolute and infinite Deity, the Universal Father, residing in us and fused with our finite mortal nature? When mortal man merges with an actual fragment of the existential Cause of the total cosmos, no limit can be placed on the fate of such an unprecedented and unimaginable association. (<a id="a98_434"></a>[UB 107:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p4_7))

Let me now record verbatim the words that a Thought Adjuster delivered to the subject of his residence:

> During the making and breaking of a contact between the mortal mind of a destiny reservist and the planetary supervisors, sometimes the indwelling Adjuster is so situated that it becomes possible to transmit a message to the mortal partner. Not long since, on Urantia, such a message was transmitted by a self-acting Adjuster to the human associate, a member of the reserve corps of destiny. This message was introduced by these words: “And now, without injury or jeopardy to the subject of my solicitous devotion and without intent to overchastise or discourage, for me, make record of this my plea to him.” Then followed a beautifully touching and appealing admonition. Among other things, the Adjuster pleaded “that he more faithfully give me his sincere co-operation, more cheerfully endure the tasks of my emplacement, more faithfully carry out the program of my arrangement, more patiently go through the trials of my selection, more persistently and cheerfully tread the path of my choosing, more humbly receive credit that may accrue as a result of my ceaseless endeavors—thus transmit my admonition to the man of my indwelling. Upon him I bestow the supreme devotion and affection of a divine spirit.” (<a id="a102_1214"></a>[UB 110:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p7_10))

These last words are more than enough reason for all human beings, especially the readers of _The Urantia Book_, to try every day to commune with our Thought Adjuster, meditate on Him, feel Him in our minds and hearts, and ask him to direct our thoughts and daily activities towards the goal that He has set, so that He fulfills his mission, that of taking us along the path that leads to Paradise.

And finally, let us remember that the fruits of spiritual union with the Thought Adjuster are truth, beauty, and goodness, translated in the finite world into peace, love, service, and fellowship.
