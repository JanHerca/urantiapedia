## Poetry: In the light

_In the nebulous swarm of constellations,_
_Oh you who were born first,_
_O nurse of flowers and fruits, O Light,_
_White mother of visions,_

_You come to us from the sun through the soft veils_
_Floating vapors in the air:_
_Life then comes alive and, under your clear shiver,_
_Smile, oh daughter of the stars!_

_Hello! because before you things were not._
_Hello! sweet; hello! powerful._
_Hello! from my looks innocent driver_
_And adviser of my steps._

_By you are the divine colors and forms,_
_Through you, all that we love._
_You make the snow shine on the tops of the mountains,_
_You charm the edge of ravines._

_You make the hummingbirds bloom under the blue sky_
_In perfumes and dew;_
_And decent grace with you has arisen_
_On the things you cherish._

_The morning is joyful with your kind caresses;_
_You give sweetness to the nights,_
_In the woods the moving shadow and the soft thickness_
_What young tenderness seeks._

_Through you the deep sea has living flowers_
_And blond swimmers that you gild._
_In the still humid and pure sky, your meteors_
_Lend the brilliance of the seven colors._

_Light, it is through you that women are beautiful_
_Under your glorious garment;_
_And your dear lights, passing through their eyes,_
_Pour out new delights._

_Their ears make you an oriental throne_
_Where you shine in a gem,_
_And wherever you shine, you remain, you whom I love,_
_Virgo as on your birth day._

_Be my strength, O Light! and may my thoughts,_
_Beautiful and simple like you,_
_In grace and peace, unfold under your faith_
_Their shapes always rhythmic!_

_Give my happy eyes the ability to see for a long time to come,_
_In a serene pleasure,_
_Beauty standing up walking like a queen_
_Under your chaste golden crown._

_And, when in its bosom the Nature of things_
_Will shape my future destinies,_
_Come back to bathe, come back to nourish yourself with your pure waters_
_My new metamorphoses. (1844-1924)_
