The arid desert burns my eyes and my feet.
I move forward, the hot air projects mirages.
The wind at my back, my heart trapped
Secretly hopes to take a turn:
Through awareness, a new perspective
Let the burdens of the journey be carried away...
Suddenly, gushing after the rain
A carpet of flowers of all colors.
Amazed, I move forward for a new start!
I feel like a child
Eyes wide open.
Beauty was staring me in the face.
Back to the fears that cause so much havoc...
I kept moving forward and climbed a peak
Which fell sheer — it was a cliff.
On its edge an eagle, with which I identified.
I was waiting for the moment to be comfortable,
Because I knew the air could carry me.
I try my “wings”, then suddenly I take off
In the void, without vertigo, in complete confidence.
It wasn't a flight, I let myself be carried away
By the hot air currents; I went up, down
Contemplating new landscapes again and again.
My abandoned death drives became breeding ground.
They added a new color to universal beauty.
Doesn't life spring from death, from pain?
Imagination, creative impulse coordinated with reality
And I felt “light, light” like the “abandoned” bird.
Light and life — here and after!!

Octavia Jung
