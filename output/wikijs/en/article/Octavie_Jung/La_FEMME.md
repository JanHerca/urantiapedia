Origin, journey, outcome...

How to educate a nature?
A living nature with a view to growth.
What action is needed to become mature?
It depends on education.
For a plant, I choose the direction;
A tutor gives a new behavior...
Create living spaces,
Take off biological energy,
Take the environment into account...
Life is always movement, succession.
Broaden my astronomical approach.
I become in this action
Bearer of life and coordinator...

In a group, — acceleration!

Trust for collaboration in the One who lives within me.
Already biological life
Is necessary for thought, -psychic life,
Who must submit matter, energy
To tend towards the true life of the spirit.
We are helped by the qualities given.

It's a never-ending job...
How is thought installed?
Science is the basis of religion.
It prepares the framework for its operation:
Coordination of matter and spirit,
Organization of energies, Emergence of thought.
Both take their origin
In the divine source...
Exploitation by life carriers
In biology, psychology, philosophy, sociology
By their great capacity for thought.
Unify the worlds with divine energy.
It is our role and our dignity.
Always start with the facts, a discipline

Questioning myself about who I am,

And on my behavior too.
Look for their meaning...
Usefulness, their ability to reproduce.
We are the co-creators of our children;
Carriers of genes to be re-producers.
We are responsible for our civilization,
Productions, relationships;
This is part of the universe...
Our body speaks of origin and end

It took no less
Than an Adjuster
For energy and spirit to be united...
He is the channel, the partner
With the spirit of the Divine Mother.
From birth we are bipolar
In a universe of binarity.

I wonder, I question myself...
The answer is divine and good:
Conceive God, reveal Him
In time and space.
This leaves traces...

From the Father to Paradise,
Who functions in his Son and the Spirit.
Outside of its static abode
It moves to the associative, dynamic state:

From binarity comes the Trinity:
Three personalities, three events:
Kindness, Love, Mercy,
Customizing the Unit...
So in man, in his image: sexuality:
Father-Son, counterpart: the Spirit

Who is involved in the operation?
From this reality: love in action.
Both sexes:
- By the boy's sperm,
- The girl's egg is fertilized.
Practical in our established world.
This is the era of the Divine Minister
Who brings things to Supremacy,
Controlled by Michael, the Son - diplomacy...

Let us become cosmic thinkers:
One entry, one exit for a change:
- entry of sperm into the egg,
- emergence of a new being, wonder...
Realization of Wisdom in Space/Time.
Nothing stops him:
Begins spiritual growth to Supremacy.

The woman synthesizes this alchemy:
Goodness, Love, Truth
Become our reality...
The problem of women needs to be clarified.
The world is not defined by masculinity.
Freeing ourselves from the psychoegalitarian error.
Can a man become a “mother”?
The claim becomes disorganization.
Law is duty to enforce.

Kindness, love, service are to be experienced:
Feminine nature realizes what man is...
It transforms philosophical thought
In organic creature: energy, thought and spirit.
The man and the woman are coordinated:
Relationship of two non-identical natures;
Feminine nature achieves cosmic synthesis.
The divine can manifest itself:
Sharing creative power.
The idea becomes transformative;
To become God's cooperator.
Studying Wisdom in an unfinished world.
Knowledge comes to the fore
Of Man, to integrate him...
Combine the masculine and feminine soul.
Help our brother, listen to him.
Be solid to consolidate.

Feminine nature is intuitional
She sees the cosmic image as fulfillment.
The spiritualization of man and woman, — coordination;
Of Divine Wisdom, — the revelation.
Adam and Eve delayed the installation.
Adjust all parental functions.
Promote beauty, educate...
The Truth of Life is openness to universality.

Prepare major roads;
The hardware highway is essential:
Bi-polarity in divine Wisdom;
A basic, archetypal truth.

Man and woman unite with the Adjuster
- in a masculine way,
- in a feminine way.

Then Wisdom shines...
Other sons and daughters will come...
Duty of the couple to show their generosity:
Bring them together for his honor and their happiness...
