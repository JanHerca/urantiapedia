### A time for everything

For everything there is a time
A time to be born, a time to die,
A time to go, a time to come,
Another one is the time to love,
Time to work, to rest,
That of success, that of failures,
Time to learn, time to forget.
They say: Time is money...
Meanwhile, life goes to hell.
Time to live, that's what's important.
We live with the times or outside of the times,
Why talk about the weather all the time?
Everything in its time, rain or shine,
Time to laugh or time to cry,
The time for regrets is stolen time.
What to do with your time if not live it,
To live life to the fullest every moment,
To appreciate all the moments that pass,
To see what is beautiful, the grace of life
And to go his way, taking his time.
Then it's time to retire,
Time to enjoy every moment
Of an earthly life that is getting ready
To exchange limited time
Against the promise of eternity

Rene Haldi


### The Time

<p style="text-align:center;">
Time passes, time flies,<br>
Time flies with the night,<br>
The night of time meets the present<br>
Which goes away taking all its time.<br>
<br>
The past, like a memory<br>
With the present comes unity;<br>
This union that nothing separates<br>
This is the future of our life.<br>
<br>
The past, the present, the future;<br>
None of this lasts:<br>
The past is no longer there,<br>
The present is only passing<br>
And the future is never present.<br>
Time is lost in the now of Eternity.<br>
</p>

### Prayer

<p style="text-align:center;">
May Your Word guide me<br>
Throughout this day,<br>
May I be vigilant, watching over my thoughts,<br>
Letting nothing in that could tarnish them<br>
And spending my moments praying, blessing,<br>
Ready to listen to Your voice, to refuse doubt<br>
I trust in You, and I fear nothing.<br>
In Your love, hidden, divine protection,<br>
My soul will be filled with blessings.<br>
</p>

Rene Haldi
