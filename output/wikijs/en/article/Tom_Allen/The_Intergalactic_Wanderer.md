A Hypothesis on the Location of Uversa

By Tom Allen (U.S.A)

Fall 2019

## Introduction

The hypothesis I wish to present is that Uversa is located in the globular cluster NGC 2419 which is in or near “**this great solar cluster**”—the physical and astronomical center of the seventh space segment of the superuniverse.

The “**Verification Triad**” is a research technique I use to create frameworks of the universe with a lower degree of error. This research model helps validate all aspects of the truth that we have.

1. **Epochal Revelation — The Urantia Papers**
2. **Early 20th Century Science Historical Facts (circa 1880-1935)**
3. **Current Science — Hypotheses and Facts**

> “_Even in the study of man’s biologic evolution on Urantia, there are grave objections to the exclusive historic approach to his present-day status and his current problems. The true perspective of any reality problem—human or divine, terrestrial or cosmic—can be had only by the full and unprejudiced study and correlation of three phases of universe reality: origin, history, and destiny. The proper understanding of these three experiential realities affords the basis for a wise estimate of the current status._” (<a id="a54_520"></a>[UB 19:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/19#p1_6))

> Your world, Urantia, is one of many similar inhabited planets which comprise the local universe of *Nebadon.* This universe, together with similar creations, makes up the superuniverse of *Orvonton,* from whose capital, Uversa, our commission hails. Orvonton is one of the seven evolutionary superuniverses of time and space which circle the never-beginning, never-ending creation of divine perfection—the central universe of *Havona.* At the heart of this eternal and central universe is the stationary Isle of Paradise, the geographic center of infinity and the dwelling place of the eternal God. (<a id="a56_602"></a>[UB 0:0.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p0_5))

Only when the three aspects of origin, history, and destiny are thoroughly analyzed, criticized, synthesized, and unified can the frameworks of the universe develop with lesser degrees of error.

## Four hypotheses on the Orvonton Scale

Here are four hypotheses about the Orvonton dimension that I present to clarify my theory about the location of Uversa. It is not important that you agree with me, but simply that you understand where I am coming from in formulating my hypothesis about Uversa. Suspend your disbelief if you do not agree with the model I have presented. I know that my framework is more or less flawed.

To understand the basis of my conclusions about the location of Uversa, it is important to have a preliminary understanding of what I assume to be the Orvonton dimension. For an in-depth study on this obscure subject, see my book: “**The Great Orvonton Scale Debate — A Critical Study of the Cosmology of _The Urantia Book_**”. It is available on Amazon. My Vimeo on the Orvonton dimension can be found here: https://vimeo.com/343356366

## First hypothesis:

The Milky Way is the only part of the seventh superuniverse space segment that is organized and partially inhabited.

## Second Hypothesis:

The inhabited Milky Way is called “Orvonton”. Only the part of the vast superuniverse space segment that is organized and partially inhabited is called “Orvonton”. The name “Orvonton” refers only to the inhabited and organized part of the Milky Way.

## Third hypothesis:

The Local Cluster constitutes the seventh superuniverse space segment. The Local Cluster has a diameter of 20 million lys (Lys = light years), while the diameter of Orvonton — the Milky Way — is relatively small (200,000 lys).

## FOURTH HYPOTHESIS:

The architectural plan is to accrete all these local clusters of galaxies into the Orvonton Milky Way over billions or trillions of years. The inhabited Milky Way, Orvonton, is the center of the space segment into which all these uninhabited galaxies of the local cluster will eventually merge, greatly expanding the possibilities for the development and evolution of Orvonton—the ever-expanding Milky Way.

## Historical and Current Facts

Historical facts and current science concerning NGC 2419 are presented here to find bases for comparative analysis and synthesis with the epochal revelation.

- It was discovered by William Herschel on December 31, 1788.
- It is estimated to contain a million stars spread over a spatial diameter of 400 light years.
- It is located near the galactic anticenter of Urantia in the constellation Lynx. (The anticenter is a direction in space directly opposite the galactic center from any position within the Milky Way Galaxy).
- It lies in the direction which crosses the dense diameter of the Milky Way — through the anticenter of Urantia in the constellation Lynx.
- It is one of the brightest, largest and most distant globular clusters surrounding the Milky Way. — The closest approach to Urantia at the perigee is 172,000 lilies.
- Harlow Shapley estimated the distance to NGC 2419 at 168,000 lys in 1922.
- Walter Baade estimated the distance in 1935 at 185,000 lilies.
- The radial velocity is $20 km / sec$ in our direction.
- It takes 3 billion years for NGC 2419 to orbit once above the pole of the Milky Way.
- NGC 2419 contains two distinct populations of red giant stars, one of which is exceptionally helium-rich. These stars orbit primarily in the center of the globular cluster.
- It has an elliptical orbit above the pole of the Milky Way.
- The current distance of NGC 2419 is estimated at 270,000 lys.
- The furthest distance from Urantia at apogee is 319,000 lilies.
- The average distance from Urantia is 245,000 lilies.

## The Four Urantia Book References to the Location of Uversa

1\.

> “_The Sagittarius sector and all other sectors and divisions of Orvonton are in rotation around Uversa, and some of the confusion of Urantian star observers arises out of the illusions and relative distortions produced by the following multiple revolutionary movements:_” (<a id="a116_275"></a>[UB 15:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p3_7))

> “_6. The whirl of the ten major sectors, the so-called star drifts, about the Uversa headquarters of Orvonton._” (<a id="a118_116"></a>[UB 15:3.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p3_13))

The ten major sectors of the Milky Way rotate “around” Uversa.

In this case, “around” is used as a preposition functioning as an adverb. This means that “around” translates to “in or somewhat near”

Example: I ride my bicycle around my neighborhood. “Around” means “in or somewhat near.” This is the same way this expression is used in (<a id="a124_138"></a>[UB 15:3.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p3_13)) The ten major sectors “swirl” around Uversa.

It takes about 250 million years for the Milky Way to complete one rotation. NGC 2419 orbits the pole of the Milky Way every 3 billion years. Thus, the Milky Way swirls about 12 times for every polar rotation of NGC 2419. This hypothetically means that these star trails in the large Orvonton sector are rotating and “swirling” near and around Uversa—NGC 2419.

2\.

> “_While each superuniverse government presides near the center of the evolutionary universes of its space segment, it occupies a world made to order and is peopled by accredited personalities. These headquarters worlds are architectural spheres, space bodies specifically constructed for their special purpose. While sharing the light of near-by suns, these spheres are independently lighted and heated. Each has a sun which gives forth light without heat, like the satellites of Paradise, while each is supplied with heat by the circulation of certain energy currents near the surface of the sphere. These headquarters worlds belong to one of the greater systems situated near the astronomical center of their respective superuniverses._” (<a id="a130_743"></a>[UB 15:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p7_1))

Uversa in NGC 2419 is “near” or adjacent to the center of the seventh superuniverse space segment.

NGC 2419 may provide many nearby suns with which to share light.

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/Le_Lien/images_03/038.jpg">
<figcaption>NGC 2419<br>NGC 2419 is a globular cluster located in the constellation Lynx. It was discovered by William Herschel on December 31, 1788. NGC 2419 is approximately 300,000 light-years from the solar system. (Another image at the end of the article)</figcaption>
</figure>

Near here means “not far” when we compare the diameter of the local layer of 20 million lilies to the diameter of 200,000 lilies of the Milky Way.

NGC 2419 is “one of the largest systems” surrounding the Milky Way.

3\.

> _1. *The Star Students,* the celestial astronomers, choose to work on spheres like Uversa because such specially constructed worlds are unusually favorable for their observations and calculations. Uversa is favorably situated for the work of this colony, not only because of its central location, but also because there are no gigantic living or dead suns near at hand to disturb the energy currents. These students are not in any manner organically connected with the affairs of the superuniverse; they are merely guests._ (<a id="a147_527"></a>[UB 30:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/30#p3_2))

Uversa is centrally located and is not near any living or dead suns.

Large groups of rotating red giant stars are found near the center of NGC 2419, so Uversa may have been built “near” the center of NGC 2419. It may be closer to the outskirts of the cluster and share light from nearby suns.

4\.

> The Satania system of inhabited worlds is far removed from Uversa and that great sun cluster which functions as the physical or astronomic center of the seventh superuniverse. From Jerusem, the headquarters of Satania, it is over two hundred thousand light-years to the physical center of the superuniverse of Orvonton, far, far away in the dense diameter of the Milky Way. Satania is on the periphery of the local universe, and Nebadon is now well out towards the edge of Orvonton. From the outermost system of inhabited worlds to the center of the superuniverse is a trifle less than two hundred and fifty thousand light-years. (<a id="a155_633"></a>[UB 32:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p2_11))

It is possible to assume from the first sentence that the word “and” separates the identification of Uversa from “this great cluster of suns” that functions as the physical or astronomical center. Cars and trucks, boys and girls, are examples of this separation. “And” can separate categories while grouping them together. One interpretation of this quote indicates that Uversa and this great solar cluster both refer to the same thing: more than 200,000 lilies of Satania. The second interpretation is that Uversa and this great solar cluster are separate and that they are both distant from Satania. Uversa, like NGC 2419, is close to the center in each interpretation.

However, the next sentence states that the physical center is more than 200,000 lilies away. If the central bulge of the Milky Way is “this great cluster of suns,” then Uversa, as NGC 2419, is considered the physical center of power control for the material evolution of the superuniverse. A thousand third-order power centers operate gravita circuits from Uversa. (<a id="a164_366"></a>[UB 15:8.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p8_2)) This makes Uversa, as NGC 2419, the physical center of power control for the superuniverse near “this great cluster of suns” at the center of the Milky Way bulge that functions as the astronomical and gravitational center of the seventh space segment of the superuniverse.

NGC 2419 like Uversa is supposed to be near the barycenter of the local sheet, which I assume is the extent of the seventh section of our superuniverse. The playing field of the seventh superuniverse is large. Uversa, like NGC 2419, is described as being “near the center,” “central,” and “astronomical center.” Uversa is “near” or close to “that great solar cluster” which is the physical or astronomical center of the superuniverse. That great solar cluster can be conceived of as being just NGC 2419 or the central bulge of the Milky Way.

The barycenter of the local sheet is not known, and has not been scientifically examined by current astronomy. It is not close to being known. The fact that NGC 2419 is close to the barycenter of the local sheet is purely hypothetical but corresponds well to my model.

The anticenter passing through Urantia is equivalent to the direction “in the dense diameter of the Milky Way” towards NGC 2419. It is reasonable to assume that Jerusem is also in this direction.

The average distance to NGC 2419 is 245,000 lys. This distance can be considered to be “greater” than 200,000 lys.

The “furthest system” is probably in Nebadon, since the phrase refers to Nebadon last. Thus, the furthest system in Nebadon is a little less than 250,000 lilies from Uversa. This may be a clue, the hypothesis of which is a comparison of the average distance of a near and outermost system in Nebadon to the average distance from Jerusem to Uversa. The revelators may have wanted to average the distances of these two systems in order to reveal future distance calculations by triangulation. Thus, these two systems may be separated by only a few thousand lilies. This may easily be of the order of the extent of incomplete Nebadon. Future relatively precise light-year measurements of the boundaries of Satania and Nebadon have yet to be calculated, since they will not be revealed at this time.

## Conclusions

Unless we think that the figures given in the Urantia Papers are not exact or are only analogies to the true values, we all agree that Uversa is more than 200,000 lys away. Whether the model for calculating the size of Orvonton is similar to mine or different, this fact remains the same.

The average distance of NGC 2419 from Urantia is 245,000 lys. I suppose this average distance is called "greater than 200,000 lys\%. The revelators could not reveal the true distance of NGC 2419 because Shapley and Baade measured it at less than 200,000 lys. Knowing that modern science would eventually discover a more accurate distance from NGC 2419, the only clue they gave us was that this distance is greater than 200,000 lys. In doing so, they gave us the opportunity to gather all this data that will one day allow us to discover the truth about the true distance of NGC 2419.

These data and speculations agree in many ways with my Orvonton scale model. Here are my conclusions:

- The physical control center of the Orvonton superuniverse is “in the dense diameter,” meaning it is in the direction of the Lynx anticenter toward NGC 2419.
- Depending on how revelators interpret the word “and,” this large solar cluster is considered to be either NGC 2419, the central bulge of the Milky Way, or both.
- The Milky Way is closest to being at the center of the local sheet.
- The average distance from Urantia is 245,000 lilies, or more than 200,000 lilies.
- Just under 250,000 lilies is the average distance to the “furthest system in Nebadon.” These two systems could be relatively close to each other.
- Uversa rotates in an ellipse “around” and “near” the ten main sectors of the stellar trails which rotate in the Milky Way.
- The apparently near-central position of our Local Group in the Local Sheet gives some credence to the possibility that Uversa in NGC 2419 is close to the barycenter of our space segment.

There are many problems to be solved, which have taken a long time and could advance this type of research, such as the light-year distances of Satania and Nebadon. Proper motions and more accurate velocities of galaxies in the local sheet could help clarify many problems. Calculations of correct motions currently unavailable are a future discovery, but future Urantia astronomers will discover them. At present, barring a revelation, this is not yet understandable.


## Addendum:

It would not have been possible to arrive at this conclusion without the most recent research by Massar, and others. If my hypothesis is correct, then I can say that it would have been a stroke of luck for anyone to arrive at the same conclusion without this newer, more precise science. Again, if I am correct, then I believe I have exhausted many aspects of truth and fact using the Triad of Verification. More precise distance measurements can strengthen or weaken my arguments. Other possibilities for measurements relative to Uversa can be presented with a lesser degree of error. I may be on the wrong horse, but my passion for these matters concerning God's beautiful universe keeps me curious. We depend on history, direct revelation, and more precise modern science to confirm our conclusions or to steer our errors in a more correct direction.

As believers and followers of the Urantia revelation, we are compelled by a God-given sense of curiosity to clarify the truth in our sincere attempt to unify reality. We must decipher and interpret the English usage and language of The Urantia Book; we must couple the epochal revelation and its outsized revealed cosmology with twentieth-century astronomy; we must study current science and seek to couple it with the epochal revelation. This triad of verification and study will ultimately bring great insight into reality. We humans have not been given a revelation beyond our means of comprehension. Otherwise, we would be deprived of vigorous thought and spiritual progress. It would be a cosmic tyranny for celestial beings to reveal more than present civilization can comprehend. Our imaginations would be stifled.

It is our responsibility to pursue this vigorous passion by studying Causality, to live ethical and moral lives as Duty, and to come to worship God deeply and fruitfully. We must delight in cultivating courageous and independent cosmic thinking. “But it is sad to note that so few on Urantia delight in cultivating these qualities of courageous and independent cosmic thinking.” (<a id="a201_380"></a>[UB 16:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_9)) Let us pray that we may be so courageous and that we may bring this joy of curiosity and deep thinking to others.

Thank you, Father and Mother. And thank you to all the ministers and administrators who have undertaken the task of providing advanced truth to our generation.
