The Progressive Divine Wisdom Group of Dakar is made up of truth seekers, who seek to perpetuate and share the teachings received from their educator, Moussa Ndiaye since 1973.

The latter had received a copy of “The Cosmogony of Urantia” from Jacques Vesses in the sixties. After studying it for two years, he undertook to create a group of young people, mostly students, with a majority of women at the beginning. He led this question-and-answer group, until the students asked for structured teaching, to better know and live the Divine Wisdom that they sensed through these exchanges.

Thus was born the Progressive Divine Wisdom Group of Dakar. The oldest members, who received training from Moussa, and welcomed more than thirty individual readers from Europe, the Americas and Africa, between 2000 and 2020, have undertaken since 2019 to share and perpetuate this educational approach.

After having organized two meetings called “Dakar Summit”, in 2018 and 2019, with the participation of readers of The Urantia Book, (Guy Perron, Gaétan and Line Charland from Canada as well as Agnès Lazare and Aurore Hennebert from Belgium), the five oldest members undertook to reactivate and share the teachings and the pedagogical approach, which they received, on a planetary scale.

Thanks to the pandemic and the lockdown in 2020, the Social Group which met every day for three months, with Africans, Europeans, Canadians and other members, expressed the need to receive the teachings of Progressive Divine Wisdom. Which has since started, in the form of a regular zoom session. Below are summarized the highlights of the third activity report of the Dakar GSDP.

The results of the GSDP activities, available in the 2022 activity report, can be summarized as follows:

1. Twelve students in Progressive Divine Wisdom from nine different nationalities (Senegal, Congo, Ivory Coast, France, Canada, Guinea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Chad) are on the way to becoming future educators, and several others have confirmed their commitment to this end.
2. Thanks to the active support of partners and members, the GSDP has formed a Limited Liability Company and has created an online site for information relating to the promotion of the training method and the organization of the training itself. To date, several people are already ready to begin the training, according to the presentation made on the site: https://sagessedivine.com. The site traces the entire history, in text and images, of the Progressive Dine Wisdom Group, from its beginnings in the seventies to the present day. You can consult the site and send us your comments to the following address: Gsdp@sagessedivine.com
3. In total, over the past two years, 53 people, men and women, from 16 countries and 3 continents, have received, on a regular basis, teachings of Progressive Divine Wisdom in 2022. Among them, 12 are expected to share this teaching as future educators. Among this number of people who have received training, there are 17 women, and 36 men, i.e. a ratio of 32% women.
4. The prospects for collaboration with associations invested in promoting the revelations of The Urantia Book are real, as are those concerning more active involvement.
