> “Of God, the most inescapable of all presences, the most real of all facts, the most living of all truths, the most loving of all friends, and the most divine of all values, we have the right to be the most certain of all universe experiences.” (_The Urantia Book_, [UB 102:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p7_10))

At IC 93, everyone met in Ste. Hyacinth, near the beautiful bluffs of Montreal. Before that, on the high peaks at Snowmass in Colorado, and before that, in the pine forests of Bowdoin College in Maine. Now it's time for readers of _The Urantia Book_ to celebrate their “Living Faith” at IC 96 in Flagstaff, Arizona, in the midst of the San Francisco mountain range.

The International Conference has been scheduled August 3 through 8, 1996, at the campus of Northern Arizona University.

Attendance at previous international conferences has varied from 850 in Montreal to more than 1,000 in Snowmass, the largest gathering of readers from around the world to date.

“We will be mailing postcards with beautiful artwork to ensure publicity for the conference,” says Janet Farrington, Vice President of the Fellowship, who is in charge of IC 96. “As a result of these efforts, we expect as many as 1,500 people.”

The theme of Living Faith is to share ideas regarding integration of the revelation into daily life. Variations of the theme which will be developed are Cosmic Family, Global Family, Human Family and Faith Family. “Each day we will study a topic by listening to presentations from some of the most innovative thinkers from around the world and by opening dialogue between readers with a wide range of experience,” Farrington says.

Plenary sessions with guest speakers will be offered in the morning followed by dialogue groups in the afternoon. As an alternative to the afternoon sessions, activities for the whole family will be available, including games, sports, music, art, hiking and horseback riding.

Afternoon dialogue sessions are open for presentation by any individuals who would like to request a track.

“The community of readers is a broad collection of individuals with unique ideas,” says Farrington. “We welcome the diversity and depend upon your presentation of new thinking to the community. We will strive for balance. Consider this your invitation.”

Anyone interested in facilitating an afternoon session is invited to submit a brief proposal to The Fellowship (see end of article for contact information).

Evenings will be devoted to worship experiences followed by the everpopular Club UB. “Club UB will feature a house band and our best talent,” Farrington says.

Special events planned at IC 96 are:

- A pre-conference retreat for artists, musicians and writers
- A pre-conference acclimatizing retreat for those challenged by high mountain air (at an altitude of 7,000 feet)
- An International Readers' Lounge, with a computer lab where individuals can 'Surf the Net.'
- Art Gallery and Publications Room
- A Secondary Works Store
- A 24-hour Worship Room

The children's program, for youth to age 12 , will feature an interactive environment exploring the home life of Jesus, the planet's earliest inhabitants and the stars.

Teenagers can look forward to the challenge of a Ropes Course, an overnight campout and personal quest, and their own Teen Lounge. “One of the most exciting additions to this International Conference is the expansion of the program for teens,” says Farrington.

The conference will conclude in the down-home spirit of the West with a country fair. “We'll have music, dancing, treats, booths, clowns, balloons and a host of interesting people to talk with,” Farrington says.
