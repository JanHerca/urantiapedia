- To be in the world is to feel incomplete.
- Completion will take place at some unknown future date.
- Names of permanence will be bestowed illuminating one’s true inner nature.
- Fusion with the fragment of God within will be accomplished.
- The two will become as one.
- It will be a time of great rejoicing, wonder an accomplishment.

What an incredible adventure awaits us!
When we awake from our earthly slumber, we will have a new and more perfect body.
- It will be perfect in design, form, and function.
- Our new bodies will better express the inner quality of our being.
- That quality of being that God gives each of us will be made more plain.
- Love and brotherhood will replace fear and suspicion.
- Your neighbor will be your friend; your friend, your neighbor.
- No more will you hear the cries of those in mourning, nor those in pain.
- Laughter and optimism will conquer self-absorption and pessimism.
- These negative, immature emotions will no longer loom as a spiritual plague.
- The fruits of the spiritual life will surround you, and you shall want for naught.
- Experiences with brilliant and charming beings will challenge your every belief.
- Your senses will grow in number.
- Those you had before will become ever more acute.
- You will find delight in doing the will of God.
- God’s will becomes your will.
- Only then will we experience completion in potential.
- Final personality, destiny of attainment.
