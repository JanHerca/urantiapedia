## The Personality of the Universal Father

- The Universal Father is truly a personality, notwithstanding that the infinity of his person places him forever beyond the full comrehension of finite beings.
- God is much more than the highest human conception of personality. He cannot be less than eternal, infinite, true, beautiful, and good.
- The immensity and grandeur of the divine personality is beyond the grasp of the unperfected mind of mortal man. Man must know God through his creations and through the revelations of his Sons.
- God is personality. Without him there would be no personality.
- As a personality, God can be known, love and be loved.
- Doubt not the personality primacy of God and that he maintains personal connection with the countless hosts of his creation.
- Personality is not simply an attribute of God. It is the totality of God's coordinated infinite nature and the unified divine will, the revelation of God to the universes.
- The absolute perfection of God would cause him to suffer the awful limitations of unqualified finality of perfectness were it not for the fact that he participates directly in the struggles of his evolutionary creatures towards perfection.

## Personality in the Universe

- Human personality is the time-space image shadow cast by the divine Creator personality. No actuality can be adequatety comprehended by an examination of its shadow.
- Man views personality looking from the finite to the infinite. This view is enhanced as to human and divine personality by the bestowal life of the Creator Son.
- The concept of divine personality can be grasped only by the insight of religious experience.
- A loving personality can hardly reveal himself to a loveless person. Even to approach the knowing of a divine personality, all of a man's personality endowments must be wholly consecrated to the effort.
- The experience of a God-knowing person exists above and beyond all human controversy and logic.
- Throughout all of the stages of evolutionary growth, there is one part of you that remains unaltered, and that is personality— permanence in the presence of change.
- While devoid of identity, personality can unify the identily of any living energy-system.
- Personality is characterized by morality—awareness of relativity of relationship with other persons. It discerns conduct levels and choosingly discriminalos between them.
- Personality is uniquely conscious of time—and this is something other than time perception of mind or spirit.
- Personality can make a gift to God—dedication Of the free will to the doing of God's will.
- When the creature submits to the will of the Creator, he does not submerge or surrender his personality. By such union with divinity man exalts, enriches, spirituatizes, and unifies his evolving self.

## The Personality concept has Spiritual Value

- Only personalities can commune with each other.
- Man does not achieve communion with God as a drop of water in the ocean, but by progressive reciprocal spiritual communion and intelligent conformity to the divine will.
- Truth and beauty might exist in the absence of personality, but divine goodness is understandable only in relation to personality. Only a person can love and be loved.
- Ultimate universe reality cannot be grasped by mathematics, logic, or philosophy. Only the personal experience of faith sons of the Father can effect the spiritual realization of the personality of God.
- God is changeless in the midst of never ending change. Identity of personality, too, is changeless midst constant change of self and environment.
- The higher concepts of universo personality imply: identity, self consciousness, self-will, the possibility of self-revelation, and also imply the possibility of fellowship.
- Individuality of personality in association with the concept or unity implies time-space transcendence by the Ultimacy of Deity.
