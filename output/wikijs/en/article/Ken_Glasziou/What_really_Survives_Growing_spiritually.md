Spirituality can be “felt” within. It cannot be defined. What spirituality is, what spirituality means, the spiritual value or content of any thought, words, or action, all of these must grow upon us as we consume and digest what is revealed to us about spirituality. Patience, and familiarity with the Urantia Papers’ content are keys to understanding spirituality.

> The Papers inform us: “The Thought Adjuster will recall and rehearse for you only those memories and experiences which are a part of, and essential to, your universe career. . . .But much of your past life and its memories, having neither spiritual meaning nor morontia value, will perish with the material brain; much of material experience will pass away as onetime scaffolding which, having bridged you over to the morontia level, no longer serves a purpose in the universe.” (<a id="a38_482"></a>[UB 112:5.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_22))

From a personal viewpoint, our Urantia career will have been a total waste if all we take with us is the “faintest flicker of faith” that gave us the chance to begin all over in a morontia career. Rarely would even one whit of our earthly career have had spiritual value and scarcely a single memory of mortal life would be likely to survive.

From a worldly viewpoint, our exposure to the Urantia Revelation will also have been wasted—for unless that exposure is the catalyst for a quantum shift in ourselves from an existence dominated by matter and materialism to one dominated by the spirituality of our very being, then we will have failed our Urantian brothers and sisters in their desperate need to know the God that has been made known to us.

> “Now, mistake not, my Father will ever respond to the faintest flicker of faith. He takes note of the physical and superstitious emotions of the primitive man. . . .But you who have been called out of darkness into the light are expected to believe with a whole heart; your faith shall dominate the combined attitudes of body, mind, and spirit.” (<a id="a44_349"></a>[UB 155:6.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p6_17))

In an article in the previous issue of Innerface we explored quotations from the Papers that provide an insight into what “spiritual meanings and values” actually are. Those that follow were selected with the hope they would assist devotees in their quest to become more spiritual.

> “. . . the spiritual experience (having realized God) demands that man find him and sincerely strive to be like him.” (<a id="a48_121"></a>[UB 5:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p5_1))

> “When man fails to discriminate the ends of his mortal striving, he finds himself functioning on the animal level of existence. He has failed to avail himself of the superior advantages of that material acumen, moral discrimination, and spiritual insight which are an integral part of his cosmic-mind endowment as a personal being.” (<a id="a50_336"></a>[UB 16:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p7_5))

> “Spiritual insight. The brotherhood of man is, after all, predicated on the recognition of the fatherhood of God. The quickest way to realize the brotherhood of man on Urantia is to effect the spiritual transformation of present-day humanity. The only technique for accelerating the natural trend of social evolution is that of applying spiritual pressure from above, thus augmenting moral insight while enhancing the soul capacity of every mortal to understand and love every other mortal.” (<a id="a52_495"></a>[UB 52:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p6_7))

> “But there is also a domain of prayer wherein the intellectually alert and spiritually progressing individual attains more or less contact with the superconscious levels of the human mind, the domain of the indwelling Thought Adjuster. In addition, there is a definite spiritual phase of true prayer which concerns its reception and recognition by the spiritual forces of the universe, and which is entirely distinct from all human and intellectual association.” (<a id="a54_466"></a>[UB 91:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p2_6))

> “The psychic and spiritual concomitants of the prayer of faith are immediate, personal, and experiential. There is no other technique whereby every man, regardless of all other mortal accomplishments, can so effectively and immediately approach the threshold of that realm wherein he can communicate with his Maker, where the creature contacts with the reality of the Creator, with the indwelling Thought Adjuster.” (<a id="a56_419"></a>[UB 91:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p6_7))

> “Habits which favor religious growth embrace cultivated sensitivity to divine values, recognition of religious living in others, reflective meditation on cosmic meanings, worshipful problem solving, sharing one’s spiritual life with one’s fellows, avoidance of selfishness, refusal to presume on divine mercy, living as in the presence of God.” (<a id="a58_348"></a>[UB 100:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p1_8))

> “Spiritual development depends, first, on the maintenance of a living spiritual connection with true spiritual forces and, second, on the continuous bearing of spiritual fruit: yielding the ministry to one’s fellows of that which has been received from one’s spiritual benefactors. Spiritual progress is predicated on intellectual recognition of spiritual poverty coupled with the self-consciousness of perfection-hunger, the desire to know God and be like him, the wholehearted purpose to do the will of the Father in heaven.” (<a id="a60_531"></a>[UB 100:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p2_1))

> “The goal of human self-realization should be spiritual, not material. The only realities worth striving for are divine, spiritual, and eternal.” (<a id="a62_149"></a>[UB 100:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p2_6))

> “. . . faith is always triumphant over doubting, for faith is both positive and living. The positive always has the advantage over the negative, truth over error, experience over theory, spiritual realities over the isolated facts of time and space. The convincing evidence of this spiritual certainty consists in the social fruits of the spirit which such believers, faithers, yield as a result of this genuine spiritual experience. Said Jesus: ‘If you love your fellows as I have loved you, then shall all men know that you are my disciples.’” (<a id="a64_549"></a>[UB 102:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p6_7))

> “The realization of the recognition of spiritual values is an experience which is superideational. There is no word in any human language which can be employed to designate this “sense,” “feeling,” “intuition,” or “experience” which we have elected to call God-consciousness. The spirit of God that dwells in man is not personal—the Adjuster is prepersonal—but this Monitor presents a value, exudes a flavor of divinity, which is personal in the highest and infinite sense.” (<a id="a66_478"></a>[UB 103:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p1_6))

> “Religion (the truth of personal spiritual experience) is founded on the inherent (Thought Adjuster) assumption that faith is valid, that God can be known and attained.” (<a id="a68_173"></a>[UB 103:9.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p9_8))

> “(Adjuster) fusion depends on yet other greater and more sublime spiritual achievements, upon the attainment of a final and complete attunement of the mortal will with the will of God as it is resident in the Thought Adjuster.” (<a id="a70_231"></a>[UB 110:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p7_1))

> Immanuel to Michael: “In all that you may perform on the world of your bestowal, bear constantly in mind that you are living a life for the instruction and edification of all your universe. You are bestowing this life of mortal incarnation upon Urantia, but you are to live such a life for the spiritual inspiration of every human and superhuman intelligence that has lived, now exists, or may yet live on every inhabited world which has formed.. . . ”(<a id="a72_455"></a>[UB 120:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p2_7))

> “To see God—by faith—means to acquire true spiritual insight. And spiritual insight enhances Adjuster guidance, and these in the end augment God-consciousness. And when you know the Father, you are confirmed in the assurance of divine sonship, and you can increasingly love each of your brothers in the flesh, not only as a brother—with brotherly love—but also as a father—with fatherly affection.” (<a id="a74_402"></a>[UB 140:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p5_13))

> “Verily, verily, I say to you, he who rules his own self is greater than he who captures a city. Self-mastery is the measure of man’s moral nature and the indicator of his spiritual development. In the old order you fasted and prayed; as the new creature of the rebirth of the spirit, you are taught to believe and rejoice. In the Father’s kingdom you are to become new creatures; old things are to pass away; behold I show you how all things are to become new. And by your love for one another you are to convince the world that you have passed from bondage to liberty, from death into life everlasting.” (<a id="a76_609"></a>[UB 143:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p2_3))

> “By the old way you seek to suppress, obey, and conform to the rules of living; by the new way you are first transformed by the Spirit of Truth and thereby strengthened in your inner soul by the constant spiritual renewing of your mind, and so are you endowed with the power of the certain and joyous performance of the gracious, acceptable, and perfect will of God. Forget not—it is your personal faith in the exceedingly great and precious promises of God that ensures your becoming partakers of the divine nature. Thus by your faith and the spirit’s transformation, you become in reality the temples of God, and his spirit actually dwells within you. If, then, the spirit dwells within you, you are no longer bondslaves of the flesh but free and liberated sons of the spirit. The new law of the spirit endows you with the liberty of self-mastery in place of the old law of the fear of self-bondage and the slavery of self-denial.” (<a id="a78_937"></a>[UB 143:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p2_4))

> “Worship—contemplation of the spiritual—must alternate with service, contact with material reality. Work should alternate with play; religion should be balanced by humor. Profound philosophy should be relieved by rhythmic poetry. The strain of living—the time tension of personality—should be relaxed by the restfulness of worship. The feelings of insecurity arising from the fear of personality isolation in the universe should be antidoted by the faith contemplation of the Father and by the attempted realization of the Supreme.” (<a id="a80_536"></a>[UB 143:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p7_3))

> “Worship is intended to anticipate the better life ahead and then to reflect these new spiritual significances back onto the life which now is. Prayer is spiritually sustaining, but worship is divinely creative.” (<a id="a82_216"></a>[UB 143:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p7_5))

> “Worship is the technique of looking to the One for the inspiration of service to the many. Worship is the yardstick which measures the extent of the soul’s detachment from the material universe and its simultaneous and secure attachment to the spiritual realities of all creation.” (<a id="a84_286"></a>[UB 143:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p7_6))

> “Prayer is self-reminding—sublime thinking; worship is self-forgetting—superthinking. Worship is effortless attention, true and ideal soul rest, a form of restful spiritual exertion.” (<a id="a86_187"></a>[UB 143:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p7_7))

> “Prayer is entirely a personal and spontaneous expression of the attitude of the soul toward the spirit; prayer should be the communion of sonship and the expression of fellowship. Prayer, when indited by the spirit, leads to co-operative spiritual progress. The ideal prayer is a form of spiritual communion which leads to intelligent worship. True praying is the sincere attitude of reaching heavenward for the attainment of your ideals.” (<a id="a88_444"></a>[UB 144:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p2_2))

> “The spiritual level. And then last, but greatest of all, we attain the level of spirit insight and spiritual interpretation which impels us to recognize in this rule of life the divine command to treat all men as we conceive God would treat them. That is the universe ideal of human relationships. And this is your attitude toward all such problems when your supreme desire is ever to do the Father’s will. I would, therefore, that you should do to all men that which you know I would do to them in like circumstances.” (<a id="a90_524"></a>[UB 147:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p4_9))

> “It is not the mental immaturity of the child that I commend to you but rather the spiritual simplicity of such an easy-believing and fully-trusting little one. It is not so important that you should know about the fact of God as that you should increasingly grow in the ability to feel the presence of God.” (<a id="a92_312"></a>[UB 155:6.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p6_12))

> “In the kingdom of the believing brotherhood of God-knowing truth lovers, this golden rule takes on living qualities of spiritual realization on those higher levels of interpretation which cause the mortal sons of God to view this injunction of the Master as requiring them so to relate themselves to their fellows that they will receive the highest possible good as a result of the believer’s contact with them. This is the essence of true religion: that you love your neighbor as yourself.” (<a id="a94_496"></a>[UB 180:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p5_7))

> “But the highest realization and the truest interpretation of the golden rule consists in the consciousness of the spirit of the truth of the enduring and living reality of such a divine declaration. The true cosmic meaning of this rule of universal relationship is revealed only in its spiritual realization, in the interpretation of the law of conduct by the spirit of the Son to the spirit of the Father that indwells the soul of mortal man. And when such spirit-led mortals realize the true meaning of this golden rule, they are filled to overflowing with the assurance of citizenship in a friendly universe, and their ideals of spirit reality are satisfied only when they love their fellows as Jesus loved us all, and that is the reality of the realization of the love of God.” (<a id="a96_786"></a>[UB 180:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p5_8))

> “This same philosophy of the living flexibility and cosmic adaptability of divine truth to the individual requirements and capacity of every son of God, must be perceived before you can hope adequately to understand the Master’s teaching and practice of nonresistance to evil. The Master’s teaching is basically a spiritual pronouncement. Even the material implications of his philosophy cannot be helpfully considered apart from their spiritual correlations. The spirit of the Master’s injunction consists in the nonresistance of all selfish reaction to the universe, coupled with the aggressive and progressive attainment of righteous levels of true spirit values: divine beauty, infinite goodness, and eternal truth—to know God and to become increasingly like him.” (<a id="a98_772"></a>[UB 180:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p5_9))

> “Then, John, give up your intolerance and learn to love men as I have loved you. Devote your life to proving that love is the greatest thing in the world. It is the love of God that impels men to seek salvation. Love is the ancestor of all spiritual goodness, the essence of the true and the beautiful.” (<a id="a100_307"></a>[UB 192:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p2_1))

> “In religion, Jesus advocated and followed the method of experience, even as modern science pursues the technique of experiment. We find God through the leadings of spiritual insight, but we approach this insight of the soul through the love of the beautiful, the pursuit of truth, loyalty to duty, and the worship of divine goodness. But of all these values, love is the true guide to real insight.” (<a id="a102_404"></a>[UB 195:5.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p5_14))
