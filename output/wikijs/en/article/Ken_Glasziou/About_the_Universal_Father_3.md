> Even though material mortals cannot see the person of God, they should rejoice in the assurance that he is a person; by faith accept the truth which portrays that the Universal Father so loved the world as to provide for the eternal spiritual progression of its lowly inhabitants; that he “delights in his children.” God is lacking in none of those superhuman and divine attributes which constitute a perfect, eternal, loving, and infinite Creator personality. 
> 
> . . . If the faith of the creature were perfect, he would assuredly know that when he had seen a Creator Son he had seen the Universal Father; **in seeking for the Father he would not ask nor expect to see other than the Son.** Mortal man simply cannot see God until he achieves completed spirit transformation and actually attains Paradise.
> 
> The natures of the Paradise Creator Sons do not encompass all the unqualified potentials of the universal absoluteness of the infinite nature of the First Source and Center, but the Universal Father is in every way divinely present in the Creator Sons. The Father and the Sons are one. The Paradise Sons of the order of Michael are perfect personalities, even **the pattern for all local universe personality** from that of the Bright and Morning Star **down to the lowest human creature** of progressing animal evolution.
> 
> Without God and his great and central person, there would be no personality throughout all the vast universe of universes. _God is personality_.
> 
> Notwithstanding that God is an eternal power, a majestic presence, a transcendent ideal, and a glorious spirit, though he is all of these and infinitely more, nonetheless, he is truly and everlastingly a perfect Creator personality, a person who “can know and be known,” who can “love and be loved,” and one who can befriend us; while you can be known, as other humans have been known, **as the friend of God**. He is a real spirit and a spiritual reality.
> 
> As we see the Universal Father revealed throughout his universe; as we discern him indwelling his myriads of creatures; as we behold him in the persons of his Sovereign Sons; as we continue to sense his divine presence here and there, near and afar, let us not doubt nor question his personal primacy. Notwithstanding all these far-flung distributions, he remains a true person and everlastingly maintains personal connection with the countless hosts of his creatures scattered throughout the universe of universes.
> 
> The idea of the personality of the Universal Father is an enlarged and truer concept of God which has come to mankind chiefly through revelation. Reason, wisdom, and religious experience all infer and imply the personality of God, but they do not altogether validate it. Even the indwelling Thought Adjuster is prepersonal. **The truth and maturity of any religion is directly proportional to its concept of the infinite personality of God and to its grasp of the absolute unity of Deity.** The idea of a personal Deity becomes, then, the measure of religious maturity after religion has first formulated the concept of the unity of God.
> 
> Primitive religion has many personal gods and they were fashioned in the image of man. Revelation affirms the validity of the personality concept of God which is merely possible in the scientific concept of a First Cause and is only provisionally suggested in the philosophic idea of Universal Unity. Only by personality approach can any person begin to comprehend the unity of God. To deny the personality of the First Source and Center leaves one only the choice of two philosophic dilemmas: materialism or pantheism.
> 
> . . .
> 
> Personality is not simply an attribute of God; it rather stands for the totality of the co-ordinated infinite nature and the unified divine will which is exhibited in eternity and universality of perfect expression. Personality, in the supreme sense, is the revelation of God to the universe of universes. ((<a id="a54_310"></a>[UB 1:5.4-13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p5_4)))

> God is absolute letting-be, and letting-be is the ontological foundation of love. Letting-be is self-giving or self-spending, so that God's creative work is a work of love and self-giving, into which he has put himself. In so-far-as created beings themselves manifest creativity, love, self-giving, they tend to be like God. 
> &nbsp; &nbsp; John Macquarrie “_Principles of Christian Theology.”_

> The nature of God can best be understood by the revelation of the Father which Michael of Nebadon unfolded in his manifold teachings and in his superb mortal life in theflesh. The divine nature can also be better understood by man if he regards himself as a child of God and looks up to the Paradise Creator as a true spiritual Father.
