According to Urantia Paper 7, the divine plan of perfection attainment for us finite ascendant sons of God has three unique components. The first of these is listed as “The Plan of Progressive Attainment.” The second is “The Bestowal Plan.” And the third is “The Plan of Mercy Ministry.” (see <a id="a36_293"></a>[UB 7:4.4-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/7#p4_4))

**Why is Plan 2 “The bestowal of the Creator Sons” so important?**

> “2. The Bestowal Plan. The next universal plan is the great Father-revelation enterprise of the Eternal Son and his co-ordinate Sons. This is the proposal of the Eternal Son and consists of his bestowal of the Sons of God upon the evolutionary creations, there to personalize and factualize, to incarnate and **make real, the love of the Father and the mercy of the Son to the creatures of all universes**.” (<a id="a40_411"></a>[UB 7:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/7#p4_5))

**Jesus bestowal was 2000 years ago. Was it not enough?**

> “The apostles were unable to grasp the real meaning of the Master’s utterances regarding the kingdom. The subsequent **distortion of Jesus’ teachings, as they are recorded in the New Testament**, is because the concept of the gospel writers was colored by the belief that Jesus was then absent from the world for only a short time; that he would soon return to establish the kingdom in power and glory.” (<a id="a44_407"></a>[UB 170:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p2_10))

The disciples goofed about the second coming and badly messed up Jesus’ epochal revelation. **The real gospel is now contained in Part 4 of The Urantia Book**.

> “Jesus of Nazareth attained the full realization of this potential of spirit personality in human experience; therefore **his life of achieving the Father’s will becomes man’s most real and ideal revelation of the personality of God**.” (<a id="a48_240"></a>[UB 1:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p6_8))

> “Christian churches of the twentieth century stand as great, but wholly unconscious, obstacles to the immediate advance of **the real gospel—the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth**.” (<a id="a50_183"></a>[UB 195:10.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_8))

There is very little in the book’s Parts 1-3 to enlighten us on that second most important component of a unique plan for the ascendant sons of God—the great Father-revelation enterprise through the bestowal life of our Creator Son.

Surely then Part 4 must be that “**most real and ideal revelation**” referred to in Paper 1. (<a id="a54_94"></a>[UB 1:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p6_8)) And as that most important second section of the unique plan for our ascendant careers (Paper 7), is it not likely that Part 4 alone was “the real and ideal revelation” that the authors of the Urantia Papers were actually commissioned to provide?

This does not imply that Parts 1-3 are throw away material. They were essential for the training of the Forum and the Seventy, and they were epochal revelation for them. However if the task of rescuing the Fourth Epochal Revelation for mankind is to be accomplished through Part 4, then surely it must be published separately from Parts 1-3.

This is to prevent the confusion about apparent errors in the cosmology of those latter parts from carrying over onto, and hence stigmatizing Part 4, that which the Papers define as “the real and ideal revelation of the personality of God.”

> “What a transcendent service if, through this revelation, the Son of Man should be recovered from the tomb of traditional theology and be presented as the living Jesus to the church that bears his name, and to all other religions!” (<a id="a60_235"></a>[UB 196:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p1_2))

> Glory be to Godfor dappled things — 
> For skies of couple-color as a brindled cow; 
> For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim.

> To know the world, not love her is thy point, 
> She gives but little, nor that little long.
> _Edward Young_
