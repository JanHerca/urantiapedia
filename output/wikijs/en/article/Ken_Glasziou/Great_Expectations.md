Having the Urantia Papers, reading them, comprehending their message, and believing their revelatory truths, places enormous obligations upon those fortunate enough (or unfortunate enough, depending on your views) to have been recipients.

One such message is that we should love all men and women as our brothers and sisters in God’s earthly family. That knowledge places obligations on our shoulders but none on theirs. However the real expectations actually imposed upon recipients of the revelation far exceeds conventional views about loving our neighbor. We are expected to become:

## Ideal citizens

> “Sonship in the kingdom, from the standpoint of advancing civilization, should assist you in becoming the ideal citizens of the kingdoms of this world since brotherhood and service are the cornerstones of the gospel of the kingdom.” (<a id="a42_236"></a>[UB 178:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_4))

## Destroyers of hatred

> “The love call of the spiritual kingdom should prove to be the effective destroyer of the hate urge of the unbelieving and war-minded citizens of the earthly kingdoms.” (<a id="a46_172"></a>[UB 178:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_4))

## Unselfish servants of all

> “But these material-minded sons in darkness will never know of your spiritual light of truth unless you draw very near them with that **unselfish social service** which is the natural outgrowth of the bearing of the fruits of the spirit in the life experience of each individual believer.” (<a id="a50_293"></a>[UB 178:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_4))

## Reborn children of the heavenly kingdom

> “As mortal and material men, you are indeed citizens of the earthly kingdoms, and you should be good citizens, all the better for having become reborn spirit sons of the heavenly kingdom.” (<a id="a54_192"></a>[UB 178:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_5))

## Recipients of sacred responsibilities

> “As faith-enlightened and spirit-liberated sons of the kingdom of heaven, you face a double responsibility of duty to man and duty to God while you voluntarily assume a third and sacred obligation: service to the brotherhood of God-knowing believers.” (<a id="a58_255"></a>[UB 178:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_5))

Soon after the Papers were published the concept grew that the main function of recipients was to spread The Urantia Book. Effectively that task is the spreading of information about God and about Jesus. But about two billion people on Urantia already know about the God who is love and about his son, Jesus who revealed God’s loving nature. Something more is required of us.

> “What is now most needed is Jesus. The world needs to see Jesus again living on earth in the experience of spirit-born mortals who effectively reveal the Master to all men.” (<a id="a62_177"></a>[UB 195:10.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_1))

> You are all to proclaim this gospel of love and truth by the lives which you live in the flesh. You shall love one another with a new and startling affection, even as I have loved you. You will serve mankind with a new and amazing devotion, even as I have served you. And when men see you so love them, and when they behold how fervently you serve them, they will perceive that you have become faith-fellows of the kingdom of heaven, and they will follow after the Spirit of Truth which they see in your lives, to the finding of eternal salvation. (<a id="a64_551"></a>[UB 191:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/191#p6_2))

> The supreme happiness oflife is the conviction that we are loved.
> _Victor Hugo_

> The best portion of a good man's life—his little, nameless, unremembered acts of kindness and love. 
> _William Wordsworth_
