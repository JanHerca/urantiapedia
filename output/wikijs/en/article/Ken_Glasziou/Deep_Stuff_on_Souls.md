The evolving soul of mortal man is created out of pre-existent “possibilities” within the Supreme (see <a id="a36_103"></a>[UB 117:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p5_11)).

That statement poses more questions than it answers. How does this come about? How, from what, and from where do these “possibilities” arise? How did they get to be within the Supreme, who is “the Supreme,” and how do we get these “possibilities” in order to build our souls? But first—what are these things termed “possibilities”?

The concept of “possibilities within the Supreme” includes the stars, the planets, the universes and “all that therein is,” meaning everything in the finite world. It embraces all life whether it be spirit, morontial, or mortal. It encompasses everything potentially possible for evolutionary finite experiencing.

But all that is “possible” originally had an infinite origin. So how is it possible for that which belongs to infinity to become manifested on the finite level?

We are not given a direct answer. However, it is pointed out that infinity encompasses all things ranging from the lowest and most qualified finite existence to the highest and unqualified absolute realities. (1264)

The infinite already contains the finite. The transmutation of possibilities from the infinity level to the finite level becomes an actuality through triodity relationships that impinge on and in the Supreme. (1261) How is apparently beyond our understanding.

The Supreme thus becomes the “possibility” storehouse upon which finite creatures such as ourselves can draw to gain that which is possible to us. And having transformed the possible to actual experience, these real experiences of our mortal lives are eventually destined to return to the Supreme for eternal keeping.

The means by which we draw upon the Supreme for “possibilities” is almost entirely dominated by the Seven Adjutant Mind Spirits, who have a much greater influence on our thoughts, if not our actions, than most of us ever deemed possible.

In actuality these adjutant mind spirits appear to be almost the sole source of what we recognize as being our own minds. It is one of their responsibilities to draw our attention to the “possibilities” available to us.

As the Universe Mother Spirit is the direct source of the adjutant mind spirits, all that comes from them cannot be other than God-like. It must also carry the potentialities and inherent characteristics of cosmic mind, the source of all finite mind.

What we receive from the Adjutant Mind Spirits also interacts with influences stemming from our Thought Adjuster. Our task is to choose between alternatives inherently available in the possibilities so presented. It may surprise us to realize that there is probably no actual originality in our thinking. Our originality is expressed by the way in which we choose among the alternatives presented to us. The soul we manufacture is a joint partnership creation, the result of our collaboration with our Thought Adjuster.

In view of the divinity of the sources from which we derive our minds, and the exalted status of our personal Helper who derives directly from the First Source and Center, why is so much of what we think and do so drastically and dramatically ungodlike?

Presumably it is because of the evolutionary instincts we derived from our animal ancestry— instincts and behavior patterns that were originally concerned with self-survival. Perhaps it is these that now provide us with a false sense of exultation when personal power comes our way. Indulged in, it may lead to an almost irreversible self-centeredness that can become total.

What was initially meant for self-survival has evolved into a means of self-destruction—but only if that is our freewill choice, for we are now beyond the animal phase in evolution, and we do have the intellect to reason, plus a built-in knowledge of morality and right and wrong that came with our acquisition of personality plus a higher potential to utilize cosmic mind.

Whatever the source of our dilemmas, these are part of the “possibilities” with which we must struggle to convert to experiences having spiritual value—if they are to become a component of the memories that accompany us throughout our eternal career.

Does “ungodlike” experience become part of the Supreme? Certainly that which is “ungodlike” cannot exist in the presence of the Universal Father, but perhaps all finite experience can contribute to the makeup of the Supreme.

The seven adjutant mind spirits who are so important for our growth are called by names consonant with their purpose—intuition, understanding, courage, knowledge, counsel, worship and wisdom. Though the adjutants have an aura of being personal, they are not actual entities. We are told they are more like circuits but that would have been an analogy coined in the mid-thirties. Perhaps the concept of “field” as it has become important in quantum physics might now be a better description.

In reality, the adjutants are levels of consciousness of the Universe Mother Spirit (<a id="a70_85"></a>[UB 36:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5_4)) who is the direct source of our individual minds. We are informed that there are no comparable influences to the adjutant mind spirits once we depart this Earth.

But though we depart forever from their presence, our souls will possess a continuing character derived from the decisions we made during our association with adjutant mind.
