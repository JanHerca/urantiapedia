> “What man himself takes with him as a personality possession are the character consequences of the experience of having used the mind and spirit circuits of the grand universe in his Paradise ascent.” (<a id="a36_204"></a>[UB 117:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p5_13))

The previous article reported that in nurturing the growth of our souls, Thought Adjusters utilize only those experiences from our mortal career that have spiritual meaning and value. The quote from p.1287 indicates that it is the consequences of experience that are of long term value to our personalities. Paper 117 further states:

> “When man decides, and when he consummates this decision in action, man experiences, and the meanings and the values of this experience are forever a part of his eternal character on all levels, from the finite to the final.” (<a id="a40_229"></a>[UB 117:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p5_13))

In our readings many of us will have puzzled over the emphasis placed by the revelators on our decision making as being of critical importance to our spiritual growth. This is emphatically summarized by a Melchizedek:

> “The keys of the kingdom of heaven are: sincerity, more sincerity, and more sincerity. All men have these keys. Men use them—advance in spirit status—by decisions, by more decisions, and by more decisions. The highest moral choice is the choice of the highest possible value, and always—in any sphere, in all of them—this is to choose to do the will of God. If man thus chooses, he is great, though he be the humblest citizen of Jerusem or even the least of mortals on Urantia.” (<a id="a44_482"></a>[UB 39:4.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p4_14))

The value of decision making is further elaborated:

> “Cosmically moral and divinely spiritual character represents the creature's capital accumulation of personal decisions which have been illuminated by sincere worship, glorified by intelligent love, and consummated in brotherly service.” (<a id="a48_241"></a>[UB 117:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p5_13)) _En passant_, this thought: “Even the work of this world, paramount though it is, is not nearly so important as the way in which you do this work. There is no material reward for righteous living, but there is profound satisfaction—consciousness of achievement—and this transcends any conceivable material reward.” (<a id="a48_604"></a>[UB 39:4.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p4_13))

Naturally we must keep in mind that decisions must concern matters of spiritual value if they are to contribute to the building of our souls. Paper 117 has this comment:

> “The evolving soul of mortal man is created out of the pre-existent possibility for such experience within the Supreme.” (<a id="a52_124"></a>[UB 117:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p5_11))

This implies that only those decisions that are about the kind of experiences potentially having God-like qualities can contribute to the growth of our souls. What are God-like qualities? Unselfish love and service, truth, beauty, and goodness for starters. We cannot make rules and definitions. As we get to know the mind of God through our Thought Adjusters and Jesus' Spirit of Truth, we will get to recognize “spiritual meaning and value.”

> Like all weak men he laid an exaggerated stress on not changing one's mind.
