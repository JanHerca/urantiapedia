- The soul is the self-reflective, truth-discerning, and spirit-perceiving part of us which forever elevates the human being above the level of the animal world.
- Self-consciousness is not the soul.
- Moral self-consciousness is not the soul--but is its foundation.
- Moral choice, spiritual attainment, the ability to know God and the urge to be like him, these are characteristics of the soul.
- The soul cannot exist apart from moral thinking and spiritual activity.
- A stagnant soul has no value.
- As it matures our soul comes nearer and nearer to actualizing as an entity intervening between the material and the spiritual, the material self and the divine spirit within.
- The morally conscious mortal "knows" intuitively of the existence of his/her soul as a real and personal spiritual experience.
