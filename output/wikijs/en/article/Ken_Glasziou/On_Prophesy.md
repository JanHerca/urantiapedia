The “prophetic” information discussed is only a sample but should be sufficient for any open minded reader to decide that these Papers must surely be worthy of their attention.

Besides the prophetic information that turns out to be correct, well-informed readers will also find materials that are well out-of date. That must be accepted as inevitable because the terms of the mandate limited the authors to our 1930’s level of knowledge.

But any really close and serious examination of the “prophetic” information provided herein will require that those with the prior intention of rejecting the Papers are forced to stretch their “truth” beyond reasonable limits in order to placate their conscience.

For me personally, this prophetic material had little to do with my conviction that the revelation is what it says it is. In Part 4, I met the Jesus I had already known for many years. The Urantia Papers expanded that knowledge and then provided the bonus of an intimate knowledge, and a far better understanding, of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—plus an overall view of a magnificent and incredible Creation, its purposes, and my own role therein. Also, I found that the quality of its text placed this work in a class all of its own, making it worth reading regardless of any claim to “inspiration”

Faith and personal experience, not science or even quality, is the key that elevates the spiritual content of the Papers to any exalted level. Virtually everybody could gain value from a study of the Urantia Papers, regardless of their authorship. As with the teachings and life of Jesus of Nazareth, they have the potential to change the individual, and the world in which we live.

## From the Urantia Papers.

> “To isolate part of life and call it religion is to disintegrate life and to distort religion.” (<a id="a45_99"></a>[UB 102:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p6_1))

> “Man’s greatest spiritual jeopardy consists in partial progress, the predicament of unfinished growth; modern science, particularly psychology, has weakened only those religions which are so largely dependent on fear, superstition, and emotion.” (<a id="a47_249"></a>[UB 99:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p4_8))

> “The philosophic elimination of religious fear and the steady progress of science add greatly to the mortality of false gods; and even though these casualties of man-made deities may momentarily befog the spiritual vision, they eventually destroy the ignorance and superstition which so long obscured the living God of eternal love.” (<a id="a49_337"></a>[UB 102:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p6_1))

> “Be not discouraged; human evolution is still in progress, and the revelation of God to the world, in and through Jesus, shall not fail.” (<a id="a51_141"></a>[UB 196:3.33](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_33))
