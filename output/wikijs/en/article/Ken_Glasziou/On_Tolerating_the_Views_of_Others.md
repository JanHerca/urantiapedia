To those who were disconcerted about the Master's tolerance of the views of others, he said:

> True and genuine inward certainty does not in the least fear outward analysis, nor does truth resent honest criticism. You should never forget that intolerance is the mask covering up the entertainment of secret doubts as to the trueness of one's belief. No man is at any time disturbed by his neighbor's attitude when he has perfect confidence in the truth of that which he wholeheartedly believes. Courage is the confidence of thoroughgoing honesty about those things which one professes to believe. Sincere men are unafraid of the critical examination of their true convictions and noble ideals. (<a id="a35_602"></a>[UB 146:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p3_2))

> The fruits of the divine spirit which are yielded in the lives of such spirit-born and God-knowing mortals are: loving service, unselfish devotion, courageous loyalty, sincere fairness, enlightened honesty, undying hope, confiding trust, merciful ministry, unfailing goodness, **forgiving tolerance**, and enduring peace. If professed believers bear not these fruits of the divine spirit in their lives, they are dead; the Spirit of Truth is not in them; they are useless branches on the living vine. (<a id="a37_504"></a>[UB 193:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p2_2))
