The prophetic nature of _The Urantia Book_’s account of continental drift and some of its consequences have now received approval in a book by professor of geology, M.A.S. McMenamin, entitled “The Garden of Ediacara,” reported by Larry Mullins in the recent “Spiritual Fellowship Journal.” The following quotes coming from McMenamin’s book followed upon that author having his attention drawn to _The Urantia Book_’s content:

> “The anonymous members of the Urantia Corps hit on some remarkable scientific revelations in the mid-1930’s. They embraced continental drift at a time when it was decidedly out of vogue in the scientific community. They recognized the presence of a global super-continent (Rodinia) and superocean (Mirovia), in existence on Earth before Pangea. . . The concept of a billion year old supercontinent (the currently accepted age for the formation of Rodinia) that subsequently split apart, forming gradually widening ocean basins in which early marine life flourished, is unquestionably present in the book.”
> 
> “Orthodox scientific arguments for such a proposal did not appear until the late 1960’s, and a pre-Pangea supercontinient was never described until Valentine and Moores made the attempt in 1970. The Urantia Corps not only had the age of formation of Rodinia approximately correct at 1 billion years, but they were the first to link breakup of Rodinia to the emergence of animals. . . One wonders how the Urantia Book authors arrived at the concept of a Proterozoic supercontinent and the link between the breakup of this supercontinent and the emergence of complex life in the ensuing rift oceans 30 years before most geologists accepted continental drift–and nearly four decades before any scientist had any inkling that Rodinia existed.”

So why this strange mixture of highly prophetic material set in a background of early 1900’s science and cosmology that has since become outdated or untenable?

_We can only guess at the truth. Being aware that much of this material is a component of a “universe frame” that provides a background in which we can fit the kind of universe career set out for us ascending mortals by the revelators may be helpful for some. The necessity for such a “**frame-in-which-to-think**” is suggested in_:

> “Partial, incomplete, and evolving intellects would be helpless in the master universe, would be unable to form the first rational thought pattern, were it not for the innate ability of all mind, high or low, to form a universe **frame in which to think.** If mind cannot fathom conclusions, if itcannot penetrate to true origins, then will such mind unfailingly postulate conclusions and invent origins that it may have a means of logical thought within the frame of these mind-created postulates. And while such universe frames for creature thought are indispensable to rational intellectual operations, they are, without exception, erroneous to a greater or lesser degree.” (<a id="a46_680"></a>[UB 115:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p1_1))


This paragraph verifies the fact that the revelators have provided a framework for their presentations. Additionally, the terms of the mandate (<a id="a49_144"></a>[UB 101:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p4_1)) explain the presence of error and out-datedness. But we are still left without any obvious explanation for the provision of certain prophetic material that **does not appear to comply with the terms of the mandate as key or lost information**. Why was it included?

One answer is that it is there to help those who are new to this unusual 2000-page book to make their decision to undertake a serious study of its content. But with the passage of time, the problem will arise that what was initially prophetic will become common place–in fact, has already done so. Hence, if _The Urantia Book_ is to last as a useful revelation for an extended period, **perhaps a succession of revised editions will be a necessity**.

Obviously there are many sections in the book that must remain as originally provided. However, it would appear to be an act of intellectual vandalism to reject, out-of-hand, the proposal that there are some sections of _The Urantia Book_ that will stand in need of revision or even deletion. In fact, the time for that need to eventuate is already upon us.

> “What a sorry sight for successive generations of the professed followers of Jesus to say, regarding their stewardship of divine truth: ‘Here, Master, is the truth you committed to us a hundred or a thousand years ago. We have lost nothing; we have faithfully preserved all you gave us; we have allowed no changes to be made in that which you taught us; here is the truth you gave us.’ But such a plea concerning spiritual indolence will not justify the barren steward of truth in the presence of the Master. In accordance with the truth committed to your hands will the Master of truth require a reckoning.” (<a id="a55_612"></a>[UB 176:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p3_7))
