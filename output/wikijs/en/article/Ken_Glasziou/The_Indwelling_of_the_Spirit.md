Perhaps no single concept has more potential to make a difference for the spiritual progress and welfare of this planet than a widespread knowledge that the spirit of the Father actually indwells every single one of God’s human children—and that the Spirit of Truth is also available for their help and guidance, simply for the asking.

A search of the New Testament reveals that there are not less than twenty of its verses that declare the truth of this fact. They are to be found in three of the four gospels, in letters attributed to John, and in the letters of Paul to the Romans, Corinthians, Colossians, Thessalonians, Galatians, and a letter to Timothy. They refer to both the spirit of the Father and the spirit of Jesus. Obviously the indwelling of these divine spirit forces was well known among the very early Christians. But somehow or other, their significance was overlooked in later Christianity.

This loss may have been coincidental with the growth of an organized “official” church and an “official” priesthood. It is easy to speculate that this official clergy ignored the “indwelling spirit” concept in order to interpose themselves as mediators between God and man. And for certain, once this role of mediator became established, it would take a lot to shift it.

However it is also possible that the growth of the intermediary role of the clergy was unintentional—it simply evolved as a natural sequence of events in communities in which most members of the congregation were illiterate. How it happened no longer matters. What does matter is that the concept of an intensely personal and individual relationship between each of us and our indwelling spirit forces desperately needs to be re-established. For therein lies the road to the age of “Light and Life.”

However, it remains factual that even among Urantia Book readers, many have not really had great success with establishing a one on one, moment by moment, relationship with their Thought Adjuster, the indwelling Spirit of the Father.

For those who may find it easier, be assured that it is just as valid to establish this relationship with the Spirit of Truth who always comes into conscious awareness as Jesus-Michael, the Son. (<a id="a46_196"></a>[UB 194:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_4)) Some may be more comfortable with establishing familiarity with the spirit of a person who is real to them—and in a certain sense, the Spirit of Truth is both the spirit of the Father and the Son. (<a id="a46_439"></a>[UB 194:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_3))

The usefulness of the “alter ego” or “other self” method in establishing this relationship has been discussed previously. Recommended in Paper 91, it suggests the use of a natural process of childhood in which the child acts out the role of both participants in a dialogue. Transposing the concept to adulthood, we converse with our Indwelling Spirit but answer ourselves as we think God, or Jesus, would have answered. Used with sincerity, this method can be a wonderful aid for many people to establish a meaningful and personal relationship with God. It also adds much realism to a comment in the Papers, “Of all human knowledge, that which is of greatest value is to know the religious life of Jesus and how he lived it.” (<a id="a48_727"></a>[UB 196:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p1_3)) For the more we know the religious life of Jesus, the more accurately we can predict how Jesus might respond in any situation.

We Urantians have an unusual load of difficulties to overcome, particularly with respect to animal behavior characteristics associated with our evolutionary origins. The age of materialism has severely aggravated our social problems by promoting a permissive attitude towards inherited animal behavioral characteristics. Materialism infers that the expression of such characteristics is natural, that we do what we do because we cannot do otherwise.

The Urantia Papers inform us that we suffer from a double deprivation, one source being the rebellion of the Planetary Prince and his staff who were scheduled to teach primitive man civilized and stabilizing social behavior. The second source was from the Adamic default that deprived us of a massive genetic upgrading. It may be that this story is told using imagery of various kinds to get the facts across. However the result is independent of the way the story is related. The final result remains that the interaction between both of these causes with a materialist philosophy could only worsen our situation.

Fortunately we have a remedy available. We are informed that “God-knowing men and women who have been born of the Spirit experience no more conflict with their mortal natures than do the inhabitants of the most normal of worlds. . . Faith sons work on intellectual levels and live on spiritual planes far above the conflicts produced by unrestrained and unnatural physical desires.” (<a id="a54_384"></a>[UB 34:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p7_7))

One of the effects of cultivating a close personal relationship with our indwelling Father-Spirit will almost certainly be a desire to fulfil the mission Jesus allotted to his sincere followers:

> “Your mission to the world is founded on the fact that I lived a God-revealing life among you; on the truth that you and all other men are the sons of God; and it shall consist in the life which you will live among men—the actual and living experience of loving men and serving them, even as I have loved and served you. Let faith reveal your light to the world; let the revelation of truth open the eyes blinded by tradition; let your loving service effectually destroy the prejudice engendered by ignorance. By so drawing close to your fellow men in understanding sympathy and with unselfish devotion, you will lead them into a saving knowledge of the Father’s love.” (<a id="a58_673"></a>[UB 191:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/191#p5_3))

And in consideration of what our Creator-Son went through for us during his incarnation as Jesus of Nazareth, a crucifixion no less, surely a substantial number of his followers will become imbued with the need to assist in bringing the task described in this following paragraph into a state of reality:

> “The time is ripe to witness the figurative resurrection of the human Jesus from his burial tomb amidst the theological traditions and the religious dogmas of nineteen centuries. Jesus of Nazareth must not be longer sacrificed to even the splendid concept of the glorified Christ. What a transcendent service if, through this revelation, the Son of Man should be recovered from the tomb of traditional theology and be presented as the living Jesus to the church that bears his name. . . .”(<a id="a62_492"></a>[UB 196:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p1_2))

Some people believe that the Christian Churches are unlikely to return to the living Jesus if the task is to be undertaken at the top of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. But if it is to commence at the grass roots level, then recognition of an individual and personal relationship with the indwelling Spirit of the Father would appear to be the most productive first step.

And in the case that any of our readers find themselves in a position of being able to help Christians realize their own indwelling, a list of relevant New testament quotations is appended.
