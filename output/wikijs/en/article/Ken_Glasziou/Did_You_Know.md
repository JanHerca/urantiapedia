Despite the assurance by Big Bang exponents that all is known (almost), there are many vital missing links to be explained.

One of these concerns the formation of galaxies. There is no way there can be a satisfactory explanation of how galaxies form until we know what “dark matter” is and why it is there. “Dark matter” is required to explain why galaxies do not fly apart since their observable mass accounts for only about 20% of what is needed to prevent their disintegration.

Carbon is now known to be vital for the formation of stars in a galaxy. If there is no carbon, no stars can form, hence no galaxies can exist. Carbon is one of the many products of supernova explosions that occur when large stars run out of the energy required to prevent gravitational implosion.

Stars form in the huge dust clouds observed in galaxies. Carbon, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, as well as forty or more organic carbon molecules have an important role in the cooling of these giant dust clouds to about 10 degrees Kelvin where a shock wave of some kind may trigger dense regions to undergo the gravitational contraction leading to star formation.

During the early part of universe expansion, subsequent to the theoretical Big Bang, the universe is supposed to have consisted of an expanding cloud of hydrogen and helium. Since there was no carbon or giant dust clouds, how did stars form in the first place? How too, did these first stars then form themselves into galaxies? Nobody has the answer to these and many other questions for which the only possible reply is, “Since it happened—therefore it must be possible.” But that is not an answer. Rather, it is the beginning of a question.
