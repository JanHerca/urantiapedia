> The exquisite and transcendent experience of loving and being loved is not just a psychic illusion because it is so purely subjective. The one truly divine and objective reality that is associated with mortal beings, the indwelling God-Spirit, functions to human observation apparently as an exclusively subjective phenomenon. Man’s contact with the highest objective reality, God, is only through the purely subjective experience of knowing him, of worshiping him, of realizing sonship with him. (<a id="a33_500"></a>[UB 196:3.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_21))

> True religious worship is not a futile monologue of self-deception. Worship is a personal communion with that which is divinely real, with that which is the very source of reality. Man aspires by worship to be better and thereby eventually attains the best. (<a id="a35_261"></a>[UB 196:3.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_22))

> The idealization and attempted service of truth, beauty, and goodness is not a substitute for genuine religious experience–spiritual reality. Psychology and idealism are not the equivalent of religious reality. The projections of the human intellect may indeed originate false gods–gods in man’s image–but the true God-consciousness does not have such an origin. The God-consciousness is resident in the indwelling spirit. Many of the religious systems of man come from the formulations of the human intellect, but the God-consciousness is not necessarily a part of these grotesque systems of religious slavery. (<a id="a37_615"></a>[UB 196:3.23](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_23))

> God is not the mere invention of man’s idealism; he is the very source of all such superanimal insights and values. God is not a hypothesis formulated to unify the human concepts of truth, beauty, and goodness; he is the personality of love from whom all of these universe manifestations are derived. The truth, beauty, and goodness of man’s world are unified by the increasing spirituality of the experience of mortals ascending toward Paradise realities. The unity of truth, beauty, and goodness can only be realized in the spiritual experience of the God-knowing personality. (<a id="a39_582"></a>[UB 196:3.24](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_24))

> Morality is the essential pre-existent soil of personal God-consciousness, the personal realization of the inner Spirit presence, but such morality is not the source of religious experience and the resultant spiritual insight. The moral nature is superanimal but subspiritual. Morality is equivalent to the recognition of duty, the realization of the existence of right and wrong. The moral zone intervenes between the animal and the human types of mind as morontia functions between the material and the spiritual spheres of personality attainment. (<a id="a41_553"></a>[UB 196:3.25](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_25))

> The evolutionary mind is able to discover law, morals, and ethics; but the bestowed spirit, the indwelling God-Spirit, reveals to the evolving human mind the lawgiver, the Father-source of all that is true, beautiful, and good; and such an illuminated man has a religion and is spiritually equipped to begin the long and adventurous search for God. (<a id="a43_352"></a>[UB 196:3.26](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_26))

> Morality is not necessarily spiritual; it may be wholly and purely human, albeit real religion enhances all moral values makes them more meaningful. Morality without religion fails to reveal ultimate goodness, and it also fails to provide for the survival of even its own moral values. Religion provides for the enhancement, glorification, and assured survival of everything morality recognizes and approves. (<a id="a45_412"></a>[UB 196:3.27](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_27))


> You are not on this planet to produce anything with your body. Your purpose is to produce something with your soul. Your body is simply and merely the tool of your soul.

> Envy not success, nor pity failure. For you know not what is success or failure in the soul's reckoning.

> An everlasting perspective helps you to keep things in their proper light.
