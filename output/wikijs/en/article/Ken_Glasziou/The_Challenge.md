> The religious challenge of this age is to those farseeing and forward-looking men and women of spiritual insight who will **dare to construct a new and appealing philosophy** of living out of the enlarged and exquisitely integrated modern concepts of cosmic truth, universe beauty, and divine goodness. Such a new and righteous vision of morality will attract all that is good in the mind of man and challenge that which is best in the human soul. Truth, beauty, and goodness are divine realities, and as man ascends the scale of spiritual living, these supreme qualities of the Eternal become increasingly coordinated and unified in God, who is love. ([UB 2:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p7_10))

The authors of the Urantia revelation presented their own qualifications in what surely must be one of the most remarkable books ever written–a work that would be even more remarkable if actually written by human beings.

To be the imaginative work of either a human individual or group, we would need to attribute to the author(s) advanced knowledge over an impressive range of subjects, remarkably fertile imagination, and the ability to display extraordinary consistency throughout a 2000 page work–all long before the general availability of advanced computers. In fact, many serious readers are so impressed by what they read that, for them, the revelatory claim is self-authenticating.

However to grant it a revelatory status and some kind of celestial authorship, there are problems. Not the least of these is its error content–some of which is so obvious that, after considering the mental astuteness elsewhere displayed, one has to acknowledge that inclusion of such error had to be deliberate.

Why? One possible answer is to divert attention away from the revelation and to something of more immediate importance. What that could be is hinted at in the statement, “_construct a new and appealing philosophy out of the enlarged and exquisitely integrated modern concepts of cosmic truth, universe beauty, and divine goodness_.”

Currently there is an urgent need for not just one new philosophy but one for every race, nation, religion, faction, language–each and every barrier that divides us. And all such philosophies have to be short, sharp, and simple, and based directly upon those revelatory concepts of “_cosmic truth, universe beauty, and divine goodness_.”

What a challenge! The new philosophies must not only be short, sharp, and simple, but also suited to the immediate needs of its recipients.

What the revelators are asking is not for some academic, scientific, and theological tome but something more along the lines of Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount as it is presented in [Matthew 5](/en/Bible/Matthew/5) to [7](/en/Bible/Matthew/7).

Be aware though that it is not an educated and privileged leadership that constitutes the real menace to the advancement of the Brotherhood of Man. Rather, it is their armies of ignorant and misinformed followers, those who directly create all the havoc and the mayhem.

Getting rid of the leaders will not bring on the Brotherhood. There will always be a surfeit of power-hungry malcontents ready to step into any vacancy.

Rather, it is the army of the underprivileged, the poor, the starving, the ignorant, the illiterate, those who hunger for a better share of God’s good gifts to the world that could either form a fertile field in which the message of love and respect for one another could take root and flower–or else become recruited for murder and mayhem. That **this world is not a machine** in which we all do as we do because we cannot do otherwise is now a proven fact. Quantum theory has empirically demonstrated the existence of a transcendent reality outside of our time and space that can interact with our world in intelligent ways. And for this to occur in the way it does, “consciousness” has to be a component of that transcendent reality.

Some call this consciousness “God.” The Urantia revelators inform us that God has granted us free will, and this grant is inviolate. We are offered a choice. We can enlist on the side of God by revoking our free will and accepting God’s will in all things–placing ourselves firmly on the pathway of selflessness, tolerance, and love.

Or we can choose to let mayhem take its course.
