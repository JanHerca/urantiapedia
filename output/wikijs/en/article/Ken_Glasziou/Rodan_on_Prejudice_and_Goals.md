> Prejudice blinds the soul to the recognition of truth, and prejudice can be removed only by the sincere devotion of the soul to the adoration of a cause that is all-embracing and all-inclusive of one’s fellow men. 
> 
> Prejudice is inseparably linked to selfishness.
> 
> Prejudice can be eliminated only by the abandonment of self-seeking and by substituting therefor the quest of the satisfaction of the service of a cause that is not only greater than self, but one that is even greater than all humanity—the search for God, the attainment of divinity.
> 
> The evidence of maturity of personality consists in the transformation of human desire so that it constantly seeks for the realization of those values which are highest and most divinely real.
> 
> In a continually changing world, in the midst of an evolving social order, it is impossible to maintain settled and established goals of destiny.
> 
> Stability of personality can be experienced only by those who have discovered and embraced the living God as the eternal goal of infinite attainment.
> 
> Thus to transfer one’s goal from time to eternity, from earth to Paradise, from the human to the divine, requires that man shall become regenerated, converted, be born again; that he shall become the re-created child of the divine spirit; that he shall gain entrance into the brotherhood of the kingdom of heaven.
> 
> All philosophies and religions which fall short of these ideals are immature.
> 
> The philosophy which I teach, linked with the gospel which you preach, represents the new religion of maturity, the ideal of all future generations. And this is true because our ideal is final, infallible, eternal, universal, absolute, and infinite. (<a id="a52_253"></a>[UB 160:1.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_13))

> Graciousness is the aroma of friendliness which emanates from a love-saturated soul.
