The information in the Papers that relates directly to this question is scattered right throughout the text of their pages. Extraordinarily, the mandate defining the “universe rules” of revelation is not described until midway through the Papers, and the authors’ explanations of their use of human sources are split between near the beginning and two thirds of the way through. Such important references surely ought to have been in a preface or in an introduction?

Expositions on the relativity and evolutionary nature of truth get mentioned in many different places. This peculiarity of presentation has made it quite difficult to obtain a coordinated and unbroken overview of the degree of authority to be afforded to revelation that stems from a variety of celestial sources—some admittedly of only marginally higher status than the intended recipients.

Possibly because of its association with that frequently declared claim that the Bible is the infallible word of God, for many of us this word “revelation” carries the subconscious connotation of being “God-ordained, hence infallible.” Perhaps it is not surprising that a similar expectation for divine infallibility has been widely accorded to the text of the Urantia Papers. But is this really a valid expectation? The scattered nature of the evidence makes it difficult to decide. So is there a way to improve our comprehension in such circumstances?

Recent research has shown that, for many of us, the graphical presentation of information is a valuable supplementary aid to understanding. The flow diagrams presented on the following pages employ this medium in the hope of clarifying the significance of these unique and remarkable Papers

	s1("What do their author's say?")
	s2("Physical facts are fairly uniform, but truth is a living and flexible 
	factor in the philosophy of the universe. Evolving personalities are only 
	partially wise and relatively true in their communications. They can be 
	certain only as far as their personal experience extends. That which 
	apparently may be wholly true in one place may be only relatively true in 
	another segment of creation. [UB 2:7.2]
	Divine truth, final truth, is uniform and universal, but the story of 
	things spiritual, as it is told by numerous individuals hailing from 
	various spheres, may sometimes vary in details owing to this relativity in 
	the completeness of knowledge and in the repleteness of personal experience 
	as well as in the length and extent of that experience. [UB 2:7.3]")
	s3("Are the Papers The
	Absolute Truth?")
	s4("All finite knowledge and creature understanding are
	relative. Information and intelligence, gleaned from
	even high sources, is only relatively complete, locally
	accurate, and personally true. [UB 2:7.1]
	...Nothing which human nature has touched can be
	regarded as infallible. Through the mind of man divine
	truth may indeed shine forth, but always of relative
	purity and pattial divinity. The creature may crave
	infallibility, but only the Creators possess it. [UB 159:4.8]")
	s5("Revelation, Truth, and
	Completeness")
	s6("The papers, of which this is one, constitute the most recent 
	presentation of truth to the mortals of Urantia. These papers differ from 
	all previous revelations, for they are not the work of a single universe 
	personality but a composite presentation by many beings. But no
	revelation short of the attainment of the Universal Father can ever be 
	complete. All Other celestial ministrations are no more than partial, 
	transient, and practically adapted to local conditions in time and space. 
	While such admissions as this may possibly detract from the immediate force 
	and authority of all revelations. the time has come arrived on Urantia when
	it is advisable to make such frank statements, even at the risk ofweakening 
	the future influente and authority ofthis, the most recent of the 
	revelations oftruth to the mortal races of Urantia. [UB 92:4.9]")
	s7("Limitations to Revelation—Cosmology")
	s8("Because your world is generally ignorant of origins, even of physical 
	origins, it has appeared to be wise from time to time to provide 
	instruction in cosmology. And always has this made trouble for the future. 
	The laws of revelation hamper us greatly by their proscription of the 
	impartation of unearned or premature knowledge. Any cosmology presented as 
	a part of revealed religion is destined to be outgrown in a very short 
	time. Accordingly, future students of such a revelation are tempted to 
	discard any element of genuine religious truth it may contain because they 
	discover errors on the face of the associated cosmologies therein presented.
	[UB 101:4.1]
	Mankind should understand that we who participate in the revelation of 
	truth are very rigorously limited by the instructions of our superiors. We 
	are not at liberty to anticipate the scientific discoveries of a thousand 
	years. Revelators must act in accordance with the instructions which form a 
	part of the revelation mandate. We see no way of overcoming this 
	difficulty, either now or at any future time. We full well know that, while 
	the historic facts and religious truths of this series of revelatory 
	presentations will stand on the records of the ages to come, within a few 
	short years many of our statements regarding the physical sciences will 
	stand in need of revision in consequence of additional scientific 
	developments and new discoveries. These new developments we even now 
	foresee, but we are forbidden to include such humanly undiscovered facts in 
	the revelatory records. Let it be made clear that revelations are not 
	necessarily inspired. The cosmology of these revelations is not inspired. 
	It is limited by our permission for the co-ordination and sorting of 
	present-day knowledge. While divine or spiritual insight is a gift, human 
	wisdom must evolve. [UB 101:4.2]
	")
	s9("Use of Human Sources")
	s10("In formulating the succeeding presentations having to do with the 
	portrayal of the character of the Universal Father and the nature of his 
	Paradise associates, together with an attempted description of the perfect 
	central universe and the encircling seven superuniverses, we are to be 
	guided by the mandate of the superuniverse rulers which directs that we 
	shall, in all our efforts to reveal truth and co-ordinate essential 
	knowledge, give preference to the highest existing human concepts 
	pertaining to the subjects to be presented. We may resort to pure 
	revelation only when the concept of presentation has had no adequate 
	previous expression by the human mind. [UB 0:12.11]
	Acknowledgment: In carrying out my commission to restate the teachings and 
	retell the doings of Jesus of Nazareth, I have drawn freely upon all 
	sources of record and planetary information. My ruling motive has been to 
	prepare a record which will not only be enlightening to the generation of 
	men now living, but which may also be helpful to all future generations. 
	From the vast store of information made available to me, I have chosen that 
	which is best suited to the accomplishment of this purpose. As far as 
	possible I have derived my information from purely human sources. Only when 
	such sources failed, have I resorted to those records which are superhuman. 
	When ideas and concepts of Jesus’ life and teachings have been acceptably 
	expressed by a human mind, I invariably gave preference to such apparently 
	human thought patterns. . . .[UB 121:8.12]
	My revelatory commission forbade me to resort to extrahuman sources of 
	either information or expression until such a time as I could testify that 
	I had failed in my efforts to find the required conceptual expression in 
	purely human sources. [UB 121:8.13]")
	s11("Well, are the Papers divine revelation?")
	s12("Truth is always a revelation: autorevelation when it emerges as a 
	result of the work of the indwelling Adjuster; epochal revelation when it 
	is presented by the function of some other celestial agency, group, or 
	personality. [UB 101:4.3] 
	In the last analysis, religion is to be judged by its fruits, 
	according to the manner and the extent to which it exhibits its own 
	inherent and divine excellence. [UB 101:4.4]
	Truth may be but relatively inspired, even though revelation is invariably 
	a spiritual phenomenon. [UB 101:4.5]
	That appears to put the decision back onto the individual, each of whom may 
	enlist the spirit forces within to assist them to formulate their free Will 
	choice.")
	s13("So why were the Papers deemed to be Necessary?")
	s14("Even in the study of man's biologic evolution on Urantia, there
	are grave objections to the exclusive historic approach to his
	present-day status and his current problems. The true
	perspective of any reality problem—human or divine, terrestrial
	or cosmic—can be had only by the full and unprejudiced study
	and correlation of three phases of universe reality: origin,
	history, and DESTINY. The proper understanding of these three
	experiential realities affords the basis for a wise estimate of the
	current status. [UB 19:1.6]")
	s15("A missing link is a real knowledge of human DESTINY")
	s16("History alone fails adequately to reveal future development—DESTINY. 
	Finite origins are helpful, but only divine causes reveal final effects. 
	Eternal ends are not shown in time beginnings. The present can be truly 
	interpreted only in the light of the correlated past and future. 
	[UB 19:1.11]
	The Urantia Papers provide a detailed knowledge of our potential eternal 
	destiny, both up to and subsequent to attainment of the Universal Father in 
	Paradise. This destiny becomes available as the result of our free will 
	decision to seek ultimately to become God-like.")
	s17("So what else can the Urantia
	Papers do for mankind?")
	s18("They provide us with a conceptual
	universe frame in which can
	visualize and understand our
	universe careers!")
	s19("Partial, incomplete, and evolving intellects would be helpless in the 
	master universe, would be unable to form the first rational thought 
	pattern, were it not for the innate ability of all mind, high or low, to 
	form a universe frame in which to think. If mind cannot fathom conclusions, 
	if it cannot penetrate to true origins, then will such mind unfailingly 
	postulate conclusions and invent origins that it may have a means of 
	logical thought within the frame of these mind-created postulates, And
	while such universe frames for creature thought are indispensable to 
	rational intellectual operations, they are, without exception, erroneous to 
	a greater or lesser degree. [UB 115:1.1]
	Conceptual frames of the universe are only relatively true; they are 
	serviceable scaffolding which must eventually give way before the 
	expansions of enlarging cosmic comprehension. The understandings of truth, 
	beauty, and goodness, morality, ethics, duty, love, divinity, origin, 
	existence, purpose. destiny, time, space, even Deity, are only relatively 
	true. God is much, much more than a Father, but the Father is man's highest 
	concept of God; nonetheless, the Father-Son portrayal of Creator-creature 
	relationship Will be augmented by those supermortal conceptions of Deity 
	which will be attained in Orvonton. in Havona, and on Paradise. Man must
	think in a mortal universe frame, but that does not mean that he cannot 
	envision other and higher frames within which thought can take place. 
	[UB 115:1.2]
	[Note: The cosmology in the Papers was for the early 1930's, and some is now
	outdated. However this has only trivial effects on the usefulness of the 
	universe frame provided]")
	s20("The Final Bonus")
	s21("The Papers in Part 1 of The Urantia Book provide a unique exposition 
	of deity relationships that is quite unprecedented on this planet. Included 
	is a revelation of the Universal Father that details interrelationships 
	with absolute, eternal, and infinite aspects of deity and which is
	further expanded in Part 3 to provide more information upon trinities, 
	triunities. triodities, and the First Source and Center, the I AM, the God 
	of monotheistic religion.
	Part 4, the final set of Papers, is devoted exclusively to the life and 
	teachings of Jesus of Nazareth in his task of revealing the very nature of 
	the Universal Father—but in a manner comprehensible to the minds of lowly 
	creatures such as ourselves who are just beginning a life of adventure that 
	has the potential to bring us into the very presence of God himself")
