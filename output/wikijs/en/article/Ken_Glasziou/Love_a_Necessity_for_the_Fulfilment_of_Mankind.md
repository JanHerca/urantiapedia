_Almost 500 years before the Christian era, Mo Tzu, in China, gained a large following for his concepts regarding mutual love and its potential to replace war among states and nations_.

“Whence do these calamities arise?” he asked. And he answered as follows:

_They arise from the **absence of mutual love**. At present feudal lords have learned only to love their own States, but not those of others. Therefore they have no scruples about attacking other states. And the heads of houses have learned only to love their own houses and never those of others. Therefore they have no scruples against usurping the houses of others. And individuals have learned only to love themselves and not others. Therefore they too have no scruples against injuring others. It follows that all the calamities, strifes, conflicts, complaints, and hatreds in the world have their origin out of the want of mutual love. How can this condition be altered?_

_It is to be altered by the way of universal love and mutual aid. This means to regard the State of others as one’s own, the houses of others as one’s own, the persons of others as one’s self._

_When all the people of the world love one another, then the strong will not overpower the weak, the many will not oppress the few, the wealthy will not mock the poor, the honored will not disdain the humble, and the cunning will not deceive the simple. And it will be due to mutual universal love that calamities, strifes, complaints, and hatred will disappear from the face of the earth._

Mo Tzu’s ideas were not well received by those in power. Jesus presented similar views 500 years later. Those in power crucified him.

> The way of the Vital Spirit fills our whole frames, yet man cannot keep track of it. It goes, yet has not departed. It comes, yet is not here. It is muted, makes no note that can be heard, yet of a sudden we find that it is there in the mind. It is dim and dark, showing no outward form, yet in a great stream, it flowed into us at our birth.
>  Tao-ism (about500 BCE)

## Love is the Rule of Living

Perhaps these previous failures mean that the rule of love cannot be hastened. It must germinate, be nurtured, and grow in the hearts of individuals–voluntarily. When a large majority have it, universal love will simply take over.

Love is the rule of living in God’s kingdom–supreme devotion to God while loving your neighbor as yourself.

The evidence to all the world that you have been born of the Spirit is that you sincerely love one another.

When the wise understand the impulses of others, they will love them. When you love your neighbors you have already forgiven them. This capacity to understand human nature and to forgive apparent wrong doing is God-like. And God-likeness is the measure of your spiritualization.

Love is the outworking of the divine and inner urge of life. It is founded on understanding, nurtured by unselfish service, and perfected in wisdom.

Love must grasp the ever changing concept of the highest cosmic good of the individual who is loved. And such love goes on to strike this same attitude to all individuals who could possibly be influenced by Spirit-led mortals’ love for their fellows.

> Praise belongs to God, the Lord of the worlds, The Compassionate, the Merciful, 'Tis Thee we worship and Thee we ask for help.
>  The Koran
