It is now 60 years since the Urantia Papers were brought to our planet and an organization developed, firstly to get the Papers published in book form, and then to generate systems to commence to spread the book throughout the world. That phase has now been achieved. In the process, a pseudo-papacy developed. Whether or not this was the intention of the revelators we cannot know. Let us presume that it was and that the initial task proceeded according to plan. Since it appears that this phase has now concluded, perhaps we are meant to prepare the way for a new phase of development. What might this new phase be?

One thing for sure is that the authors of the book were remarkably intuitive and prophetic in describing the conditions and impending changes that would come about in world society. In <a id="a38_185"></a>[Paper 99, The Social Problems of Religion](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p5), we find a guide book for the next one thousand years. It is our responsibility to take note of the wisdom and experience that a superior intelligentsia has provided on how we may handle the situation presently confronting us. We are told:

> “_Institutional religion cannot afford inspiration and provide leadership in this impending world-wide social reconstruction and economic reorganization because it has unfortunately become more or less of an organic part of the social order and the economic system which is destined to undergo reconstruction. Only the real religion of personal spiritual experience can function helpfully and creatively in the present crisis of civilization._” (<a id="a40_448"></a>[UB 99:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p2_1))

This would indicate that there is very little that dedicated Urantia Book readers can contribute on an organizational basis that is liable to bring benefit to our planet. Whatever potentialities are conferred upon us by virtue of our possession of the book, the fostering of a religious organization appears to be an improbable source of progress. That does not mean that we should not find stimulation and companionship through the forming of social organizations. But it does mean that the reconstruction of society is unlikely to gain significant benefits. Paper 99 offers further advice:

> “_Religionists must function in society, in industry, and in politics as individuals, not as groups, parties, or institutions. A religious group which presumes to function as such, apart from religious activities, immediately becomes a political party, an economic organization, or a social institution. Religious collectivism must confine its efforts to the furtherance of religious causes._” (<a id="a44_397"></a>[UB 99:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p2_3))

Taken together these two quotations tell us that it is the creative functioning of our personal spiritual experience that can be helpful in ameliorating the inevitable recurring crises on our planet. But, as a collective, we must confine our efforts to the furtherance of religious causes. How can we do this and what should the immediate goals be?

The greatest present need for the spiritual development of our planet remains the same as it was 2000 years ago when our Creator Son took on human form in an effort to rectify our misconceptions about God. In a pre-bestowal conversation between Immanuel and Michael, Immanuel said: “_Your great mission to be realized and experienced in the mortal incarnation is embraced in your decision to live a life wholeheartedly motivated to do the will of the Paradise Father, ***thus to reveal God, your Father, in the flesh***._” (<a id="a48_524"></a>[UB 120:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p2_8))

The greatest hindrance to the further spiritual advancement to our planet is an endemic misunderstanding of the nature of God. No world religion has ever fully comprehended the significance of the reality that the love, goodness, and mercy of God as a Father unconditionally transcends his righteousness as our judge. Jesus taught us the meaning of that reality not only by his life but also by his parables (the prodigal son, the lost coin, the lost sheep) and teachings such as: “_Would any of you who are fathers give your son a snake when he asks for a fish? Or would you give him a scorpion when he asks for an egg? As bad as you are, you know how to give good things to your children. How much more, then, will the Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!_” ([Luke 11:11-13](/en/Bible/Luke/11#v11))

Surely, then, the correcting of that primary error is the cardinal requirement for the creation of an environment conducive to the further spiritual progress of society. Until mankind understands the nature of God, little further progress can be made, and stagnation or even regression will be its fate. As Urantia Book readers who have comprehended the reality of God’s nature, and its meaning for our relationships with God and one another, we have the obligation to get that message through to mankind. That is our primary personal task. It is also our task as religious collectives in which we can come together to discuss ways and means of promulgating that message. As Jesus said to Simon, “_Lead men into the kingdom and the great and living truths of the kingdom will presently drive out all serious error. . . and when you have a man safely and securely in the kingdom, then is the time, when such a one will come to you with inquiries, to impart instruction having to do with the progressive advancement of the soul._” **Let first things come first.** (<a id="a52_1063"></a>[UB 141:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p6_2))

> Man with his burning soul
> Has but an hour of breath
> To build a ship of Truth
> In which his soul may sail
> Sail on the sea of death
> For death takes toll
> Of beauty, courage, youth,
> Of all, but Truth.
>
>   John Masefield
