> _Mind is always creative. The mind endowment of an individual animal, mortal, morontian, spirit ascender, or finality attainer is always competent to produce a suitable and serviceable body for the living creature identity._ (<a id="a36_228"></a>[UB 42:12.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p12_9))

Our personality is a fixed pattern, a gift from the Universal Father. It is individual, unique, unchangeable. Just as the original pattern of a designer dress is a fixed unchangeable pattern, so is our personality pattern. But a dress pattern is only a pattern. The dress manufacturer may modify it in many ways to suit the production requirements of his/her factory. Nevertheless the original pattern is fixed, unchanged. Its expression is what is modified. And when it appears in a shop window, a discerning woman may recognize the stamp of the designer.

“_The liaison of the cosmic mind and the ministry of the adjutant mind-spirits evolve a suitable physical tabernacle for the evolving human._” (<a id="a40_144"></a>[UB 42:12.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p12_11)) This is also true for the animal. But for human beings endowed with both free will and the gift of the Father of his spirit fragment, It is not the end of the matter.

We tend to think of ourselves as a body having a spirit. The reality is we are spirit dwelling in a material body. _“The spirit is the architect, the mind is the builder, the body is the material building._” (<a id="a42_209"></a>[UB 42:12.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p12_12)) Only our personality is fixed. But just as with a material building, there are limitations on how much our body can be modified. Despite these limitations, we are assured of always having a serviceable material body and brain with which to attain the attainable.

Our task is to “serve as we pass by”—as did our mentor, Jesus of Nazareth. The spirit forces within ourselves, our Father-spirit and Jesus’ Spirit of Truth, will determine what is attainable for us.

In serving as we pass by, it is God who brings us our daily tasks. When we accept what comes our way, doing whatever needs doing as we think Jesus himself would do it, then this is what is meant by “doing the will of God.”

“_I am now on the way to Rome with you and your father, and that is sufficient for today. My tomorrow is wholly in the hands of my Father in heaven._” (Jesus to Ganid, <a id="a48_168"></a>[UB 130:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p5_3))

We need never reject the tasks that come our way on false grounds of our physical or mental inadequacy. The spirit and the cosmic mind will see to the serviceability of our equipment. If it is God’s will for us, then it is possible for us.
