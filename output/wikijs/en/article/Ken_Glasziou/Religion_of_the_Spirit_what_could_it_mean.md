In a dimension beyond that which is worldly and finite, the religion of the spirit defines a transcendental state that derives its reality from the collective experience of the souls of men and women of all mankind.

Human beings are not singular units. Each of us is bipolar. We have a self pole and a God pole, the latter being an indwelling spirit-fragment of God, the Father-Creator, the First Source and Center of all that is. And it is the joint activities of these two independent entities, the human mind and its embedded God-Mind, that bring about the existence of the human soul–which in its turn, generates those experiences that constitute the body of the religion of the spirit.

In itself the soul consists of selected experience, human experience selected by the God-Spirit-Within because of its content of spiritual meaning and value, the latter being largely determined by its content of selflessness and service-orientated experiential love. During lifetime the soul is the repository of that which has spiritual meaning and value as a result of our life experience. In the after life it is, in many ways, the memory of our earthly existence–for only those experiences that have spiritual value can also have a meaningful existence in a dimension that is purely spiritual.

But what could have meaning or value to a life existent only as a spirit entity?

If we take the example of the earthly human life of Jesus of Nazareth for our model, whether as it was revealed in the New Testament Gospels or in the Urantia Papers, then central to that life was Jesus’ determination to live solely in accord with the will of God through his life of loving, selfless service to the spiritual welfare of his Father’s earthly children.

And that appears to have been his sole purpose–and his religion of the spirit.
