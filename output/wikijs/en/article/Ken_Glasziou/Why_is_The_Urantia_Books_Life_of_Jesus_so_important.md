> If the faith of the creature were perfect, he would assuredly know that when he had seen a Creator Son he had seen the Universal Father; in seeking for the Father, he would not ask nor expect to see other than the Son. Mortal man simply cannot see God until he achieves completed spirit transformation and actually attains Paradise. (<a id="a36_336"></a>[UB 1:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p5_5))

> “The natures of the Paradise Creator Sons do not encompass all the unqualified potentials of the universal absoluteness of the infinite nature of the First Great Source and Center, but the Universal Father is in every way divinely present in the Creator Sons. The Father and his Sons are one. These Paradise Sons of the order of Michael are perfect personalities, even the pattern for all local universe personality from that of the Bright and Morning Star down to the lowest human creature of progressing animal evolution.” (<a id="a38_528"></a>[UB 1:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p5_6))

> The nature of God can best be understood by the revelation of the Father which Michael of Nebadon unfolded in his manifold teachings and in his superb mortal life in the flesh. The divine nature can also be better understood by man if he regards himself as a child of God and looks up to the Paradise Creator as a true spiritual Father. (<a id="a40_340"></a>[UB 2:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p0_1))

> “The nature of God can be studied in a revelation of supreme ideas, the divine character can be envisaged as a portrayal of supernal ideals, but the most enlightening and spiritually edifying of all revelations of the divine nature is to be found in the comprehension of the religious life of Jesus of Nazareth.” (<a id="a42_316"></a>[UB 2:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p0_2))

> “The infinite and eternal Ruler of the universe of universes is power, form, energy, process, pattern, principle, presence, and idealized reality. But he is more; he is personal; he exercises a sovereign will, experiences self-consciousness of divinity, executes the mandates of a creative mind, pursues the satisfaction of the realization of an eternal purpose, and manifests a Father’s love and affection for his universe children. And all these more personal traits of the Father can be better understood by observing them as they were revealed in the bestowal life of Michael, your Creator Son, while he was incarnated on Urantia.” (<a id="a44_639"></a>[UB 3:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p6_7))

> “In the study of the religious life of Jesus, view him positively. Think not so much of his sinlessness as of his righteousness, his loving service. Jesus upstepped the passive love disclosed in the Hebrew concept of the heavenly Father to the higher active and creature-loving affection of a God who is the Father of every individual, even of the wrongdoer.” (<a id="a46_363"></a>[UB 5:4.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p4_15))

> “Nevertheless, I tell you that the Father and I are one. He who has seen me has seen the Father. My Father is working with me in all these things, and he will never leave me alone in my mission, even as I will never forsake you when you presently go forth to proclaim this gospel throughout the world.” (<a id="a48_306"></a>[UB 157:6.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p6_13))

> Devote your life to proving that love is the greatest thing in the world (<a id="a50_76"></a>[UB 192:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p2_1))
