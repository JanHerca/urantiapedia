> Through religious faith the soul of man reveals itself and demonstrates the potential divinity of its emerging nature by the characteristic manner in which it induces the mortal personality to react to certain trying intellectual and testing social situations. Genuine spiritual faith (true moral consciousness) is revealed in that it:
> 1. Causes ethics and morals to progress despite inherent and adverse animalistic tendencies.
> 2. Produces a sublime trust in the goodness of God even in the face of bitter disappointment and crushing defeat.
> 3. Generates profound courage and confidence despite natural adversity and physical calamity.
> 4. Exhibits inexplicable poise and sustaining tranquillity notwithstanding baffling diseases and even acute physical suffering.
> 5. Maintains a mysterious poise and composure of personality in the face of maltreatment and the rankest injustice.
> 6. Maintains a divine trust in ultimate victory in spite of the cruelties of seemingly blind fate and the apparent utter indifference of natural forces to human welfare.
> 7. Persists in the unswerving belief in God despite all contrary demonstrations of logic and successfully withstands all other intellectual sophistries.
> 8. Continues to exhibit undaunted faith in the soul’s survival regardless of the deceptive teachings of false science and the persuasive delusions of unsound philosophy.
> 9. Lives and triumphs irrespective of the crushing overload of the complex and partial civilizations of modern times.
> 10. Contributes to the continued survival of altruism in spite of human selfishness, social antagonisms, industrial greeds, and political maladjustments.
> 11. Steadfastly adheres to a sublime belief in universe unity and divine guidance regardless of the perplexing presence of evil and sin.
> 12. Goes right on worshiping God in spite of anything and everything. Dares to declare, “Even though he slay me, yet will I serve him. (<a id="a48_138"></a>[UB 101:3.4-16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p3_4))

> Spiritual attainment is the true goal of living. (<a id="a50_52"></a>[UB 170:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p2_6))

> In science the human self observes the material world; philosophy is the observation of this observation of the material world; religion, true spiritual experience, is the experiential realization of the cosmic reality of the observation of the observation...
