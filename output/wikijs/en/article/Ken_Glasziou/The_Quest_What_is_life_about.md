- Sooner or later all universe personalities begin to realize that the final quest of eternity is the endless exploration of infinity, the never-ending voyage of discovery into the absoluteness of the First Source and Center.
- Sooner or later we all become aware that all creature growth is proportional to Father identification.
- We arrive at the understanding that living the will of God is the eternal passport to the endless possibility of infinity itself.
- Mortals will sometime realize that success in the quest of the Infinite is directly proportional to the achievement of Fatherlikeness.
- In this universe age the realities of the Father are revealed within the qualities of divinity.
- These qualities of divinity are personally appropriated by universe creatures in the experience of living divinely.
- To live divinely means actually to live the will of God.
- Qualities of divinity are: Unity, truth, beauty, greatness, goodness.
