<p>On Peer Group Pressure</p>
<p>Succumbing to peer group pressures has ruined a countless number of both young and adult lives. Why do people of normal intelligence and normal courage become helpless, spineless idiotic cowards in the face of peer group pressure?</p>
<p>Surely the answer can only be that they are responding to some deeply felt, overriding, inherited instinct that they seem powerless to oppose.</p>
<p>An instinct observed in herd animals may give the clue. This is a blind, irrational fear of aloneness that, in nature, serves to protect individual herd members from attacking predators but, in the human herd, tends to lead to destruction.</p>
<p>It is the same instinct that, in the domesticated horse, will cause a foal that becomes separated from its mother to flee headlong toward her, ignoring any and all obstacles such as a barbwire fence on which it may destroy itself.</p>
<p>Certainly it is fear of aloneness and rejection that is responsible for a large proportion of teenagers giving in to peer group pressure and trying the cool thing—be it pot, cigarettes, alcohol, so-called recreational drugs, and hard drugs. Or perhaps it is the fear that causes them to indulge in some stupid escapade that may come unstuck and land themselves and  probably others in hospital, the morgue, or jail.</p>
<p>Being alone is really not that bad. I learned my lesson during the war years when having to cope with solitary confinement in complete darkness and total isolation from noise or other contact from the outside world. Time to think can even be a blessing.</p>
<p>Practice may be the key that opens the window to a new found courage that will isolate the fearful from their instinctive behavior. Try going off by yourself sometime. Since you can end the aloneness whenever you want, there is nothing to fear. Spend some lone time in prayer, meditation, or just reminiscing about good times. Not only will you find it tolerable but soon it may become indispensable.</p>
<p>In reality you are never alone. The indwelling God-Spirit is always with you, as is Jesus’ Spirit of Truth. Try talking to them, tell them of your fears and your problems. To them you will always be accepted. And in practicing aloneness, you will soon discover that you have no need for the kind of ‘friend’ who would reject you or make fun of you if you refuse to indulge in self-destructive behavior. Seriously practice being alone and the terrors of peer group pressure need never mar your life.</p>
