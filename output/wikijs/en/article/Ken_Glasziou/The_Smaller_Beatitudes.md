[Adapted from the Catechist Newsletter, Dutton Park, Qld., January 1998]

Blessed are they who can laugh at themselves; they will have no end of fun.

Blessed are they who can tell a mountain from a molehill; they will be saved a lot of bother.

Blessed are they who know how to relax without seeking excuses; wisdom has surely overtaken them.

Blessed are they who know when they should listen; they will learn new things.

Blessed are they who take not themselves seriously; they will be valued by others.

Happy are they who take small things seriously and serious things calmly; they will go far in life.

Happy are they who smile copiously and frown not; theirs will be the sunny side of life.

Happy are they who are rich in understanding; they may be taken for fools, but that is the price of charity.

Blessed are they who think before acting and pray before thinking; they will avoid much blundering.

Blessed are they who can curb their tongues while presenting a smile; the Gospel has penetrated their hearts.

Happy are you when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely, yet you still recognize the God-Spirit in all whom you meet; for the light of truth shines forth in your life and you have found true wisdom.
