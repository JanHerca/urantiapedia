<p>What If?</p>
<p>What if the Urantia Papers had actually been written by a committee bent upon saving the world? Such a committee would need to have included expert-level knowledge of the Bible, the archaeology and history of the first century Palestine area, a substantial knowledge of the Roman world, plus expertise in chemistry, geology, history, physics, and general science.</p>
<p>The writing of the 2000-page Urantia Book would have required an enormous amount of time and effort. Hence it would be logical for the authors to have been highly selective in making guesses about future discoveries that could come within the scope of the “missing gap” information&quot; allowed by the mandate.  Further discussion of some of this supposed “missing gap,” unearned, but prophetic information follows.</p>
