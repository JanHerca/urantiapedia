> Your mission to the world is founded on the fact that I lived a God-revealing life among you; on the truth that you and all other men are the sons of God; and it shall consist in the life which you will live among men—the actual and living experience of loving men and serving them, even as I have loved and served you. Let faith reveal your light to the world; let the revelation of truth open the eyes blinded by tradition; let your loving service effectually destroy the prejudice engendered by ignorance. (<a id="a36_512"></a>[UB 191:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/191#p5_3))

> All Urantia is waiting for the proclamation of the ennobling message of Jesus, unencumbered by the accumulated doctrines and dogmas of nineteen centuries of contact with the religions of evolutionary origin. The hour is striking for presenting to Buddhism, to Christianity, to Hinduism, even to the peoples of all faiths, not the gospel about Jesus, but the living, spiritual reality of the gospel of Jesus. (<a id="a38_411"></a>[UB 94:12.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p12_7))

> But doubt not, this same kingdom of heaven which the Master taught exists within the heart of the believer, will yet be proclaimed to this Christian church, even as to all other religions, races, and nations on earth—even to every individual. (<a id="a40_246"></a>[UB 170:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p5_8))

> The concept of Jesus is still alive in the advanced religions of the world. Paul’s Christian church is the socialized and humanized shadow of what Jesus intended the kingdom of heaven to be—and what it most certainly will yet become. (<a id="a42_237"></a>[UB 170:5.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p5_17))

> There must come a revival of the actual teachings of Jesus, such a restatement as will undo the work of his early followers who went about to create a sociophilosophical system of belief regarding the fact of Jesus’ sojourn on earth. (<a id="a44_237"></a>[UB 170:5.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p5_19))

> Mistake not! there is in the teachings of Jesus an eternal nature which will not permit them forever to remain unfruitful in the hearts of thinking men. The kingdom as Jesus conceived it has to a large extent failed on earth; for the time being, an outward church has taken its place; but you should comprehend that this church is only the larval stage. . . . (<a id="a46_363"></a>[UB 170:5.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p5_21))

> Thus does the so-called Christian church become the cocoon in which the kingdom of Jesus’ concept now slumbers. The kingdom of the divine brotherhood is still alive and will eventually and certainly come forth from this long submergence, just as surely as the butterfly eventually emerges as the beautiful unfolding of its less attractive creature of metamorphic development. (<a id="a48_379"></a>[UB 170:5.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p5_21))

> But paganized and socialized Christianity stands in need of new contact with the uncompromised teachings of Jesus; it languishes for lack of a new vision of the Master’s life on earth. A new and fuller revelation of the religion of Jesus is destined to conquer an empire of materialistic secularism and to overthrow a world sway of mechanistic naturalism. Urantia is now quivering on the very brink of one of its most amazing and enthralling epochs of social readjustment, moral quickening, and spiritual enlightenment. (<a id="a50_523"></a>[UB 195:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_2))

> The modern age will refuse to accept a religion which is inconsistent with facts and out of harmony with its highest conceptions of truth, beauty, and goodness. The hour is striking for a rediscovery of the true and original foundations of present-day distorted and compromised Christianity—the real life and teachings of Jesus. (<a id="a52_332"></a>[UB 195:9.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_5))

> Christianity has indeed done a great service for this world, but what is now most needed is Jesus. The world needs to see Jesus living again on earth in the experience of spirit-born mortals who effectively reveal the Master to all men (<a id="a54_239"></a>[UB 195:10.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_1))

> Jesus did not found the so-called Christian church, but he has, in every manner consistent with his nature, fostered it as the best existent exponent of his lifework on earth. (<a id="a56_179"></a>[UB 195:10.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_9))

> The living Jesus is the only hope of a possible unification of Christianity. The true church—the Jesus brotherhood—is invisible, spiritual, and is characterized by unity, not necessarily by uniformity. Uniformity is the earmark of the physical world of mechanistic nature. Spiritual unity is the fruit of faith union with the living Jesus. The visible church should refuse longer to handicap the progress of the invisible and spiritual brotherhood of the kingdom of God. And this brotherhood is destined to become a living organism in contrast to an institutionalized social organization. (<a id="a58_592"></a>[UB 195:10.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_11))

> The Christianity of even the twentieth century must not be despised. It is the product of the combined moral genius of the God-knowing men of many races during many ages, and it has truly been one of the greatest powers for good on earth, and therefore no man should lightly regard it. . . . (<a id="a60_295"></a>[UB 195:10.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_12))

> If the Christian church would only dare to espouse the Master’s program, thousands of apparently indifferent youths would rush forward to enlist in such a spiritual undertaking, and they would not hesitate to go all the way through with this great adventure. (<a id="a62_262"></a>[UB 195:10.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_10))

> If Christianity could only grasp more of Jesus’ teachings, it could do so much more in helping modern man to solve his new and increasingly complex problems. (<a id="a64_161"></a>[UB 195:10.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_19))

> The time is ripe to witness the figurative resurrection of the human Jesus from his burial tomb amidst the theological traditions and the religious dogmas of nineteen centuries. Jesus of Nazareth must not be longer sacrificed to even the splendid concept of the glorified Christ. (<a id="a66_283"></a>[UB 196:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p1_2))

> What a transcendent service if, through this revelation, the Son of Man should be recovered from the tomb of traditional theology and be presented as the living Jesus to the church that bears his name, and to all other religions! . . . Indeed, the social readjustments, the economic transformations, the moral rejuvenations, and the religious revisions of Christian civilization would be drastic and revolutionary if the living religion of Jesus should suddenly supplant the theologic religion about Jesus. (<a id="a68_510"></a>[UB 196:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p1_2))

> Some day a reformation in the Christian church may strike deep enough to get back to the unadulterated religious teachings of Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. You may preach a religion about Jesus, but, perforce, you must live the religion of Jesus. (<a id="a70_265"></a>[UB 196:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p2_1))

## Revolution with patience and toleration

> You should learn that the expression of even a good thought must be modulated in accordance with the intellectual status and spiritual development of the hearer. (<a id="a74_165"></a>[UB 181:2.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/181#p2_21))

> Melchizedek had warned his followers to teach about the one God, the Father and Maker of all, and to preach only the gospel of divine favor through faith alone. But it has often been the error of the teachers of new truth to attempt too much, to attempt to supplant slow evolution by sudden revolution. (<a id="a76_306"></a>[UB 95:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p1_8))

> The teachers of the religion of Jesus should approach other religions with the recognition of the truths which are held in common (many of which come directly or indirectly from Jesus’ message) while they refrain from placing so much emphasis on the differences. (<a id="a78_266"></a>[UB 149:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p2_5))

## So what comes first?

The graduation from religion of authority to religion of the spirit must begin at the level of the individual seeking to establish a genuine personal spiritual relationship with the God-Spirit-within—one that will be wholly validated by personal experience. Completion of this step requires a fundamental change—the God-Spirit-within becomes our primary authority, our personal friend, and intimate spiritual guide. Attestation to the factuality of that indwelling Spirit is found in more than twenty New Testament verses:

> "Know you not that you are the temple of God, that the Spirit of God dwells in you. ([1. Cor. 3:16](/en/Bible/1_Corinthians/3#v16))

> “God’s spirit joins himself to our spirits to declare we are God’s children.” ([Romans 8:16](/en/Bible/Romans/8#v16))

> "God is love. He that dwells in love dwells in God and God in him. ([1 John 4:16](/en/Bible/1_John/4#v16))

> "For it is not you who speaks but the Spirit of the Father who speaks in you. ([Matthew 10:20](/en/Bible/Matthew/10#v20))

This one step, involving individual development of God-consciousness, is absolutely basic to any upgrading of Urantian religion. It must come first.
