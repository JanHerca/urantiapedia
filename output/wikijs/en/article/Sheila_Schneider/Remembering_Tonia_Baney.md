_By Sheila Schneider, former Foundation staff member, Illinois, United States_

_Editor's Note: Tonia Baney served as Urantia Foundation's executive director from 1996 to 2003. During her tenure, she led the Foundation towards a multi-national framework, which helped increase book distribution worldwide. Her skills and business savvy steered the Foundation through some challenging times, and her warmheartedness created a friendly, family-like atmosphere within 533. We are all grateful for her service and wish her Godspeed during this next phase of the universe career._

I first met Tonia Baney when she arrived at Urantia Foundation for the first expect from someone advising the trustees and helping them create a new organization for members who read _The Urantia Book_.

Tonia and her husband Steve lived on the island of Maui in Hawaii. Tonia had established an advertising agency and was the executive director of the Maui Arts \& Cultural Center. She was also a talented portrait artist. For years, she would travel from Hawaii to Chicago, or wherever she was needed, to facilitate the work of ACT.

As a student of _The Urantia Book_ for over 20 years, Tonia was enthusiastic and dedicated to spreading the teachings in any way she could. And in 1996, Tonia became the executive director of Urantia Foundation.

It was a time of expansion, and the Foundation office took on a new “vibe” if you will. I was her executive assistant and had served as assistant to the previous two executive directors.

Tonia accomplished a lot during this time, and it was a privilege to serve with her. The cover of _The Urantia Book_ was redesigned.

Translation work began on the Russian, Korean, Farsi, Portuguese, Chinese, Hindi, German, and Italian languages. The library book program expanded to include a volunteer, Mark Bloomfield, who traveled the globe to provide books to libraries worldwide. We also opened branch offices in Australia, Canada, France, and Finland to expedite global book distribution.

Tonia began the annual tradition of the holiday party held at Urantia Foundation headquarters. The party gave many readers an opportunity to visit Chicago and the Foundation while enjoying the festivities and meeting the staff and other readers of _The Urantia Book_.

Tonia traveled to many book fairs, reader meetings, and other Urantia-related gatherings throughout her tenure as executive director. When I

began reading _The Urantia Book_, she encouraged me to attend the regular study group meetings at the Foundation, and we had many discussions about how to promote its teachings.

Tonia left Urantia Foundation in October 2003, returned to Hawaii, and pursued other projects including her work as a portrait artist. She also remained a great advocate and promoter of _The Urantia Book_. When I left the Foundation in April 2004, Tonia supported my decision to go back to school and encouraged me while I was earning my bachelor's degree in sculpture.

In 2011, Tonia and Steve returned to Wisconsin where Tonia was born and most of her family lives. When I received my graduate degree in 2014, they came to celebrate with me. I couldn't have been more thrilled that they were with me during that special time.I continued to speak to Tonia and Steve via phone and noticed when Tonia began to lose some of her language abilities. After her Alzheimer's diagnosis, I spoke frequently with Steve, giving him encouragement when needed. When I learned of Tonia's death on February 13, 2023, my first thought was, “I will see you later, my friend!”

Although this is a sad event, my memories of Tonia—her good heart, her beauty both inside and out, her smiles, her generosity of spirit, her calm demeanor, and the twinkle in her eyes—will remain with me for the rest of my earthly life.
