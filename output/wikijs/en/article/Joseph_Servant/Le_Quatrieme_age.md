The characteristics of one age can manifest themselves during other ages, but schematically we have:

The first age: understanding

The second age: knowledge

The third age: wisdom

The fourth age: love

The passage from one age to the next is done by saturation of the previous age; saturation is continually superimposed on completion.

A river never goes back to its source but becomes richer as it progresses; this is how life goes, starting at the level of the flesh and flowing into an ocean of love, the world of the spirit.

The fourth age is the age of pure love—the golden age—the age of living with God who is love and whose will is that we be like Him by being love on our level as He is on His. God is our best friend, in direct and constant contact with us through His divine graft into our mind, our Thought Adjuster with whom we will merge.

How are you doing?

-I like !

To love is a state, an unconditioned state, a state of peace and availability inviting us to adapt instantly and affectionately to the present moment by producing the fruits of the spirit which are:

Service expression of love.
Selfless dedication.
Courageous loyalty.
Sincere fairness.
Informed honesty.
Lively hope.
Trust without suspicion.
Merciful ministry.
Unalterable goodness.
Lenient tolerance.
Lasting peace.

To be thus motivated is to do the will of the Father who is love, it is to follow Jesus who is concerned only with the principles of the interior and personal spiritual life of men; and whose teachings are based on faith and love, and not on the law (ethics and duty).

To love is to be — and to be is to love — otherwise it is to limit oneself to existing.

Love is inseparable from the concept of energy; the person who loves is animated by an additional specific energy.

In the fourth age death appears as the peaceful entry into a fifth age, a new adventure in a life where habits are righteousness and joy in truth. “Life is the prelude to a symphony whose first note is death” (Litz)
