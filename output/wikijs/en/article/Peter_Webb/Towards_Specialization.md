There seems to be a propensity in the latter half of the 20th century towards specialization — of seeing reality in our own particular sphere of endeavour. Each decade has its catch phrase. The eighties seems to be one of economical and material considerations, generally speaking of course.

The anarchy and personal experience of the sixties led a lot of us into the lull of the seventies. The plight of the nineties and into the next century may well hinge on the economic security and the freedom to act.

The scientific and technological age is no respector of persons. Each of the five epochal revelations has heralded an event of world significance. Our present age and the Urantia revelation are indeed of monumental importance. It will only be in retrospect that its full impact will be realised.

One aspect of specialization is a narrower focusing of our energies, until other elements of our existence become channeled into a very narrow band of thinking. Indeed we do focus our minds on God. But what specialization could be more noble? Our feet are on the ground. As well as the spirit of God, we have been given the facts — science and the beauty of true emotions, and all in one dose — truth, beauty and goodness. If we are dogmatic it is not through narrow-mindedness; it is through expansions of existence.

> “If the personal experience of a faither is to be challenged by dogma, then this faith-born son of the experiencible Father may reply with that unchallengeable dogma, the statement of his actual sonship with the Universal Father.” ([UB 102:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p7_7))

We don't have gurus or churches, but we can compete with the best. What greater teacher can we have than God himself in the indwelling Adjuster.

The frustrations of not seeing the URANTIA family grow in leaps and bounds is offset by the quality of its participants. Each person saved is a living treasure. The idea of person to person contact and study groups suggests continual strong growth. The things of the world look after themselves evolution. The things of the spirit show us the meanings.

Our weekend retreat once again showed to me the quality of God-knowing and God-growing personalities on our little planet on the rim of the universe.

Science will cherish and nurture life for its own means. God will cherish and nurture our spirit if we let him.

> “We had rather assume the risk of a system rebellion than to court the hazard of depriving one struggling mortal from any evolutionary world of the eternal joy of pursuing the ascending career.” ([UB 112:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_8))

There was with all of us a quality of personalities on the weekend which was unique, just as all conferences, retreats and study groups are unique. Another aspect of God is shown to us which ever draws inwards to his source and centre.

Jesus was unique, not eccentric. In our small ways we too can share with the uniqueness which is present in God-knowing individuals. A quality which gives immense pleasure to be able to share.
