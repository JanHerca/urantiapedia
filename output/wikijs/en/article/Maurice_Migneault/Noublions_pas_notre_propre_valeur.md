There are already thousands of studies or works surrounding ***The Urantia Book*** thanks to courageous readers seeking truth. Even if we must recognize the undeniable contribution of all these thinkers, we must not forget an important fact: the place we occupy in the universe is unique, and consequently, our point of view is also unique. No one else can see things from where we stand. In addition, we possess a personality that is unique in the universe. Therefore, the spiritual thought of the humblest among us has as much value as that of the most renowned of men.

> . . . You are to let your light shine but do so with wisdom and discretion. ([UB 151:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p3_1))

No one has more power than another to communicate with God. The journey to Heaven is not a race against time to cross a finish line. We are the sons of a Creator and have inherited this aptitude for creativity. If all this secondary work means nothing to you, if for you the use of analogies is more effective for your understanding than philosophical and scientific explanations, if you feel the need to explain things in your own words, this is even more valuable for your growth than standardized and well-polished explanations. Is not the best study for our personal growth that which we make ourselves through our afflictions, doubts and missteps?

> 1. Jesus . . . emphasized the value of utilizing the *analogy* existing between the natural and the spiritual worlds as a means of teaching truth. ([UB 151:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p3_3))

Our understanding of things requires effort; effort that cannot be avoided simply by obediently adopting the understanding that others have had (for their own growth). The questioning itself represents the greatest part of this effort. The question is eternal while the answers we give ourselves are ephemeral.

> . . . Growth is not truly indicated by mere products but rather by progress. ([UB 100:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p1_3))

In the material world, he who shouts the loudest will be heard the furthest. This attitude in our societies is associated with ambition, the race for power, wealth, competition and the desire for recognition. It is on this canvas that our life is painted. But we are also spiritual beings and in this world, we do not have to pray louder to be better heard by God, because He is so close that He hears our prayer even before we offer it to Him.

It is human to seek notoriety and recognition, as is the genuine desire to show sharing and mutual aid, but those who have great intellectual and mental capacities often overshadow those who speak in a softer and more discreet voice, but just as valid. We must therefore never lose sight of our own value, even if we do not always know how to express it.
