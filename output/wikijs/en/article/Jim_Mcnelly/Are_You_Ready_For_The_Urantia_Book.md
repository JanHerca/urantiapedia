_Jim Mcnelly (From An Article In The Brotherhood Of Man Library)_

During periods of darkness when tyrants cast a pall of authoritarianism over the world, it never fails that dedicated bands of volunteers appear unexpectedly to pick up the banner of light when truth and righteousness might otherwise flicker or fade.

Past revelations are filled with testimonies of individuals carrying on when ordained teachers and leaders failed or became timid, missing the opportunities of the ages. Van and Amadon stood tall following the fall of the Prince and remained steadfast for over one hundred thousand years. Adamson carried on when the Garden was no more. David Zebedee gathered a band of workers when others sought only to be served. Steven stepped forward and paid the price as Peter sought to devolve Jesus' teachings into a minor subsect of Judaism. Paul's eyes were opened and, with teachings that worked, turned the Roman world upside down.

Look at what is happening. The sales agreement with the Brotherhood has been cancelled. None of the staff trained in book distribution are left at 533. Less than 5\% of the former Brotherhood has stayed with the Foundation.

It will be years before the Fellowship gathers the scattered Brotherhood into a new sovereign order, capable of undertaking the forbidden book dissemination mission. It is unlikely that the Fellowship will soon regain its sales agency trust. The work of reorganizing the Fellowship will take years, if not decades. These are times that call for extraordinary undertakings.

With no organization left, or on the horizon, dedicated to the dissemination of _The URANTIA Book_, the Blue Rangers have appeared suddenly and anonymously to fulfil the lost mission — to let people know that _The URANTIA Book_ exists and where to find it. The Blue Rangers are a volunteer task force of individuals dedicated to fostering the dissemination of _The URANTIA Book_. It is not the goal of the Rangers to change the Foundation, Fellowship, societies, study groups, or other organizations — each has its own task in the work of the harvest.

Rangers think globally, but act locally. There is nothing to join; no dues to pay. One becomes a Ranger by taking action — by letting people know that _The URANTIA Book_ exists and where to find it.

“Are you ready for _The URANTIA Book_?” is their current theme, a campaign that dares to let individuals make up their own minds concerning the contact of extraterrestrials with our world. No interpreters of the teachings, no proponents of an organization, no defenders of tradition, the autonomous Rangers work on their own, knowing they are carrying on the work of the unheralded ones who came before and will come after. Rangers let others determine for themselves whether or not they are ready for the Great Revelation.

The job of the Rangers is simple: Let people know that _The URANTIA Book_ exists and where to find it. The technique is clear: Tell everyone. Spread the word one on one or in groups any way you can. Go on television and on the radio. Talk to any group that will listen. Don't wait to be nominated by a committee, create your own speakers' bureau! The tools are common. Wear buttons. Put up posters. Pass out literature. Place stickers. Write letters to the editor. Rangers print their own posters, brochures, and other aids.

Keep the message of the Rangers simple: The Book exists and this is how to get it. Introduce people to God and the teachings in your non-Ranger activities. The most simple action of a Ranger is to place posters in a public place that reads: “Are you ready for _The URANTIA Book_? Call 312-525-3319 or write: _The URANTIA Book_, 533 Diversey Parkway, Chicago Il. 60614.” If a local bookstore is able and willing to buy direct, support them by listing the store location as well as the Foundation.

Join the Rangers in working on the demand side of the revelation. There is little point in getting _The URANTIA Book_ into bookstores if there is no curiosity and love of adventure stimulating people to come in and look for it! “Are you ready for _The URANTIA Book_?” is an effective campaign and technique for getting people to ask the most basic questions, “What is it? Am I ready for it? How can I get one?” Once the potential readers have asked these questions on their own, the work of the Ranger moves on. Remember, the authors of the book have already determined that the world is ready for it. We have been the ones holding back!
