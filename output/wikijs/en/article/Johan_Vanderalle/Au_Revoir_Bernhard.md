_Testimony of Johan Vanderalle (Belgium)_

Bernhard and I met for the first time in 1999. From 2001 we chose to follow a spiritual path which brought us closer and we became best friends.

Almost four years ago, at the end of 2012, I proposed to develop together a seminar to 'Learn to know God' or to know Him better. A basic seminar called 'Ecce Homo' was developed, aiming

- To captivate the mind and touch the minds of non-readers (thus not knowing the Book) to the main theme — learning to know God — by responding to their fundamental spiritual needs and their questions concerning the true nature and meaning of their humanity, thus delicately introducing _The Urantia Book_ into this basic seminar course.

- To offer Cectors and study groups a different, progressive and thematic approach with cross-references.

Generously, with heart and soul, Bernhard said: yes!

The teaching we call “Deus-up” — a universal and progressive approach — is based on The Urantia Book, as well as our spiritual journey and personal life experience.

In March of this year 2016, the fruit of our cooperation, which has 350 pages, was almost ripe in Dutch and French. (It was in March that Bernfiard had a first warning)

In recent years, not a day has gone by that we were not in contact. Either we were together for several days in Filly (in the Belgian Ardennes) or in Uccle (Brussels) to finalize what we had prepared or revised as texts, each at his own home, or we contacted each other by Skype, by email or even when there was no contact, we were in contact because we were always busy finalizing the texts, without forgetting the days and weekends when we gave this Teaching together to a dozen people individually and which were a blessing to finalize our spiritual work and testament.

In this way our friendship deepened — a man-to-woman relationship of fraternal spiritual friendship, which I will miss.

This male cooperation would not have been possible on any other level than spiritual. We are so different!

Bernhard avoided the unknown, I chose the thoughtful adventure. I took him everywhere he would never have gone alone.

Bernhard was a genius of synthesis, I want to analyze down to the smallest elements.

Bernhard didn't like cooking, I like to prepare my own meals, and he didn't say no!

Bernhard only tasted white wine, I only drink red wine.

By the way, we are so complementary!

The Urantia Book has always inspired us, I end with a text from the Book UB 5:1.7:

> “Man is spiritually indwelt by a surviving Thought Adjuster. If such a human mind is sincerely and spiritually motivated, if such a human soul desires to know God and become like him, honestly wants to do the Father’s will, there exists no negative influence of mortal deprivation nor positive power of possible interference which can prevent such a divinely motivated soul from securely ascending to the portals of Paradise.” (<a id="a75_430"></a>[UB 5:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p1_7))
