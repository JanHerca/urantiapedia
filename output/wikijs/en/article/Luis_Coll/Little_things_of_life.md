This video is very significant about the little things in everyday life:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=nwAYpLVyeFU#!

It was said of the Creator Son that when he was in this world “**he went everywhere doing good**”. What does this mean? That Jesus rendered a service to God 24 hours a day. His way of living and acting was spontaneous and natural.

To render a service to God, it is not necessary to go as a missionary to the remote jungles of Africa. In the asphalt and concrete jungles of our cities there are hundreds of people who need to be “evangelized” once again.

On our long road to Paradise, and in our personal and spiritual growth, we must start with the little things of everyday life.

**Examples:**

- When we go to a bar and ask the waiter for a coffee, always leave a small word of kindness: thank you!
- When we take the metro or bus, let the elderly, pregnant women or people with disabilities sit down.
- When people return to work on Mondays with a face of circumstances to start the monotonous weekly routine... cheer up, man, Friday will come!
- When we are driving and someone commits an imprudence and our nerves get on edge and we want to sing the forty... well take it easy.
- If we can do a favor to someone in need, even if we can't help them too much at the moment physically or financially, at least leave them a few positive words of encouragement

Cheer up and go ahead, somehow this will be fixed!

And so many more things could be cited about the little things of everyday life.

This is exactly the way of living and acting that the Creator Son had when he was in this world. One of the greatest lessons that we all have to learn, without exception, is to do these things naturally and spontaneously, and not just because a book tells me to or because my religion tells me to.
