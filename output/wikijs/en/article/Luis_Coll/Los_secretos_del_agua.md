Water has its secrets.

Many claim that the Earth is flat, but when we look at the Moon and the planets it turns out that they are round and not flat. All things from atoms and many round shapes that exist in nature tend to be round and spherical: a flower, a sunflower, the trunks of trees and the same stones with the erosion of water acquire round shapes.

Water is essential for life and it also adapts to everything. One of the funny things about water is that if it rains, even if you throw water high enough into the air, it sorts itself out and falls into perfect round spheres. In space, astronauts who are in the IIS (International Space Station) and release water or some liquid in the absence of gravity, that water is also arranged to form round and perfect spheres. Who understands that mystery?

Another of the curious things about water is that it contains **hydrogen and oxygen;** oxygen is the main ingredient for fire and yet **water puts out fire.** Another of the mysteries difficult to understand.

> Technical analysis does not reveal what a person or a thing can do. For example: Water is used effectively to extinguish fire. That water will put out fire is a fact of everyday experience, but no analysis of water could ever be made to disclose such a property. Analysis determines that water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen; a further study of these elements discloses that oxygen is the real supporter of combustion and that hydrogen will itself freely burn.

## Chemical composition of water and fire

**Water** is a substance whose molecule is composed **of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.​** The term water generally refers to the substance in its liquid state, although it can be found in its solid form , called ice, and in its gaseous form, called vapor.​ [Wikipedia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agua)

**Fire** refers to the set of incandescent particles or molecules of [fuel matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel), capable of emitting [heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat) and [visible light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum), product of a chemical reaction of [oxidation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox) accelerated. The [flames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flame) are the parts of the fire that emit visible light, while the smoke is physically the same but no longer emits it. The flames consist mainly of [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide), [water vapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor), [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen) and [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen). If they are hot enough, gases can [ionize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization) and become [plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)).

Experiments have been done with water, so that the water molecules change into very beautiful crystals if they perceive positive and pleasant sensations, and change into ugly and disfigured patterns if they perceive negative and destructive sensations. This has been verified by Dr. Masaru Emoto.

**Masaru Emoto** (江本 勝 '**Emoto Masaru'**[**<sup>?</sup>**](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayuda:Japanese_Language%C3%A9s), [Yokohama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokohama), [July 22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_22) [1943](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1943) − [Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo), [October 17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_17) [2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014)[<sup>1</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaru_Emoto)​was a [Japanese] author(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan) known for his controversial claims that words, sentences, sounds, and thoughts directed toward a volume of water would influence on the shape of the ice crystals obtained from it. According to Emoto, the aesthetic appearance of the crystals would depend on whether the words or thoughts are positive or negative. Through Masaru Emoto's research, it was possible to understand that water not only stores information, but is also sensitive to feelings and human consciousness. When we manage to accept and love our body, it responds and makes us feel united and connected to nature.

**Water was essential for life to be implanted by the Life Carriers.**

> On a planet where life has a marine origin, the ideal conditions for the implantation of life are provided by a large number of inland seas, by an extensive coastline of shallow waters and sheltered bays; and precisely the waters of the Earth were rapidly distributing in this way. These ancient inland seas were rarely more than 150 or 180 meters deep, and sunlight can penetrate ocean water to more than 180 meters. <a id="a64_420"></a>[UB 58:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/58#p1_7)
> 
> We Life Carriers on Urantia had been through the long vigil of watchful waiting since the day we first planted life plasma in the waters of the planet, and the appearance of the first truly intelligent beings and volitional naturally caused us great joy and supreme satisfaction. <a id="a66_282"></a>[UB 62:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p6_1)

The human body is largely made up of water. It is estimated that 65% of body weight is water. The variation ranges between 50% and 70%, depending on each stage of life. But human beings also have a spiritual nucleus that we must take care of and make progress.

> Not only in the realms of life but even in the world of physical energy, the sum of two or more things is very often something *more* than, or something *different* from, the predictable additive consequences of such unions. The entire science of mathematics, the whole domain of philosophy, the highest physics or chemistry, could not predict or know that the union of two gaseous hydrogen atoms with one gaseous oxygen atom would result in a new and qualitatively superadditive substance—liquid water. The understanding knowledge of this one physiochemical phenomenon should have prevented the development of materialistic philosophy and mechanistic cosmology. (<a id="a70_666"></a>[UB 12:9.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p9_3))

> Your religion is becoming real because it is emerging from the slavery of fear and the bondage of superstition. Your philosophy struggles for emancipation from dogma and tradition. Your science is engaged in the agelong contest between truth and error while it fights for deliverance from the bondage of abstraction, the slavery of mathematics, and the relative blindness of mechanistic materialism.
> 
> Mortal man has a spirit nucleus. The mind is a personal-energy system existing around a divine spirit nucleus and functioning in a material environment. Such a living relationship of personal mind and spirit constitutes the universe potential of eternal personality. Real trouble, lasting disappointment, serious defeat, or inescapable death can come only after self-concepts presume fully to displace the governing power of the central spirit nucleus, thereby disrupting the cosmic scheme of personality identity. (<a id="a74_518"></a>[UB 12:9.5-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p9_5))
