Agora is a very successful film about some historical realities of the past, religion, science and astronomy. In this film, based on historical facts, you can learn a lot about the eternal struggle between Science and Religion. Two points of view that have almost always been difficult to reconcile.

Hypatia, the astronomer, represents the image of science, philosophy, which ventures in search of knowledge, of discoveries, of the truth and beauty of things, and tries to preserve this knowledge for future generations.

Dogmatic and institutionalized religions have almost always fought against it. It is a historical fact that Christianity very early abandoned the original teachings of Jesus and became compromised with politics and power. At the same time, politics had to pay a great price and compromise under an authoritarian Church that was quickly taking power under a distorted Gospel and molded to the selfish interests of men who quickly began to call it the “word of God.”

> “_But there is no excuse for the involvement of the church in commerce and politics; such unholy alliances are a flagrant betrayal of the Master._” (<a id="a44_151"></a>[UB 195:10.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_13))

> “_Christianity has dared to lower its ideals before the challenge of human greed, war-madness, and the lust for power;_” (<a id="a46_124"></a>[UB 195:9.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_9))

It is totally intolerable that some supposed ministers of God have dared to bless weapons that would later destroy other human beings; it doesn't matter what religion has practiced that.

Thus, the fierce religious struggles, dogmatism and exacerbated fanaticism began very soon and all under the motto: “In the name of God” or “In the name of Christ.” Shameful and pathetic on the part of authoritative religions, a real backwardness for humanity and a flagrant perversion of the true loving character of the Father in heaven.

In the film, Hypatia does not take sides with politics or institutional religion, but defends the knowledge of true science, philosophy and good human relations, as well as good and human progress. In short, what today have been called humanism. Because of this, the religious hypocrites and fanatics pushed it out of the way and tried to destroy all the knowledge they had in those days.

It is also a historical fact that the religions of this world, corrupted by power, have almost always tried to have totalitarian control over politics, science and knowledge, and have stifled any innovative mind that came up with some new invention and new knowledge. vo for humanity.

We can also see in dogmatic and narrow-minded religion the shameful discrimination of women. Paul was a promoter and defender of this, something totally contrary to what Jesus taught and practiced. Jesus was a liberator from discrimination against women. Jesus welcomed the woman to “the kingdom of heaven” in the same way as men.

> “_It was most astounding in that day, when women were not even allowed on the main floor of the synagogue (being confined to the women’s gallery), to behold them being recognized as authorized teachers of the new gospel of the kingdom. The charge which Jesus gave these ten women as he set them apart for gospel teaching and ministry was the emancipation proclamation which set free all women and for all time; no more was man to look upon woman as his spiritual inferior. . . . And this liberation of women, giving them due recognition, was practiced by the apostles immediately after the Master’s departure, albeit they fell back to the olden customs in subsequent generations. . . . But Paul, despite the fact that he conceded all this in theory, never really incorporated it into his own attitude and personally found it difficult to carry out in practice._” (<a id="a62_866"></a>[UB 150:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p1_3))

For centuries past, progressive-minded men and women have not forgiven Paul for this blunder.

One of the conclusions we can draw from this film is: Should religion mix with politics, power and the things of that world? The answer is a resounding NO.

People who know God, and want to provide some service in the religious field, are called to be ambassadors of a heavenly country, which has little or nothing to do with the things of this world.

> “_. . .you have been called to represent me in the world, even as I represent my Father. You are spiritual ambassadors of a spiritual kingdom, special representatives of the spirit Father._” (<a id="a70_194"></a>[UB 142:7.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p7_17))

> “_Melchizedek. . . the visible Son of God, persuaded Abraham to abandon his scheme of material conquest and temporal rule in favor of the spiritual concept of the kingdom of heaven._” (<a id="a72_187"></a>[UB 93:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p6_1))

Without a doubt, Alejandro Amenábar has been very successful in these historical events of the past. It may be that, as in all movies, there are some exaggerated scenes, but the harsh reality of history has often been like that.

In this more advanced age in which we live, it is a good film as a reference point for religious people, so as not to make the same mistakes of the past.

> “_The modern age will refuse to accept a religion which is inconsistent with facts and out of harmony with its highest conceptions of truth, beauty, and goodness. The hour is striking for a rediscovery of the true and original foundations of present-day distorted and compromised Christianity—the real life and teachings of Jesus._” (<a id="a78_336"></a>[UB 195:9.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_5))
