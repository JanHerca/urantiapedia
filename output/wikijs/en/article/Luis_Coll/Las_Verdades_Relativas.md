What is the truth? Pilate asked Jesus ([John 18:38](/en/Bible/John/18#v38))

Truth is always something relative and transitory. What at one time may be considered true, at another time may be outdated.

Seekers after truth should always keep this in mind.

Many people in this world have embarked on “the search for truth” and after having tried hard, researched and read many books, they still come across this same feeling of what Pilate said to Jesus: what is truth?

The total truth about things, right now for us is almost impossible to find.

Understanding an absolute truth will only be possible after a long path of progress and more advanced spiritual training.

The absolute truth is only available on a level of reality and perfection called Paradise. There the Truth is savored, it is lived within it, they are not just words that the wind takes away.

In this world of ours, the way things are, any person or group that comes out claiming to have the absolute truth is a sham and a hoax.

The truth is always something relative and transitory, what today can be considered the truth, tomorrow can be outdated.

In the dark times of the Middle Ages there was a general belief, especially in the most closed and dogmatic sectors, that the Earth had to be square, and the scientists of that time, with more open and progressive minds, when they took out their light some new truth and when they refuted that the Earth had to be round instead of square, they had serious problems with those dark and shadowy characters from the Holy Office (the Inquisition). Some of them were condemned and even burned for having affirmed this and for bringing to light new ideas and theories about science and astronomy. (See Wikipedia, Galileo Galilei 15641642). Then later, when it was discovered that the Earth was indeed round, that truth and other truths that had already been established plummeted to the ground.

In our current society we can also see how relative and transitory the truth can be. For example, politicians claim that they always tell the truth, especially to get more votes in the elections, but when some case of corruption is discovered and when we see that they can barely fulfill 10% of everything they have promised us, we immediately see that that truth that they have tried to tell us falls $t a ~m$ well noisily to the ground.

And once again, we see that truth is relative and transitory; and so many more examples could be cited.

**The Relative Truths**

- The truth in this world can always be partial and relative.

- What at one time may be considered true, at another time may be out of date.

- You can technically know a fact and yet be eternally wrong about the truth.

- The model of true values and truth must be sought in the spiritual world and in the divine levels of eternal reality.

In this world of ours, any person or group that appears saying that they have the absolute truth is a farce and a hoax. The Absolute Truth is only available at the Paradise levels of reality and perfection.
