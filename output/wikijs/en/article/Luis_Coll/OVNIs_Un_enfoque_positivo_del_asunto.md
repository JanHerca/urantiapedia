The subject of UFOs and aliens is quite current, sometimes so much so that we can find “UFOs” and aliens even in the soup.

The cinema, magazines, films, books, Comics, etc., have done us a trick by presenting ETs most of the time as a kind of aliens and invading monsters. These are creations, novels and fantasies of the mind of the human being himself. But these beings from space - we could call them our older brothers - are not to be driven by the whims of man.

The universe is a place of peace and order, there are no “Star Wars”. In such a large and enormous universe, it is to be assumed that there are other beings and inhabitants, and worlds like ours, some more backward in their evolution and others much more advanced. We are not the center of the universe. Many people have seen these ships in our skies, from peasants and sheep herders to intellectuals, soldiers, airplane pilots. In short, all kinds of people. Some even claim to have been or traveled on their ships, and overall the experience has been a positive change in their lives.

The subject of UFOs is nothing new and is as old as humanity itself. In different cultures and countries we can find “traces” of them, also in very old books and writings. In the Bible, for example, “_the column of fire that led Moses and the children of Israel_” ([Exodus 13:21,22](/en/Bible/Exodus/13#v21)). The prophet Ezekiel's vision of “_a great cloud with encircling fire_” and “_its appearance as a wheel in the middle of a wheel_” ([Ezekiel 1](/en/Bible/Ezekiel/1)) Today we would call that flying saucers. Researchers on this matter could very well tell us that they have found “clues” of these objects in different cultures, books and in-person testimonies from the people who have seen them.

In some historical books and writings from different cultures and in _The Urantia Book_ which was given in 1955, we can also find some clues about the activities of those beings: “_the two seraphic transports_” (<a id="a46_212"></a>[UB 74:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p0_1)), “_arrival seraphic transports_” (<a id="a46_289"></a>[UB 75:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p6_3)) “_a silver cloud approached them and overshadowed the four of them._” (<a id="a46_403"></a>[UB 158:1.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p1_10)) angels, Messengers, traversers of space etc. (<a id="a46_496"></a>[UB 39:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p3_8))

> **_The Urantia Book_ is not a UFO book, nor is it particularly dedicated to this topic. For that, there are already researchers and ufologists who are dedicated to this matter.**
{.is-info}

Another of the great questions debated by researchers, the military, governments, and scientists is the following: if there are beings from other worlds, if they come and show their ships sporadically, why don't they manifest themselves openly and officially? to our world? This question has many people and researchers on the subject of UFOs in suspense.

One of the main reasons why they do not manifest themselves in an official and open way (and many people agree on this) is that we are not prepared for a direct and official encounter with these beings.

It also seems that there is a universal Law that prohibits beings from other worlds that are much more advanced than ours in their cultural, mental and spiritual level, from invading or arbitrarily manifesting themselves in a much more backward world like ours.

The trajectories of these ships in our skies, their very fast displacements, their sudden course turns, the ability to become invisible and their manipulation of energy (which escape the laws of matter and physics that we know) should be enough to show us that they come from a level much higher than human, and probably from worlds and spheres in the universe light years from our planet.

If these ships manifested themselves visibly in a population center, it is most likely that they would cause panic, nervousness, fear, a heart attack, etc. and some religious fanatics and people from some esoteric type groups would say that “the end of the world” has come.

The military world would immediately go on alert, and all the ancestral suspicions and fears of the human being would come to the fore. Have they come in peace? Will they come to rule us by force? Are they not secret weapons of the enemy?, etc.

In summary, right now (year 2010 AD) our intellectual, mental and spiritual level is not sufficiently prepared for an official and open contact with beings from other worlds that may be light years away, much more advanced than us.

At present it has become quite fashionable that there are people of a religious or esoteric type, who claim to have direct contact with these beings and receive direct messengers from them or even from God himself. Or they believe that they are very special envoys and presume to be great “characters” in these matters. They are known as UFO contactees, through channeling, and various methods such as automatic writing, Ouija, astrology, etc. But one has to be extremely careful with what one “contacts”.

The rare manifestations that there are about people who claim to receive “messages” (sometimes apocalyptic and destruction) from these beings and even from the virgin and from Jesus himself include the appearance of and sores and blood; that produces a rather sickening morbid spectacle. Many times this belongs to a deep field of unreliable mental and psychic forces. And as a good psychiatrist who understands these matters could very well tell us, most of the time this comes out of people's own minds due to deep mental concentrations that produce these phenomena. But these elevated beings are not to be managed by the whims and deep mental concentrations of people through the ouija, astrology, channeling, etc. Many times that has brought a lot of confusion and more than one hustler has made a killing with “the subject of UFOs.” Some religious groups or characters have also done crazy things, such as predicting the end of the world and committing suicide and all this “in the name of UFOs” and ETs. <ins>That is why it is extremely dangerous to try to “connect”</ins> with those beings and ships from other worlds and spheres using those methods. Those beings rarely manifest through those methods.

Almost all the people, from peasants to the military and airplane pilots who have seen those ships and those beings, had not prepared themselves at all and it was a real surprise for them to see those ships in our skies.

The very Commander of the Angels and the Seraphic Hosts, Gabriel (what today we would commonly call ET), when he appeared to Mary to give her the news of the birth of Jesus, he did so in the most normal and natural way. Maria hadn't prepared herself for that encounter at all and got pretty scared, thank goodness Gabriel's reassuring words calmed her down.

Another elevated being who was in this world to fulfill a mission, Melchizedek, also came in the most natural and normal way, manifesting himself for the first time to a Chaldean shepherd in ancient Salem (Palestine). “_His arrival was not spectacular, his materialization was not contemplated by human eyes. The first time a mortal man observed him was the memorable day when a Chaldean shepherd of Sumerian origin entered Amdon's tent._” (<a id="a73_441"></a>[UB 93:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p2_1))

## The future

In the future of this world, when the intellectual, mental and spiritual level is higher and the interplanetary communication with other worlds has been re-established, seeing passengers from other worlds arriving at our planet may be as normal as when we now see planes crossing our planets. Heavens, or like when we see a tourist bus coming from another country arrive in our city.

The future of this world is destined to be a better and far more advanced world of advanced intellectual and spiritual training and progress.

The only apocalypse that may possibly occur is the one produced by the stupid human being himself with his damnable wars and with his horrific habit of arming himself to the teeth with missiles and nuclear warheads and biological and destructive weapons. Either there is some large-scale natural disaster such as a major earthquake, some fairly sudden climate change or other natural disaster, or some major global economic or other crisis.

But today we have those ideas from some religious fanatics about God, or from beings coming down from heaven with destructive fire to annihilate the so-called “impious.” Let's also never imagine Jesus coming down from heaven with a flaming sword to take away a few conceited and self-centered people from some religious group or esoteric type who think they are the only ones who are going to be “saved”. These ideas about God and Jesus and “_the end of the world_”, in which God is going to burn this world with fire from heaven <ins>are completely false</ins> and contrary to the true loving character of God and his purpose for the world. man and the future of this world.

In a future age of our beautiful blue planet, the intellectual, mental and spiritual level will be sufficiently advanced, and wars will finally have ended. There will be a Planetary Government, a single religion and a world language, and there will be “**good will among men**”. This era has been described in many ways since ancient times: “_the kingdom of heaven on earth_”, “_the New Earth_”, “_the New Era_”, “_the advanced age of Light and Life_”, “_the New World_” etc

Serious investigators on this UFO issue should be pragmatic and not get carried away by whatever wind or sensational news may blow up in the press or by some individuals. There are many smarties who do not hesitate to make false statements and comments in order to gain some prominence OR cause misinformation. There are also many fake videos and photos and comments circulating on the Internet and elsewhere. These beings (our older brothers, to put it in some way), coming from other worlds and much more advanced spheres, are not to be managed by the simple whims and imaginations of the human being.

Everything in this universe happens with a purpose, normally those interplanetary ships and travelers of time and space are invisible to the human eye, and the rare and few times that they are seen in our skies perhaps they fulfill a fundamental purpose, even if it is to show the man we are not alone in this wide and great universe.

In summary: the subject of “UFOs” is a rather complex subject and there are very different opinions. The conclusion that we can draw from all this is that there are other beings, other worlds and other realities that are quite unknown even to human beings.
