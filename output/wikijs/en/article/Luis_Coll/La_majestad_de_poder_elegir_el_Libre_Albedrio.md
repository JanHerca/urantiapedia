The problem is this: if man with free will is endowed within himself with the powers of creativity, then we have to recognize that free creativity contains the potential for free destructiveness.

And when creativity turns towards destructiveness, you come face to face with the devastations of evil and sin - oppressions, wars and destructions. Evil is a partial creativity that tends towards disintegration and final destruction.

All conflict is bad in the sense that it inhibits the creative function of the inner life - it is a kind of civil war in the personality. (<a id="a42_139"></a>[UB 111:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p4_11))

Mortal man is endowed with free will, the power to choose, and although this choice is not absolute, it is nevertheless relatively final on the finite level and as far as the destiny of the personality that chooses is concerned. (<a id="a44_230"></a>[UB 118:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p6_7))

Without the free will that each person has, there would be almost no possibility of choice, perhaps it would be something like “brave new world” but of automata, a type of mechanical perfection but without much possibility of choice.

But free will also presents a paradox and a big problem, and it is the following:

With the possibility of being able to choose, people can build the best dreams, the noblest ideals, the best projects and the possibility of building and building a better life and a better world.

But at the same time, this free will also allows people to carry out the worst nightmares, wars, clashes and a lot of evil deeds, and choose the paths of evil and make their life and this world a mess.

The political, religious dictators and leaders of the society that we have had have always tried to create a society of automata, all following the same pattern of their political, economic or religious ideas, BUT THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE.

After reflecting on the free will that each one of us has -THAT FREE MAJESTY OF CHOICE- let us choose the paths of good, positive actions, both for our personal good and for the good of others.
