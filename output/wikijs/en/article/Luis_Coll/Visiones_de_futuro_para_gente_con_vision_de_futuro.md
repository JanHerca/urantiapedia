## The cities and houses of the future

The cities of the future should not exceed above all cultural, artistic, fraternity and communication centers between people, and communicated with other similar centers in other parts of the world.

> “_There are five different types of metropolitan government, depending on the size of the city, but no city is permitted to have more than one million inhabitants. On the whole, these municipal governing schemes are very simple, direct, and economical. The few offices of city administration are keenly sought by the highest types of citizens._” (<a id="a42_349"></a>[UB 72:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p2_2))

The big and monstrous cities that we have today are not made to live in so many people, because they produce too much crowding, noise and stress, and that also prevents people from dedicating more time to the simple and calm meditation that is so and so necessary for the health and well-being of people.

> “_At the time of this writing the worst of the materialistic age is over; the day of a better understanding is already beginning to dawn. The higher minds of the scientific world are no longer wholly materialistic in their philosophy, . . ._” (<a id="a46_246"></a>[UB 195:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_4))

> _One of the great troubles with modern life is that man thinks he is too busy to find time for spiritual meditation and religious devotion._ (<a id="a56_144"></a>[UB 195:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_7))

The ideal housing for people should be small houses in contact with nature and natural environments, small self-sufficient agricultural communities with natural and artisanal agriculture and NOT the industrial agriculture that we have today, which does not provide enough work for people and is an agriculture too devoted to speculation.

Solar and other clean energy will play an important role in these cities and houses of the future. Polluting energies (oil, coal, etc.) should be abandoned, as well as dangerous nuclear energy, and bet on and promote clean and natural energies.

> _These people regard the home as the basic institution of their civilization. It is expected that the most valuable part of a child’s education and character training will be secured from his parents and at home, and fathers devote almost as much attention to child culture as do mothers._ (<a id="a66_293"></a>[UB 72:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p3_4))

We all know friends that these things are still very utopian in our world, but at least they should serve as initiative and inspiration for people who want to achieve these goals. The Melchizedeks who revealed this document are an order of very wise and intelligent beings who thoroughly understand human, political, economic, and religious affairs, and they revealed these things in order to promote a better society in our world.

> “_This recital of the affairs of a neighboring planet is made by special permission WITH THE INTENT OF ADVANCING CIVILIZATION AND AUGMENTING GOVERNMENTAL EVOLUTION ON URANTIA. Much more could be narrated that would no doubt interest and intrigue Urantians, but this disclosure covers the limits of our permissive mandate._” (<a id="a78_327"></a>[UB 72:12.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p12_3))
