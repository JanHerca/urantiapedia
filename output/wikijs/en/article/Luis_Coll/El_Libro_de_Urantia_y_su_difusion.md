_The Urantia Book_ is a rather peculiar book, since it has no human author.

The _Urantia Book_ documents were given over several years by a commission of celestial beings through a technique that is not related to spiritualism, parapsychology, clairvoyance or paranormal phenomena. There is no human author behind the _Urantia Book_.

(For details of how these Papers came to be see [History of the Urantia Movement](/en/article/William_S_Sadler/A_History_of_the_Urantia_Movement) by Dr. William S. Sadler, 1960)

Some of the celestial beings who revealed the Documents give us details of the origin and reasons for revealing those documents.

> “_Because of this conceptual poverty associated with so much ideational confusion, I have been directed to formulate this introductory statement in explanation of the meanings which should be attached to certain word symbols as they may be hereinafter used in those papers which the Orvonton corps of truth revealers have been authorized to translate into the English language of Urantia._” (<a id="a46_394"></a>[Prólogo I](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p0_1))

The celestial beings who revealed the Documents used great wisdom to ensure that no human author remained and no one in particular was revered. <ins>_The Urantia Book_ must be understood by its essence and content</ins>, and according to the discernment and spiritual growth of each individual.

Later in the book we can also read:

> “_These papers were authorized by a Nebadon commission of twelve acting under the direction of Mantutia Melchizedek. We indited these narratives and put them in the English language, by a technique authorized by our superiors, in the year A.D. 1935 of Urantia time._” (<a id="a52_271"></a>[UB 119:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p8_9))

_The Urantia Book_ is not related to the fashions of the New Age, spiritualism, astrology and clairvoyance phenomena, channeling, etc., nor with any religion and any political or economic system.

<ins>The mission of the _Urantia Book_ is unique and exclusive.</ins>

It is also not related to UFOs, although _The Urantia Book_ can give many clues about the phenomenon of “UFOs” “_seraphic transports_” (<a id="a58_136"></a>[UB 75:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p6_3)) _angels, Messengers, space traversers etc._ (<a id="a58_224"></a>[UB 39:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p3_8)) This belongs to a field in which there are already serious researchers dedicated to this issue.

## Diffusion and methods

Although there may be many ways to spread and publicize the Book, not all methods are appropriate. Many people and new UB readers are enthusiastic about these truths and have a great desire to go out and proclaim the Book to the 4 winds in print, TV and media and reach the masses. But that is the wrong method of spreading the Book.

<ins>The UB must be disseminated as it came, in a calm and calm manner</ins>, and in a personal way, which is the best method.

There is no systematic and concrete method of spreading the Book. It can come to each person differently; some may be attracted by its philosophy, by its beauty. Others for the astronomical description of the universes, the description of the Universal Father, the IV part -The life and teachings of Jesus, etc.; each person can find a particular facet of the Book that appeals to them the most.

## The personal touch

Most people are tired enough of being sold religious propaganda. To aggressively proselytize the Book is a mistake.

Each cultural level of person can be attracted in a different way, an intellectual person by its depth and content, a religious person by the description of the Universal Father and the Life of Jesus, a politician by some advice that can be found in the Book, a Anyone who is drawn to spiritual themes can find plenty of room for that, and most people for its beauty and content.

## Study groups, meetings and Encounters

Study groups and dedicated reader meetings are an essential part of sharing ideas and personal growth.

> “_One of the most important lessons to be learned during your mortal career is teamwork. The spheres of perfection are manned by those who have mastered this art of working with other beings. Few are the duties in the universe for the lone servant. The higher you ascend, the more lonely you become when temporarily without the association of your fellows._” (<a id="a78_362"></a>[UB 28:5.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p5_14))

## Quality, not quantity

When we go deeper into the study of the book, we feel that we have to acquire a certain <ins>voluntary</ins> commitment to the cause of the Universal Father and his Creator Son. But this commitment is never imposed by obligation or fear.

> “_The Universal Father never imposes any form of arbitrary recognition, formal worship, or slavish service upon the intelligent will creatures of the universes. The evolutionary inhabitants of the worlds of time and space must of themselves—in their own hearts—recognize, love, and voluntarily worship him. The Creator refuses to coerce or compel the submission of the spiritual free wills of his material creatures. The affectionate dedication of the human will to the doing of the Father’s will is man’s choicest gift to God; in fact, such a consecration of creature will constitutes man’s only possible gift of true value to the Paradise Father._” (<a id="a84_654"></a>[UB 1:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p1_2))

_The Urantia Book_ does not obligate anything, but in return it offers a great invitation. If we are willing to enlist in the cause of the Universal Father and his Son, we must do so with sincere heart and motivation, and not out of fear of being punished OR disobeying “the holy Commandments of God” or because “my religion tells me to.”

God Wants Volunteers, Not Recruits:

> “_You would be neither shocked nor disturbed by some of Jesus’ strong pronouncements if you would only remember that he was the world’s most wholehearted and devoted religionist. He was a wholly consecrated mortal, unreservedly dedicated to doing his Father’s will. Many of his apparently hard sayings were more of a personal confession of faith and a pledge of devotion than commands to his followers._” (<a id="a90_408"></a>[UB 196:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p2_7))

The dissemination of the _Urantia Book_ must be in an orderly and calm way, each one in the way in which he feels guided, and in a personal way to receptive and interested people. The only UB that most people are going to read is the one that goes on shoe soles, that is, yourself.
