> Jesus could help men so much because he loved them so sincerely. He truly loved each man, each woman, and each child. He could be such a true friend because of his remarkable insight—he knew so fully what was in the heart and in the mind of man. He was an interested and keen observer. He was an expert in the comprehension of human need, clever in detecting human longings. (<a id="a37_378"></a>[UB 171:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p7_4))

> He never seemed to be curious about people, and he never manifested a desire to direct, manage, or follow them up. He inspired profound self-confidence and robust courage in all who enjoyed his association. When he smiled on a man, that mortal experienced increased capacity for solving his manifold problems. (<a id="a39_313"></a>[UB 171:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p7_6))

> Most of the really important things which Jesus said or did seemed to happen casually, “as he passed by.” There was so little of the professional, the well-planned, or the premeditated in the Master’s earthly ministry. He dispensed health and scattered happiness naturally and gracefully as he journeyed through life. It was literally true, “He went about doing good.” (<a id="a41_372"></a>[UB 171:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p7_9))
