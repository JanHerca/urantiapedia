A harsh reality of this society in which we are used to seeing so many calamities in wars, refugee camps, racism, etc., on the most important people in this world-children. How can you produce better children and young people if the environment in which some children have to grow up and live is already poisoned by hate and racism?

How can it produce valuable results, if the stage on which it acts is already occupied by prejudice, hatred, fear, resentment, revenge and fanaticism?

THE SINCERITY AND COURAGE OF THIS GIRL are worth more than all the weapons in the world put together.

It seems that the leaders we have in this world have been and are totally incapable of creating a better world. They are more interested in political, economic and nationalistic interests instead of taking care of the welfare of the people. In my opinion, the future generations of young people and children that are to come are the hope of creating a better world.

If they don't do it, who will?
