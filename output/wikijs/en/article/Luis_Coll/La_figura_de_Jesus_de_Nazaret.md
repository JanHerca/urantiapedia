Jesus, little Jesus of my heart, how sweet and beautiful you are!

If I had to believe in that kind of Jesus as some cartoonists have painted him, that Jesus so sweet, so pretty, so loving, so gentle and so handsome, with a wax face like a Sunday morning picture, or that Jesus dressed in gold and jewels who only seems to bless the rich, or that kind of Jesus with the face of a bum, if I had to believe in that kind of Jesus I would have become an atheist long ago.

**It is time to show this world what Jesus of Nazareth was like**, the Son of Man, a man among men, a layman without titles or pretensions, of noble and magnanimous character, brave and determined, of whom it was said that he went everywhere doing good.

> “_...The revelation of the truth about God is appearing, and the human race is destined to know the Universal Father in all that beauty of character and loveliness of attributes so magnificently portrayed by the Creator Son who sojourned on Urantia as the Son of Man and the Son of God._” [UB 4:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p5_7)

The dark, sad, and dull Christ in some dark corner of a church does not appeal at all to young and thoughtful people.

> “_The pictures of Jesus have been most unfortunate. These paintings of the Christ have exerted a deleterious influence on youth; the temple merchants would hardly have fled before Jesus if he had been such a man as your artists usually have depicted. His was a dignified manhood; he was good, but natural. Jesus did not pose as a mild, sweet, gentle, and kindly mystic. His teaching was thrillingly dynamic. He not only meant well, but he went about actually doing good._” [UB 141:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p3_6)

There was only one secret behind the figure of Jesus of Nazareth, that he was and remains a divine Son of the loving Father in heaven, who was among us two thousand years ago.

This comment may not please some narrow-minded Christians and religious people, but it is time to show this world the true personality of Jesus of Nazareth in all his beauty of character and lovely attributes.

Or would you rather stay with the plastic-coated Jesus with a waxy face, sad and dull as ever?

I prefer to renew my ideas about Jesus of Nazareth.
