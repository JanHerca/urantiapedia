The universe is an incredibly large place, and we are increasingly realizing it. Today's modern telescopes are penetrating further and further into outer space, deep space, also called the “Ultra Deep Field”, and more and more clusters with thousands and millions of galaxies are being discovered, something incredible.

> _In the not-distant future, new telescopes will reveal to the wondering gaze of Urantian astronomers no less than 375 million new galaxies in the remote stretches of outer space. At the same time these more powerful telescopes will disclose that many island universes formerly believed to be in outer space are really a part of the galactic system of Orvonton._ ([UB 12:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p2_3))

The universe is not just a collection of physical matter, of worlds and galaxies. There are also other levels of reality and other energies. The Big-Bang theory will never be able to satisfactorily explain the origin of the universe.

Other energies also circulate through the universe and there are other levels of reality, not yet discovered by science. Quantum physicists and other scholars will gradually discover some of these things.

> _Life is an adaptation of the original cosmic causation to the demands and possibilities of universe situations, and it comes into being by the action of the Universal Mind and the activation of the spirit spark of the God who is spirit._ ([UB 130:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p4_7))

To give us an idea of the immensity of the universe, the closest star to us—Proxima Centauri—is 4.2 light years away. If you could make a trip to that star with a ship that was fast enough, it would take centuries to reach it. With that we can already get an idea of how incredibly large the universe is.

The universe is also dominated by mind and spirit, which exert superuniversal control over all creation, giving life and breath to all things.

> _The outstanding attribute of the Infinite Spirit is omnipresence. Throughout all the universe of universes there is everywhere present this all-pervading spirit, which is so akin to the presence of a universal and divine mind._ ([UB 8:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/8#p5_1))

> _The source of universe reality is the Infinite. The material things of finite creation are the time-space repercussions of the Paradise Pattern and the Universal Mind of the eternal God._ ([UB 130:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p4_2))

Beyond physical and material creation, and beyond the levels of reality of the universe, extends the so-called zone of Infinity —absolute mystery. No one knows what lies beyond, only the Infinite Creator and the Infinite Spirit can penetrate these vast and enormous zones of Infinity.

> _In brief, the Infinite Spirit testifies that, since he is eternal, so also is the central universe eternal. And this is the traditional starting point of the history of the universe of universes. Absolutely nothing is known, and no records are in existence, regarding any event or transaction prior to this stupendous eruption of creative energy and administrative wisdom that crystallized the vast universe which exists, and so exquisitely functions, at the center of all things. Beyond this event lie the unsearchable transactions of eternity and the depths of infinity—absolute mystery._ ([UB 8:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/8#p1_9))
