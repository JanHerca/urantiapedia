The state of the world is pathetic and pitiful, but all things have their causes and effects. The bad actions of the world and people in general bring their consequences and we see that clearly in wars, political corruption, tremendous economic inequalities, corrupt nationalism, political blindness... and all these things are based on selfishness and self-interest.

Crisis? COVID-19? Conspiracies? Poverty and wealth? The masters of the world? Political parties with magical solutions to fix things? The way the world is going, many people are tired of always hearing the same thing, and all this is not going to be solved in any way and it will continue to be a waste of time until there is a serious and profound radical change. A change in moral, intellectual and spiritual values, and no matter how many times you think about all of this, this world will remain the same if you don't seek other values and other ways of governing and doing things.

There is too much tendency to always blame others: the politician on duty, economic problems, the media, conspiracies, etc. This world will not progress until each individual learns to be responsible for himself and understands that the quality of a better society has to be put into practice by himself in the first place and in his own life.

The world is just the way humans make it, period. «It is the peoples who make the civilizations; civilizations do not make peoples." (<a id="a48_134"></a>[UB 76:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p6_4))

A better society will only come about when people are seriously willing to pursue the high universal values of love and spiritual values contained in the unadulterated and unmanipulated unparalleled teachings of Jesus of Nazareth.

> High civilizations are born of the sagacious correlation of material wealth, intellectual greatness, moral worth, social cleverness, and cosmic insight. (<a id="a52_156"></a>[UB 81:6.38](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_38))
> 
> One of the most important things in human living is to find out what Jesus believed, to discover his ideals, and to strive for the achievement of his exalted life purpose. Of all human knowledge, that which is of greatest value is to know the religious life of Jesus and how he lived it. (<a id="a54_291"></a>[UB 196:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p1_3))
> 
> And the men of many subsequent generations have said the same things. Many intelligent and well-meaning men, even in the more enlightened age of these revelations, maintain that modern civilization could not have been built upon the teachings of Jesus—and they are partially right. But all such doubters forget that a much better civilization could have been built upon his teachings, and sometime will be. This world has never seriously tried to carry out the teachings of Jesus on a large scale, notwithstanding that halfhearted attempts have often been made to follow the doctrines of so-called Christianity. (<a id="a56_615"></a>[UB 154:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p4_6))

The hope of a better civilization can only be achieved through the universal value of love and seeking as a priority the ultimate and universal value that is God, the infinite source of all things and universal and eternal values. Without love, without God, this society will continue to drift. If it wants to progress and walk towards a better society, the world must take more seriously the good news of the gospel of Jesus of Nazareth, not manipulated or adulterated. Materialistically minded and non-spiritual skeptics will always say that a better society cannot be made on the teachings of Jesus.

> The religion of Jesus fosters the highest type of human civilization in that it creates the highest type of spiritual personality and proclaims the sacredness of that person. (<a id="a60_178"></a>[UB 194:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_7))

The challenge for this modern age, if you want to put an end to most of the evils in the world, consists of the mental, intellectual and spiritual regeneration and transformation of the people of this world.
