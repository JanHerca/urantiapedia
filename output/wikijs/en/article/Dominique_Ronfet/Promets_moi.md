<p style=“text-align=center;”>
Sometimes, your hand raised towards the sky<br>
bring down a flame.<br>
Grabbed like booty.<br>
So you think you found it.<br>
<br>
What?<br>
The truth.<br>
<br>
But immediately the fire turns into a sword<br>
who comes to engrave the stone with a few words,<br>
which you then venerate.<br>
<br>
Totem soon to be broken<br>
because it is fire that you want to drink from.<br>
<br>
So with your hand you relaunch your line,<br>
like a fisherman of the heavens<br>
And again you want to catch it.<br>
<br>
What?<br>
The truth.<br>
<br>
But history repeats itself<br>
Endless punishment, or unquenchable thirst<br>
So you go back down into the valley<br>
And seek advice<br>
<br>
First with the shepherd:<br>
<br>
— “Tell me, why do we always thirst for fire?<br>
You who know how to guide wandering bodies, do you know the answer? "<br>
<br>
— “Do you want to expand your house or supply its fire?”<br>
The shepherd replied laconically.<br>
<br>
#Next to the miller:<br>
— “What bread will satisfy me?”<br>
<br>
— “The bread of life will not stop your hunger.<br>
And that's good. Otherwise, love your loaf."<br>
Was the miller's response.<br>
<br>
Finally, with the teacher:<br>
— “What knowledge will satisfy my head as much as my heart and my body?”<br>
<br>
— “Are you looking for knowledge or the experience of reality?”<br>
The schoolmaster retorted abruptly.<br>
<br>
So, like a conqueror, you turned around to see how far you had come.<br>
And the path answered you:<br>
<br>
“Do not look at your tracks but at the sun that always rises before you.”<br>
<br>
Promise me<br>
</p>

**The Truth**

> “The false science of materialism would sentence mortal man to become an outcast in the universe. Such partial knowledge is potentially evil; it is knowledge composed of both good and evil. Truth is beautiful because it is both replete and symmetrical. When man searches for truth, he pursues the divinely real.” (<a id="a100_316"></a>[UB 2:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p7_4))

> “5. Is the *love of truth* and the willingness to go wherever it leads, desirable? Then must man grow up in a world where error is present and falsehood always possible.” (<a id="a102_174"></a>[UB 3:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p5_10))

**Goodness**

> “In the physical universe we may see the divine beauty, in the intellectual world we may discern eternal truth, but the goodness of God is found only in the spiritual world of personal religious experience. In its true essence, religion is a faith-trust in the goodness of God. God could be great and absolute, somehow even intelligent and personal, in philosophy, but in religion God must also be moral; he must be good. Man might fear a great God, but he trusts and loves only a good God. This goodness of God is a part of the personality of God, and its full revelation appears only in the personal religious experience of the believing sons of God.” (<a id="a106_657"></a>[UB 2:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p6_1))

**Beauty**

“Beauty, rhythm and harmony are intellectually associated and spiritually related. Truth, facts and relationships are intellectually inseparable and associated with the philosophical concepts of beauty.” 44:7:2

**Truth, Beauty and Goodness Combined**

> “Truth is coherent, beauty attractive, goodness stabilizing. And when these values of that which is real are co-ordinated in personality experience, the result is a high order of love conditioned by wisdom and qualified by loyalty. The real purpose of all universe education is to effect the better co-ordination of the isolated child of the worlds with the larger realities of his expanding experience. Reality is finite on the human level, infinite and eternal on the higher and divine levels.” (<a id="a114_500"></a>[UB 2:7.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p7_12))
