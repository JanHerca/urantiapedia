Return to his homeland.

Tidy up your house before having a friend over.

To find oneself.

Little dreamer Thumb, find your way.

Calming your body means calming your thoughts.

Your thoughts are born here, in your body: in your belly, in your chest, in your arms... and come to die in a final message, of which only the structure matters, in the strange space of your brain.

Calm your body, rebuild your channels and you will be reborn to life.

That's all.

Don't try not to think, it's a natural function, but let your universe live in this imagination that you see being built.

Have confidence, you are the subject and the master.

You are the subject and the master.

Build, with the images that are revealed, your being, your state of being alive.

Rebuild yourself!

Dominique Ronfet
