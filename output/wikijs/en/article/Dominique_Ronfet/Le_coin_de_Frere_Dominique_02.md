Today I think of the soul, finally, of **my** soul.

Who is she?

Can I “think” my soul?

Sometimes perhaps a grace, a particular well-being can invade us, and then we will speak of the soul.

But is that really it?

There is a big difference between experiencing something and thinking about it.

It is as if we had to integrate, try to unify, contradictory information coming from various sources. Unification of the senses.

Impossible synthesis?

Construction in progress?

Yet :

> “_Always must man’s inner spirit depend for its expression and self-realization upon the mechanism and technique of the mind. Likewise must man’s outer experience of material reality be predicated on the mind consciousness of the experiencing personality. Therefore are the spiritual and the material, the inner and the outer, human experiences always correlated with the mind function and conditioned, as to their conscious realization, by the mind activity. Man experiences matter in his mind; he experiences spiritual reality in the soul but becomes conscious of this experience in his mind. The intellect is the harmonizer and the ever-present conditioner and qualifier of the sum total of mortal experience. Both energy-things and spirit values are colored by their interpretation through the mind media of consciousness._” (<a id="a57_832"></a>[UB 103:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p6_6))

I could therefore not 'think' my soul, but at best be aware that 'something' has happened.

Gee, so like the echo, the echo of a response??
