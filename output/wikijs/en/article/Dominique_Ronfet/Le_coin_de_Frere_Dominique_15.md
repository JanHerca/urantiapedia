- I don't remember who said:

“_The Truth is something that no one has ever said and will never say._”

- Anything !

- Maybe not! Telling the truth isn't simply saying “what is”.

Which, at a given moment, represents the maximum of “reality” but does not contain the entirety of the statement.

- Always your convoluted reasoning.

- It’s mostly about being up to the challenge.

- What challenge?

- That of not stagnating in the murky waters of thought habits.
