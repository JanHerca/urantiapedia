So here comes this much-speculated year, which in a strange _maiutics_ an ancient people would have announced to us as “special”.

It is true that if 2012 resembles its predecessor, the adrenaline of our news bulletins has not finished rising, conservatism has not finished cracking.

And what about UB in all this, you might ask?

If UB was the coming revolution? (Not specifically in the next 12 months but in a “future moment”)

This word (_revolution_) which for many sounds like a catastrophe, nevertheless contains the energy of renewal that our societies seem to terribly need.

There were industrial revolutions, technological revolutions, ideological revolutions, artistic revolutions. We could have fun defining this word as the _dreams_ of some pushing our _evolution_.

What stagnates is bound to die, we know that.

But then what force could come and shake up this conservatism that we love so much?

Conservatism of ideas, conservatism of behavior, social conservatism... I believe that UB has the potential to renew our conservatism (should I say our habits).

In this I would not hesitate to say that he is _revolutionary_.

Let us therefore be vigilant actors in this upcoming movement and not stagnate.

And of course, have an excellent and joyful holiday (past, present or future).
