During our general assembly on May 24th, which took place in Dinard, Brittany, a vote brought your servant to the position of President of the AFLUB. This renewal, linked to the duration of this mandate but especially desired by our previous President, Michel, should allow him to focus his energy on more personal imperatives. But don't worry, he will never be far away, at the heart of our small community.

I must still pay special tribute to the work carried out with him: for 2 years Michel strengthened our structures which, like a tutor, should allow the AFLUB, that is to say all these scattered reading groups, to continue to develop by knowing who to contact (creation of regional intermediaries, hyperactive secretariat, website) and, thanks to our strengthened statutes, better understand our “raison d'être” as an association.

It is therefore in a serene but responsible spirit that I take up this role. With Ivan S, our new Vice President, Max M secretary and Robert G in progressive charge of the treasury, our office will work to bring this “strange” plant that is the AFLUB to life.

In this spirit of openness and exchange between French-speaking readers, I offered Guy, from Switzerland, the position of editor-in-chief of Le Lien, which he accepted. With Jean, from Belgium, on layout and printing, a French-speaking European identity is beginning to take shape around our little world of readers.

I believe that by strengthening this identity, our exchanges with readers from more distant horizons will then be more natural. I would also like to point out the excellent contact that we were able to have in Dinard with Gaëtan, President of the UAI and Line his wife, Vice President of the Urantia Association of Canada, both traveling far from their Quebec.

It is possible that you will hear about a project, still far away but which is becoming clearer, of a **European Meeting** in 2011 which will undoubtedly take place in Marseille. This idea launched by Michel will be one of the flagship projects of the years to come and will require the participation of all for a quality welcome.

But, in the immediate future, Paris will welcome you in November 2008 around the theme: “Jesus, the man”, this session will close the cycle on The Origins of the Individual. Many of you are welcome to submit your work! You will find the details of this meeting on the site http://www.urantia.fr. in the coming weeks

May the AFLUB therefore be a home:
- within which seekers of truth like to meet.
- of readers who warm up to the study of the Urantia Papers.
- of cultural, artistic, intellectual and even spiritual sharing and exchanges.

In short, a home of men and women who dare to take on all the challenges of life and the millennium that is coming. There you have it, I can promise you at least one thing right now: in the months to come the President's message will be shorter.

Thank you for your attention.

In spirit with you.

**Dominique Ronfet**, President of the **AFLUB**
