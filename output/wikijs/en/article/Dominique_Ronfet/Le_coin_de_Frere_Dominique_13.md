- Did you know that a 19th century music composer, Gustav MAHLER, divided his 8th symphony into 2 parts? Taking as sung texts on the one hand the Veni Creator Spiritus, a Latin religious hymn from the 9th century and an extract from the final scene of Goethe's Faust with its Eternal Feminine.
- Ah? And what message do you think he wanted to give us?
- Who can know? Is the Spirit masculine or feminine? How to reconcile masculine and feminine principles?... the eternal question. Profane love, and sacred love... If we discover God through love, is woman the help of man?
- And vice versa!
- Of course.
- It is true that the ***UB*** distinguishes the Spirit of Truth, from the Creator Son, from the Holy Spirit, his associate, the Divine Minister.
- And all this remains “of the Spirit.” P 95 — §7 There are many spiritual influences, but they are one.

<p style="text-align:center;">
“Come, Creative Spirit<br>
Visit the souls of your faithful<br>
Filled with grace from Above,<br>
The courses you created.”<br>
</p>

-The **Veni Creator**?

- Yes, and the last verses of Faust, ending the symphony:

<p style="text-align:center;">
“Everything that must perish<br>
This is just a symbol;<br>
What is unfulfilled<br>
Find your measure here,<br>
And all the indescribable<br>
Here comes true:<br>
The eternal feminine<br>
Towards the Above draws us.”<br>
</p>

- Superb! Upward and downward movement that come together!
- And again, you're lucky.
- How so?
- I could have sung it to you, but then your aspirations would have quickly subsided.
