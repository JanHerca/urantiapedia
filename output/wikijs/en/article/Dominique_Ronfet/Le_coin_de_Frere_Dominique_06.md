What if we meditated on emptiness?

We naturally move towards fullness.
We are looking for the full.
And yet this emptiness surrounds us, is within us.
Emptiness is a bit of our future,
our ‘pocket of the future’,
our potential waiting for...
To be full would be to be complete, fixed, without aspiration, satisfied, quite simply.
Fortunately there is our emptiness.
Fortunately.

> _Thus may the incompleteness of the Supreme be regarded as a virtue since it makes possible the evolutionary growth of the creature-creation of the present universes. Emptiness does have its virtue, for it may become experientially filled._ ([UB 117:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p2_8))
