Good morning,

Today I would like to talk to you about thought.

“You mean mental?”

No, no... of thought. How can we talk about water when talking about the basin that contains it?

To know you have to taste, said - I don't remember who - so let's dive in.

And let's try to understand this space in which, ultimately, we are. We are ultimately only there, as I said... I don't know what.

So how do we swim well? How do we think well? How do we develop and become real thinkers?

> _But with the vast majority of Urantians the Adjuster must patiently await the arrival of death deliverance; must await the liberation of the emerging soul from the well-nigh complete domination of the energy patterns and chemical forces inherent in your material order of existence. The chief difficulty you experience in contacting with your Adjusters consists in this very inherent material nature. So few mortals are real thinkers; you do not spiritually develop and discipline your minds to the point of favorable liaison with the divine Adjusters. The ear of the human mind is almost deaf to the spiritual pleas which the Adjuster translates from the manifold messages of the universal broadcasts of love proceeding from the Father of mercies. The Adjuster finds it almost impossible to register these inspiring spirit leadings in an animal mind so completely dominated by the chemical and electrical forces inherent in your physical natures._ (<a id="a51_953"></a>[UB 110:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p7_6))

Without going so far as to speak of a hypothetical contact with the divine Guest (that's another subject) I am interested in the development of our thinking.

Why is it so difficult to think freely?

Isn't it astonishing that the only space that is entirely left to our will, our thought, is so often restricted by our care, imprisoned by received ideas. And that it seems that we ultimately take pleasure not in exploring new horizons but in consolidating ever more strongly the barriers of the certainties that we develop.

Well, I know, we need these temporary scaffoldings, but wouldn't the real challenge be to dare to think differently by always anticipating a new horizon?

(a colorful formula, but pretty, right?)

So, wouldn't we be real thinkers by combining discipline and creative imagination?

Do we want freedom through progressive integration or prison through repetition of the known? In short:

What do we want?
