This month of April, some may have traveled to Malaga, or are preparing for the UAI International Conference which will take place there from the 17th to the 21st.

The UAI, our parent company as an association, must be considered as an organ of support and encouragement.

If each country must preserve its particularities, each reader must not forget that he is not alone in this world, reading this astonishing collection that is The Urantia Book.

So, don't hesitate, ask us, ask Gaëtan, President of the AUI, about this structure. You will get answers.

The following month of May, everyone will also have noted in their diary the dates from May 7 to 10: Aflu is organizing its first meeting of the year around the theme of love: What is love, what is loving?

Vast and warm question under the spring sun of Sologne, come in large numbers!

The news is therefore about reunion, about communion.

May these be festive and joyful!

Finally, since we are talking about a “key” and, to start this spring in a good mood, I will tell you a little oriental story which also invites us to reflect:

Someone saw Nasrudin searching for something on the ground.
- “What have you lost, Nasrudin?”
- “My key!” replied Nasrudin.

They both then got down on their knees to try to find her.
- “But, by the way, where did you drop it?”
- “In my house!”
- “So why are you looking for her here?”
- “There is more light here than in my house.”

We look forward to seeing you again very soon for a new “treasure hunt”.
