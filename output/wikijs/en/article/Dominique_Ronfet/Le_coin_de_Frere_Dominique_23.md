- ***Why is it so difficult to love your neighbor?***
- ...hmm...Somewhere the Christian philosopher Gustave Thibon says that having faith means accepting to “keep your wound open”. I have the impression that this is also a bit like your answer.
- ***Interesting, in fact loving your neighbor means opening up to “him, to the world, showing your fragility. And therefore a little ”showing your wound", your fears.***
- While we prefer to wander around our inner courtyard and dwell on our problems, while building our little castle.

- Anything. Although...
