- Do you know that our cafe has to close?
- What?! But where are we going to exchange?
- They are redoing the whole building.

I hope at least that one of those cold and anonymous buildings will not be built, in which each tenant seems to strive to think and live like their neighbor.

- Well, the wind is changing. Maybe it's progress. But yes, it's really difficult to think for yourself in this world that always seeks uniformity.
- Let's not be negative, let's just be vigilant like the snake, and flexible like the stork.
- Flexible as a stork? Nonsense. You'll never change! But I like you.
- Come on, one last one for the road: “The spiritually routine soul constantly lowers living truth to stagnant levels of wisdom and into the realm of mere exaltation of knowledge.”
- Your book is really special!
