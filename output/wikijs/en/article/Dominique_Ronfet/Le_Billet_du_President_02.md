**Watteau**, in his magnificent painting “Pilgrimage to the Island of Cythera”, invites us on a lovers' journey heading towards a mythological island.

Likewise, on the return from Chalès, where our biannual meeting took place, will we have found the path, the meaning of the word Love so often used but which ultimately remains so mysterious?

But as soon as one trip ends, another is prepared. It is on the symbolic island of Notre-Dame des Lumières that we should meet this fall to address the theme of our destiny.

And as every house begins with a door, we will reflect on and illustrate (artist, to your tools!) the theme of Awakening (post-mortem).

Summer is coming again, obviously with its trips which are opportunities for everyone to rest, to recharge their batteries around the values of peace and joy, the premises of a meaningful beyond, of a hoped-for elsewhere.

The Lien and AFLUB team wishes you happy, bright and warm holidays.
