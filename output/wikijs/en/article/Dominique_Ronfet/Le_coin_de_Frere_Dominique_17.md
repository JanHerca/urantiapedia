- Hello, still looking?
- I don't know....
- Ahhh, the “I don’t know”, you’re very lucky!
- How so?
- The “I don’t know” is an endless well of knowledge, said...I don’t remember who.
- What if I had told you: “I know...”?
- Do you know anyone who could limit their sentence to these two simple words. No, obviously, it would have been followed by an essential complement, probably long and invasive.

Whereas with “I don’t know…”, the discussion is open, the imagination can work.
- You're very complicated this morning. I haven't had my coffee yet.
- Also, if you had let me finish my sentence, you would know that I didn't know if I was going to work, and with your thoughts, it's certain, my migraine has found a place to develop.

Doubt is no longer possible. And, please, don't add anything!

Dominique Ronfet
