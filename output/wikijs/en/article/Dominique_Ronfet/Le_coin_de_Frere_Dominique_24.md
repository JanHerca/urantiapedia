***- And happiness, does your book talk about happiness?***
- Sure, wait... I'm looking.
***- So you no longer know how to think for yourself?***
- OK, here I go...

Well, let's say that happiness seems to correspond to an overall satisfaction of one's mind.

***- It's confusing...***
- Do you know your desires? Do you know what gives you pleasure?
***- Of course.***
- Happiness seems to respond not to a part of oneself like your desires, but to a totality. I would compare this to the Cosmic Mind and its capacity to apprehend reality.
***- What connection?***
- We have the capacity to know the world in a direct and global way and not simply in a piecemeal way.
***- I don't understand anything.***
- So let's say I'm talking about love.
***- Ah... OK, I find you idealistic, that's better.***
***Would you like another drink?***
- Wait... I listen to my desire... yes.
