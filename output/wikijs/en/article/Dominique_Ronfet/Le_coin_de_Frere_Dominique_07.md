What if we talked about friendship?

The secret garden that everyone agrees to share.

This learning of brotherhood.

Did you know that it is Rodan who talks about it best in the Fascicles?

> _Train your memory to hold in sacred trust the strength-giving and worth-while episodes of life, which you can recall at will for your pleasure and edification. Thus build up for yourself and in yourself reserve galleries of beauty, goodness, and artistic grandeur. But the noblest of all memories are the treasured recollections of the great moments of a superb friendship. And all of these memory treasures radiate their most precious and exalting influences under the releasing touch of spiritual worship._ ([UB 160:4.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p4_12))

> _3. *The enthusiasm for living.* Isolation tends to exhaust the energy charge of the soul. Association with one’s fellows is essential to the renewal of the zest for life and is indispensable to the maintenance of the courage to fight those battles consequent upon the ascent to the higher levels of human living. Friendship enhances the joys and glorifies the triumphs of life. Loving and intimate human associations tend to rob suffering of its sorrow and hardship of much of its bitterness. The presence of a friend enhances all beauty and exalts every goodness. By intelligent symbols man is able to quicken and enlarge the appreciative capacities of his friends. One of the crowning glories of human friendship is this power and possibility of the mutual stimulation of the imagination. Great spiritual power is inherent in the consciousness of wholehearted devotion to a common cause, mutual loyalty to a cosmic Deity._ ([UB 160:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p2_8))

Let’s get to know each other, let’s learn to appreciate each other!

What if we started by experimenting with friendship?
