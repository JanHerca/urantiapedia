- “My dear, what good is a book?”
- “...to jam a door?”
- “But what else?”
- “To raise myself up to reach an object.”
- “?? Well, but that’s all?!”
- “Ah yes, I forgot, to help me fall asleep at night.”
- “But you're incredible! So you don't get any wealth from your reading?”
- “Yes, you are right, sometimes they can help me to know the world better. I can then try to dominate it better. And, sometimes, it works.”
