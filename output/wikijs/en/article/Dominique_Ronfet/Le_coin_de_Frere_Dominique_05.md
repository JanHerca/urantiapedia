Should we contrast the “man of desire” with the “man of will”?

Should we contrast the modern, extroverted and conquering man with a meditative man in search of his desire, of 'his meaning of life'?

(In which direction to live?)

> 3. The personality craving to be like God—the wholehearted desire to do the Father’s will. (<a id="a40_94"></a>[UB 1:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p2_6))

So desire precedes will?
He who knows himself, knows his desire.
Finally, his desires...

(but who knows each other?)

How can we find our way since we have to do what we want? But let's listen to the very lyrical Louis Claude de St Martin and his Man of Desire \*

> “May my immortal and divine growth be continuous like that of my eternal source. It is by penetrating into beings that God makes them feel their life; they are in death as soon as they are no longer in communion with Him. All of you, inhabitants of the earth, rejoice for joy, you can contribute to universal communion. You can, like so many vestals, maintain the sacred fire, and make it shine in all parts of the universe.” Page 4
