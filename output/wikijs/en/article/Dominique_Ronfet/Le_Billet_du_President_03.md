The readers of _The Urantia Book_ represent a composite and motley collection of characters who rely on this revelation to elevate, synthesize, and coordinate their own beliefs. Are we to seek inner unity in outer diversity or comfortable conformity?

For me, there is no doubt, we must live in full recognition of our differences and thus progress a little more in understanding each other, ourselves and the world. This is simply called meeting each other.

This is what we will try to do again during our next meeting which will take place from ***May 13 to 16, 2010*** at the ***Châlès*** estate, near Orléans.

In our study we will explore ever more deeply the morontial lands which are described to us, among others, in ***Paperback 48*** and what will be there “Our morontial daily life”, an integral part of the cycle: “The destinies of the Individual” already started previously. The continuation could be entitled: “The spiritual shores”... Note that this meeting should be the only one of the year 2010, so come in large numbers!

Furthermore, our association will be in an election period, the President, as well as certain positions on the board of directors will be subject to the candidacies and votes of our members.

We look forward to seeing you there, in complete brotherhood.

Dominique Ronfet
