**1) — Common point between Frandalanks and Adjusters**

**the Frandalanks** (subgroup of Power Directors, called Master Physical Controllers):

> “OF ALL the universe personalities concerned in the regulation of interplanetary and interuniverse affairs, the power directors and their associates have been the least understood on Urantia. While your races have long known of the existence of angels and similar orders of celestial beings, little information concerning the controllers and regulators of the physical domain has ever been imparted. Even now I am permitted fully to disclose only the last of the following three groups of living beings having to do with force control and energy regulation in the master universe:” ([UB 29:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p0_1))

Physical master controllers:

> “Not all of these orders are persons in the sense of possessing individual powers of choice. Especially do the last four seem to be wholly automatic and mechanical in response to the impulses of their superiors and in reaction to existing energy conditions. But though such response appears wholly mechanistic, it is not; they may seem to be automatons, but all of them disclose the differential function of intelligence.” ([UB 29:4.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_12))

> “The remaining four groups of the Master Physical Controllers are hardly persons within any acceptable definition of that word. These transmitters, associators, dissociators, and frandalanks are wholly automatic in their reactions; nevertheless they are in every sense intelligent. We are greatly limited in our knowledge of these wonderful entities because we cannot communicate with them. They appear to understand the language of the realm, but they cannot communicate with us. They seem fully able to receive our communications but quite powerless to make response.” ([UB 29:4.26](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_26))

(underlining is mine)

- **the Adjusters** that everyone, after having read the Book, would proudly define as “prepersonal”:

> “And all this necessitates such arrangements for contact and communication with his manifold creatures as have been ordained, first, in the personalities of the Paradise Sons of God, who, although perfect in divinity, also often partake of the nature of the very flesh and blood of the planetary races, becoming one of you and one with you; thus, as it were, God becomes man, as occurred in the bestowal of Michael, who was called interchangeably the Son of God and the Son of Man. And second, there are the personalities of the Infinite Spirit, the various orders of the seraphic hosts and other celestial intelligences who draw near to the material beings of lowly origin and in so many ways minister to them and serve them. And third, there are the impersonal Mystery Monitors, Thought Adjusters, the actual gift of the great God himself sent to indwell such as the humans of Urantia, sent without announcement and without explanation. In endless profusion they descend from the heights of glory to grace and indwell the humble minds of those mortals who possess the capacity for God-consciousness or the potential therefor.” ([UB 2:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p1_7))

> “The Circuit Spirits are related to the native inhabitants of Havona much as the Thought Adjusters are related to the mortal creatures inhabiting the worlds of the evolutionary universes. Like the Thought Adjusters, the Circuit Spirits are impersonal, and they consort with the perfect minds of Havona beings much as the impersonal spirits of the Universal Father indwell the finite minds of mortal men. But the Spirits of the Circuits never become a permanent part of Havona personalities.” ([UB 17:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/17#p5_5))

(here we also find a qualifier which is neither “prepersonal” nor personal)

So both are not systematically recognized as people, ...or “pre-people”.

The nuance perhaps comes from there, when the author of the booklet speaks of “other types of revealed beings” (Link no. 5, page 12; 2nd column...), he means personalities, without nuance.

Concerning the adjuster at our level the sense of prepersonal should be appreciated with humility. I understand it as having a potential to become a personality...but in the meantime it is not one as we can conceive it (assuming that we have a clear idea of it but that is another story).

**2) — Should we conclude that...**

> “All static, dead, concepts are potentially evil. The finite shadow of relative and living truth is continually moving. Static concepts invariably retard science, politics, society, and religion. Static concepts may represent a certain knowledge, but they are deficient in wisdom and devoid of truth. But do not permit the concept of relativity so to mislead you that you fail to recognize the co-ordination of the universe under the guidance of the cosmic mind, and its stabilized control by the energy and spirit of the Supreme.” ([UB 130:4.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p4_15))

> “The great weakness of ancestor veneration is that it promotes a backward-looking philosophy. However wise it may be to glean wisdom from the past, it is folly to regard the past as the exclusive source of truth. Truth is relative and expanding; it *lives* always in the present, achieving new expression in each generation of men—even in each human life.” ([UB 79:8.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p8_8))

It is remarkable that, despite everything, we always seek to stop reality on a “freeze-frame” to take a photograph which we are convinced will have the value of immutable Truth (yet since particle physics we should be wiser...). Our relationship to words and language is a perfect reflection of this.

But it seems we can't do otherwise:

> “Partial, incomplete, and evolving intellects would be helpless in the master universe, would be unable to form the first rational thought pattern, were it not for the innate ability of all mind, high or low, to form a *universe frame* in which to think. If mind cannot fathom conclusions, if it cannot penetrate to true origins, then will such mind unfailingly postulate conclusions and invent origins that it may have a means of logical thought within the frame of these mind-created postulates. And while such universe frames for creature thought are indispensable to rational intellectual operations, they are, without exception, erroneous to a greater or lesser degree.” ([UB 115:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p1_1))

It is therefore fortunate that not all authors have the same point of view.

So are we immersed in an _evanescent_ system, which escapes any final analysis, because it is always in motion and searching for itself?

But let's get back to our inconsistencies. There are undoubtedly more delicate ones to raise...to be continued.
