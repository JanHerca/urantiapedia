Dear friends,

In a few weeks, from **May 24 to 27**, we should meet at the new site of the Domaine de la **Neyliere** near Lyon.

This traditional meeting will this year be marked by the election of our new President. I will indeed pass the torch, after 2 terms during which I hope to have properly served our small community.

We have high quality talents so I have no doubt that our fraternity will continue its work without risk.

So this is the last word I send you in this post and there is a bit of emotion in my keyboard, if I may say so.

But the ship keeps moving!

So we'll see you soon and I hope to see many of you at what should be our little annual party.

See you soon,

Dominique Ronfet
