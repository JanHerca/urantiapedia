Man is an island, surrounded by his fears.
He sees dangerous blades in the waves that touch him.
Man is an island that shelters ferocious beasts.
But he doesn't see them, and thinks he hears the wind roaring in the distance.

Man is an island inhabited by the Friend.
And when his storms have passed,
Let silence return to settle on its lands
He can hear Him whispering.
But does he want it?

Man is an island floating, undecided, on the ocean of time.
The world is thus an archipelago of idiots who ignore each other.
Man is a world, he is free to know himself,
He is free to cultivate his land.

Man is a free world,
It's up to him to know he is free,
It’s up to him to cultivate his land.
Dominique Ronfet
