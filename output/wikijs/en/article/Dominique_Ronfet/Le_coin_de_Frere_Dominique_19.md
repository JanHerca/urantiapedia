“My only freedom is to dream, so I dream of freedom.” (Benoîte Groult)

- Why does the search for freedom seem to be an ever unsatisfied desire?
- It seems that we have difficulty identifying ourselves in this space of freedom.

As it is said: “Freedom is non-existent outside of cosmic reality...” <a id="a39_70"></a>[UB 54:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p1_4)

- In short, always a problem of integrating a “personality”, the “Who am I?” into a “reality” (space) whose rules we discover every day.
- A bit like in a school playground?

I remember that as a child this very small space raised many problems.

- You too have experienced these difficulties in this miniature world:

Who to talk to?

Should I try to talk to girls?

Who is the big guy with his gang?

Should I get closer to them?...?

- Yes, what to do, what to do with our freedom?
