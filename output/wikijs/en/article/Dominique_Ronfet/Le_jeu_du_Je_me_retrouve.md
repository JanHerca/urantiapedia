In the game of _I find myself_ there is no doubt: nothing is certain Little Thumb lender,
Everyone takes the hand that is extended and invites us to a present that was once scattered.
In the beginning was One, then Two, then Three
And the dancing could begin.

Who knows?
Yes, who knows?
Maybe....., but no, it's certain: with two hands in the game of I find myself the intervals are less dispersed.

And the sense of direction regained becomes more harmonious again

In the game of _I find myself_.
