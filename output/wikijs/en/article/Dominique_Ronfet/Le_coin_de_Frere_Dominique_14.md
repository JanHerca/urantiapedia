- Memory is a strange phenomenon.
- What do you mean?
- It seems that our existence is constructed in this “space”.

A bit like living in an apartment but not controlling the clutter.

- ...and that we had to die suffocated under our own rubbish?

Interesting image. But can we talk about space without addressing time?

- The weather?
- His apprehension seems to be due to our capacity to forget: the heavier and more present the memories are, the longer and heavier time seems to us. No?
- We should build a future “personality”, not dependent on our memories.
- Not identifying with the past?
- Do not identify only with the past, monitor your present clutter.
- You're going to talk to me about the construction of your soul, I see you coming.
- I was thinking in passing:

> _Patience is exercised by those mortals whose time units are short; true maturity transcends patience by a forbearance born of real understanding._ ([UB 118:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p1_6))

- Think far ahead and only take the necessary luggage.
- Luggage, furniture, if you listened to us we could pass for happy movers.
- But isn't that what we will be: eternal travelers between two happy moves?
