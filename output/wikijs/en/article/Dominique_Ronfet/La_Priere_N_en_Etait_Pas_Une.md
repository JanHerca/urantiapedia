LITTLE FOX, JUST OUT OF HIS BURROW, MET A LITTLE MAN IN THE DAMP MORNING, SITTING ON A STUMP. HE APPEARED TO BE BUSY WITH HIS NOTEBOOK.

WHAT ARE YOU WRITE LITTLE MAN?

THIS IS MY MORNING PRAYER. A PRAYER, WHICH IS NOT ONE.

YOU ARE ADDRESSING THE BIG FOX CUB,
THE QUIET CRUSH?

FOR ME HE IS THE FATHER OF MYSTERIES.

LITTLE FOX, INTERESTED, THEN ASKS HIM:

BUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY “PRAYER THAT IS NOT ONE”?

I WOULD LIKE MY REQUEST TO BE NOT JUST A CALL WAITING FOR A RESPONSE, BUT LIKE A WINDOW THAT WE OPEN. THAT THE LIGHT THAT SPRINGS OUT OF IT ATTRACTS MY JOY AND MY CURIOSITY

IT LOOKS LIKE YOU LOVE THE BIG FOX CUB.

AS THE MORNING DAWNED, LIFE RESUMED ITS COURSE IN THIS SMALL WOOD. THE EXCHANGE RESUMED:

I HOPE ABOVE ALL THAT HE DOES NOT SIMPLY FULLFILL MY DESIRES, SAID LITTLE MAN, BUT SHOWS ME THE WAY TO MY TRUE NEEDS.

YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR NEEDS? ASKED LITTLE FOX IN SURPRISE.

ONLY THE MASTER OF LIFE CAN ENLIGHTEN ME BECAUSE HE ALONE KNOWS ME.

AFTER A SHORT MOMENT OF AWKWARD SILENCE LITTLE FOX WAS HAPPY WITH A DIVERSION.

HEY, LOOK WHO'S COMING. HEY!

LITTLE RABBIT! JOIN US.

LITTLE RABBIT THEN STOPPED HIS RUNNING. WHY WAS HE RUNNING, BY THE WAY?

YES, LITTLE FOX, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

LITTLE MAN AND I DISCUSS HIS MORNING PRAYER TO THE BIG FOX.

YOU WOULD LIKE TO TELL THE GRAND AUDITOR.

YES, IF YOU WANT.

HE WANTS HIS REQUEST TO HAVE NO ANSWER.

I DIDN'T SAY THAT! INTERVENED LITTLE MAN.

CAN YOU READ US THIS REQUEST WHICH IS NOT ONE? SAY LITTLE RABBIT.

THE SUN GENTLY AWAKENED THE COLORS OF OUR UNDERGROWTH.

HERE IS A FIRST VERSION: COVER US WITH A RAIN OF GOLDEN THAT...
“A RAIN OF GOLDEN?” INTERRUPTS LITTLE FOX.

BUT LET HIM FINISH, SAID LITTLE RABBIT. EVEN IF IT'S STRANGE.

OK, CAN I START AGAIN!?

ASKED LITTLE MAN, A LITTLE VEXED.

COVER US WITH A RAIN OF GOLDEN SO THAT OUR DRIED UP SOULS MAY QUENCH THEIR THIRST.

MAGNETIZED BY THE POWER OF ITS DROPS, LET US GO TOGETHER TOWARDS ITS SOURCE.

HHMMM, BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN. MAYBE A LITTLE TOO LITERARY. SAID LITTLE RABBIT.

THE WHOLE SOUNDS GOOD. AND DID IT COME TO YOU THIS MORNING? LITTLE FOX ASKED POLITELY.

THIS IS MY MEDITATION FOR THE DAY. DOESN'T IT FEEL A LITTLE MYSTICAL ON THE RETURN? ASKED LITTLE MAN.

IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A REQUEST FOR A LOAN AT A PREFERENTIAL RATE, ANSWERED LITTLE FOX WITH HUMOR.

I LIKE SAID LITTLE RABBIT. I AM SURE THAT THE GREAT LISTENER, WITH INFINITE EARS, WOULD APPRECIATE IT TOO. HE LOVES IT WHEN WE MAKE AN EFFORT TO LISTEN BETTER TO HIM.

WELL, YOU REASSURE ME. AND IF THE THREE OF US NOW MADE A SILENT PRAYER? SUGGESTED LITTLE MAN.

UNDERSTOOD, ANSWERED LITTLE RABBIT. I THINK I'VE NEVER SHARED THIS MOMENT OF INTIMACY WITH RACES OTHER THAN MY OWN.

OKAY, BUT I WARN YOU: MY PRAYERS WILL GO TO THE BIG FOX, KNOWN AS LITTLE FOX.

AND THIS IS HOW LITTLE MAN, LITTLE FOX AND LITTLE RABBIT GATHERED SILENTLY IN THIS UNDERGROUND.

AND I ASSURE YOU, IT WAS AN AMAZING SHOW.
