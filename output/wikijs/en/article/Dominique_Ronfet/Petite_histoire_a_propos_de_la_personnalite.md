Our hero, tired, had just returned home. A day of work (“ordinary” he thought) was thus ending. Some music, a bath...perhaps an 'aperitif’. He had deserved it.

In fact our hero was not very satisfied with this day.

Now that he found himself alone, calm slowly returned to him...as well as a surprising sentence that he had read a few days before and had left him skeptical:

> “Personality is a level of deified reality and ranges from the mortal and midwayer level of the higher mind activation of worship and wisdom up through the morontial and spiritual to the attainment of finality of personality status. That is the evolutionary ascent of mortal- and kindred-creature personality, but there are numerous other orders of universe personalities.” (<a id="a43_377"></a>[UB 0:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p5_1))

He remembered some of the events of the last few hours and wondered who had experienced them like this.

Was this 'a deified level of reality'?

He felt that by concentrating his thoughts on this concept he was gathering within himself all these parts, these _little selves_ as he called them, which had invaded him and had taken him far away from what he wanted to be.

“Hmmmm...but who am I?”

For a long time he knew that he would never be able to know himself completely. Barely understand himself. Without doubt discover himself...

But for the moment he was trying to bring all these scattered pieces back to himself. One _little-me_ had been very upset by a remark, another had reacted cowardly to a colleague.

It was like trying to wake up from a deep sleep... He got up from his chair and looked at the starry sky.

“Yes, if I want to serve God I must first identify myself. How could the blind person that I so often am claim to serve anyone?... Seeking my Personality to find God, isn't that the best path? Suppose a friend is staying at my house, shouldn't I have returned home if I want to meet him?,” he thought boldly.

A shiver of evidence ran through him but his thoughts, at the same time as his eyelids, grew heavy.

“Come on, old man! Don’t overdo it. Tomorrow you’ll try... Yes, tomorrow...”

This is how our hero went to bed with wise resolutions and the _feeling_ of a stronger inner unity...while the echoes of a raging television resounded from a neighboring apartment.
