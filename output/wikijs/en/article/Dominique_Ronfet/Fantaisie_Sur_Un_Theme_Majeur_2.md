> Below you will find a Fantasy on a major theme, written in recent days but which results from a constant meditation on a form of “impermanence” of existence.
> 
> It's a complex subject but one that needs to be treated lightly if we don't want to play the connoisseur, that's my opinion.
> 
> At the end of the text itself I voluntarily added 3 extracts from UB which served as a point of reference for this essay.
> 
> And then I tell myself that some who may have lost their footing with my essay, will find a binary balance for their own meditation on these subjects. I hesitated but in the end, it's better.

Who can say?<br>
<br>
If movement is life,<br>
<br>
Peace can only come from adapting to its current.<br>
<br>
Do you think your hand can hold back the wind?<br>
<br>
You know how to analyze its movement, but do you learn to live with its breathing?<br>
<br>
You would like to believe,<br>
<br>
Thinking of the world as an object,<br>
<br>
To be able to identify it, hold it, define it<br>
<br>
But your view is closed, limited,<br>
<br>
How could she go around it?<br>
<br>
You can't be outside and inside at the same time,<br>
<br>
You have to be with it.<br>
<br>
But you have to deal with it,<br>
<br>
And serve twice:<br>
<br>
The Master within, and the Master without.<br>
<br>
The Master outside will ask you for the “tithe of time”:<br>
<br>
Your work in motion, your voice resonating in the vibrant air and carrying your ephemeral message.<br>
<br>
And the one within will guide you by leaving on the ground the seeds of the “tithe of eternity”,<br>
<br>
You know that you must follow them silently and pick them up, then return them to him, because he alone will be able to make them germinate.<br>
<br>
— “But I want to tell the truth!” exclaims our very young knight<br>
<br>
— “You might as well speak against the wind,” the Master within replied ironically, with an immense laugh.<br>
<br>
— “Come, speak, and do not listen to him” said the Master outside.<br>
<br>
And this is how our story has unfolded for ages, like an old cassette reeling off its tale in the future perfect.<br>
<br>
Fortunately the time has come (the time always comes),<br>
<br>
Find its connection,<br>
<br>
And tune our dissonances to the inner tuning fork<br>
<br>
**Phew!**<br>
<br>
The story ends well,<br>
a future seems to be taking shape,<br>
so let's be happy!<br>
<br>
And let us dance in the shadow of the Great Secret,<br>
<br>
Under the Sun of the Beautiful Path,<br>
sprinkled with multi-colored seeds.<br>
<br>
**Moral:**<br>
<br>
Why do it heavily,<br>
Which we can very well achieve slightly.<br>
<br>

> “It is impossible accurately to determine, simultaneously, the exact location and the velocity of a moving object; any attempt at measurement of either inevitably involves change in the other. The same sort of a paradox confronts mortal man when he undertakes the chemical analysis of protoplasm. The chemist can elucidate the chemistry of *dead* protoplasm, but he cannot discern either the physical organization or the dynamic performance of *living* protoplasm. Ever will the scientist come nearer and nearer the secrets of life, but never will he find them and for no other reason than that he must kill protoplasm in order to analyze it. Dead protoplasm weighs the same as living protoplasm, but it is not the same.” ([UB 65:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p6_1))

> “The great problem of life is the adjustment of the ancestral tendencies of living to the demands of the spiritual urges initiated by the divine presence of the Mystery Monitor. While in the universe and superuniverse careers no man can serve two masters, in the life you now live on Urantia every man must perforce serve two masters. He must become adept in the art of a continuous human temporal compromise while he yields spiritual allegiance to but one master; and this is why so many falter and fail, grow weary and succumb to the stress of the evolutionary struggle.” ([UB 109:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p5_4))

> “Divine truth is a spirit-discerned and living reality. Truth exists only on high spiritual levels of the realization of divinity and the consciousness of communion with God. You can know the truth, and you can live the truth; you can experience the growth of truth in the soul and enjoy the liberty of its enlightenment in the mind, but you cannot imprison truth in formulas, codes, creeds, or intellectual patterns of human conduct. When you undertake the human formulation of divine truth, it speedily dies. The post-mortem salvage of imprisoned truth, even at best, can eventuate only in the realization of a peculiar form of intellectualized glorified wisdom. Static truth is dead truth, and only dead truth can be held as a theory. Living truth is dynamic and can enjoy only an experiential existence in the human mind.” ([UB 180:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p5_2))
