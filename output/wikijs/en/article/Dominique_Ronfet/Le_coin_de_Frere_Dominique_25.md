> “_Next to the supreme satisfaction of worship is the exhilaration of philosophy. Never do you climb so high or advance so far that there do not remain a thousand mysteries which demand the employment of philosophy in an attempted solution._” ([UB 27:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p6_1))

- Your book contains strange passages.
- Yes, the search for Truth seems to be an eternal quest.
- But I thought that the acquisition of the Truth was a definitive experience?
- Here is another belief to overcome.

It's like the wine in your glass.

It can be seen under various functions: thirst-quenching, for the joy it will bring you, for its calorie intake...but we cannot reduce it to just one of these aspects.

- So you have to drink it to know it?
- Indeed. So let's not wait any longer.
