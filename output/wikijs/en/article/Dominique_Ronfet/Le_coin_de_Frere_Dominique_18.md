A — How do I know if I’m not dreaming?

B — But you’re dreaming! We all dream our reality.

    — So I can't have faith if everything is just an illusion!

B — I didn't say that, it simply seems that our happiness goes through phases of awakening then falling back into a dreamy semi-consciousness.

A — Doesn’t that discourage you?

B — Not at all: if you accept the rules of the game, you can laugh at yourself, then everything is fine.

A — Humor is therefore very important.

B — It is undoubtedly the universal key that will allow us to pass through many doors.
