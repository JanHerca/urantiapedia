***- Do you really think you can learn something by reading a book?***

- I see you coming. But you're right. No, in fact, you can't really “learn” something. A book just provides a setting, an intellectual journey. It can put you in the right frame of mind, bring you to the door of an experience. But it is not the experience.

***- So what's missing?***

- Who knows? An inner influence, a magical encounter between your desire and your need. That little extra that will crystallize a level in you and add a stone to your building.

***- Here you are again playing the poet. But otherwise what is the use of a book?

- In the area that interests us, the meaning of life, only to reinforce certainties, themselves resulting from conditioning.

***- But your free will?***

- To have true free will you would already have to have an active personality.

***- You are very tough!***

- We'll see. Come on, want another drink?
