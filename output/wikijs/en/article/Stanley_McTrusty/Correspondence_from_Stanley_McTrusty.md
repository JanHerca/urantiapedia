Stanley McTrusty, a long term Urantia Book reader who is a professional mathematician, sent us his thesis on reality followed by a letter in elaboration. First the thesis:

- The Universe and all it contains is Energy.
	Energy cannot be created or destroyed.
	Energy can only be changed from one form to another.
	Therefore: Energy exists.
	Potential energy—absolutely no activity
	Kinetic energy (dynamic)—always has a beginning.
- The appearance of the universe was initiated by a First Cause; brought about by a system of transformations; has laws to control the transformations, and the sustaining of these laws to prevent the vanishing of the universe back into potential energy.
- This system and its laws indicate an intelligence far superior to mankind. This intelligence is responsible for the existence of the universe.
	Therefore: This intelligence exists. (GOD)
- Energy transformations require time and space.
	Time: To provide an interval for the event to take place.
	Space: To provide some place for the event to happen.
- Mankind is an energy transformation. (subset of the universe) Therefore: Mankind cannot be First Cause.
- Universal laws apply to societies.
- Universal laws apply to individuals.
- Proper use or misuse of universal laws (by ignorance or by design) is a matter of choice.
- The freedom of choice makes societies and individuals responsible for their own actions—(free but responsible).
- Choose proper use of universal laws—the results are desirable consequences.
- Choose misuse of universal laws (by ignorance or by design) and the results are undesirable consequences.
- Persistent misuse leads to self-destruction.

This is real religion. Once understood, it frees individuals and societies from the superstitions, wrong beliefs, rituals, the dogma of religious organizations, and from other organizations trying to control through fear and guilt.

Stanley's letter to the editor follows:

I am a mathematician—a left handed one at that. Having been born at a time when everyone thought left handers should be converted to right handers, the result is I am ambidextrous in nearly everything I do. This no doubt accounts for the strange or at least different way I think and do things.

In reference to your comment about ‘energy’ all I can say at this point is that it appears to be the ‘stuff’ God used to construct the universe.

All my life the so-called experts in science, religion, and politics have tried to convince me that there are no simple solutions to complex problems. I never have and still do not believe that this is true.

Complex situations are man's attempt to deceive himself a little and the rest of mankind a great deal. (My opinion—for these reasons):

Complexities—
1. Enable devious persons to hide their true intentions.
2. Provide a means to transfer blame.
3. In religion it provides the means to produce a convincing argument for the need of a mediator between man and God.
4. Provides a means to transfer productivity.
5. Provides a means for distorting or masking truth.
6. Aids and abets the dissemination of false information.
7. Provides a security blanket for lazy thinkers.
8. Etc.

Very complex physical phenomena can be expressed with very complex mathematical equations. By using allowable mathematical laws, the first equation may be changed to an equivalent equation less complex than the original. Through a series of these transformations obtaining less and less complex equivalent equations, we can finally arrive at a very simple and understandable solution to a very complex problem.

After years of accumulating information from religion and science, I decided to apply the mathematical procedures to this information. I reduced this information by trying to eliminate complexities. The rule I used was—is this complexity God-given or man-made—and eliminated the man-made. The result was: The universe and all it contains is energy.

This is the simplest form that I was able to reduce this information. When I got to this point I found myself dealing directly with God. I am absolutely and totally responsible for:
1. Proper use of universal (God-given) laws.
2. Keeping God's commandments.
3. Doing the will of God.
4. Choosing good over evil.
5. Loving God and man.

I found that I have defined a system whereby I can tell if I am choosing good over evil. The greater my skill becomes in making my choices, the greater is my spiritual growth.

God gave me the ability to choose, the freedom to choose, and gave me the responsibility for the choices I make.

To sum up: I need to do the right thing, in the right way, at the right time.

I have great confidence in what I have done and explained because it will help me to drastically reduce my transgressions of the Divine Law.

_The Urantia Book_ states (<a id="a100_27"></a>[UB 2:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p5_3)) “_The Creators are the very first to attempt to save man from the disastrous results of his foolish transgression of the divine laws._”

If just one person really understands what I have deduced in this summary, and if it helps them as much as it has me, I will have my reward.

> Who supplies another with a constructive thought has enriched him forever.
