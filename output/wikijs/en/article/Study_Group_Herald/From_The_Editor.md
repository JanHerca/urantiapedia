<p class="v-card v-sheet theme--light gray lighten-3 px-2">© 1992 The Fellowship for readers of The Urantia Book</p>

We are very gratified by the response of readers to The STUDY GROUP HERALD and feel encouraged to continue developing this channel of communication of the study group movement of readers of _The Urantia Book_.

We find in these pages the JOY OF THE AWARENESS OF THE FATHER'S LOVE. It nourishes The spirit of brotherhood and sisterhood as we set sail on the uncharted waters of a new frontier. Let us take a moment together to meditate in this unspeakable joy and gratitude for the blessings that fill our cup to overflowing.

As to the mundane details of the production and distribution of our STUDY GROUP HERALD, we have the following report:

All work up to the actual printing and mailing is done by volunteers. We are short a few hands and seek individuals to cover jobs that could be done much better by people taking responsibility for them.

EDITOR OF TOPICAL STUDIES We seek help in this department of someone who will elicit and gather studies that are being used in the international array of study groups. The studies need be found, prepared for publication, and carefully“ proofed ”for accuracy of page references.

A remarkable study of the 28 statements presented on Page 556 and 557 from an actual[^0]

mansion world lesson on morontia mota was painstakingly assembled by George Zeuberbuehler, a reader from White Haven Pennsylvania. George gave this topical study to a gathering of the Connecticut Fellowship in September of 1992. It will be presented in our 1993 Spring Edition.

**PHOTO-JOURNALISTS** - The STUDY GROUP HERALD invites photographers everywhere who take photos at Urantia gatherings to send them in. If your group is engaging in an interesting activity, try to get some photos and send them in with descriptions of what went on. We welcome study groups to get photographed and send in your pictures with names, introductions, and some descriptive copy. This will not only make The STUDY GROUP HERALD more interesting, it will help us all to get to know one another.

Janet Farrington, Family Life Editor is preparing a feature for Spring Edition, 1993 on “Aging on Urantia - The experience for individuals and families.” Any readers wishing to share their experiences in this context, contact Janet by writing to her care of The Study Group Herald.

David Glass, Social Activities Editor is readying a feature introducing regional study groups. Send him your study group photos with names and introductions care of The STUDY GROUP HERALD.

**ARTISTS** - We are interested in the artwork of readers and welcome readers to send in their drawings or paintings to share with the rest of us. Any subject is welcome. All that is required is that it can be reproduced well in our printing process. “All the arts of all the beings of the entire universe which are capable of intensifying and exalting the abilities of self-expression and the conveyance of appreciation are applied to their highest capacity in the worship of the Paradise Deities.” P. 304.4.

**MONEY** - We have been receiving enough money from the first two issues to cover the cost of printing. This, however, does not cover the very high cost of mailing in addition to which we have operating costs during the production process such as telephone, photocopying, postage, etc. With a mail-out of 4,000 STUDY GROUP HERALDS worldwide, we aught to be able to relieve the FELLOWSHIP and its benefactors of this expense. It will make for a healthier medium of communication and a happier editor if The STUDY GROUP HERALD were to become financially self-sufficient. When you read this, make out a check to The FELLOWSHIP and write on the lower portion of the check, For The STUDY GROUP HERALD. We suggest $\$ 5.00 /$ year per reader.

Enclosed is my contribution for $\$$ to defray the cost of The STUDY GROUP HERALD.

The falsehoods in any religion or system of beliefs are soon exposed in this environment of extremes. _The Urantia Book_ has withstood all the tests and questions wee have asked of it over the years and it has not been found wanting.
