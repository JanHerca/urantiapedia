## FROM THE EDITOR

_It is very exciting to be part of this movement of Readers of _The Urantia Book_ and to be in touch with so many readers._

_The STUDY GROUP HERALD is receiving a positive response and the seed seems to be germinating. We received almost 80 letters of interest which included $ 831.00 in contributions toward production costs._

_The Cost of producing and mailing The STUDY GROUP HERALD, Vol. 1, No. 1 was more than $ 4,000.00. The difference between costs and income was made up by a single benefactor who, for the time being, is willing to subsidize this nere medium._

Make Checks Payable to The STUDY GROUP HERALD clo The Fellowship and send them in with the cutout form below to The Fellowship, 529 Wrightwood Avenue, Chicago IL 60614._

> “These expressions of love, gratitude, and reverence for the Father and His celestial family are a natural, spiritual overflow of the loving feelings and personal appreciation evoked by the evenings readings. These periods of worship are customarily enhanced by instrumental and vocal music. The sharing, socializing, study, worship, music, and conversation at these gatherings do not take place within a couple of hours, but generally last the entire evening.”
