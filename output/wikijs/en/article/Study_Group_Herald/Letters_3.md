March 12, 1992

To The STUDY GROUP HERALD,

I received my copy of the Herald last week and I started from the beginning to read through as I always do with any book. I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated the efforts of so many people whose efforts were involved in preparing such a work.

THEN I reached the last pages upon which were printed the CLASSIFIEDS. I could not believe what I was reading! There appeared an ad for a book written by Frank Jakubowsky suggesting that this book would tell us more about the life of Jesus as we studied the ASTROLOGICAL influence upon his life. This was very disturbing to me.

I have no objection to anyone who chooses to plan their lives based upon astrological information. I even have good friends who are still fascinated with it. This is a free country and we are free willed beings. I respect that with all my being. But, to be an instrument to suggest to _Urantia Book_ Students that we can learn _more_ about _Jesus_ and _His life_ by reading such a book really “turns me off.” _The Urantia Book_ so very plainly teaches that Astrology is not a valid science for today. It is not even dealt with ambiguously, but definitely. There are at least a dozen references on the pages of _The Urantia Book_ to the fact that Astrology is a _remnant_ of the _superstitions_ of a people who are not informed. (Although many of those people were the “intelligent” of that day.)

Why are we meeting in Study Groups to study _The Urantia Book_? I _know_ why _our_ group meets and studies _The Urantia Book_ and I had assumed that all other Urantia Study Groups had the same reason. We, here in our Knoxville group, have accepted this U-Book to be exactly what it says it is - the Fifth Epochal Revelation. When the new revelation so plainly explains the place that Astrology should have in the history of the evolutionary process of our spiritual growth then why would any Urantia Group who accepts these teachings still give space to a belief in superstitions of our uninformed brothers of past epochs in our history??? (The disclaimer for products advertised does not satisfy me. This is not a merchandise catalogue.)

_The Urantia Book_ does tell us that uninformed man, in his zeal to find instant answers and his human fascination with the bizarre, is still inclined to hang on to some of these superstitions. But, I would think that those of us who have been privileged to have access to the advanced knowledge in _The Urantia Book_ would have passed the stage of dependence upon such “stuff”. To realize that a group of Urantia movement leaders whom I had perceived to be true believers in a _higher_ understanding of truth, has resorted to giving advertising to a book which encourages us to seek understanding of Jesus' life from the words of some astrologer is very disappointing and disillusioning to me. Perhaps you should review the information on pages 973A, 1337A and 1680D. If this is not enough then proceed with all the other references to the subject of Astrology listed in the Concordex.

To The STUDY GROUP HERALD

In my view, the Classified Ad Jesus was a Leo (Vol. 1, No. 2) stuck out like a sore thumb. In this type of periodical, accepting an ad implies an endorsement of the product advertised. _The Urantia Book_ goes to great lengths to discourage the belief in astrology and other superstitions. To include this advertisement would seem to promote something contrary to the teachings of the book. Would the magazine consider similar ads for Tarot Cards, Ouija Boards, etc.? The picture of Jesus as a “Leo” is not the picture of Jesus which _The Urantia Book_ presents. In my opinion, such a picture does a deep disservice to Jesus. Advertising such a book does a similar disservice to your readership.

If the magazine does not yet have a policy for accepting advertising, I suggest that you should formulate one very soon and very thoughtfully.

To The STUDY GROUP HERALD,

This past week I received my first copy of The STUDY GROUP HERALD. It was quite refreshing to read the various articles from international to the home side.

I was enjoying the Herald until I reached the classified section and was extremely disappointed to find an ad pertaining to Astrology.

Turning to (page 1337) of _The Urantia Book_, you will find that Astrology is a superstitious belief. I do feel that this type of material ought not to be a part of the material of _The Urantia Book_, or the Herald.

In the future, I hope your classifieds would be more selective and that money will not be a motivation for printing such classifieds.

To The STUDY GROUP HERALD,

I don't know how many of those who knew Fran [Huntington] are aware of her passing. I thought that if you published this eulogy, it might help get the word out to her many friends in the Urantia movement. Anyway, it made me feel better to write it.

IN MEMORY OF FRAN HUNTINGTON

A very dear friend of mine graduated from Urantia last fall. If you knew Fran, I'm sure you loved her well, as I did.

The first time we met, I had come to _The Urantia Book_ study group in Portland, Oregon for the first time. By then I had lived in Oregon for over five years, in which time I had finished _The Urantia Book_, and I knew not another single person in Oregon who believed or had even begun to read the book. Imagine how happy I was to be so warmly received by someone as charming and witty as Fran!

Fran, my young son, and I were roommates at my first Urantia Conference in Silver Falls, Oregon. For several years after that, my son's favorite expression was her's: “For crying out loud!” To this day, that expression brings back a sequence of funny memories of Fran.

Fran's physical death came as a great shock to me. She was in such great shape that I thought she would live to be a hundred. Now after pondering her life and death for a few months, I am getting over feeling guilty about not being there for her during her last months (I had moved out of state and wasn't keeping in touch). Now I am more comforted by the fact that someone who never had a true life-mate, nor even very much the physical comfort of this world, must by now have both a true love soul-mate with whom to raise the ideal family, and a new body which is whole and well in a world of worship, love, and plenty.

I feel very fortunate to have made Fran Huntington one of the most treasured friends of my life. I know her memory will live on in my heart until I see her again in the mansion worlds.

Bon voyage, Fran. God speed in your new adventures!

To The STUDY GROUP HERALD I appreciate receiving The STUDY GROUP HERALD - and plan to subscribe as soon as I can.

About seven years ago, when in Chicago, I visited the Fellowship Headquarters - and attended one of the meetings there - led, if I remember right, by a young lady - I believe her name was Kulieke though I was unable to meet her.

While in Chicago I visited the Urantia headquarters and was shown all over. I have fond memories of this experience. Im now quite elderly (84) and my resources prevent my typing instead of handwriting.

Next month I will be able to send the five dollars — (How can you do it for so little?) (I decided I could send it now. Ha! Ha!) — in the meantime I will try to reach some of the readers of _The Urantia Book_, and hope to set up some meetings.

I've been away from my home here for several years — travelling to see members of my family in Denver and in Oregon etc. — and am more settled here again.

An 8 week illness prevented my keeping up with my friends of past years, but now, having recovered, you will be hearing from me again.

I've been a reader of _The Urantia Book_ for seven years. Now I'm reading it again for the fourth time and understanding its message even more deeply. I hope to be of more service to the Urantia movement, worldwide. I'm thrilled to learn that it is in Finnish now. I was born in Finland and at the age of two brought to America (Montana).

Thank you for sending the Herald.

I'm so happy to have the joy of reading “about” Urantia even as the joy/jubilation of experiencing is within. Perhaps if I knew your publication schedule I could contribute some written matter not only inspirational but experiential as well.

To The STUDY GROUP HERALD

Hearty, warm, sincerre congratulations to all who contributed to the first 2 issues of our new Herald. It is a welcome, effective study group medium for all of us far-flung readers.

The subject of reading our Book has so many nuances of personality — !

4 years ago, after finishing a 9 th reading and cogitating on something new for the 10^th^, I tentatively began a condensing project which has proven such a delightfully fresh insight that I am wondering if anyone else is doing something similar — undoubtedly with a variety of procedures. .

My routine is — at dawn — to read just 1 section of a paper and to copy a few favorite sentences. By the next morning — after the hours of subconsious winnowing — the key sentence (the most times all) is/are transferred to a bound composition book; and the next section of the book receives its preparation for tomorrow:

Now on a 13th composition book, limiting entries to 1 side of a single page, the other side is being left to eventually add decorations of all sorts ... it will finally be an open, thoroughly personal expression of our weighty tome... which would eventually be so enlightening to compare with someone else's.

My travelling so slowly through 9 readings before needing a variation would probably find a counterpart who tried something else after less ... and went about it in styles innumerable.

A treasured 1986 bookmark memento of the First Annual Yearly Reading of _The Urantia Book_ with the Northern Light Urantia Society of Alaska starts me off with wondering if they are still an active, impressively friendly beacon of light and life; and does all this seem to merit an ongoing dialogue?

To The STUDY GROUP HERALD,

My wife and I are readers of _The Urantia Book_ and members of a study group in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. A fellow member of the study group loaned us a copy of The STUDY GROUP HERALD and I was impressed by the intimate, down-to-earth style. It's wonderful to see the comments of readers in distant locations.

Personally, I have been reading _The Urantia Book_ for 13 years now. I was majoring in philosophy at university when I was introduced to the book. I was 23 and filled with the wonder of life and a curiosity as to the meaning and purpose of human existence. _The Urantia Book_ answered my philosophical questions and satisfied my scientific wonderings, but most of all it gave me an understanding which led to a way of life which philosophy or science could not have shown: The love of our Father and the relationship we have as brothers and sisters. For as I wrote inside my book's cover:

YOU DO NOT HAVE A SOUL 
YOU ARE ONE
AND IN THIS REGARD
WE ARE ALL KINDRED

Please accept my cheque in the amount of $15.00 and place me on your mailing list for The STUDY GROUP HERALD.

To The STUDY GROUP HERALD,

As I was reading through the second issue of The STUDY GROUP HERALD, I felt re-inspired to continue on getting involved in the revelation of _The Urantia Book_. It feels good to hear of others experiencing the revelation and be able to share it with many others of similar feelings.

Keep up the great work. I hope to see you at the International Conference in 1993.

To The STUDY GROUP HERALD,

I am honored to be a part of the readership of _The Urantia Book_ and The STUDY GROUP HERALD. The kingdom of heaven on earth is apparent in the spirit/energy/divine love alive in this publication. Never have I felt such spiritual support. A part of me wishes to write/contact each of the contributors (in some cosmic way I have) because I am deeply touched with the diversity and commonality of the experience of knowing Jesus through the revelation - and the sublime joy of that knowing!

I was particularly pleased to see Mary Daly's writings and photo. I contacted Mary earlier this year, with the help of the Fellowship (Thank you!) and was delighted with her loving and warm response to my questions. I know she was sent by God (and angels doing some serious trekking between South Dakota and Alaska). Her prayers, support, and back issues of THE SQUARE PEG JOURNAL have been helpful and healing.

My contact with readers has been sporadic, but always characterized by love and joyful service. Such is sonship with the Father. What a privilege. What a joy!

To The STUDY GROUP 

This paper is what l've been waiting for! It's like a visit to an old friend.

I have no one I can talk with about the Urantia teaching - no one seems to be interested.

I had a book put in the local library but it is not used. I'm very disappointed.

Perhaps this lady will read the paper when you send it - I hope.

June 9, 1992

To The STUDY GROUP HERALD,

Thank you for sharing about my publication [SQUARE PEG JOURNAL]. I got about a dozen letters and I answered each one explaining the situation as best I could [regarding the termination of publication of SQUARE PEG JOURNAL] and sent them back issues. The demands of family life have continued to grow. Briege can walk now and does not sit quietly while I type but wants to add her own flourishes. And there is far, far more.

...with three of my children in a Catholic school for the first time, I have become involved in something different. Of course after years of homeschooling, they need extra support in this change. But, now that the year is over, I can say they have done very well.

However, I have learned that there are no Catholic textbooks in use, and hardly are any on the market. Except for the catechism texts, all the books are secular same as for the public schools.

Part of the reason is that such books are paid for with public funds, no small matter when the school is struggling to survive in a farming community. However there is a certain lack of vision in this decision. Secular texts, as you know if you have looked at any, are aggressively secular. The silence about God and religion is deafening, and even dishonest. Periods in history when everyone had to make their religious allegiance known on pain of death, are passed over with only a word or two about the secular achievements of their sovereigns. It is as if religious choice and religious motivation had never been a factor in human history ... this is the sort of re-writing of history we had come to expect of the communist world. .

What kind of a Catholic, Christian, or religious education is being provided? Is religious material being provided in a supplementary fashion?

In defense of the truth and in an effort to provide my children and others with the education they need, I have decided to embark on a very ambitious project. I would like to provide a gradeby-grade supplement for the use of either the schools or the parents, so that we may keep our children informed of the truth about history, literature, science, and the arts - that religious consciousness and motivation have been a vast factor throughout most of human history.

You may be familiar with E.D. Hirch's books about cultural literacy. In these you will find the same politically correct nonsense as elsewhere. By second grade, for example, he recommends that children be familiar with “The Night Before Christmas” - But not with the first chapter of Luke's Gospel where we learn what happened the first Christmas. About Jesus, he has less to say than about King Tut, although in his first grade book there is a world civilization section which evenhandedly gives. space to all the world religions. Here he presents. Jesus thus: “Jesus seemed to be teaching that people should work hard, he was kind and led a simple life. ..” “_Seemed ...what_?” Is E.D. Hirsch aware that Jesus had a religious message?

So I have gotten together with a number of people, in writing and locally, and we are working on a “Hedge School Anthology.” For over a hundred years, when education was forbidden in Ireland, those courageous people educated their children behind the hedges. When my great, great grandfather came to this country during the potatoe famine, he not only knew reading, writing, math, and history but catechism and Latin. All learned in secret. Parents can provide for their children if they've a mind to.

What should be in such an anthology? I wel. come any suggestions. Though I have, as usual. the specific needs of Catholics in mind, I hope to be more honest than Hirsch about the genuine religious motivations of men throughout history and all over the world. As you know, the Urantia revelation transforms one's perception of everything.

Perhaps this project will interest some readers. Love,

Mary Daly
