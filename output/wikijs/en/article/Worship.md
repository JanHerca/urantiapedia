“**The God of worship claims all allegiance or none**.”

Worship is **for its own sake**; prayer embodies a self- or creature-interest element; that is the great difference between worship and prayer. There is absolutely no self-request or other element of personal interest in true worship; we simply worship God for what we comprehend him to be. Worship asks nothing and expects nothing for the worshiper. We do not worship the Father because of anything we may derive from such veneration; we render such devotion and engage in such worship as a natural and spontaneous reaction to the recognition of the Father's matchless personality and because of his lovable nature and adorable attributes.

Worship is the act of the material mind's assenting to the attempt of its spiritualizing self, under the guidance of the associated indwelling spirit, to communicate with God as a faith son of the Universal Father.

Worship is the highest privilege and the first duty of all created intelligences. Worship is the conscious and joyous act of recognizing and acknowledging the truth and fact of the intimate and personal relationships of the Creators with their creatures.

Worship is the highest joy of Paradise existence.

Worship is the technique of looking to the One for the inspiration of service to the many. Worship is the yardstick which measures the extent of the soul's detachment from the material universe and its simultaneous and secure attachment to the spiritual realities of all creation.

Prayer is self-reminding—sublime thinking; **worship is self-forgetting—super-thinking**. Worship is effortless attention, true and ideal soul rest, a form of restful spiritual exertion.

Worship is the act of the son's personal communion with the divine Father, the assumption of refreshing, creative, fraternal, and romantic attitudes by the human soul-spirit.

Worship is a personal communion with that which is divinely real, with that which is the very source of reality. Man aspires by worship to be better and thereby eventually attains the best.

The prelude to true worship is the **practice of the presence of God** which eventuates in the brotherhood of Man.
