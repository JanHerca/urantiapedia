## Seeds Take Root In India

There are over one billion people in India, 16 official languages–with English being among the most important–over 1,500 dialects, and significant concentrations of nearly every major religion on the planet. India is a country of contrasts–of modern and cosmopolitan urban centers and innumerable rural hamlets. It has been a center of civilization since ancient times, producing some of the oldest surviving written texts and providing modern India with a rich cultural tradition. Urantia Foundation is pleased to be able to offer the people of India the opportunity to add the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ to this rich heritage.

Urantia Foundation recently completed preparations for its first printing of the English text of _The Urantia Book_ on the Indian subcontinent. In partnership with one of the largest and oldest Christian publishing houses in India, a special edition of _The Urantia Book_ will soon be available in bookstores throughout India. With a fauxleather, gold-embossed cover, in packaging specially designed for the Indian market, this attractive edition will mark the next step in our efforts to seed the teachings among mthe people of India.

Those efforts were begun in earnest nearly a decade ago when Foundation Representative Mark Bloomfield began placing books in libraries throughout India. His efforts and knowledge of this region led the Foundation to participate in several bookfairs in India, with efforts led by Kathleen and Trevor Swadling of the Foundation Office in Australia. These efforts eventually sparked discussions with the Indian Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (ISPCK), a nonprofit publisher and distributor that has operated in India since 1711.

Urantia Foundation was looking for ways to further its dissemination efforts in India. The General Secretary of ISPCK wanted to provide copies of _The Urantia Book_ to graduates of theological colleges throughout India. After the Delhi Bookfair, where preliminary meetings took place, the General Secretary visited Foundation headquarters at 533 Diversey in Chicago. An agreement was struck to print 10,000 books in India, to donate 6,000 books to theological students there, and to distribute the rest for sale in bookstores at a subsidized price of 100 rupees (about US$2.00).

With an agreement in place, the work began of getting the text into print in a region 12 time zones distant from the Foundation's Chicago headquarters. After formatting the new book was completed, including a _Keyword Index_ to provide the theology students with an added reference tool, the text was ready to cross the globe and take printed form. Foundation staff member Matthew Viglione traveled to Delhi in March to deliver the files and to work out the details involved in the printing process.

After a week of meetings and orientation with the publisher's production department and their printer, “any lingering doubt disappeared and was replaced by extreme confidence in their processes,” Matthew said. With such confidence, the final discussions and decisions concerning the printing were quickly resolved. With proofing and final approval of the text completed at the end of April, _The Urantia Book_ will be coming off the presses in Delhi before the end of the school year. The seminary graduates will have their own copy of The Urantia Book, printed in India. Distribution to bookstores will begin shortly thereafter. Field Representative Mark Bloomfield, who was responsible for seeding thousands of Indian libraries, will remain in Delhi to oversee the distribution of the newly printed text.

What an impact this could have! We have embraced this opportunity, knowing the potential effect these programs could have in bringing new truth to millions of hungry souls. Urantia Foundation looks forward to a long and fruitful relationship with our new publishing partner in India. Together we shall reach out to the people of the world's largest democracy.

This seeding of _The Urantia Book_ in India is being made possible thanks to the contributions of generous readers. For approximately $45,000, these books will be spread far and wide throughout India. We hope to continue this program, which will need funding again next year for approximately the same amount. We invite those of you who are excited about this project to earmark your donations for this program.

We hope that you share our exhilaration that the seeds planted in India's ancient soil may one day bear the fruits of renewed spiritual enlightenment.

## Board Of Trustees Election - Seppo Kanerva

![Seppo Kanerva](https://www.urantia.org/sites/default/files/images/Seppo_Kanerva_200.jpg “Seppo Kanerva”)

Urantia Foundation welcomes a new Trustee, **Seppo Kanerva**, who was elected to the Board on May 15, 2003. Seppo was elected to fill the vacancy on the Board created by the departure of **Kwan Choi**. We thank Dr. Choi for his service and wish him well in the future.

Seppo has been a loyal, trustworthy, and faithful servant and student of the fifth epochal revelation since 1976 and has hosted study groups in both Finnish and English for the past several years. He helped to organize the Urantia Association of Finland, and he managed Urantia Foundation's Helsinki office for eight years before passing on that responsibility to the current managers in 2001.

In 1993 Seppo completed the seven year project of translating _The Urantia Book_ into Finnish. As Urantia Foundation's Translation Manager, Seppo has overseen the translation and publication of _The Urantia Book_ into six languages, with seven more nearing completion, and nine additional translations in various stages of development. He also coordinates the work of scores of volunteers who translate newsletters and other communications into many languages. His extraordinary talent and passion for linguistics has been extremely valuable to Urantia Foundation.

During the early 1990's, Seppo was a member of the historic Advisory Committee to the Trustees which enthusiastically undertook the formation of the membership organization, International Urantia Association. As the Chairman of the IUA's Council of National Presidents & Vice Presidents for the past five years, he has served the worldwide membership of the International Urantia Association with grace and wisdom.

It is with great enthusiasm that the Trustees and staff welcome Seppo as a new member of the Board of Trustees. The Trustees are pleased to have someone of Seppo's experience serve with them in leading Urantia Foundation in the coming years.

## Copyright Update

On March 11, 2003, the majority of a three-judge panel of the United States Tenth Circuit Coun of Appeals upheld the jury's verdict in the case of Michael Foundation, Inc. v. Urantia Foundation. They held that the jury had sufficient evidence on which to base its decision that _The Urantia Book_ is neither a “composite work” nor a “commissioned work,” and that Urantia Foundation was, therefore, not entitled to a renewal of the U.S. copyright in _The Urantia Book_.

One of the judges filed a dissenting opinion indicating that in his view, “the district court erred in denying Urantia Foundation's motion for judgment n.o.v.” In his opinion, “Urantia Foundation's renewal copyright is valid and enforceable as a matter of law.”

> “[A]ll things (including evil, potential and manifest) work together for good to all beings who know God, love to do his will, and are ascending Paradiseward according to his eternal plan and divine purpose.” [UB 54:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p4_7)

The appellate decision affects only the United States renewal copyright in the English text of _The Urantia Book_. Urantia Foundation will continue to display a copyright notice in the English book in order to preserve its international copyrights. In addition, all of the translations have separate copyrights that remain valid in the United States and internationally.

Although Michael Foundation, Inc. also had contested two of Urantia Foundation's trademarks, the district court granted summary judgment prior to trial upholding the validity of the trademarks “Urantia” and “Urantian” to identify the publications and services of Urantia Foundation.

Urantia Foundation has sought to make the most of this period of full worldwide copyright protection for the English text in order to carry out the mandates of _The Declaration of Trust Creating Urantia Foundation_: to exercise control over the printing and reproduction of _The Urantia Book_ and all translations thereof.

The U.S. renewal copyright would have provided protection through the year 2050 during which to develop a solid base of readers of the inviolate text. and produce quality translations. As a public charitable trust, Urantia Foundation holds these rights in trust for the benefit of the peoples of our planet, now and in the future. This is a duty owed not only to current readers but those to come, as well as to those who may never glimpse its pages but in the future will benefit from its beneficial uplifting of planetary culture.

For these reasons, the Trustees are requesting the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision. Although the Supreme Court accepts relatively few cases, we feel strongly that it is our duty to future generations to do everything within our power to preserve this revelation intact. We ask you all to join us in praying for the best outcome in the outworking of the plans for our world.

As the original publisher, Urantia Foundation has led efforts to disseminate the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ to the world and to publish, translate, and protect the text. If U.S. copyright protection is not restored, these tasks become increasingly important, and we ask for the help of all who share our love for these inspiring teachings. Together, we can ensure that future generations will have access to an affordable and unadulterated Urantia Book. The Concentric-Circles Symbol and the words “Urantia” and “Urantian” will continue to identify Urantia Foundation's publications and services.

We thank the loyal and dedicated readers who have supported Urantia Foundation. You have blessed this work with your love of the book, your willingness to live its teachings, and your attention to the everyday tasks of disseminating the revelation. You have served on committees, staffed offices, answered phones, raised funds, facilitated study groups and conferences, attended book fairs, hauled and shipped books, called on bookstores and libraries, translated _The Urantia Book_ and a multitude of Other communications, and much more. You have generously given of your time and money to this noble cause. Thank you. You have been needed in the past, and you will be needed even more in the future. We look forward to the challenges of creating a bright future together.

> “In civilization much, very much, depends on an enthusiastic and effective load-pulling spirit. Ten men are of little more value than one in lifting a great load unless they lift together—all at the same moment. And such teamwork—social co-operation—is dependent on leadership. The cultural civilizations of the past and the present have been based upon the intelligent co-operation of the citizenry with wise and progressive leaders; and until man evolves to higher levels, civilization will continue to be dependent on wise and vigorous leadership.” [UB 81:6.37](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_37)

## A New Framework For International Cooperation

“_To foster study of_ The Urantia Book _and to disseminate its teachings”_

When early readers of _The Urantia Book_ came together to form an organization based on its teachings, they recognized that their Protestant Christian backgrounds could have the undesired effect of creating an organizational structure appealing to others with similar backgrounds but lacking the desired international and ecumenical appeal. They sought to “make a sincere and prayerful effort to rise above the bias which is inherent in our backgrounds.”

Through the years, the International Urantia Association has grown and evolved to the point where members are now found on five continents. Linguistic, cultural, and religio-philosophic differences abound. As a result of this wonderful diversity, members have developed a framework through which they can join together in brotherly and harmonious action.

In addition to this experience working with people of diverse backgrounds toward common goals, we also have the benefit of valuable lessons from _The Urantia Book_ regarding the outworking of previous epochal revelations on our planet. The members of International Urantia Association have used this knowledge and experience and integrated it in a new organizational Charter.

The new Charter was adopted effective March 1, 2003, and will operate provisionally until new Bylaws have been drafted and ratified by the members. The primary purpose of the organization is “to foster study of _The Urantia Book_ and to disseminate its teachings.” IUA continues to work in partnership and cooperation with Urantia Foundation in the dissemination of the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ and supports Urantia Foundation's role as established by the Declaration of Trust.

The challenge has been to develop an organizational structure that will permit associations throughout the world to organize and conduct themselves according to their own cultural preferences while, at the same time, sharing certain core principles, goals, and purposes. The international body, rather than governing, carries out activities of common interest to the national associations, such as publishing an international journal, sponsoring international conferences, etc.

The new structure is based on a representative model recommended in _The Urantia Book_ where there is a balance of power among legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The “Representative Council,” composed of the Presidents and Vice Presidents of all the national Urantia Associations, is the legislative body that decides upon the international activities of IUA and empowers the executive body to implement those decisions. The executive body is an eleven-member “International Service Board” composed of the international officers and committee chairpersons. A “Judicial Commission” is available to resolve disputes.

Members of the International Service Board met in Chicago March 7-9, 2003 and continue meeting via email. The Representative Council likewise has ongoing Internet meetings. Due to differences in language and time zone among members, these email meetings conducted with the aid of volunteer translators are currently the best available method for communication.

One new feature of the Charter is the “member-at-large” category. Individuals wishing to join IUA in countries where no association exists, or individuals who live in isolated regions in certain countries where local associations do exist, may join as members-at-large.

We thank those who worked for three years to creatively integrate the fruit of our early experience into the current organizational structure. As their work progressed, the group was successively expanded to incorporate a wider variety of viewpoints. In the final months several other individuals were added to finalize details and to ensure that the Charter was sufficiently flexible to work within the laws of diverse areas of the world where associations may form. Kudos to Charter Committee Chairperson Jo Anne King and to members Travis Binion, Cathy Jones, Seppo Kanerva, Jay Peregrine and Nancy Shaffer, as well as Tonia Baney, Mo Siegel, Kathleen Swadling, Mindy Williams, and the many others who contributed to this process.

This Charter heralds a new era for the IUA and provides many more opportunities for service in the growing family of Urantia Book readers. _The Urantia Book_ reveals a pattern common to past epochal revelations: Devoted individuals, who had received new truths, trained and systematically planned for the infusion of the new teachings into the societies and cultures of their times. IUA provides a framework within which those who have received the teachings revealed in _The Urantia Book_ can band together in teams and work with a spirit of unity and cooperation for the service of mankind.

## Transforming Disappointment To Triumph

In our efforts to become a worldwide organization, we at Urantia Foundation are learning many valuable lessons. The challenging goal of this small, charitable foundation to increasingly become international in distribution and printing is not proceeding without some disappointments. But “obstacles only challenge the exertions of the undaunted kingdom builder.” (1740:8)

We have long been challenged by the high prices charged for _El libro de Urantia_ by bookstores in Latin America. Import duties and high shipping costs have added considerably to the ultimate price charged to consumers. These import costs are typically more than the cost of producing the book.

Urantia Foundation has continually sought ways to make the book more affordable to the public. In recent years we have reached favorable agreements with some of the largest distributors in Latin America. Under these agreements, Urantia Foundation heavily discounts the book and ships in large quantities in order to make the book more broadly available in bookstores at lower prices than when we depended solely upon smaller distributors and direct sales to bookstores.

We recently took another step to reduce the price of _El libro de Urantia_ in Latin America by contracting with one of the most respected companies in South America to print _El libro de Urantia_. Our goal was to further reduce the price of the book by eliminating import duties within Latin America and significantly reducing shipping costs.

Our first experience with the new printer, however, was somewhat disappointing. Although they still contained the complete text of _El libro de Urantia_, many failed to meet Urantia Foundation's quality standards for sale in the book industry due to uneven page margins.

We are inspired by the teachings of _The Urantia Book_, and we are attempting to become “experienced in the skillful wresting of victory from the very jaws of defeat \[and\] . . . learning how to transform the difficulties of time into the triumphs of eternity.” (1405:4) We ask your help to transform a disappointment into an opportunity for spreading the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ throughout the Spanish-speaking world.

We were able to negotiate a favorable resolution of the quality issues with the printer and now have a large quantity of _El libro de Urantia_ available for distribution as gift books. In an area of the world where so many people are struggling to meet basic needs, and where there is also such a strong interest in _El libro de Urantia_ and so many devoted readers who can make use of these low-cost books, we cannot help but consider this a blessing to have these books available for distribution.

Many willing workers are in place to make optimum use of these surplus books, but unfortunately they do not have financial resources to devote to this project. We are, therefore, seeking financial contributions from those who are able to support this work.

Just $12.00 per book-$120 per case of ten-will cover the costs to send these books to readers and study groups in Latin America. We invite individuals, Urantia Associations, Fellowship Societies, and study groups to fund this program as co-sponsors with Urantia Foundation. A small contribution can go a long way toward making _El libro de Urantia_ widely available in many troubled areas at a time of economic hardship for so many. Your gift can transform this challenge into an opportunity.

> “[T]hese angels been father to many disappointments, and they will point out that sometimes your most disappointing disappointments have become your greatest blessings.” [UB 48:6.36](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p6_36)

## Experience Introducing Le Livre d'Urantia In Québec

Colette Pelletier

For many years, Urantia Foundation has worked closely with a book distributor in Québec that distributes _Le Livre d'Urantia_. Colette Pelletier and Richard Doré, Managers of Urantia Foundation's office in Québec, recently met with the company's sales representatives to coach them on ways to answer questions from bookstore owners about _The Urantia Book_ and to explain why _Le Livre d'Urantia_ would be relevant as a stock item in their customers' bookstores.

The sales representatives responded positively to this information and gave assurances of their cooperation. They also offered to collaborate with our staff by helping to connect them with bookstore owners interested in hosting introductory presentations on _The Urantia Book_ for their clientele. As a result of these efforts, several introductory presentations have already been held.

A team of volunteers has also been helping Urantia Foundation by arranging a large number of exhibitions of _Le Livre d'Urantia_ at book fairs and other local events. Participation in these events is funded and supported by the L'Association Urantia d'Québec, and the participants have gained valuable experience in introducing _The Urantia Book_.

A brainstorming session and in-depth discussions on the experiences gleaned from these events were held at a recent readers' summer meeting in Québec. As a result, a team was formed to design and create a more formalized introductory presentation based on the most frequently asked questions and supported by educational material and graphics on PowerPoint slides. The presentation is now ready to be used at special meetings held at book fairs, bookstores, and libraries.

Colette recently declared, “We are beneficiaries of this service project, as it has demanded an intense and profound reflection on the subject matter of the book as well as providing regular opportunities to work with one another in teams. All this has resulted in an enhanced appreciation of the revelation and of one another in addition to the opportunity to introduce others to the transforming teachings of _The Urantia Book_.”

## Spring Cleaning

Spring cleaning is a time-honored tradition. Would you help us with a spring cleanup of our reader database so that we can save mailing costs and provide more reliable referrals to individuals who contact us? Keeping our mailing list clean saves money and helps us to serve you better!

We enjoy connecting readers to other readers and study groups worldwide. This service is the most personally fulfilling duty of the Reader Services Department. Sharing our comprehension of the teachings with others increases social and spiritual insight and expands our circle of Father-seeking friends.

Our ability to provide this service suffers when the readers on our mailing list fail to inform our office when they move or Change their Phone number or email address. Without current contact information, we are hampered in our efforts to assist enthusiastic readers looking to socialize their understandings of the teachings.

Please take a moment to examine your mailing address on this newsletter. We have included a code that indicates your status in our database. If you see an “R” after your name, this means you have given us permission to give your Phone number and email address to individuals in your area who are seeking other readers. If there is an “G” after your name, it means you have informed us that you are hosting a study group.

If you are willing to serve as a referral contact or are currently hosting a study group focused on _The Urantia Book_ but are not currently designated as such in our database, please retum the enclosed card. Also, please notify us when you move or otherwise update your contact information. It will save us precious funds in wasted mail and retum fees.

Thank you for taking the time to return the attached form with your updates!
