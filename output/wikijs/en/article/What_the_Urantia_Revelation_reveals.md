## What is its primary message???

_The goal of human self-realization should be spiritual, not material. The only realities worth striving for are divine, spiritual, and eternal._

The mission of our indwelling God-Spirit chiefly concerns **the future life**, not this life.

**Much of our past life and its memories, having neither spiritual meaning nor morontia value, will perish** with the material brain; much of the material experience will pass away as onetime scaffolding which, having bridged us over to the morontia level, no longer serves a purpose in the universe (_morontia is a post-material but pre-spirit state of reality_).

Mankind is very nearly wholly material.

Meanings are derived from a combination of recognition and understanding. **Meanings are non-existent in a wholly sensory or material world**. Meanings and values are only perceived in the inner or supernatural spheres of human experience.

**Mankind’s true destiny consists in the creation of new and spirit goals,** and then in responding to the cosmic allurements of such supernal goals of non-material value.

**Spiritual destiny is dependent on faith, love, and devotion to truth—hunger and thirst for righteousness—the whole-hearted desire to find God and be like him.**

When the spiritual tests of greatness are applied…the quality of unselfishness revealed in disinterested labor for the welfare of one’s earthly fellows is the real measure of planetary greatness.

Actual spiritual status is the measure of Deity attainment—attunement with the indwelling God-Spirit. The achievement of **finality of spirituality** is equivalent to the attainment of the maximum of reality, the **maximum of God-likeness**. Eternal life is the endless quest for infinite values.

[Neither our worldly possessions nor those worldly experiences that lack spiritual value survive our transition to the mansion worlds. God-likeness is the standard for estimating spiritual value—and the spiritual life of Jesus is our finest example.]
