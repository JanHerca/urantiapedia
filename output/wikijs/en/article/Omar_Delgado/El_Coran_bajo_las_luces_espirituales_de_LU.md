## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

I thank God the Father as the First Source and Center of us all for giving me the opportunity to contribute a small grain of sand to this epochal revelation, _The Urantia Book_.

My thanks also to those who helped complete the written work, especially Andrés Delgado and Leonardo Delgado, my brothers.

These concordances are dedicated to our Creator Father who as Son of Man-Jesus of Nazareth set foot on this world for his spiritual gift to men and who with his Hindu disciple, Ganid, compiled in the great library of Alexandria a series of teachings of the time and extracted the best texts of spiritual edification from the religious and philosophical books of that time (Paper 131 of _The Urantia Book_).

This collection of quotes is dedicated to all sincere spiritual seekers of the Muslim religion and all branches of Islam and its philosophy, to broaden their spiritual horizons and better understand the Father of us all, the Creator of the universes.

Finally, may the Spirit of God in your hearts enlighten you, may you immerse yourself in the spiritual teachings of revelation and find the treasures that lie within its pages, and may you become a guiding light and become new children of the spirit, a new human being.

## INTRODUCTION

Spiritual manifestations from on High are the revelations that carry forward progressive civilization. This collection of quotes from the Quran and The Urantia Book is intended to broaden the spiritual horizons of every sincere believer in the Truth of this faith, nascent in the 6th century AD by Muhammad. Jesus said: The Father always sends messengers or revelations to each generation of humanity, without forgetting anyone, to expand and refresh the spiritual message of the Kingdom.

_Praises to God, Lord of the worlds._

The _Quran_ begins with these poetic verses (ayats or verses) a new way of knowing the Universal Father for the 6th century AD. From the evolutionary point of view, the human mind is preparing itself, either for a new revelation or for a new way of understanding the heavenly Father.

The ceaseless work of the mind adjutants, the spirit of worship, and the wisdom adjutant ([UB 36:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5_6)), show the fruit of long-range human understanding.

The term God (Allah) is new at that time, a result of evolutionary religion.

_The Urantia Book_ shows us ([UB 95:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p7_6)) that the strength of Islam has lain in its clear and well-defined presentation of God as the one and only deity.

It is one more example that in our world we know the Universal Father in various ways.

Each belief has its _supreme_ way of calling upon the Heavenly Father. ([UB 96:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/96#p1_3))

## CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE OF THE UNIVERSE - THE NAME OF THE FATHER

[Quran 1-1-2](/en/book/Islam/Quran/1#v1) _In the name of God, the Gracious, the Compassionate._

[UB 1:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p1_1) _Of all the names by which God the Father is known throughout the universes, those which designate him as the First Source and the Universe Center are most often encountered. The First Father is known by various names in different universes and in different sectors of the same universe. The names which the creature assigns to the Creator are much dependent on the creature’s concept of the Creator. The First Source and Universe Center has never revealed himself by name, only by nature. If we believe that we are the children of this Creator, it is only natural that we should eventually call him Father. But this is the name of our own choosing, and it grows out of the recognition of our personal relationship with the First Source and Center._

[UB 1:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p1_2) _The Universal Father never imposes any form of arbitrary recognition, formal worship, or slavish service upon the intelligent will creatures of the universes. The evolutionary inhabitants of the worlds of time and space must of themselves—in their own hearts—recognize, love, and voluntarily worship him. The Creator refuses to coerce or compel the submission of the spiritual free wills of his material creatures. The affectionate dedication of the human will to the doing of the Father’s will is man’s choicest gift to God; in fact, such a consecration of creature will constitutes man’s only possible gift of true value to the Paradise Father. In God, man lives, moves, and has his being; there is nothing which man can give to God except this choosing to abide by the Father’s will, and such decisions, effected by the intelligent will creatures of the universes, constitute the reality of that true worship which is so satisfying to the love-dominated nature of the Creator Father._

[Quran 4-126](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v126) _To God belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth._

[Quran 4-132](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v132) _To God belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth; God is sufficient as a guardian._

[Quran 16-3](/en/book/Islam/Quran/16#v3) _He created the heavens and the earth with truth (with purpose, purpose, and on solid foundations of truth)._

[Quran 20-8](/en/book/Islam/Quran/20#v8) _God, there is no Deity except Him, His are the most Beautiful Names._

[Quran 42-49](/en/book/Islam/Quran/42#v49) _To God belongs the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. He creates whatever He wills..._

[Quran 48-7](/en/book/Islam/Quran/48#v7) _And to God belong the armies of the heavens and the earth; God is Knowing, Wise._

This quote reveals the kind of heavenly armies he commands both in heaven and on Earth. As for human armies, he does not command them.

[Quran 42-51](/en/book/Islam/Quran/42#v51) _It is not fitting for any mortal that God speaks to him except by Revelation or behind a veil, or by sending a messenger (or angel) to reveal, by his leave, what He wills (Reveal). There is no doubt that He is the One Who is Exalted, All-Knowing._ (See [Exodus 33-20](/en/Bible/Exodus/33#v20) and [1 Timothy 6-16](/en/Bible/1_Timothy/6#v16))

[UB 1:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p3_3) _The Universal Father is not invisible because he is hiding himself away from the lowly creatures of materialistic handicaps and limited spiritual endowments. The situation rather is: “You cannot see my face, for no mortal can see me and live.” No material man could behold the spirit God and preserve his mortal existence. The glory and the spiritual brilliance of the divine personality presence is impossible of approach by the lower groups of spirit beings or by any order of material personalities. The spiritual luminosity of the Father’s personal presence is a “light which no mortal man can approach; which no material creature has seen or can see.” But it is not necessary to see God with the eyes of the flesh in order to discern him by the faith-vision of the spiritualized mind._

[Quran 57:1-3](/en/book/Islam/Quran/57#v1) _Everything in the heavens and on the earth glorifies God; and He is the Glorious, possessing irresistible power, the All-Knowing_

To Him belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and causes death. He possesses complete power over all things.

_He is the First, the Last, the Outer, and the Inner. He possesses full knowledge of all things._

[Quran 50-43](/en/book/Islam/Quran/50#v43) _Surely We are the Ones Who give life and cause death, and to Us is the return._

This verse undoubtedly speaks of someone other than God Himself. The Father inhabits eternity with the Eternal Son and the Infinite Spirit, who are His associates; they are the Fathers of Creation.

[UB 161:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/161#p1_6) _1. The Father in Paradise does enjoy equality of communication with at least two other beings who are fully equal to himself and wholly like himself—the Eternal Son and the Infinite Spirit. In view of the doctrine of the Trinity, the Greek was compelled to concede the personality possibility of the Universal Father. (It was the later consideration of these discussions which led to the enlarged conception of the Trinity in the minds of the twelve apostles. Of course, it was the general belief that Jesus was the Eternal Son.)_

[Quran 85-9](/en/book/Islam/Quran/85#v9) _He to Whom belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. God is Witness to all things._

[UB 1:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p0_1) _THE Universal Father is the God of all creation, the First Source and Center of all things and beings. First think of God as a creator, then as a controller, and lastly as an infinite upholder. The truth about the Universal Father had begun to dawn upon mankind when the prophet said: “You, God, are alone; there is none beside you. You have created the heaven and the heaven of heavens, with all their hosts; you preserve and control them. By the Sons of God were the universes made. The Creator covers himself with light as with a garment and stretches out the heavens as a curtain.”_ (See [Nehemiah 9-6](/en/Bible/Nehemiah/9#v6)).

[Quran 112-1-4](/en/book/Islam/Quran/112#v1) _Say: He is, God, the One and Only of Absolute Oneness._

_God, the eternally supplicated (who is in need of nothing)._

_He has not begotten, nor has he been begotten._

_And no one, no one can compare with Him._

[UB 4:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p4_3) _God is the being of absolute self-determination; there are no limits to his universe reactions save those which are self-imposed, and his freewill acts are conditioned only by those divine qualities and perfect attributes which inherently characterize his eternal nature. Therefore is God related to the universe as the being of final goodness plus a free will of creative infinity._

## THE CIRCLE OF ETERNITY

[Quran 4:4-126](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v4) _All that is in the heavens and on the earth belongs to God. God surrounds all things._

[UB 131:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/131#p1_2) _“God is supreme; he is the Most High of heaven and earth. God is the perfected circle of eternity, and he rules the universe of universes. He is the sole maker of the heavens and the earth. When he decrees a thing, that thing is. Our God is one God, and he is compassionate and merciful. Everything that is high, holy, true, and beautiful is like our God. The Most High is the light of heaven and earth; he is the God of the east, the west, the north, and the south._

This beautiful teaching found by Jesus and Ganid in the writings of Cynicism emphasizes that _The Heavenly Father IS_ the circle of eternity where everything revolves in an orbit around him by his light, love and wisdom.

If the Father is the God of the east, west, north, and south, it shows me that he doesn't just speak to one nation or planet: it shows me that the Father has revealed himself to every place in creation. As he reveals himself to this world, he also reveals himself to other worlds.

[Quran 3-191](/en/book/Islam/Quran/3#v191) _those who remember God standing, sitting and lying down and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth: Our Lord, You did not create all this in vain!_

What a beautiful and contemplative reflection the creature has before the vastness of creation! So much so that the revelators expand and embellish the panorama with the following statement from the book:

[UB 1:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p0_2) _The myriads of planetary systems were all made to be eventually inhabited by many different types of intelligent creatures, beings who could know God, receive the divine affection, and love him in return. The universe of universes is the work of God and the dwelling place of his diverse creatures. “God created the heavens and formed the earth; he established the universe and created this world not in vain; he formed it to be inhabited.”_ (see [Isaiah 45-18](/en/Bible/Isaiah/45#v18)).

[Quran 20-50](/en/book/Islam/Quran/20#v50) _(Moses) said: Our Lord is the One Who creates everything and the One Who endows each thing with its particular character and then directs it (to the fulfillment of the goal and purpose of its existence)._

[Quran 20-53](/en/book/Islam/Quran/20#v53) _He Who made the earth a cradle for you and made paths for you therein, and sends down water from the sky and produces by it pairs of plants._

This verse shows in our own being the true feeling of things, the existential goal of all of us.

[UB 32:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p5_7) _There is in the mind of God a plan which embraces every creature of all his vast domains, and this plan is an eternal purpose of boundless opportunity, unlimited progress, and endless life. And the infinite treasures of such a matchless career are yours for the striving!_

[UB 32:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p5_8) _The goal of eternity is ahead! The adventure of divinity attainment lies before you! The race for perfection is on! whosoever will may enter, and certain victory will crown the efforts of every human being who will run the race of faith and trust, depending every step of the way on the leading of the indwelling Adjuster and on the guidance of that good spirit of the Universe Son, which so freely has been poured out upon all flesh._

## UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE OF GOD

[Quran 2-85](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v85) _God is not unaware of what you do._
[Quran 2-107](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v107) _Do you not know that to God belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and that apart from Him you have no one to protect you or help you?_

[Quran 3-5](/en/book/Islam/Quran/3#v5) _Truly from God, there is nothing, neither on earth nor in heaven, that is hidden from Him._

[Quran 3-73](/en/book/Islam/Quran/3#v73) _... God is all-encompassing, all-knowing._

[Quran 11-123](/en/book/Islam/Quran/11#v123) _To God belongs the dominion and knowledge of the unseen of the heavens and the earth, and to Him alone are committed all matters (for judgment). Worship Him and place your trust in Him. Your Lord is not heedless, nor does He disregard what you do._

[Quran 14-38](/en/book/Islam/Quran/14#v38) _O Our Lord! Surely, You know everything we keep secret and everything we reveal. There is nothing on earth or in heaven that is hidden from God._

[Quran 34-2](/en/book/Islam/Quran/34#v2) _He knows what enters the earth and what comes out of it, what descends from the sky and what ascends to Him. He is Most Merciful, Most Forgiving._

[UB 3:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p3_1) _“God knows all things.” The divine mind is conscious of, and conversant with, the thought of all creation. His knowledge of events is universal and perfect. The divine entities going out from him are a part of him; he who “balances the clouds” is also “perfect in knowledge.” “The eyes of the Lord are in every place.” Said your great teacher of the insignificant sparrow, “One of them shall not fall to the ground without my Father’s knowledge,” and also, “The very hairs of your head are numbered.” “He tells the number of the stars; he calls them all by their names.”_

[UB 3:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p3_2) _The Universal Father is the only personality in all the universe who does actually know the number of the stars and planets of space. All the worlds of every universe are constantly within the consciousness of God..._

And as The Urantia Book says: (49) God is never caught off guard.

## GOD DOESN'T WANT ANYONE TO BE LOST

[UB 126:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p3_7) _... Unless you are born again, born of the spirit, you cannot enter the kingdom of God._

Spiritual birth is the recognition of our spiritual need and hunger, as physical food is to every human being. Spiritual development depends, first, on maintaining a living spiritual connection with true spirit forces, and second, on the continual bearing of spiritual fruit—the bestowing upon one's fellows what one has received from spirit benefactors. Spiritual progress is based on the intellectual recognition of spiritual poverty combined with a self-consciousness of the hunger for perfection, the desire to know God and to be like him, the sincere purpose to do the will of the Father in heaven.

[UB 100:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p2_2) _Spiritual growth is first an awakening to needs, next a discernment of meanings, and then a discovery of values. The evidence of true spiritual development consists in the exhibition of a human personality motivated by love, activated by unselfish ministry, and dominated by the wholehearted worship of the perfection ideals of divinity. And this entire experience constitutes the reality of religion as contrasted with mere theological beliefs._

[UB 2:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p5_2) _... “for the Father himself loves you.” It is in response to this paternal affection that God sends the marvelous Adjusters to indwell the minds of men. God’s love is universal; “whosoever will may come.” He would “have all men be saved by coming into the knowledge of the truth.” He is “not willing that any should perish.”_

The divine spirit is the one who helps and cares for every mortal who is in communion with Him. He is our cosmic pilot of destiny. He is the giver of humankind's spiritual nourishment.

Our recognition of our spiritual needs is heard by the spirit and He is the one who enhances our everyday life into an extraordinary life no matter how simple it may seem.

[UB 132:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p7_9) _... That which the enlightened and reflective human imagination of spiritual teaching and leading wholeheartedly and unselfishly wants to do and be, becomes measurably creative in accordance with the degree of mortal dedication to the divine doing of the Father’s will. When man goes in partnership with God, great things may, and do, happen._

## MICHAEL OF NEBADON

The Universal Father doesn't do things alone; he's not a selfish being. God works in partnership. Just as he is with human beings, so he is with his Paradise children.

[Quran 2-116, 117](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v116) _and they say: God has taken to Himself a Son. May He be glorified above that!_

_If all that is in the heavens and on earth belongs to Him, and all are subject to Him!_

_He who gave beginning to the heavens and the Earth. When he decrees something, he only has to say, “Be!” And it is._

[Quran 21-107](/en/book/Islam/Quran/21#v107) _And We have not sent you except as a mercy unmatched by all the worlds._

[Quran 20-8](/en/book/Islam/Quran/20#v8) _God, there is no Deity except Him, His are the most Beautiful Names._

_One of the names of the Father is being The Light._

[Quran 24-35](/en/book/Islam/Quran/24#v35) _God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The example of His Light is like a niche where there is a lamp; the lamp is in a crystal, and the crystal, shining like a radiant star like a pearl, lit with the oil of a blessed olive tree that is neither of the east nor of the west. The oil almost gives light of itself, though no fire touches it. Light upon Light! God guides to His Light whomever He wills. God draws people's attention (with parables). God possesses full knowledge of all things._

[Matthew 6-22](/en/Bible/Matthew/6#v22) _The lamp of the body is the eye; if therefore your eye is single, your whole body will be full of light;_

23 But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how much greater is that darkness?

[Matthew 5-14](/en/Bible/Matthew/5#v14) _You are the light of the world; (I) a city set on a hill cannot be hidden._

15 _nor do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick, (J) and it gives light to all who are in the house._

16 _Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven._

[Matthew 25-1](/en/Bible/Matthew/25#v1) _Then the kingdom of heaven will be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom._

2 _five of them were wise and five were foolish._

3 _The foolish ones took their lamps and took no oil with them;_

4 _But the wise took oil in their vessels, along with their lamps._

5 _And while the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and fell asleep._

6 _And at midnight there was a cry: Behold, the bridegroom comes; go out to meet him!_

7 _Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps._

8 _And the foolish said to the wise, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out._

9 _But the wise answered, saying, That there be not enough for us and for you, go rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves._

10 _But while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage; and the door was shut._

11 _Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us!_

12 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.

13 _Watch therefore, for you do not know the day or the hour in which the Son of Man is coming._

[UB 140:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p4_4) _“You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it gives light to all who are in the house. Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and be led to glorify your Father who is in heaven.”_

[UB 140:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p4_5) _While light dispels darkness, it can also be so “blinding” as to confuse and frustrate. We are admonished to let our light so shine that our fellows will be guided into new and godly paths of enhanced living. Our light should so shine as not to attract attention to self. Even one’s vocation can be utilized as an effective “<b>reflector</b>” for the dissemination of this light of life._

[UB 182:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p1_9) _The Master, during the course of this final prayer with his apostles, alluded to the fact that he had manifested the Father’s name to the world. And that is truly what he did by the revelation of God through his perfected life in the flesh. The Father in heaven had sought to reveal himself to Moses, but he could proceed no further than to cause it to be said, “I AM.” And when pressed for further revelation of himself, it was only disclosed, “I AM that I AM.” But when Jesus had finished his earth life, this name of the Father had been so revealed that the Master, who was the Father incarnate, could truly say:_

[UB 182:1.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p1_10) _I am the bread of life._

[UB 182:1.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p1_11) _I am the living water._

[UB 182:1.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p1_12) _I am the light of the world._

[UB 182:1.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p1_13) _
I am the desire of all ages._

[UB 182:1.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p1_14) _I am the open door to eternal salvation._

[UB 182:1.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p1_15) _I am the reality of endless life._

[UB 182:1.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p1_16) _I am the good shepherd._

[UB 182:1.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p1_17) _I am the pathway of infinite perfection._

[UB 182:1.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p1_18) _I am the resurrection and the life._

[UB 182:1.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p1_19) _I am the secret of eternal survival._

[UB 182:1.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p1_20) _I am the way, the truth, and the life._

[UB 182:1.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p1_21) _I am the infinite Father of my finite children._

[UB 182:1.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p1_22) _I am the true vine, you are the branches._

[UB 182:1.23](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p1_23) _I am the hope of all who know the living truth._

[UB 182:1.24](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p1_24) _I am the living bridge from one world to another._

[UB 182:1.25](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p1_25) _I am the living link between time and eternity._

[UB 182:1.26](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p1_26) _Thus did Jesus enlarge the living revelation of the name of God to all generations. As divine love reveals the nature of God, eternal truth discloses his name in ever-enlarging proportions.._

The lamp is not only Christ: it is also us, for the very Light of God is within us (the Thought Adjuster). It is within each of us; the spirit is waiting for us to make its presence useful.

Having the Spirit doesn't mean being saved, but rather bearing spiritual fruits in society itself. The world truly needs to revive the Spirit. The universal presence within us is still unknown.

[Quran 24-36](/en/book/Islam/Quran/24#v36) _(This Light may be best obtained, and those directed to it are found) in some houses (which are generally hidden from the eyes of people and) for which God has provided a way for them to be built and cherished, and for His name to be mentioned and invoked therein; in them, they glorify Him morning and evening._

[Quran 25-1](/en/book/Islam/Quran/25#v1) _Blessed is He Who sent down to His Servant the Judgment as a warning to all the worlds!_

[Quran 23-85](/en/book/Islam/Quran/23#v85) _And blessed is He to Whom belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and that which is between them; with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, and to Him you will return._

[Quran 21-26](/en/book/Islam/Quran/21#v26) _They have said: The Merciful has taken a Son. Far from it in their glory! Rather, they are distinguished servants._

[John 1-1,4](/en/Bible/John/1#v1). _In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God._

2 _This was in the beginning with God._

3 _all things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made._

4 _in him was life, and the life was the light of men._

[Daniel 7-13](/en/Bible/Daniel/7#v13) _I was watching in the night visions, and behold, one like the Son of Man, coming with the clouds of heaven! He came to the Ancient of Days, and they brought him near before him._

14 _He was given dominion, glory, and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom that will not be destroyed._

[UB 33:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p1_1) _Our Creator Son is the personification of the original 611,121 concept of infinite identity of simultaneous origin in the Universal Father and the Eternal Son._

Michael of Nebadon is the “only begotten Son” who personifies the 611,121st universe concept of divinity and infinity. His headquarters is in the triple mansion of light on Salvington. This abode is so arranged because Michael has experienced life in all three phases of intelligent creature existence: spiritual, morontia, and material. Because of the name associated with his seventh and final bestowal on Urantia, he is sometimes called Christ Michael.

Jesus is our Father, Creator of this local universe. He knocks at the door of all of us and of all worlds.

[Quran 2-186](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v186) _and when my servants (messengers) ask you about me..._

_I am near and I answer the prayer of the one who asks, when he asks of Me; so let them answer Me and believe in Me, that they may be rightly guided!_

[Revelation 3-20](/en/Bible/Revelation/3#v20) _Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with me._

[UB 166:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p3_7) _... Nevertheless, to all who are honest of heart and sincere in faith, it remains eternally true: “Behold, I stand at the doors of men’s hearts and knock, and if any man will open to me, I will come in and sup with him and will feed him with the bread of life; we shall be one in spirit and purpose, and so shall we ever be brethren in the long and fruitful service of the search for the Paradise Father.” And so, whether few or many are to be saved altogether depends on whether few or many will heed the invitation: “I am the door, I am the new and living way, and whosoever wills may enter to embark upon the endless truth-search for eternal life.”_

[UB 165:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p2_9) _“But I have many other sheep not of this fold, and these words are true not only of this world. These other sheep also hear and know my voice, and I have promised the Father that they shall all be brought into one fold, one brotherhood of the sons of God. And then shall you all know the voice of one shepherd, the true shepherd, and shall all acknowledge the fatherhood of God._

[UB 165:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p2_10) _“And so shall you know why the Father loves me and has put all of his flocks in this domain in my hands for keeping; it is because the Father knows that I will not falter in the safeguarding of the sheepfold, that I will not desert my sheep, and that, if it shall be required, I will not hesitate to lay down my life in the service of his manifold flocks. But, mind you, if I lay down my life, I will take it up again. No man nor any other creature can take away my life. I have the right and the power to lay down my life, and I have the same power and right to take it up again. You cannot understand this, but I received such authority from my Father even before this world was.”_

[Quran 20-4](/en/book/Islam/Quran/20#v4) _a gradual revelation from Him Who created the Earth and the High Heavens._

[UB 92:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p4_8) _4. Jesus of Nazareth. Christ Michael presented for the fourth time to Urantia the concept of God as the Universal Father, and this teaching has generally persisted ever since. The essence of his teaching was love and service, the loving worship which a creature son voluntarily gives in recognition of, and response to, the loving ministry of God his Father; the freewill service which such creature sons bestow upon their brethren in the joyous realization that in this service they are likewise serving God the Father._

## THE ETERNAL ISLAND OF PARADISE

[Quran 3-107](/en/book/Islam/Quran/3#v107) _Those whose faces shine will be (included) in the Mercy of God, wherein they will dwell eternally._

[Quran 9-129](/en/book/Islam/Quran/9#v129) _But if they turn away from you (O Messenger), then say: God is sufficient for me, there is no deity but He, in Him I trust, and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne!_

[Quran 13-2](/en/book/Islam/Quran/13#v2) _God is He Who raised the heavens without pillars that you can see, and then He settled Himself on the Supreme Throne and made the sun and the moon submit to His Command, each one traversing its course in a time fixed by Him. He directs all affairs (as the Supreme Ruler of Creation). He sets forth in detail the signs of truth and the relevant revelations included in the Book, so that you may be certain of the meeting with Your Lord._

What a verse! So much truth in a single paragraph.

The physical gravity of the physical universe lies in Paradise, hence why the moon and sun follow their paths in their orbits. It is literally true that everything is created by pillars invisible to us.

This paragraph also highlights the great truth that in a single book the great revelations of the world are highlighted.

[UB 92:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p4_9) _5. The Urantia Papers. The papers, of which this is one, constitute the most recent presentation of truth to the mortals of Urantia. These papers differ from all previous revelations, for they are not the work of a single universe personality but a composite presentation by many beings. But no revelation short of the attainment of the Universal Father can ever be complete. All other celestial ministrations are no more than partial, transient, and practically adapted to local conditions in time and space. While such admissions as this may possibly detract from the immediate force and authority of all revelations, the time has arrived on Urantia when it is advisable to make such frank statements, even at the risk of weakening the future influence and authority of this, the most recent of the revelations of truth to the mortal races of Urantia._

[Quran 20-5](/en/book/Islam/Quran/20#v5) _The Merciful, Who sits upon the Throne._

[UB 11:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p0_1) _PARADISE is the eternal center of the universe of universes and the abiding place of the Universal Father, the Eternal Son, the Infinite Spirit, and their divine co-ordinates and associates. This central Isle is the most gigantic organized body of cosmic reality in all the master universe. Paradise is a material sphere as well as a spiritual abode. All of the intelligent creation of the Universal Father is domiciled on material abodes; hence must the absolute controlling center also be material, literal. And again it should be reiterated that spirit things and spiritual beings are real._

[UB 11:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p0_2) _The material beauty of Paradise consists in the magnificence of its physical perfection; the grandeur of the Isle of God is exhibited in the superb intellectual accomplishments and mind development of its inhabitants; the glory of the central Isle is shown forth in the infinite endowment of divine spirit personality—the light of life. But the depths of the spiritual beauty and the wonders of this magnificent ensemble are utterly beyond the comprehension of the finite mind of material creatures. The glory and spiritual splendor of the divine abode are impossible of mortal comprehension. And Paradise is from eternity; there are neither records nor traditions respecting the origin of this nuclear Isle of Light and Life._ (See The Urantia Book Paper 11.)

To our human understanding, the Isle of Paradise is as real as the planet itself; we can discern its grandeur in the visible creation of our physical universe. The great nuclear Isle of Light is the great attractor of the cosmic realm. It is the universal axis that enables the cosmic movement of the galaxies in their entirety.

It is the beating heart that emanates the energy for our existence, for a planetary system, a constellation, a universe, and the greater Cosmos as a whole. Just as there is spatial breathing, the beating heart of creation is Paradise.

[Quran 35-41](/en/book/Islam/Quran/35#v41) _Surely God sustains the heavens and the earth, so that they will not cease_

[Quran 35-41](/en/book/Islam/Quran/35#v41) _Surely God sustains the heavens and the earth, so that they will not be destroyed. If they begin to fall, there is no one who can support them (if He were to let them fall). He does not let them fall, despite all the wickedness of His servants, because) He is Oft-Forgiving (who does not rush to punish the errors of His servants) Forgiving._

[UB 11:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p1_4) _The Father is always to be found at this central location. Did he move, universal pandemonium would be precipitated, for there converge in him at this residential center the universal lines of gravity from the ends of creation. Whether we trace the personality circuit back through the universes or follow the ascending personalities as they journey inward to the Father; whether we trace the lines of material gravity to nether Paradise or follow the insurging cycles of cosmic force; whether we trace the lines of spiritual gravity to the Eternal Son or follow the inward processional of the Paradise Sons of God; whether we trace out the mind circuits or follow the trillions upon trillions of celestial beings who spring from the Infinite Spirit—by any of these observations or by all of them we are led directly back to the Father’s presence, to his central abode. Here is God personally, literally, and actually present. And from his infinite being there flow the flood-streams of life, energy, and personality to all universes._

[UB 11:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p8_1) _The inescapable pull of gravity effectively grips all the worlds of all the universes of all space. Gravity is the all-powerful grasp of the physical presence of Paradise. Gravity is the omnipotent strand on which are strung the gleaming stars, blazing suns, and whirling spheres which constitute the universal physical adornment of the eternal God, who is all things, fills all things, and in whom all things consist._

[UB 11:8.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p8_2) _The center and focal point of absolute material gravity is the Isle of Paradise, complemented by the dark gravity bodies encircling Havona and equilibrated by the upper and nether space reservoirs. All known emanations of nether Paradise invariably and unerringly respond to the central gravity pull operating upon the endless circuits of the elliptical space levels of the master universe. Every known form of cosmic reality has the bend of the ages, the trend of the circle, the swing of the great ellipse._

[UB 11:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p8_3) _Space is nonresponsive to gravity, but it acts as an equilibrant on gravity. Without the space cushion, explosive action would jerk surrounding space bodies. Pervaded space also exerts an antigravity influence upon physical or linear gravity; space can actually neutralize such gravity action even though it cannot delay it. Absolute gravity is Paradise gravity. Local or linear gravity pertains to the electrical stage of energy or matter; it operates within the central, super-, and outer universes, wherever suitable materialization has taken place._

## A NEW REVELATION

Throughout the history of humanity there have always been manifestations of divinity, even if they appear to be human.

The incessant work of the spiritual world for man is arduous, constant and persevering.

Since the emergence of the human mind on the planet, and even before, celestial visitations have been constant. It is literally true that man is not alone, but in his egotism, he has considered himself alone and even unique in the universe.

A revelation is a person who connects with divinity and helps humanity evolve. Every human being has the gift of spiritual revelation, more than any present writing in the world.

[UB 92:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p5_8) _There have been hundreds upon hundreds of religious leaders in the million-year human history of Urantia from Onagar to Guru Nanak. During this time there have been many ebbs and flows of the tide of religious truth and spiritual faith, and each renaissance of Urantian religion has, in the past, been identified with the life and teachings of some religious leader. In considering the teachers of recent times, it may prove helpful to group them into the seven major religious epochs of post-Adamic Urantia:_

Onagar, the first spiritual teacher in human history. Guru Nanak, a great 15th-century master and, according to *The Urantia Book*, founder of one of Asia's most advanced religions, merging Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism into a single doctrine. Every religion originates in Asia, so we could emphasize that it's one of the best in the world.

The world is characterized by certain eras.

[UB 92:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p5_8) _During this time there have been many ebbs and flows of the tide of religious truth and spiritual faith, and each past revival of Urantian religion has been identified with the life and teachings of one or another religious leader. In considering the teachers of recent times, it may be helpful to group them into seven major religious ages of post-Adamic Urantia:_

[UB 92:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p5_9) _1. The Sethite period. The Sethite priests, as regenerated under the leadership of Amosad, became the great post-Adamic teachers. They functioned throughout the lands of the Andites, and their influence persisted longest among the Greeks, Sumerians, and Hindus. Among the latter they have continued to the present time as the Brahmans of the Hindu faith. The Sethites and their followers never entirely lost the Trinity concept revealed by Adam._

[UB 92:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p5_10) _2. Era of the Melchizedek missionaries. Urantia religion was in no small measure regenerated by the efforts of those teachers who were commissioned by Machiventa Melchizedek when he lived and taught at Salem almost two thousand years before Christ. These missionaries proclaimed faith as the price of favor with God, and their teachings, though unproductive of any immediately appearing religions, nevertheless formed the foundations on which later teachers of truth were to build the religions of Urantia._

[UB 92:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p5_11) _3. The post-Melchizedek era. Though Amenemope and Ikhnaton both taught in this period, the outstanding religious genius of the post-Melchizedek era was the leader of a group of Levantine Bedouins and the founder of the Hebrew religion—Moses. Moses taught monotheism. Said he: “Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one God.” “The Lord he is God. There is none beside him.” He persistently sought to uproot the remnants of the ghost cult among his people, even prescribing the death penalty for its practitioners. The monotheism of Moses was adulterated by his successors, but in later times they did return to many of his teachings. The greatness of Moses lies in his wisdom and sagacity. Other men have had greater concepts of God, but no one man was ever so successful in inducing large numbers of people to adopt such advanced beliefs._

[UB 92:5.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p5_12) _4. The sixth century before Christ. Many men arose to proclaim truth in this, one of the greatest centuries of religious awakening ever witnessed on Urantia. Among these should be recorded Gautama, Confucius, Lao-tse, Zoroaster, and the Jainist teachers. The teachings of Gautama have become widespread in Asia, and he is revered as the Buddha by millions. Confucius was to Chinese morality what Plato was to Greek philosophy, and while there were religious repercussions to the teachings of both, strictly speaking, neither was a religious teacher; Lao-tse envisioned more of God in Tao than did Confucius in humanity or Plato in idealism. Zoroaster, while much affected by the prevalent concept of dual spiritism, the good and the bad, at the same time definitely exalted the idea of one eternal Deity and of the ultimate victory of light over darkness._

[UB 92:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p5_13) _5. The first century after Christ. As a religious teacher, Jesus of Nazareth started out with the cult which had been established by John the Baptist and progressed as far as he could away from fasts and forms. Aside from Jesus, Paul of Tarsus and Philo of Alexandria were the greatest teachers of this era. Their concepts of religion have played a dominant part in the evolution of that faith which bears the name of Christ._

[UB 92:5.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p5_14) _6. The sixth century after Christ. Mohammed founded a religion which was superior to many of the creeds of his time. His was a protest against the social demands of the faiths of foreigners and against the incoherence of the religious life of his own people._

[UB 92:5.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p5_15) _7. The fifteenth century after Christ. This period witnessed two religious movements: the disruption of the unity of Christianity in the Occident and the synthesis of a new religion in the Orient. In Europe institutionalized Christianity had attained that degree of inelasticity which rendered further growth incompatible with unity. In the Orient the combined teachings of Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism were synthesized by Nanak and his followers into Sikhism, one of the most advanced religions of Asia._

To date, all these eras of humanity have been marked by his imprint, where every subsequent writing has been considered the word of God.

The [Bhagavad Gita](/en/book/Hinduism/Bhagavad_Gita) is to Hinduism, as the [Bible](/en/Bible) is to Christianity, the [Adi Granth](/en/book/Sikhism/Shri_Guru_Granth_Sahib) is to Sikhism, the Analects is to Confucianism, the [Tao Te Ching](/en/book/Taoism/Tao_Te_Ching) is to Taoism, the [Quran](/en/book/Islam/Quran) is to Islam, the Torah is to Jews, [The Kitab-IÍqan](/en/book/Bahaism/The_Kitab_i_Iqan) and the Baha'i writings are to the Baha'i faith.

[Quran 2-2](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v2) _This is the (incomparably honored) Book: there is no doubt (about its Divine Authorship and that it is a collection of pure truths from beginning to end). A perfect guide for those pious devotees, who fulfill their duty to God._

This verse reveals a great meaning to me, where the manifestation of God is revealed in the pages as well, not only of the Quran itself but everywhere.

The Bible mentions a future writing (for this generation) of a new and everlasting gospel for multitudes, languages, and nations.

Revelation 14:6 Then I saw another angel flying through the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth—to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people.

[Quran 2-4](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v4) _And those who believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you (such as the Torah, the Gospel, the Psalms, and the scrolls of Abraham); and in the Hereafter._

Here it is highlighted that the truth is not only on one side: all truths complement the previous one.

[Quran 2-129](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v129) Our Lord! And raise up for this community a Messenger from among themselves, who will recite to them Your revelations and instruct them in the Book (which You will reveal to them) and in wisdom, and purify them (from false beliefs and doctrines, from sins and from all impurities). Indeed, You are the Glorious, the All-Glorious, the All-Knowing, the All-Wishing.

In itself, a beautiful prayer for all believers of good faith. The souls of the world truly yearn for true ministers of truth; not just Muslims, but all faiths of the world.

## THE VIRTUE

[Quran 2-177](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v177) _Piety (and virtue) does not consist in turning one's face towards the east or the west; rather piety (and virtue) is the state of one who believes in God and the Last Day, and the angels, the Books, and the prophets..._

This section, halfway through the verse, reveals to me the importance of believing in the manifestations of truth, regardless of their source. The parts make up the whole. But what is piety, virtue?

[Quran 2-189](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v189) _... Piety (and virtue) does not consist in entering houses from their backs, but piety (and virtue) is the state in which he (truly believes in God) strives for righteousness and piety._

[UB 16:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p7_6) _Virtue is righteousness—conformity with the cosmos. To name virtues is not to define them, but to live them is to know them. Virtue is not mere knowledge nor yet wisdom but rather the reality of progressive experience in the attainment of ascending levels of cosmic achievement. In the day-by-day life of mortal man, virtue is realized by the consistent choosing of good rather than evil, and such choosing ability is evidence of the possession of a moral nature._

[Quran 5-15](/en/book/Islam/Quran/5#v15) _... or doubtless it has been revealed to you that there has been revealed to you a Light from God (illuminating your minds, your hearts, and your ways) and a Book manifest in itself and manifesting the truth._

[Quran 3-79](/en/book/Islam/Quran/3#v79) _... Be servants of God apart from God. Rather (I would say): be pure teachers of the Lord, teaching the Book and studying it._

A master is someone who chooses to be one. Revelation has the transformative power to reveal the inner master through the Spirit of Truth.

[Quran 5-48](/en/book/Islam/Quran/5#v48) _We have sent down to you (O Messenger) the Book of Truth (embodied of it and with nothing false in it) as a confirmation (of its Divine Authorship and of the truths contained in) all that of the Book that was revealed before it and as a safeguard for (all the true teachings that were in) it. So judge between them with what God has sent down (to you) and do not follow their desires and whims contrary to the truth that has come to you. For every (community to which a Messenger was sent with a Book) We have appointed a way of life and a comprehensive system (containing the principles of that way and how to follow it). Had God willed, He would have made you one community (He would have willed, in other circumstances) to test you in what He has given (and thus subject you to the law of progress). Strive together, then, as though competing in good works. To God is the return of all of you, and He will make you understand (the truth) about that in which you differ.

This verse shows me that each generation brings its teachers who teach the truth. It means that the Father will always send messengers into the world.

[UB 92:5.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p5_16) _The future of Urantia will doubtless be characterized by the appearance of teachers of religious truth—the Fatherhood of God and the fraternity of all creatures. But it is to be hoped that the ardent and sincere efforts of these future prophets will be directed less toward the strengthening of interreligious barriers and more toward the augmentation of the religious brotherhood of spiritual worship among the many followers of the differing intellectual theologies which so characterize Urantia of Satania._ (see [Romans 8-19](/en/Bible/Romans/8#v19))

[Quran 4-166](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v166) _(Whether people or not) God bears witness (to the truth) to what He has sent down to you. And He has sent it down. And He has sent it down from His Knowledge. Based on it and alongside it. And the angels also bear witness (to it); although God is sufficient as a witness._

[UB 92:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p4_1) _Revelation is evolutionary but always progressive. Down through the ages of a world’s history, the revelations of religion are ever-expanding and successively more enlightening. It is the mission of revelation to sort and censor the successive religions of evolution. But if revelation is to exalt and upstep the religions of evolution, then must such divine visitations portray teachings which are not too far removed from the thought and reactions of the age in which they are presented. Thus must and does revelation always keep in touch with evolution. Always must the religion of revelation be limited by man’s capacity of receptivity._

[Quran 6-7](/en/book/Islam/Quran/6#v7) _Even if We had sent down to you (O Messenger) a scroll which they could touch with their hands, those who persist in their disbelief would have said: This is clearly nothing but magic._

[UB 102:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p7_7) _If science, philosophy, or sociology dares to become dogmatic in contending with the prophets of true religion, then should God-knowing men reply to such unwarranted dogmatism with that more farseeing dogmatism of the certainty of personal spiritual experience, “I know what I have experienced because I am a son of I AM.” If the personal experience of a faither is to be challenged by dogma, then this faith-born son of the experiencible Father may reply with that unchallengeable dogma, the statement of his actual sonship with the Universal Father._

[UB 102:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p6_5) _Convictions about God may be arrived at through wise reasoning, but the individual becomes God-knowing only by faith, through personal experience. In much that pertains to life, probability must be reckoned with, but when contacting with cosmic reality, certainty may be experienced when such meanings and values are approached by living faith. The God-knowing soul dares to say, “I know,” even when this knowledge of God is questioned by the unbeliever who denies such certitude because it is not wholly supported by intellectual logic. To every such doubter the believer only replies, “How do you know that I do not know?”_

[Quran 6-106](/en/book/Islam/Quran/6#v106) _Follow (O Messenger) what has been revealed to you from your Lord..._

We are all messengers, and as humanity we will always need revelation.

[Quran 6-106](/en/book/Islam/Quran/6#v106) _Follow (O Messenger) what has been revealed to you from your Lord. There is no deity but Him..._

[Quran 7-3](/en/book/Islam/Quran/7#v3) _Follow what has been sent down to you (O mankind) from your Lord..._

The invitation is out: follow what has come down to the world, not only the writings, but also those men who are manifestations of the Father.

[Quran 7-52](/en/book/Islam/Quran/7#v52) _We have certainly brought to you a Book (in which the meanings and commandments of) and We have explained it with precision and knowledge, as a guidance and mercy for those who will believe and those who will deepen in faith._

[Quran 11-49](/en/book/Islam/Quran/11#v49) _These are tidings of some exemplary events of the unseen (a time and a world beyond the perception of created beings) which We have revealed to you (O Messenger) neither you nor your people knew of them before this. So (seeing that there is no substantial difference between the conditions in which the Messengers carried out their missions and the reactions they encountered), be patient (with their reactions and their persistence in disbelief). The (happy) (final) result will be with the pious devotees._

[1 Corinthians 2-9](/en/Bible/1_Corinthians/2#v9) _But as it is written:_

Things that no eye has seen, nor ear heard,

_Nor have they entered into the heart of man,_

_They are what God has prepared for those who love him._

[Jeremiah 33-3](/en/Bible/Jeremiah/33#v3) _Call to me, and I will answer you and tell you great and mighty things you do not know._

[Quran 14-1](/en/book/Islam/Quran/14#v1) _(This is) a Book We have sent down to you that you may guide mankind, by the leave of their Lord, out of every form of darkness (intellectual, spiritual, social, economic and political) to the light, to the path of the Glorious, the possessor of irresistible power, the Praiseworthy (Who provides for them and all beings and covers all their needs)._

_The moral and spiritual duty of all those who believe in the truth is to lead humanity out of the spiritual obscurantism in which it lives._

_Before You (O Muhammad) We sent none but men to whom We revealed - and if you (O people) do not know, then ask the people of expert knowledge (those who have knowledge of Divine Revelations)._

We have sent them with clear proofs of the truth and Scriptures. And to you, We have sent down the Reminder, that you may explain to mankind what has been revealed to them (through you about the truth of their present and future lives), and that they may reflect.

[Quran 16-64,65](/en/book/Islam/Quran/16#v64) _And We have not sent down to you the Book except that you should explain to them (all matters of faith and law) in which they differed, and as guidance and mercy for the people who will believe and those who have believed._

God brings him down from heaven and thereby revives the Earth after his death. Without a doubt, in this, a sign (manifesting the truth) is given to people willing to listen (and understand the discourses of the book of creation and revelation).

_The Masters of God are rivers that flow through the universe and leave wells in the cosmos._

[UB 182:1.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p1_11) _I am the living water. The water of life is the Creator of the universe, Christ Jesus; we are the living and life-giving well; the very seeking quenches spiritual thirst; what is received is given._

[Quran 25-6](/en/book/Islam/Quran/25#v6) Say: (It is a Book filled with knowledge, revealing many secrets such as no human being could possibly discover) He Who knows all the secrets in the heavens and the earth has sent it (to teach us some of these secrets and to guide you in your lives so that you may attain happiness in both worlds). Surely He is Oft-Forgiving and Compassionate.

[Quran 26-192,194](/en/book/Islam/Quran/26#v192) _This (the revelation) is verily the Book of the Lord of the worlds being sent down by Him (in parts)._

_The trustworthy spirit descends it,_

_In your heart, so that you may be one of the warners (To whom Divine Revelation has been entrusted)._

What a wonderful verse! So much meaning to embellish the heavenly message of revelation: The Urantia Book.

[Quran 42-15](/en/book/Islam/Quran/42#v15) _Therefore (O Messenger) call people to that (the way of life which God has established for you). Persevere in that which is exactly right (in every matter) as you are commanded (by God). Do not follow their desires and whims (those who follow other ways, including the followers of the previous scriptures), and say: I believe in every Book which God has sent down; and I am commanded to promote equity between you (without discrimination of race or status of birth, and likewise with regard to wealth or power). God is our Lord and your Lord. We will give account of Our deeds, and you, of your deeds: (do not allow there to be) any dissension between us and you. God will gather us all together (and settle any differences between us and you). To Him is the return._

[Quran 42-17](/en/book/Islam/Quran/42#v17) _God is the One who sent down the Book with the truth and the balance (expounding the truth and what is right in all matters). And what do you know, the last Hour may be near._

[Quran 64-11](/en/book/Islam/Quran/64#v11) _No affliction befalls you except by God's permission. Whoever believes in God (truly and sincerely), He guides his heart (to the knowledge of the eternal will and sincerity, and since it acts upon the lives of His creatures, He guides him to humble submission to Him, and to peace and sincerity). God is fully aware of all things._

[Quran 69-43](/en/book/Islam/Quran/69#v43) _It is a revelation being sent down in parts from the Lord of the Worlds._

[UB 92:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p4_10) _But no revelation is complete until that which is obtained upon attaining the Universal Father. All other heavenly ministrations are but partial, transitory, and practically adapted to local conditions in time and space._

## THE WILL OF GOD

Divine will lies in our recognition and spiritual need to seek that which immortalizes us as good, beautiful, and true. It is the work of transforming us from human beings into true superhumans (in spirit).

[UB 111:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p5_1) _The doing of the will of God is nothing more or less than an exhibition of creature willingness to share the inner life with God—with the very God who has made such a creature life of inner meaning-value possible. Sharing is Godlike—divine. God shares all with the Eternal Son and the Infinite Spirit, while they, in turn, share all things with the divine Sons and spirit Daughters of the universes._

[UB 111:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p5_2) _The imitation of God is the key to perfection; the doing of his will is the secret of survival and of perfection in survival._

[Quran 2-5](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v5) _Those (illustrious) are on the true guidance of their Lord; and they are the ones endowed with prosperity._

[Quran 2-286](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v286) _(O you who believe! If you are concerned that God will hold every soul accountable for its hidden plans and intentions, then know that) God exacts nothing from any soul except within its capacity; to its credit is whatever it has earned, and against it is whatever it deserves..._

[UB 117:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p6_9) _Men all too often forget that God is the greatest experience in human existence. Other experiences are limited in their nature and content, but the experience of God has no limits save those of the creature’s comprehension capacity, and this very experience is in itself capacity enlarging. When men search for God, they are searching for everything. ...._

[UB 48:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_5) _3. Inherent capacities cannot be exceeded; a pint can never hold a quart. The spirit concept cannot be mechanically forced into the material memory mold._

[UB 171:8.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p8_10) _1. Ability is the practical measure of life’s opportunities. You will never be held responsible for the accomplishment of that which is beyond your abilities._

In life, we must recognize our spiritual obligations to others. We cannot evade responsibility through negligence. We are fit for what we are about to experience and discover. The credit of mercy has been given to us! Sooner or later, we will render an account of the life of heavenly credit. Justice will mercifully decree our deeds, without overlooking our inner honesty.

[Quran 3-101](/en/book/Islam/Quran/3#v101) _How is it that you disbelieve, when revelations from God are recited to you, and His Messenger is among you? Whoever holds fast to God will be guided to a straight path._

[Quran 4-175](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v175) _So those who believe in God (as is evident from this proof and this light) and draw near to Him, He will admit them to (great) mercy from His Presence and bounty and guide them to Him on a straight path._

[UB 111:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p5_6) _This choosing of the Father’s will is the spiritual finding of the spirit Father by mortal man, even though an age must pass before the creature son may actually stand in the factual presence of God on Paradise. This choosing does not so much consist in the negation of creature will—“Not my will but yours be done”—as it consists in the creature’s positive affirmation: “It is my will that your will be done.” And if this choice is made, sooner or later will the God-choosing son find inner union (fusion) with the indwelling God fragment, while this same perfecting son will find supreme personality satisfaction in the worship communion of the personality of man and the personality of his Maker, two personalities whose creative attributes have eternally joined in self-willed mutuality of expression—the birth of another eternal partnership of the will of man and the will of God._

[Quran 4-76](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v76) _Those who (truly) believe fight in the cause of God, while those who disbelieve fight in the cause of the taghut (evil forces that institute patterns of belief and rule in defiance of God) ..._

[Quran 4-87](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v87) _God, there is no Deity but He, will gather you all together on the Day of Resurrection, about which there is no doubt. Who can be more truthful than God?_

[UB 189:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p3_1) _A little after half past four o’clock this Sunday morning, Gabriel summoned the archangels to his side and made ready to inaugurate the general resurrection of the termination of the Adamic dispensation on Urantia. When the vast host of the seraphim and the cherubim concerned in this great event had been marshaled in proper formation, the morontia Michael appeared before Gabriel, saying: “As my Father has life in himself, so has he given it to the Son to have life in himself. Although I have not yet fully resumed the exercise of universe jurisdiction, this self-imposed limitation does not in any manner restrict the bestowal of life upon my sleeping sons; let the roll call of the planetary resurrection begin.”_

[UB 189:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p3_2) _The circuit of the archangels then operated for the first time from Urantia. Gabriel and the archangel hosts moved to the place of the spiritual polarity of the planet; and when Gabriel gave the signal, there flashed to the first of the system mansion worlds the voice of Gabriel, saying: “By the mandate of Michael, let the dead of a Urantia dispensation rise!” Then all the survivors of the human races of Urantia who had fallen asleep since the days of Adam, and who had not already gone on to judgment, appeared in the resurrection halls of mansonia in readiness for morontia investiture. And in an instant of time the seraphim and their associates made ready to depart for the mansion worlds. Ordinarily these seraphic guardians, onetime assigned to the group custody of these surviving mortals, would have been present at the moment of their awaking in the resurrection halls of mansonia, but they were on this world itself at this time because of the necessity of Gabriel’s presence here in connection with the morontia resurrection of Jesus._

[UB 189:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p3_3) _Notwithstanding that countless individuals having personal seraphic guardians and those achieving the requisite attainment of spiritual personality progress had gone on to mansonia during the ages subsequent to the times of Adam and Eve, and though there had been many special and millennial resurrections of Urantia sons, this was the third of the planetary roll calls, or complete dispensational resurrections. The first occurred at the time of the arrival of the Planetary Prince, the second during the time of Adam, and this, the third, signalized the morontia resurrection, the mortal transit, of Jesus of Nazareth._

[UB 189:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p3_4) _When the signal of the planetary resurrection had been received by the chief of archangels, the Personalized Adjuster of the Son of Man relinquished his authority over the celestial hosts assembled on Urantia, turning all these sons of the local universe back to the jurisdiction of their respective commanders. And when he had done this, he departed for Salvington to register with Immanuel the completion of the mortal transit of Michael. And he was immediately followed by all the celestial host not required for duty on Urantia. But Gabriel remained on Urantia with the morontia Jesus._

[Quran 7-42](/en/book/Islam/Quran/7#v42) _But those who believe and do good and righteous deeds - We do not burden anyone with responsibility except to the extent of their ability - they will be the companions of Paradise (gardens)._

[Quran 11-23](/en/book/Islam/Quran/11#v23) _As for those who believe, and do good and righteous deeds, and humble themselves before their Lord, they will be the companions of Paradise; they will dwell therein._

[Quran 11-115](/en/book/Islam/Quran/11#v115) _And be patient and persevere (in doing good, avoiding error, and against every kind of persecution you are suffering in the cause of Allah). Surely, Allah never lets the reward of those who dedicate themselves to doing good, knowing that Allah is watching, go to waste._

[UB 130:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p2_6) _Ganid was, by this time, beginning to learn how his tutor spent his leisure in this unusual personal ministry to his fellow men, and the young Indian set about to find out the motive for these incessant activities. He asked, “Why do you occupy yourself so continuously with these visits with strangers?” And Jesus answered: “Ganid, no man is a stranger to one who knows God. In the experience of finding the Father in heaven you discover that all men are your brothers, and does it seem strange that one should enjoy the exhilaration of meeting a newly discovered brother? To become acquainted with one’s brothers and sisters, to know their problems and to learn to love them, is the supreme experience of living.”_

[UB 130:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p2_7) _This was a conference which lasted well into the night, in the course of which the young man requested Jesus to tell him the difference between the will of God and that human mind act of choosing which is also called will. In substance Jesus said: The will of God is the way of God, partnership with the choice of God in the face of any potential alternative. To do the will of God, therefore, is the progressive experience of becoming more and more like God, and God is the source and destiny of all that is good and beautiful and true. The will of man is the way of man, the sum and substance of that which the mortal chooses to be and do. Will is the deliberate choice of a self-conscious being which leads to decision-conduct based on intelligent reflection._

The (Urantia) revelation complements every well-intentioned detail of evolving beliefs, highlighting the truths that each one holds.

[Quran 16-41,44](/en/book/Islam/Quran/16#v41) _Those who migrate (to another land) in the cause of Allah after being oppressed for their faith, We will certainly provide them with a good stay in this world, and their reward in the Hereafter is certainly greater. If only (all people) knew (how great is this reward)!_

_Those who have persevered in patience (through all adversities) and placed their trust in their Lord._

[Quran 16-91](/en/book/Islam/Quran/16#v91) _And fulfill the pledge of God when you make a pledge (and any pledge that you have between yourselves and in the name of God) and do not break your oaths after you have confirmed them. Surely you have taken God as guarantor. Truly God knows all that you do._

_God needs men of courage, who keep promises with the path laid out in their Savior._

[Quran 65-7](/en/book/Islam/Quran/65#v7) _Whoever has abundant resources, let him spend them properly; and whoever is given a (narrower) provision, let him spend from what God has given him. God does not entrust a soul with a duty except in what He has (already) given it (of capacity to perform that duty). God will create ease after the difficulty._

[UB 166:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p4_11) _“The Father’s human children have equal capacity for the reception of material blessings; therefore does he bestow things physical upon the children of men without discrimination. When it comes to the bestowal of spiritual gifts, the Father is limited by man’s capacity for receiving these divine endowments. Although the Father is no respecter of persons, in the bestowal of spiritual gifts he is limited by man’s faith and by his willingness always to abide by the Father’s will.”_

[Quran 16-79](/en/book/Islam/Quran/16#v79) _Do not the birds flying in the air consider themselves to be under the command of God? None sustains them except God (Who has given them the power of flight). Surely therein are signs (manifesting the truth) for the people who will believe and deepen in faith._ (See [Matthew 6-26](/en/Bible/Matthew/6#v26)).

[Quran 24-41](/en/book/Islam/Quran/24#v41) _Have you not considered that everything in the heavens and the earth, and the birds that fly in a row with outstretched wings, glorify God? Each one knows the manner of their prayer and glorification. God is fully aware of all they do._

[Quran 67-19](/en/book/Islam/Quran/67#v19) _Have you never considered the birds above you, flying in lines with wings spread and folded? Nothing supports you except the Merciful. Verily, He sees all things well._

[UB 165:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p5_1) _That evening after supper, when Jesus and the twelve gathered together for their daily conference, Andrew asked: “Master, while we were baptizing the believers, you spoke many words to the lingering multitude which we did not hear. Would you be willing to repeat these words for our benefit?” And in response to Andrew’s request, Jesus said:_

[UB 165:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p5_2) _“Yes, Andrew, I will speak to you about these matters of wealth and self-support, but my words to you, the apostles, must be somewhat different from those spoken to the disciples and the multitude since you have forsaken everything, not only to follow me, but to be ordained as ambassadors of the kingdom. Already have you had several years’ experience, and you know that the Father whose kingdom you proclaim will not forsake you. You have dedicated your lives to the ministry of the kingdom; therefore be not anxious or worried about the things of the temporal life, what you shall eat, nor yet for your body, what you shall wear. The welfare of the soul is more than food and drink; the progress in the spirit is far above the need of raiment. When you are tempted to doubt the sureness of your bread, consider the ravens; they sow not neither reap, they have no storehouses or barns, and yet the Father provides food for every one of them that seeks it. And of how much more value are you than many birds! Besides, all of your anxiety or fretting doubts can do nothing to supply your material needs. Which of you by anxiety can add a handbreadth to your stature or a day to your life? Since such matters are not in your hands, why do you give anxious thought to any of these problems?_

[UB 165:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p5_3) _“Consider the lilies, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin; yet I say to you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. If God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is cut down and cast into the fire, how much more shall he clothe you, the ambassadors of the heavenly kingdom. O you of little faith! When you wholeheartedly devote yourselves to the proclamation of the gospel of the kingdom, you should not be of doubtful minds concerning the support of yourselves or the families you have forsaken. If you give your lives truly to the gospel, you shall live by the gospel. If you are only believing disciples, you must earn your own bread and contribute to the sustenance of all who teach and preach and heal. If you are anxious about your bread and water, wherein are you different from the nations of the world who so diligently seek such necessities? Devote yourselves to your work, believing that both the Father and I know that you have need of all these things. Let me assure you, once and for all, that, if you dedicate your lives to the work of the kingdom, all your real needs shall be supplied. Seek the greater thing, and the lesser will be found therein; ask for the heavenly, and the earthly shall be included. The shadow is certain to follow the substance._

[UB 165:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p4_10) _To another standing near by who asked Jesus how the wealthy would stand in the day of judgment, he replied: “I have come to judge neither the rich nor the poor, but the lives men live will sit in judgment on all. Whatever else may concern the wealthy in the judgment, at least three questions must be answered by all who acquire great wealth, and these questions are:_

[UB 165:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p4_11) _“1. How much wealth did you accumulate?accumulated?_

[UB 165:4.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p4_12) _«2. How did you acquire this wealth?_

[UB 165:4.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p4_13) _“3. How did you use your wealth?”_

The trial of the millionaires, surely.

## YOU CAN'T FOOL GOD

[Quran 2-9](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v9) _They seek to deceive God and those who believe, but they deceive only themselves (with whom they are in love), but they do not realize._

[Quran 2-14,15](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v14) _When they meet those who believe, they declare (hypocritically): “We believe”; but when they are alone in secret with their (apparent human) devils (to whom they rush in need of renewing their disbelief and their commitment to them for fear of losing their support), they say: “Certainly, we are with you; we are only mocking (them).”_

(Since they are doing nothing but wanting to go astray and make fools of themselves), God returns their mockery, leaving them to wander blindly in their rebellion.

[Matthew 7-21,23](/en/Bible/Matthew/7#v21) 21 _Not everyone who says to me, “Lord, Lord,” will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven._

22 Many will say to me on that day, “Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name cast out demons, and perform many miracles?”

23 Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Depart from me, you evildoers!’

[Matthew 24-11](/en/Bible/Matthew/24#v11) _And many false prophets will arise and deceive many;_

[Matthew 24-24](/en/Bible/Matthew/24#v24) _For false Christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect._

[2 Peter 2-1,3](/en/Bible/2_Peter/2#v1) 1 _But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, bringing swift destruction on themselves._

2 _and many will follow their delusions, because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed,_

3 _and through covetousness they will with feigned words make merchandise of you. For such people, now of a long time, damnation does not linger, and their destruction does not slumber._

[2 Thessalonians 2-9](/en/Bible/2_Thessalonians/2#v9) _the coming of the wicked is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders_

[Jeremiah 14-14](/en/Bible/Jeremiah/14#v14) _Then the Lord said to me: The prophets prophesy falsely in my name; I did not send them, nor command them, nor speak to them; they prophesy to you a lying vision, divination, vanity, and deceit of their own heart._

[Jeremiah 23-11](/en/Bible/Jeremiah/23#v11) For both prophet and priest are wicked; even in my house I have found their wickedness, says the Lord.

[Jeremiah 23-30](/en/Bible/Jeremiah/23#v30) _Therefore, behold, I am against the (false) Prophets, says the Lord, who steal my words, each from his neighbor._

31 _The Lord says: Behold, I am against the prophets who sweeten their tongues and say, He has said._

32 Behold, saith the Lord, I am against them that prophesy lying dreams, and tell them, and cause my people to err with their lies and with their flattery, yet I did not send them, neither did I command them; and they have done no good to this people, saith the Lord.

[Quran 6-70](/en/book/Islam/Quran/6#v70) _Remove from those who regard their religion as enjoyment and amusement (and who make their religion a game and a diversion) and those who have been seduced by the worldly life._

[UB 140:3.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p3_19) _“I warn you against false prophets who will come to you in sheep’s clothing, while on the inside they are as ravening wolves. By their fruits you shall know them. Do men gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles? Even so, every good tree brings forth good fruit, but the corrupt tree bears evil fruit. A good tree cannot yield evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit. Every tree that does not bring forth good fruit is presently hewn down and cast into the fire. In gaining an entrance into the kingdom of heaven, it is the motive that counts. My Father looks into the hearts of men and judges by their inner longings and their sincere intentions._

[UB 140:3.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p3_20) _“In the great day of the kingdom judgment, many will say to me, ‘Did we not prophesy in your name and by your name do many wonderful works?’ But I will be compelled to say to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me you who are false teachers.’ But every one who hears this charge and sincerely executes his commission to represent me before men even as I have represented my Father to you, shall find an abundant entrance into my service and into the kingdom of the heavenly Father.”_

[UB 2:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p3_2) _How futile to make puerile appeals to such a God to modify his changeless decrees so that we can avoid the just consequences of the operation of his wise natural laws and righteous spiritual mandates! “Be not deceived; God is not mocked, for whatsoever a man sows that shall he also reap.” True, even in the justice of reaping the harvest of wrongdoing, this divine justice is always tempered with mercy. Infinite wisdom is the eternal arbiter which determines the proportions of justice and mercy which shall be meted out in any given circumstance. The greatest punishment (in reality an inevitable consequence) for wrongdoing and deliberate rebellion against the government of God is loss of existence as an individual subject of that government. The final result of wholehearted sin is annihilation. In the last analysis, such sin-identified individuals have destroyed themselves by becoming wholly unreal through their embrace of iniquity. The factual disappearance of such a creature is, however, always delayed until the ordained order of justice current in that universe has been fully complied with._

[UB 2:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p3_3) _Cessation of existence is usually decreed at the dispensational or epochal adjudication of the realm or realms..._

[Quran 8-55](/en/book/Islam/Quran/8#v55) _There is no doubt that the worst class of all living creatures in the sight of God are those who are so entrenched in disbelief that they cannot believe._

[UB 102:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p0_1) _TO THE unbelieving materialist, man is simply an evolutionary accident. His hopes of survival are strung on a figment of mortal imagination; his fears, loves, longings, and beliefs are but the reaction of the incidental juxtaposition of certain lifeless atoms of matter. No display of energy nor expression of trust can carry him beyond the grave. The devotional labors and inspirational genius of the best of men are doomed to be extinguished by death, the long and lonely night of eternal oblivion and soul extinction. Nameless despair is man’s only reward for living and toiling under the temporal sun of mortal existence. Each day of life slowly and surely tightens the grasp of a pitiless doom which a hostile and relentless universe of matter has decreed shall be the crowning insult to everything in human desire which is beautiful, noble, lofty, and good._

[UB 102:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p0_2) _But such is not man’s end and eternal destiny; such a vision is but the cry of despair uttered by some wandering soul who has become lost in spiritual darkness, and who bravely struggles on in the face of the mechanistic sophistries of a material philosophy, blinded by the confusion and distortion of a complex learning. And all this doom of darkness and all this destiny of despair are forever dispelled by one brave stretch of faith on the part of the most humble and unlearned of God’s children on earth._

[UB 102:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p0_3) _This saving faith has its birth in the human heart when the moral consciousness of man realizes that human values may be translated in mortal experience from the material to the spiritual, from the human to the divine, from time to eternity._

[Quran 9-8](/en/book/Islam/Quran/9#v8) ... They seek to please you with their mouths, but their hearts are reluctant; and most of them are transgressors (who habitually disregard all the bounds of equity).

[Matthew 23-25](/en/Bible/Matthew/23#v25) _Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside you are full of extortion and injustice._

26 You blind Pharisee! First cleanse the inside of the cup and the plate, so that the outside may be clean also.

27 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but within are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.

28 _So you also appear righteous to others on the outside, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness._

[UB 175:1.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/175#p1_17) _“Woe upon you, scribes and Pharisees and all other hypocrites who make sure that they tithe mint, anise, and cumin and at the same time disregard the weightier matters of the law—faith, mercy, and judgment! Within reason, the one you ought to have done but not to have left the other undone. You are truly blind guides and dumb teachers; you strain out the gnat and swallow the camel._

[UB 175:1.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/175#p1_18) _“Woe upon you, scribes, Pharisees, and hypocrites! for you are scrupulous to cleanse the outside of the cup and the platter, but within there remains the filth of extortion, excesses, and deception. You are spiritually blind. Do you not recognize how much better it would be first to cleanse the inside of the cup, and then that which spills over would of itself cleanse the outside? You wicked reprobates! you make the outward performances of your religion to conform with the letter of your interpretation of Moses’ law while your souls are steeped in iniquity and filled with murder._

[UB 175:1.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/175#p1_19) _“Woe upon all of you who reject truth and spurn mercy! Many of you are like whited sepulchres, which outwardly appear beautiful but within are full of dead men’s bones and all sorts of uncleanness. Even so do you who knowingly reject the counsel of God appear outwardly to men as holy and righteous, but inwardly your hearts are filled with hypocrisy and iniquity._

[Quran 15-35](/en/book/Islam/Quran/15#v35) _This is because you used to mock at all the signs and Revelations of God, and the worldly life deceived you..._

[Quran 15-72](/en/book/Islam/Quran/15#v72) _As your life! They wandered about, lost in their delirium (of perversion)._

[Quran 16-107](/en/book/Islam/Quran/16#v107) _And that is because they have chosen the present, worldly life rather than the Hereafter, and because God does not guide the disbelieving people._

[Quran 17-72](/en/book/Islam/Quran/17#v72) _Whoever is blind in this (world) (who has not followed any path to faith, righteousness, and responsibility in the Hereafter) will be blind in the Hereafter and even more astray from the path (that leads to Divine forgiveness and eternal satisfaction)._

[Quran 48-11](/en/book/Islam/Quran/48#v11) _Those among the Bedouin who lagged behind will say to you (as an excuse): “Our possessions and families kept us busy, so ask God for our forgiveness.” They speak with their tongues that which is not in their hearts._

_Say (to them): “Who can intercede for you with God if He intends a benefit for you? (Whatever excuse you offer, consider that) God is fully aware of everything you do.”_

[Quran 104-3](/en/book/Islam/Quran/104#v3) _He believes that his wealth will make him endure forever!_

## DEMONIC PACTS

[Quran 2-102](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v102) _And (as their ancestors did) they followed the inventions which the devils conceived and spread about the reign of Solomon (falsely attributing his use of jinn, demons and animals in his reign to sorcery). But (attributing creation or creative effects to sorcery is a form of disbelief and) Solomon (who was a prophet and an excellent Servant of God) never succumbed to disbelief, but it was the devils (who spread falsehoods about his reign) who disbelieved, teaching people sorcery and (the distorted form of) the knowledge that had been revealed to Haru and Marat, the angels of Babylon... how evil was that for which they sold their souls; if only they knew._

[Quran 4-117](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v117) _Instead, they invoke female deities (and in doing so) they in fact invoke no one but an arrogant and rebellious demon._

[Quran 5-90,91](/en/book/Islam/Quran/5#v90) _O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, sacrifices to idols (in places consecrated for offerings to other than God) and (the pagan practice of) divining arrows (and similar practices) are an abominable evil work of Satan; avoid them completely so that you may prosper (in both worlds)_

[1 Corinthians 6-9](/en/Bible/1_Corinthians/6#v9) _Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor those who have sex with mankind,_

[Galatians 6-7](/en/Bible/Galatians/6#v7) _Do not be deceived: God is not mocked: for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap._

Satan seeks enmity and hatred among you only through intoxicants, gambling, and turning you away from the remembrance of God and prayer. So, then, will you not abstain?

Certain quotes from books of spiritual teaching have always urged human beings not to engage in those seemingly harmless acts: acts of drunkenness, gluttony, and sordid adventures for the spirit. The spirit itself is stripped of its mortal indwelling; such aberrations distance us from God; such things entail aberrations.

[UB 112:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p3_3) _2. Intellectual (mind) death. When the vital circuits of higher adjutant ministry are disrupted through the aberrations of intellect or because of the partial destruction of the mechanism of the brain, and if these conditions pass a certain critical point of irreparability, the indwelling Adjuster is immediately released to depart for Divinington. On the universe records a mortal personality is considered to have met with death whenever the essential mind circuits of human will-action have been destroyed._

A human being without God is a living dead being, just atoms without spiritual life wandering around the world.

[UB 110:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p1_5) _The Adjuster remains with you in all disaster and through every sickness which does not wholly destroy the mentality. But how unkind knowingly to defile or otherwise deliberately to pollute the physical body, which must serve as the earthly tabernacle of this marvelous gift from God. All physical poisons greatly retard the efforts of the Adjuster to exalt the material mind, while the mental poisons of fear, anger, envy, jealousy, suspicion, and intolerance likewise tremendously interfere with the spiritual progress of the evolving soul._

The Urantia Book is a work that attests to what those messengers (prophets) intended to convey. Today, we have a broader view of the unbridled consequences of an immature self lacking wisdom. Despite these situations, the Spirit helps us maintain a healthy social life, a healthy body, and an expansive spiritual life.

[UB 91:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p7_5) _The practical test of all these strange religious experiences of mysticism, ecstasy, and inspiration is to observe whether these phenomena cause an individual:_

[UB 91:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p7_6) _1. To enjoy better and more complete physical health._

[UB 91:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p7_7) _2. To function more efficiently and practically in his mental life._

[UB 91:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p7_8) _3. More fully and joyfully to socialize his religious experience._

[UB 91:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p7_9) _4. More completely to spiritualize his day-by-day living while faithfully discharging the commonplace duties of routine mortal existence._

[UB 91:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p7_10) _5. To enhance his love for, and appreciation of, truth, beauty, and goodness._

[UB 91:7.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p7_11) _6. To conserve currently recognized social, moral, ethical, and spiritual values._

[UB 91:7.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p7_12) _7. To increase his spiritual insight—God-consciousness._

[Quran 19-68,69](/en/book/Islam/Quran/19#v68) _And so, by your Lord, We will resurrect them and gather them all together, and the devils (of human beings and of the jinn whom they used to follow,) before Us, and then We will surely gather them on their knees in groups around Hell._

Afterwards, we will undoubtedly root out from each group of the same belief the most stubbornly rebellious against the Merciful.

Although Hell is mentioned in these verses, it is clear that it is the final extinction of the rebellious beings who have fallen from the light and their armies of evil; human beings can participate in them.

[UB 67:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p7_1) _The personal (centripetal) consequences of the creature’s willful and persistent rejection of light are both inevitable and individual and are of concern only to Deity and to that personal creature. Such a soul-destroying harvest of iniquity is the inner reaping of the iniquitous will creature._

[UB 67:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p7_7) _... No person is ever made to suffer vital spiritual deprivation because of the sin of another. Sin is wholly personal as to moral guilt or spiritual consequences, notwithstanding its far-flung repercussions in administrative, intellectual, and social domains._

[Quran 22-3](/en/book/Islam/Quran/22#v3) _Among the people are those who argue about God without any true knowledge and follow every corrupt, rebellious and malicious devil._

[Quran 42-42](/en/book/Islam/Quran/42#v42) _The way (of reproach and retaliation) is only against those who wrong people and behave rebelliously on Earth, defying all justice. For such individuals is a painful punishment._

[Quran 43-62](/en/book/Islam/Quran/43#v62) _And never let Satan lead you astray (from the straight path). He is indeed a manifest enemy._

[UB 188:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p4_5) _The animal nature—the tendency toward evil-doing—may be hereditary, but sin is not transmitted from parent to child. Sin is the act of conscious and deliberate rebellion against the Father’s will and the Sons’ laws by an individual will creature._

[UB 53:9.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p9_8) _But for ages the seven prison worlds of spiritual darkness in Satania have constituted a solemn warning to all Nebadon, eloquently and effectively proclaiming the great truth “that the way of the transgressor is hard”; “that within every sin is concealed the seed of its own destruction”; that “the wages of sin is death.”_

[Proverbs 13-15](/en/Bible/Proverbs/13#v15) _Good understanding gives grace;_

_But the way of transgressors is hard._

[Romans 6-23](/en/Bible/Romans/6#v23) _For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord._

Much more can be seen with a deeper study of sin and the judgment of these rebels of light, as well as by studying the Lucifer rebellion and the planetary rebellion. Islam has little information about the rebellion in its contemporary writings. The Urantia Book complements, expands, and projects the information obtained by humankind.

## THE LOVE OF GOD

[Quran 2-222](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v222) _... indeed God loves those who return to Him in sincere repentance (of their past sins and mistakes) and He loves those who purify._

[Quran 3-146](/en/book/Islam/Quran/3#v146) _And how many prophets have had to fight (in the Cause of God) followed by a multitude of pious and totally dedicated servants of God, and they did not become discouraged by what befell them in the Cause of God, nor did they falter, nor did they humble themselves (before the enemy). And God loves those who are steadfastly patient._

[Quran 3-148](/en/book/Islam/Quran/3#v148) _And so God has rewarded them in this life and has given them a better reward in the Hereafter. Surely God loves those who do good, knowing that God is watching over them._

[UB 2:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p5_1) _“God is love”; therefore his only personal attitude towards the affairs of the universe is always a reaction of divine affection. The Father loves us sufficiently to bestow his life upon us. “He makes his sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.”_

[Matthew 5-45](/en/Bible/Matthew/5#v45) _so that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven, for he makes his sun rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust._

[Quran 4-17](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v17) _God accepts the repentance of those who commit evil out of ignorance and then (turn away and) repent immediately afterward. It is their repentance that God reciprocates with forgiveness; God is all-knowing (of what each one does and why he does it) and all-wise._

[UB 89:10.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/89#p10_6) _The forgiveness of sin by Deity is the renewal of loyalty relations following a period of the human consciousness of the lapse of such relations as the consequence of conscious rebellion. The forgiveness does not have to be sought, only received as the consciousness of re-establishment of loyalty relations between the creature and the Creator. And all the loyal sons of God are happy, service-loving, and ever-progressive in the Paradise ascent._

[Quran 7-56](/en/book/Islam/Quran/7#v56) _... Indeed, the Mercy of God is near to those who do good, knowing that God is looking upon them._

[UB 2:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p4_1) _Mercy is simply justice tempered by that wisdom which grows out of perfection of knowledge and the full recognition of the natural weaknesses and environmental handicaps of finite creatures. “Our God is full of compassion, gracious, long-suffering, and plenteous in mercy.” Therefore “whosoever calls upon the Lord shall be saved,” “for he will abundantly pardon.” “The mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting”; yes, “his mercy endures forever.” “I am the Lord who executes loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness in the earth, for in these things I delight.” “I do not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men,” for I am “the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort.”_

[Quran 9-108](/en/book/Islam/Quran/9#v108) _... God loves those who strive to purify themselves._

[Quran 19-76](/en/book/Islam/Quran/19#v76) _God strengthens with guidance those who seek and find guidance. Good and righteous deeds of perpetual merit are better in the sight of their Lord in reward and result._

[Quran 19-96](/en/book/Islam/Quran/19#v96) _Surely those who believe and do good and righteous deeds, the Merciful will bestow love upon them (in the Heavens and many upon the Earth so that they may be welcomed throughout Creation, however weak and few they may be now)_

[Quran 22-63,66](/en/book/Islam/Quran/22#v63) _Or do you consider that God sends down water from the sky, and looks upon the earth as green? Surely, God is Subtle (Perceiving the smallest dimensions of all things and accomplishing what He wills, so that they are not fully tangible), All-Aware._

To Him belongs everything in the heavens and on earth. Surely, God is the All-Profound and Self-Sufficient (absolutely independent of all creation), the Praiseworthy (Who provides for them all as their Lord).

_Do you not consider that God has made everything on Earth to serve you, and the ships that sail the sea by His command? And He holds the Heavens so that they do not fall to Earth except by His permission. Surely God is merciful and compassionate to people._

_It is He who gave you life, then makes you die, then raises you up again. Yet, man is truly ungrateful._

[Quran 29-60,62](/en/book/Islam/Quran/29#v60) _How many living creatures are there that do not carry their own sustenance (deposited), yet God provides for them and He provides for you! He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing._

If you ask them, “Who is He who created the heavens and the earth, and made the sun and the moon subject to His command (thus sustaining life)?” They will undoubtedly say, “God, how is it then that those (who oppose this revelation) turned away from the truth and proclaimed false claims?”

_God increases the provision to those of His servants whom His Will disposes, and He spares it (to whom His Will disposes) or there is no doubt that God possesses full knowledge of all things._

[Quran 30-46](/en/book/Islam/Quran/30#v46) _Among His Signs is that He sends the merciful winds as glad tidings so that He may favor you with a token of His Mercy, and that the ships may sail by His command (according to the laws He has laid down), and that you may seek His bounty, and that (in recognition of all these favors of His) you may be grateful (to Him)._

[UB 2:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p4_2) _God is inherently kind, naturally compassionate, and everlastingly merciful. And never is it necessary that any influence be brought to bear upon the Father to call forth his loving-kindness. The creature’s need is wholly sufficient to insure the full flow of the Father’s tender mercies and his saving grace. Since God knows all about his children, it is easy for him to forgive. The better man understands his neighbor, the easier it will be to forgive him, even to love him._

[UB 2:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p4_3) _Only the discernment of infinite wisdom enables a righteous God to minister justice and mercy at the same time and in any given universe situation. The heavenly Father is never torn by conflicting attitudes towards his universe children; God is never a victim of attitudinal antagonisms. God’s all-knowingness unfailingly directs his free will in the choosing of that universe conduct which perfectly, simultaneously, and equally satisfies the demands of all his divine attributes and the infinite qualities of his eternal nature._

[UB 2:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p4_4) _Mercy is the natural and inevitable offspring of goodness and love. The good nature of a loving Father could not possibly withhold the wise ministry of mercy to each member of every group of his universe children. Eternal justice and divine mercy together constitute what in human experience would be called fairness._

[UB 2:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p4_5) _Divine mercy represents a fairness technique of adjustment between the universe levels of perfection and imperfection. Mercy is the justice of Supremacy adapted to the situations of the evolving finite, the righteousness of eternity modified to meet the highest interests and universe welfare of the children of time. Mercy is not a contravention of justice but rather an understanding interpretation of the demands of supreme justice as it is fairly applied to the subordinate spiritual beings and to the material creatures of the evolving universes. Mercy is the justice of the Paradise Trinity wisely and lovingly visited upon the manifold intelligences of the creations of time and space as it is formulated by divine wisdom and determined by the all-knowing mind and the sovereign free will of the Universal Father and all his associated Creators._

[Quran 34-24](/en/book/Islam/Quran/34#v24) _Say: Who is He who provides for you the heavens and the earth? Say: It is God! Surely then, either we (who believe in His Oneness as Deity, Lord, and Supreme Sovereign) follow, or you (who attribute to Him partners in His Divinity, Lordship, and Sovereignty) follow the true guidance, or we are clearly astray._

[Quran 35-2](/en/book/Islam/Quran/35#v2) _What God opens for human beings from (the treasures of) His Mercy, no one can withhold; and what He withholds, no one can release. He is Glorious, possessing irresistible power (whom no one can prevent from doing what He wills), All-Knowing (in every act of Whom many examples of wisdom are given)_

[Quran 61-4](/en/book/Islam/Quran/61#v4) _God certainly loves those who fight in His cause in ranks as if it were a firm and solid structure._

[UB 155:6.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p6_11) _Never forget that there is only one adventure more satisfying and exciting than the attempt to discover the will of the living God, and that is the supreme experience of honestly trying to do the divine will. Never fail to remember that the will of God can be accomplished in any earthly occupation. There are no holy vocations and no secular vocations. All things are sacred in the lives of those who are spirit-led; that is, subordinated to truth, ennobled by love, dominated by mercy, and controlled by equanimity—righteousness. The spirit which my Father and I shall send into the world is not only the Spirit of Truth, but also the spirit of idealistic beauty._

## THE WILL OF GOD

[Quran 3-101](/en/book/Islam/Quran/3#v101) _How is it that you disbelieve, when God's revelations are recited to you, and His Messenger is among you? Whoever holds fast to God will be guided to a straight path._

[Quran 4-175](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v175) _So those who believe in God (as is evident from this Proof and this Light) and draw near to Him, He will admit them to (great) mercy from His Presence and bounty and guide them to Himself on a straight path._

[UB 111:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p5_1) _The doing of the will of God is nothing more or less than an exhibition of creature willingness to share the inner life with God—with the very God who has made such a creature life of inner meaning-value possible. Sharing is Godlike—divine. God shares all with the Eternal Son and the Infinite Spirit, while they, in turn, share all things with the divine Sons and spirit Daughters of the universes._

[UB 111:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p5_2) _The imitation of God is the key to perfection; the doing of his will is the secret of survival and of perfection in survival._

[UB 111:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p5_3) _Mortals live in God, and so God has willed to live in mortals. As men trust themselves to him, so has he—and first—trusted a part of himself to be with men; has consented to live in men and to indwell men subject to the human will._

[UB 111:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p5_4) _Peace in this life, survival in death, perfection in the next life, service in eternity—all these are achieved (in spirit) now when the creature personality consents—chooses—to subject the creature will to the Father’s will. And already has the Father chosen to make a fragment of himself subject to the will of the creature personality._

[UB 111:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p5_5) _Such a creature choice is not a surrender of will. It is a consecration of will, an expansion of will, a glorification of will, a perfecting of will; and such choosing raises the creature will from the level of temporal significance to that higher estate wherein the personality of the creature son communes with the personality of the spirit Father._

[UB 111:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p5_6) _This choosing of the Father’s will is the spiritual finding of the spirit Father by mortal man, even though an age must pass before the creature son may actually stand in the factual presence of God on Paradise. This choosing does not so much consist in the negation of creature will—“Not my will but yours be done”—as it consists in the creature’s positive affirmation: “It is my will that your will be done.” And if this choice is made, sooner or later will the God-choosing son find inner union (fusion) with the indwelling God fragment, while this same perfecting son will find supreme personality satisfaction in the worship communion of the personality of man and the personality of his Maker, two personalities whose creative attributes have eternally joined in self-willed mutuality of expression—the birth of another eternal partnership of the will of man and the will of God._

[Quran 7-57](/en/book/Islam/Quran/7#v57) _And He it is Who sends the merciful winds as glad tidings before His Mercy, that when they carry new burdens, We may guide them over a dead land and thus send down water from them, thereby bringing forth fruits (crops) of every kind. In the same way We bring forth the dead (on the Day of Judgment) that you may reflect and be considerate._

[Quran 11-23](/en/book/Islam/Quran/11#v23) _As for those who believe, and do good and righteous deeds, and have surrendered themselves to their Lord, they are the companions of Paradise, therein they will dwell._

[UB 155:6.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p6_11) _Never forget there is only one adventure which is more satisfying and thrilling than the attempt to discover the will of the living God, and that is the supreme experience of honestly trying to do that divine will. And fail not to remember that the will of God can be done in any earthly occupation. Some callings are not holy and others secular. All things are sacred in the lives of those who are spirit led; that is, subordinated to truth, ennobled by love, dominated by mercy, and restrained by fairness—justice. The spirit which my Father and I shall send into the world is not only the Spirit of Truth but also the spirit of idealistic beauty._

[Quran 11-56](/en/book/Islam/Quran/11#v56) _I have put my trust in God, my Lord and your Lord. There is no living creature that He does not take by the hair and that is not under His complete control. Surely, my Lord is on a straight path (He governs existence and carries out all His decrees correctly and with absolute justice)._

[Quran 11-115](/en/book/Islam/Quran/11#v115) _And be patient and persevere (in doing good, avoiding error, and against every kind of persecution you are suffering in the cause of Allah). Surely, Allah never lets the reward of those who dedicate themselves to doing good, knowing that Allah is watching, go to waste._

[Quran 16-41](/en/book/Islam/Quran/16#v41) _Those who migrate (to another land) in the cause of Allah after being oppressed for their faith, We will certainly provide them with a good stay in this world, and their reward in the Hereafter is certainly greater. If only (all people) knew (how great is that reward)!_

_Those who have persevered in patience (through all adversities) and placed their trust in their Lord._

_Before you (O Muhammad) We sent none but men to whom We revealed - and if you (O people) do not know, then ask the people of expert knowledge (those who have knowledge of Divine Revelations)._

_(We have sent them with) clear proofs of the truth and Scriptures. And to you We have sent down the Reminder so that you may explain to humanity what has been revealed to them (through you about the truth of their present and future lives), and that they may reflect._

[Quran 16-91](/en/book/Islam/Quran/16#v91) _And fulfill the pledge of God when you make a pledge (and any pledge that you have between yourselves in the Name of God) and do not break your oaths after you have confirmed them. Surely you have taken God as guarantor. Truly God knows all that you do._

[Quran 16:79](/en/book/Islam/Quran/16#v79) _Do they not consider the birds flying in the air to be under the command of God? None controls them except God (who has given them the power of flight). Surely therein are signs (manifesting the truth) for the people who will believe and deepen their faith. (See Matthew 6:26)_

## THE THOUGHT ADJUSTER

[Quran 2-156](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v156) _Those who, when a calamity befalls them, say: “Surely we belong to God (as creatures and servants of His), and verily to Him we shall return.” (And they act accordingly)._

[UB 110:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p3_4) _... The great goal of human existence is to attune to the divinity of the indwelling Adjuster; the great achievement of mortal life is the attainment of a true and understanding consecration to the eternal aims of the divine spirit who waits and works within your mind. But a devoted and determined effort to realize eternal destiny is wholly compatible with a lighthearted and joyous life and with a successful and honorable career on earth. Co-operation with the Thought Adjuster does not entail self-torture, mock piety, or hypocritical and ostentatious self-abasement; the ideal life is one of loving service rather than an existence of fearful apprehension._

[Quran 2-157](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v157) _Upon them are blessings from their Lord (such as forgiveness, answering their calls, and meeting their needs) and mercy (which comes in the form of help both in this life and in the Hereafter, and favors in Paradise beyond human imagining); they are the rightly guided._

[UB 194:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_1) _Many queer and strange teachings became associated with the early narratives of the day of Pentecost. In subsequent times the events of this day, on which the Spirit of Truth, the new teacher, came to dwell with mankind, have become confused with the foolish outbreaks of rampant emotionalism. The chief mission of this outpoured spirit of the Father and the Son is to teach men about the truths of the Father’s love and the Son’s mercy. These are the truths of divinity which men can comprehend more fully than all the other divine traits of character. The Spirit of Truth is concerned primarily with the revelation of the Father’s spirit nature and the Son’s moral character. The Creator Son, in the flesh, revealed God to men; the Spirit of Truth, in the heart, reveals the Creator Son to men. When man yields the “fruits of the spirit” in his life, he is simply showing forth the traits which the Master manifested in his own earthly life. When Jesus was on earth, he lived his life as one personality—Jesus of Nazareth. As the indwelling spirit of the “new teacher,” the Master has, since Pentecost, been able to live his life anew in the experience of every truth-taught believer._

[Quran 2-269](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v269) He gives wisdom to whom He wills, and to whomever is given wisdom, much good is given. Yet only the people of discernment reflect and are attentive. (See [Ephesians 1-17](/en/Bible/Ephesians/1#v17) and [James 1-5](/en/Bible/James/1#v5)).

[Quran 7-10](/en/book/Islam/Quran/7#v10) _We have indeed established you on the earth (O mankind, and have given you great potential) and have entrusted you with your livelihood. You give no thanks._

[Quran 8-24](/en/book/Islam/Quran/8#v24) _O you who believe! Respond to God and to the Messenger when the Messenger calls you (in the name of God) to that which gives you life, and know that God_
“intervenes” between the person and the heart and that you will be reunited before Him.

[UB 108:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p6_1) _It is indeed a marvel of divine condescension for the exalted and perfect Adjusters to offer themselves for actual existence in the minds of material creatures, such as the mortals of Urantia, really to consummate a probationary union with the animal-origin beings of earth._

The Thought Adjuster is God within us mortals. It is the divine part that guides us on the spiritual path.

Religions understand little about God, as well as about God in man.

In our minds and cultures, we have a distant God (without knowing where He is). Revelation is meant to help us conceptually understand our inner God and Father in our human experience and ascendancy to the Great Beyond (as the Quran says). There is also the Spirit of Truth that accompanies our living souls.

[Quran 16-102](/en/book/Islam/Quran/16#v102) _Say (Say to them, O Messenger): “My Lord says): ”The Spirit of Holiness brings it from your Lord with the Truth (embodiing the truth and with nothing false in it), that it may confirm those who believe (strengthening them in their faith and adherence to the path of God) and as guidance and glad tidings for the Muslims (those who have submitted themselves totally to God)."_

[Quran 18-24](/en/book/Islam/Quran/18#v24) _And remember your Lord when you forget, and say: "I hope that my Lord will guide me to that which is nearer to right conduct than this (my forgetfulness)_

[Quran 17-85](/en/book/Islam/Quran/17#v85) _They ask you about the spirit, Say: "The spirit is from the Command of my Lord, and of knowledge, but a little has been given to you._

[Quran 26-78, 83](/en/book/Islam/Quran/26#v78) _He Who created me and therefore guides me (to all that is for my benefit in this world and the next)._

_And He is the One Who provides me with food and drink;_

_And Who, when I fall ill, heals me._

_And Who will make me die and then grant me new life._

_And Who, I hope, will forgive my sins on the Day of Judgment.
My Lord! Grant me sound judgment, and gather me among the upright.

[Quran 40-15](/en/book/Islam/Quran/40#v15) _He is above all degrees, the Lord of the Supreme Throne. He transmits the spirit (the life-giving Revelation from the immaterial realm) of His Order to whomever His Will dictates from His servants, to warn (the sentient and responsible beings) of the Day of Meeting (when His servants will meet Him)._

[Quran 57-28](/en/book/Islam/Quran/57#v28) _... And He will assign for you a light to travel (on the straight path in this world, leading to Paradise in the Hereafter) and He will forgive you. God is the Forgiving, Compassionate._

[Quran 58-22](/en/book/Islam/Quran/58#v22) _... Those (are) those in whose hearts God has inscribed faith and strengthened them with a spirit from Himself (which is the source of their spiritual vigor and intellectual illumination). And He will admit them to Gardens through which rivers flow, therein they will dwell. God is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him..._

[Quran 64-8](/en/book/Islam/Quran/64#v8) _So believe (O human beings) in God and His Messenger, and the Light which He has sent down (The spirit) God is fully aware of all that you do!_

## THE HAVONA CIRCUITS AND THE MANSION WORLDS (THE MANSIONS)

[Quran 2-29](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v29) _He it is Who (made the Earth fit for your life before He gave you life and) created everything in the world for you (to create you - the human race - and to make the Earth fit for your life); then He turned (His Will) towards the sky and arranged it into seven heavens (in perfect balance). He is fully aware of all things._

[Quran 67-3](/en/book/Islam/Quran/67#v3) _He Who created the seven heavens in harmony. You see no error or inconsistency in the creation of the Merciful. Look again: can you see any fault?_

[Quran 71-15](/en/book/Islam/Quran/71#v15) _Do you not see how God has created the seven heavens in harmony?_

These verses reveal two points to me: both the mansion worlds and the Havona circuits are in perfect balance.

[UB 14:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p1_9) _The billion worlds of Havona are arranged in seven concentric circuits immediately surrounding the three circuits of Paradise satellites. There are upwards of thirty-five million worlds in the innermost Havona circuit and over two hundred and forty-five million in the outermost, with proportionate numbers intervening. Each circuit differs, but all are perfectly balanced and exquisitely organized, and each is pervaded by a specialized representation of the Infinite Spirit, one of the Seven Spirits of the Circuits. In addition to other functions this impersonal Spirit co-ordinates the conduct of celestial affairs throughout each circuit._ (See The Urantia Book, Paper 14.)

[Quran 6-127](/en/book/Islam/Quran/6#v127) _For them is the Abode of Peace with their Lord (where they will enjoy perfect peace and salvation) and He is their Protector because of what they have been doing._

[UB 27:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p1_5) _The last rest of time has been enjoyed; the last transition sleep has been experienced; now you awake to life everlasting on the shores of the eternal abode. “And there shall be no more sleep. The presence of God and his Son are before you, and you are eternally his servants; you have seen his face, and his name is your spirit. There shall be no night there; and they need no light of the sun, for the Great Source and Center gives them light; they shall live forever and ever. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things have passed away.”_

[Quran 17-44](/en/book/Islam/Quran/17#v44) _The seven heavens and the earth and all that is in them glorify Him. There is nothing that does not glorify Him with its praises, but you will not understand its glorification. Yet He is (regardless of what His Servants have earned from Him) Compassionate and Forgiving._

This verse refers to seven heavens, which, from a broader and revelatory point of view, tells me about the seven worlds of abode.

[Quran 30-50](/en/book/Islam/Quran/30#v50) _Consider, then, the signs of God's mercy, how He revives the earth after its death: surely then it is He Who raises the dead. He is the One Who has full power over all things._

[Quran 23-16,17](/en/book/Islam/Quran/23#v16) _After that, you will certainly be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection._

_Indeed, We have created above you seven heavens, one above the other, and seven paths (for the angels to move about, for the commands of God to descend, and for the actions of beings to ascend). We are not unaware of creation and what We create (with all the aspects of their lives)._

[Quran 31-28](/en/book/Islam/Quran/31#v28) _Your creation and your resurrection are but (the creation and resurrection) of a single soul. Verily, God is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing._

[Quran 41-12](/en/book/Islam/Quran/41#v12) _So He formed seven heavens in two days, and inspired in each heaven its tasks. And We adorned the lowest heaven with lamps, and We guarded. This is the measured determination of the Glorious, Possessor of irresistible power, the All-Knowing._

[Quran 48-20](/en/book/Islam/Quran/48#v20) _God has promised you many spoils that you will obtain and has given you these in advance and removed the hand of men from you so that it would be a sign for the believers and to guide you to a straight path._

[Quran 65-12](/en/book/Islam/Quran/65#v12) _God is the One Who created the seven heavens and the earth like them; and may His commandments (concerning creation and its operation, and the lives of the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth) be revealed to them, that they may know with certainty that God is supremely powerful over all things, and that God truly encompasses all things in (His) Knowledge._

[Quran 78-12](/en/book/Islam/Quran/78#v12) _And We have built over you seven firm heavens._

[UB 45:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_1) _The seven major worlds swinging around Jerusem are generally known as the transitional culture spheres. Their rulers are designated from time to time by the Jerusem supreme executive council. These spheres are numbered and named as follows:_

[UB 45:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_2) _Number 1. The Finaliter World. This is the headquarters of the finaliter corps of the local system and is surrounded by the receiving worlds, the seven mansion worlds, dedicated so fully to the scheme of mortal ascension. The finaliter world is accessible to the inhabitants of all seven mansion worlds. Transport seraphim carry ascending personalities back and forth on these pilgrimages, which are designed to cultivate their faith in the ultimate destiny of transition mortals. Although the finaliters and their structures are not ordinarily perceptible to morontia vision, you will be more than thrilled, from time to time, when the energy transformers and the Morontia Power Supervisors enable you momentarily to glimpse these high spirit personalities who have actually completed the Paradise ascension, and who have returned to the very worlds where you are beginning this long journey, as the pledge of assurance that you may and can complete the stupendous undertaking. All mansion world sojourners go to the finaliter sphere at least once a year for these assemblies of finaliter visualization._

[UB 45:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_3) _Number 2. The Morontia World. This planet is the headquarters of the supervisors of morontia life and is surrounded by the seven spheres whereon the morontia chiefs train their associates and helpers, both morontia beings and ascending mortals._

[UB 45:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_4) _In passing through the seven mansion worlds, you will also progress through these cultural and social spheres of increasing morontia contact. When you advance from the first to the second mansion world, you will become eligible for a visitor’s permit to transitional headquarters number two, the morontia world, and so on. And when present on any one of these six cultural spheres, you may, on invitation, become a visitor and observer on any of the seven surrounding worlds of associated group activities._

[UB 45:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_5) _Number 3. The Angelic World. This is the headquarters of all the seraphic hosts engaged in system activities and is surrounded by the seven worlds of angelic training and instruction. These are the seraphic social spheres._

[UB 45:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_6) _Number 4. The Superangel World. This sphere is the Satania home of the Brilliant Evening Stars and a vast concourse of co-ordinate and near-co-ordinate beings. The seven satellites of this world are assigned to the seven major groups of these unnamed celestial beings._

[UB 45:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_7) _Number 5. The World of the Sons. This planet is the headquarters of the divine Sons of all orders, including the creature-trinitized sons. The surrounding seven worlds are devoted to certain individual groupings of these divinely related sons._

[UB 45:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_8) _Number 6. The World of the Spirit. This sphere serves as the system rendezvous of the high personalities of the Infinite Spirit. Its seven surrounding satellites are assigned to individual groups of these diverse orders. But on transition world number six there is no representation of the Spirit, neither is such a presence to be observed on the system capitals; the Divine Minister of Salvington is everywhere in Nebadon._

[UB 45:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p1_9) _Number 7. The World of the Father. This is the silent sphere of the system. No group of beings is domiciled on it. The great temple of light occupies a central place, but no one can be discerned therein. All beings of all the system worlds are welcomed as worshipers._

[UB 47:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p0_1) _THE Creator Son, when on Urantia, spoke of the “many mansions in the Father’s universe.” In a certain sense, all fifty-six of the encircling worlds of Jerusem are devoted to the transitional culture of ascending mortals, but the seven satellites of world number one are more specifically known as the mansion worlds._

[UB 47:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p0_2) _Transition world number one itself is quite exclusively devoted to ascendant activities, being the headquarters of the finaliter corps assigned to Satania. This world now serves as the headquarters for more than one hundred thousand companies of finaliters, and there are one thousand glorified beings in each of these groups._

## THE RESURRECTION

[Quran 2-56](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v56) _Then, from that death-like state, We revived you (by causing you to recover from that death-like state) so that you might be thankful._

[1 Corinthians 15-40](/en/Bible/1_Corinthians/15#v40) _There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies; but the glory of the heavenly is one, and the glory of the earthly is another._

[UB 47:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p3_2) _The very center of all activities on the first mansion world is the resurrection hall, the enormous temple of personality assembly. This gigantic structure consists of the central rendezvous of the seraphic destiny guardians, the Thought Adjusters, and the archangels of the resurrection. The Life Carriers also function with these celestial beings in the resurrection of the dead._

[UB 47:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p3_3) _The mortal-mind transcripts and the active creature-memory patterns as transformed from the material levels to the spiritual are the individual possession of the detached Thought Adjusters; these spiritized factors of mind, memory, and creature personality are forever a part of such Adjusters. The creature mind-matrix and the passive potentials of identity are present in the morontia soul intrusted to the keeping of the seraphic destiny guardians. And it is the reuniting of the morontia-soul trust of the seraphim and the spirit-mind trust of the Adjuster that reassembles creature personality and constitutes resurrection of a sleeping survivor._

[Quran 3-107](/en/book/Islam/Quran/3#v107) _Those whose faces shine will be (included) in the Mercy of God, wherein they will dwell eternally._

[Quran 4-87](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v87) _God, there is no Deity but He. He will gather you all together on the Day of Resurrection (of the coming) about which there is no doubt. Who can be more truthful than God?_

[Quran 6-12](/en/book/Islam/Quran/6#v12) Say: “To whom belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth?” Say: “To God.” To Himself has mercy been prescribed (so, despite the errors and misconceptions of His servants, He sustains all that is in the heavens and the earth by His mercy. He leaves no one to its mercy, and, as a requirement of His mercy, He will surely gather you all together on the Day of Resurrection about (whose coming) there is no doubt. Those who have ruined themselves (by abusing and corrupting their primordial nature, their sound reasoning and their capacity to believe, which are their principal part of God's mercy) do not believe.

[Quran 6-32](/en/book/Islam/Quran/6#v32) _And the present life of this world is nothing but enjoyment and amusement, and the Abode of the Hereafter is better for those who turn away from disobedience to God in worship and piety. Will you not then understand and reason?_

This verse shows me that we should not get involved in sordid and cheap adventures, that there is a better life and it is forged from this moment on for the Hereafter.

[Quran 9-38](/en/book/Islam/Quran/9#v38) _O you who believe! What excuse do you have that when you are told, “Mobilize in the cause of God!” you hold fast to the earth? Do you delight in the present worldly life more than in the Hereafter? The enjoyment of this worldly life is a small thing compared to the Hereafter._

[Quran 19-66, 67](/en/book/Islam/Quran/19#v66) _And (in spite of this, that unbeliever) human says: “Will I be resurrected after I have died?”_

_Does that human being not take into account that we created him before, when he was nothing?_

[Quran 22:7](/en/book/Islam/Quran/22#v7) _And the Last Hour will surely come, there is no doubt about it. And God will surely resurrect all those who are in the graves._

[UB 189:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p3_2) _The circuit of the archangels then operated for the first time from Urantia. Gabriel and the archangel hosts moved to the place of the spiritual polarity of the planet; and when Gabriel gave the signal, there flashed to the first of the system mansion worlds the voice of Gabriel, saying: “By the mandate of Michael, let the dead of a Urantia dispensation rise!” Then all the survivors of the human races of Urantia who had fallen asleep since the days of Adam, and who had not already gone on to judgment, appeared in the resurrection halls of mansonia in readiness for morontia investiture. And in an instant of time the seraphim and their associates made ready to depart for the mansion worlds. Ordinarily these seraphic guardians, onetime assigned to the group custody of these surviving mortals, would have been present at the moment of their awaking in the resurrection halls of mansonia, but they were on this world itself at this time because of the necessity of Gabriel’s presence here in connection with the morontia resurrection of Jesus._

[Quran 87-16,17](/en/book/Islam/Quran/87#v16) _But you (O mankind) are willing to prefer the life of this world;_

_While the life of the Hereafter is better and longer lasting._

[UB 195:9.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_7) _Selfish men and women simply will not pay such a price for even the greatest spiritual treasure ever offered mortal man. Only when man has become sufficiently disillusioned by the sorrowful disappointments attendant upon the foolish and deceptive pursuits of selfishness, and subsequent to the discovery of the barrenness of formalized religion, will he be disposed to turn wholeheartedly to the gospel of the kingdom, the religion of Jesus of Nazareth._

[Quran 29-64](/en/book/Islam/Quran/29#v64) _The present, worldly life is but fun and play, but the abode of the Hereafter is truly alive. If only they knew._

[Quran 30-25](/en/book/Islam/Quran/30#v25) _And among His signs is that the heavens and the earth are held firm (subsisting) by His Command. Finally, when He calls you from the earth (with a single special call), then (immediately) you will come out._

[Quran 50-42](/en/book/Islam/Quran/50#v42) _The Day when you will hear the blast (as a predetermined decree of God that must happen). That is the Day of Arrival (when the dead will be raised from the graves)._

## PARABLES OF THE TALENTS

[Quran 3-25](/en/book/Islam/Quran/3#v25) _What will be their fate when We have gathered them all for a Day (about Whose coming) there is no doubt, and when every soul will be given back in full whatever it earned (while in this world), and no one will be wronged?_

[Matthew 25-14,30](/en/Bible/Matthew/25#v14) 14 _for the kingdom of heaven is like a man who, going to a far place, called his servants and delivered to them his _goods.

15 _To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his ability; and then he went away._

16 _And he who had received five talents went and traded with them, and made five more talents._

17 _likewise he who had received two, also gained two more._

18 _But he who had received one went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money._

19 _After a long time the lord of those servants came and settled accounts with them._

20 _And he who had received five talents came and brought five other talents, saying, Lord, you delivered to me five talents; behold, I have gained five more talents on top of them._

21 _and his lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord._

22 _The one who had received two talents also came and said, “Lord, you delivered to me two talents; behold, I have gained two more talents on top of them.”_

23 _His master said to him, “Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things; I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.”_

24 _But he who had received the one talent came and said, "Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed._

25 _Therefore I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the ground; behold, what is yours._

26 _His master answered and said to him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed.’_

27 _Therefore, you should have given my money to the bankers, and when I came, I would have received what is mine with interest._

28 _Take the talent from him and give it to him who has ten talents._

29 _For to him who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; and from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away._

30 _and cast the worthless servant into outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth._

[UB 109:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p4_5) _I have observed a Thought Adjuster indwelling a mind on Urantia who has, according to the records on Uversa, indwelt fifteen minds previously in Orvonton. We do not know whether this Monitor has had similar experiences in other superuniverses, but I suspect so. This is a marvelous Adjuster and one of the most useful and potent forces on Urantia during this present age. What others have lost, in that they refused to survive, this human being (and your whole world) now gains. From him who has not survival qualities, shall be taken away even that experienced Adjuster which he now has, while to him who has survival prospects, shall be given even the pre-experienced Adjuster of a slothful deserter._

[UB 176:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p3_4) _“As individuals, and as a generation of believers, hear me while I speak a parable: There was a certain great man who, before starting out on a long journey to another country, called all his trusted servants before him and delivered into their hands all his goods. To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one. And so on down through the entire group of honored stewards, to each he intrusted his goods according to their several abilities; and then he set out on his journey. When their lord had departed, his servants set themselves at work to gain profits from the wealth intrusted to them. Immediately he who had received five talents began to trade with them and very soon had made a profit of another five talents. In like manner he who had received two talents soon had gained two more. And so did all of these servants make gains for their master except him who received but one talent. He went away by himself and dug a hole in the earth where he hid his lord’s money. Presently the lord of those servants unexpectedly returned and called upon his stewards for a reckoning. And when they had all been called before their master, he who had received the five talents came forward with the money which had been intrusted to him and brought five additional talents, saying, ‘Lord, you gave me five talents to invest, and I am glad to present five other talents as my gain.’ And then his lord said to him: ‘Well done, good and faithful servant, you have been faithful over a few things; I will now set you as steward over many; enter forthwith into the joy of your lord.’ And then he who had received the two talents came forward, saying: ‘Lord, you delivered into my hands two talents; behold, I have gained these other two talents.’ And his lord then said to him: ‘Well done, good and faithful steward; you also have been faithful over a few things, and I will now set you over many; enter you into the joy of your lord.’ And then there came to the accounting he who had received the one talent. This servant came forward, saying, ‘Lord, I knew you and realized that you were a shrewd man in that you expected gains where you had not personally labored; therefore was I afraid to risk aught of that which was intrusted to me. I safely hid your talent in the earth; here it is; you now have what belongs to you.’ But his lord answered: ‘You are an indolent and slothful steward. By your own words you confess that you knew I would require of you an accounting with reasonable profit, such as your diligent fellow servants have this day rendered. Knowing this, you ought, therefore, to have at least put my money into the hands of the bankers that on my return I might have received my own with interest.’ And then to the chief steward this lord said: ‘Take away this one talent from this unprofitable servant and give it to him who has the ten talents.’_

[UB 176:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p3_5) _“To every one who has, more shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but from him who has not, even that which he has shall be taken away. You cannot stand still in the affairs of the eternal kingdom. My Father requires all his children to grow in grace and in a knowledge of the truth. You who know these truths must yield the increase of the fruits of the spirit and manifest a growing devotion to the unselfish service of your fellow servants. And remember that, inasmuch as you minister to one of the least of my brethren, you have done this service to me.”_

## THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL

[Quran 5-12](/en/book/Islam/Quran/5#v12) _And indeed, God took a pledge from the Children of Israel and raised up from among them twelve leaders and representatives (one from each tribe to look after their affairs and as spiritual guides). God said: “Surely I am with you if you establish the Prayer according to all its conditions, and pay the Prescribed Alms, and believe in all My Messengers, and honor them, and support them, and grant God a good loan (by spending of your wealth in the Cause of God), then I will certainly erase your evil deeds and admit you to Gardens through which rivers flow. But whoever among you disbelieves after this and is ungrateful has strayed from the straight path.”_

[UB 97:9.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p9_1) _There never were twelve tribes of the Israelites—only three or four tribes settled in Palestine. The Hebrew nation came into being as the result of the union of the so-called Israelites and the Canaanites. “And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites. And they took their daughters to be their wives and gave their daughters to the sons of the Canaanites.” The Hebrews never drove the Canaanites out of Palestine, notwithstanding that the priests’ record of these things unhesitatingly declared that they did._

## THE TEN COMMANDMENTS

[Quran 7-145](/en/book/Islam/Quran/7#v145) _(Moses completed the period appointed by his Lord in order to be favored with the Book and to set the affairs of his people in order). And We wrote for him on the Tablets all that was necessary for instruction and guidance (in following the path to God) and for explanation of all matters. And (We said): "Take them firmly and command your people to take firmly the best of them (to fulfill the commandments in the best possible way). Soon I will show you the (final) abode of the transgressors._

[Exodus 20-1, 17](/en/Bible/Exodus/20#v1) 1 _and God spoke all these words, saying:_

2 _I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery._

3 _You shall have no other gods before me._

4 _You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything that is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth._

5 You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me.

6 _and I show mercy to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments._

7 _You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain._

8 _Remember the Sabbath day[a] to keep it holy._

9 _Six days you shall labor, and do all your work;_

10 _But the seventh day is a Sabbath of the Lord your God; in it you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your manservant, nor your maidservant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates._

11 _For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day[c] and hallowed it._

12 _Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long in the land that the Lord your God is giving you._

13 _You shall not kill._

14 _You shall not commit adultery._

15 _You shall not steal._

16 You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

17 You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor's.

[UB 142:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p3_10) _“Again should you have discerned the growth of the understanding of divine law in perfect keeping with these enlarging concepts of divinity. When the children of Israel came out of Egypt in the days before the enlarged revelation of Yahweh, they had ten commandments which served as their law right up to the times when they were encamped before Sinai. And these ten commandments were:_

[UB 142:3.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p3_11) _“1. You shall worship no other god, for the Lord is a jealous God._

[UB 142:3.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p3_12) _“2. You shall not make molten gods.._

[UB 142:3.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p3_13) _“3. You shall not neglect to keep the feast of unleavened bread._

[UB 142:3.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p3_14) _“4. Of all the males of men or cattle, the first-born are mine, says the Lord._

[UB 142:3.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p3_15) _“5. Six days you may work, but on the seventh day you shall rest._

[UB 142:3.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p3_16) _“6. You shall not fail to observe the feast of the first fruits and the feast of the ingathering at the end of the year._

[UB 142:3.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p3_17) _“7. You shall not offer the blood of any sacrifice with leavened bread._

[UB 142:3.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p3_18) _“8. The sacrifice of the feast of the Passover shall not be left until morning._

[UB 142:3.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p3_19) _“9. The first of the first fruits of the ground you shall bring to the house of the Lord your God._

[UB 142:3.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p3_20) _“10. You shall not seethe a kid in its mother’s milk._

## TIMES OF THE UNIVERSE

[Quran 10-5](/en/book/Islam/Quran/10#v5) _He it is Who made the sun a radiant, illuminating light and the moon a reflected light and determined the seasons so that you may know (how to calculate) the number of years and measure (time). God has not created all this without truth (with meaning, with a definite purpose and on solid foundations of truth). He will establish in detail the signs and proofs (of the truth) for people who seek knowledge._

[Quran 22-47](/en/book/Islam/Quran/22#v47) ... but one day with your Lord is like a thousand years of your reckoning.

[Quran 32-5](/en/book/Islam/Quran/32#v5) _He directs the matter from Heaven (Paradise) to Earth; then the matter ascends to Him in a day, which consists of a thousand years according to your reckoning._

[Psalms 90-4](/en/Bible/Psalms/90#v4) _For a thousand years before your eyes_

_They are like yesterday, which passed,_

_And like one of the watches of the night._

[2 Peter 3-8](/en/Bible/2_Peter/3#v8) _But do not forget, dear brothers, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day._

[UB 2:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p2_2) _There is finality of completeness and perfection of repleteness in the mandates of the Father. “Whatsoever God does, it shall be forever; nothing can be added to it nor anything taken from it.” The Universal Father does not repent of his original purposes of wisdom and perfection. His plans are steadfast, his counsel immutable, while his acts are divine and infallible. “A thousand years in his sight are but as yesterday when it is past and as a watch in the night.” The perfection of divinity and the magnitude of eternity are forever beyond the full grasp of the circumscribed mind of mortal man._

[UB 14:1.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p1_14) _On the outskirts of this vast central universe, far out beyond the seventh belt of Havona worlds, there swirl an unbelievable number of enormous dark gravity bodies. These multitudinous dark masses are quite unlike other space bodies in many particulars; even in form they are very different. These dark gravity bodies neither reflect nor absorb light; they are nonreactive to physical-energy light, and they so completely encircle and enshroud Havona as to hide it from the view of even near-by inhabited universes of time and space._

[UB 46:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p1_2) _The standard mile of Jerusem is equivalent to about seven Urantia miles. The standard weight, the “gradant,” is built up through the decimal system from the mature ultimaton and represents almost exactly ten ounces of your weight. The Satania day equals three days of Urantia time, less one hour, four minutes, and fifteen seconds, that being the time of the axial revolution of Jerusem. The system year consists of one hundred Jerusem days. The time of the system is broadcast by the master chronoldeks._

[UB 33:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p6_7) _Chronology is reckoned, computed, and rectified by a special group of beings on Salvington. The standard day of Nebadon is equal to eighteen days and six hours of Urantia time, plus two and one-half minutes. The Nebadon year consists of a segment of the time of universe swing in relation to the Uversa circuit and is equal to one hundred days of standard universe time, about five years of Urantia time._

[UB 33:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p6_8) _Nebadon time, broadcast from Salvington, is the standard for all constellations and systems in this local universe. Each constellation conducts its affairs by Nebadon time, but the systems maintain their own chronology, as do the individual planets._

[UB 33:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p6_9) _The day in Satania, as reckoned on Jerusem, is a little less (1 hour, 4 minutes, 15 seconds) than three days of Urantia time. These times are generally known as Salvington or universe time, and Satania or system time. Standard time is universe time._

## THE CHANNELS OF WEALTH

[Quran 16-72](/en/book/Islam/Quran/16#v72) _And God has favored some of you over others in provision. Despite this (it is We Who provide for them), those who have been more favored do not consent to share their provision with those whom their right hands provide so that they may be equal to them in that respect. How then can they deny the grace and generosity of God?_

This verse, although it may seem that Heavenly Father has preferences, is not the case. God the Father has no preferences and does not intervene in human affairs, but He does take note of what we do with what we have and what we do with our fellow human beings.

[Quran 93-8,11](/en/book/Islam/Quran/93#v8) _And He found you in need, and made you self-sufficient?_

_Therefore, do not oppress the orphan;_

_Do not reprimand or throw out the one who asks._

_And as for the favor of your Lord, proclaim it!_

[Quran 108-1](/en/book/Islam/Quran/108#v1) _We have surely bestowed upon you abundant goodness._

[UB 160:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p4_10) _It requires intelligence to secure one’s share of the desirable things of life. It is wholly erroneous to suppose that faithfulness in doing one’s daily work will insure the rewards of wealth. Barring the occasional and accidental acquirement of wealth, the material rewards of the temporal life are found to flow in certain well-organized channels, and only those who have access to these channels may expect to be well rewarded for their temporal efforts. Poverty must ever be the lot of all men who seek for wealth in isolated and individual channels. Wise planning, therefore, becomes the one thing essential to worldly prosperity. Success requires not only devotion to one’s work but also that one should function as a part of some one of the channels of material wealth. If you are unwise, you can bestow a devoted life upon your generation without material reward; if you are an accidental beneficiary of the flow of wealth, you may roll in luxury even though you have done nothing worth while for your fellow men._

[UB 160:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p4_11) _Ability is that which you inherit, while skill is what you acquire. Life is not real to one who cannot do some one thing well, expertly. Skill is one of the real sources of the satisfaction of living. Ability implies the gift of foresight, farseeing vision. Be not deceived by the tempting rewards of dishonest achievement; be willing to toil for the later returns inherent in honest endeavor. The wise man is able to distinguish between means and ends; otherwise, sometimes overplanning for the future defeats its own high purpose. As a pleasure seeker you should aim always to be a producer as well as a consumer._

[UB 160:4.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p4_12) _Train your memory to hold in sacred trust the strength-giving and worth-while episodes of life, which you can recall at will for your pleasure and edification. Thus build up for yourself and in yourself reserve galleries of beauty, goodness, and artistic grandeur. But the noblest of all memories are the treasured recollections of the great moments of a superb friendship. And all of these memory treasures radiate their most precious and exalting influences under the releasing touch of spiritual worship._

[UB 160:4.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p4_13) _But life will become a burden of existence unless you learn how to fail gracefully. There is an art in defeat which noble souls always acquire; you must know how to lose cheerfully; you must be fearless of disappointment. Never hesitate to admit failure. Make no attempt to hide failure under deceptive smiles and beaming optimism. It sounds well always to claim success, but the end results are appalling. Such a technique leads directly to the creation of a world of unreality and to the inevitable crash of ultimate disillusionment._

[UB 160:4.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p4_14) _Success may generate courage and promote confidence, but wisdom comes only from the experiences of adjustment to the results of one’s failures. Men who prefer optimistic illusions to reality can never become wise. Only those who face facts and adjust them to ideals can achieve wisdom. Wisdom embraces both the fact and the ideal and therefore saves its devotees from both of those barren extremes of philosophy—the man whose idealism excludes facts and the materialist who is devoid of spiritual outlook. Those timid souls who can only keep up the struggle of life by the aid of continuous false illusions of success are doomed to suffer failure and experience defeat as they ultimately awaken from the dream world of their own imaginations._

[UB 160:4.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p4_15) _And it is in this business of facing failure and adjusting to defeat that the far-reaching vision of religion exerts its supreme influence. Failure is simply an educational episode—a cultural experiment in the acquirement of wisdom—in the experience of the God-seeking man who has embarked on the eternal adventure of the exploration of a universe. To such men defeat is but a new tool for the achievement of higher levels of universe reality._

[UB 160:4.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p4_16) _The career of a God-seeking man may prove to be a great success in the light of eternity, even though the whole temporal-life enterprise may appear as an overwhelming failure, provided each life failure yielded the culture of wisdom and spirit achievement. Do not make the mistake of confusing knowledge, culture, and wisdom. They are related in life, but they represent vastly differing spirit values; wisdom ever dominates knowledge and always glorifies culture._

[UB 165:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p4_10) _To another standing near by who asked Jesus how the wealthy would stand in the day of judgment, he replied: “I have come to judge neither the rich nor the poor, but the lives men live will sit in judgment on all. Whatever else may concern the wealthy in the judgment, at least three questions must be answered by all who acquire great wealth, and these questions are:_

[UB 165:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p4_11) _“1. How much wealth did you accumulate?_

[UB 165:4.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p4_12) _“2. How did you get this wealth?_

[UB 165:4.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p4_13) _“3. How did you use your wealth?”_

A quote that really makes us think, regardless of the riches themselves, rather it makes us wonder:

How have we invested what we have in our fellow human beings? Have we been commendable to those who honestly help us with our material success or our financial burdens?

[UB 132:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_1) _A certain rich man, a Roman citizen and a Stoic, became greatly interested in Jesus’ teaching, having been introduced by Angamon. After many intimate conferences this wealthy citizen asked Jesus what he would do with wealth if he had it, and Jesus answered him: “I would bestow material wealth for the enhancement of material life, even as I would minister knowledge, wisdom, and spiritual service for the enrichment of the intellectual life, the ennoblement of the social life, and the advancement of the spiritual life. I would administer material wealth as a wise and effective trustee of the resources of one generation for the benefit and ennoblement of the next and succeeding generations.”_

[UB 132:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_2) _But the rich man was not fully satisfied with Jesus’ answer. He made bold to ask again: “But what do you think a man in my position should do with his wealth? Should I keep it, or should I give it away?” And when Jesus perceived that he really desired to know more of the truth about his loyalty to God and his duty to men, he further answered: “My good friend, I discern that you are a sincere seeker after wisdom and an honest lover of truth; therefore am I minded to lay before you my view of the solution of your problems having to do with the responsibilities of wealth. I do this because you have asked for my counsel, and in giving you this advice, I am not concerned with the wealth of any other rich man; I am offering advice only to you and for your personal guidance. If you honestly desire to regard your wealth as a trust, if you really wish to become a wise and efficient steward of your accumulated wealth, then would I counsel you to make the following analysis of the sources of your riches: Ask yourself, and do your best to find the honest answer, whence came this wealth? And as a help in the study of the sources of your great fortune, I would suggest that you bear in mind the following ten different methods of amassing material wealth:_

[UB 132:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_3) _“1. Inherited wealth—riches derived from parents and other ancestors._

[UB 132:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_4) _“2. Discovered wealth—riches derived from the uncultivated resources of mother earth._

[UB 132:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_5) _“3. Trade wealth—riches obtained as a fair profit in the exchange and barter of material goods._

[UB 132:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_6) _“4. Unfair wealth—riches derived from the unfair exploitation or the enslavement of one’s fellows._

[UB 132:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_7) _“5. Interest wealth—income derived from the fair and just earning possibilities of invested capital._

[UB 132:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_8) _“6. Genius wealth—riches accruing from the rewards of the creative and inventive endowments of the human mind._

[UB 132:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_9) _“7. Accidental wealth—riches derived from the generosity of one’s fellows or taking origin in the circumstances of life._

[UB 132:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_10) _“8. Stolen wealth—riches secured by unfairness, dishonesty, theft, or fraud._

[UB 132:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_11) _“9. Trust funds—wealth lodged in your hands by your fellows for some specific use, now or in the future._

[UB 132:5.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_12) _“10. Earned wealth—riches derived directly from your own personal labor, the fair and just reward of your own daily efforts of mind and body._

[UB 132:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_13) _“And so, my friend, if you would be a faithful and just steward of your large fortune, before God and in service to men, you must approximately divide your wealth into these ten grand divisions, and then proceed to administer each portion in accordance with the wise and honest interpretation of the laws of justice, equity, fairness, and true efficiency; albeit, the God of heaven would not condemn you if sometimes you erred, in doubtful situations, on the side of merciful and unselfish regard for the distress of the suffering victims of the unfortunate circumstances of mortal life. When in honest doubt about the equity and justice of material situations, let your decisions favor those who are in need, favor those who suffer the misfortune of undeserved hardships.”_

[UB 132:5.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_14) _After discussing these matters for several hours and in response to the rich man’s request for further and more detailed instruction, Jesus went on to amplify his advice, in substance saying: “While I offer further suggestions concerning your attitude toward wealth, I would admonish you to receive my counsel as given only to you and for your personal guidance. I speak only for myself and to you as an inquiring friend. I adjure you not to become a dictator as to how other rich men shall regard their wealth. I would advise you:_

[UB 132:5.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_15) _“1. As steward of inherited wealth you should consider its sources. You are under moral obligation to represent the past generation in the honest transmittal of legitimate wealth to succeeding generations after subtracting a fair toll for the benefit of the present generation. But you are not obligated to perpetuate any dishonesty or injustice involved in the unfair accumulation of wealth by your ancestors. Any portion of your inherited wealth which turns out to have been derived through fraud or unfairness, you may disburse in accordance with your convictions of justice, generosity, and restitution. The remainder of your legitimate inherited wealth you may use in equity and transmit in security as the trustee of one generation for another. Wise discrimination and sound judgment should dictate your decisions regarding the bequest of riches to your successors._

[UB 132:5.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_16) _“2. Everyone who enjoys wealth as a result of discovery should remember that one individual can live on earth but a short season and should, therefore, make adequate provision for the sharing of these discoveries in helpful ways by the largest possible number of his fellow men. While the discoverer should not be denied all reward for efforts of discovery, neither should he selfishly presume to lay claim to all of the advantages and blessings to be derived from the uncovering of nature’s hoarded resources._

[UB 132:5.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_17) _“3. As long as men choose to conduct the world’s business by trade and barter, they are entitled to a fair and legitimate profit. Every tradesman deserves wages for his services; the merchant is entitled to his hire. The fairness of trade and the honest treatment accorded one’s fellows in the organized business of the world create many different sorts of profit wealth, and all these sources of wealth must be judged by the highest principles of justice, honesty, and fairness. The honest trader should not hesitate to take the same profit which he would gladly accord his fellow trader in a similar transaction. While this sort of wealth is not identical with individually earned income when business dealings are conducted on a large scale, at the same time, such honestly accumulated wealth endows its possessor with a considerable equity as regards a voice in its subsequent distribution._

[UB 132:5.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_18) _“4. No mortal who knows God and seeks to do the divine will can stoop to engage in the oppressions of wealth. No noble man will strive to accumulate riches and amass wealth-power by the enslavement or unfair exploitation of his brothers in the flesh. Riches are a moral curse and a spiritual stigma when they are derived from the sweat of oppressed mortal man. All such wealth should be restored to those who have thus been robbed or to their children and their children’s children. An enduring civilization cannot be built upon the practice of defrauding the laborer of his hire._

[UB 132:5.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_19) _“5. Honest wealth is entitled to interest. As long as men borrow and lend, that which is fair interest may be collected provided the capital lent was legitimate wealth. First cleanse your capital before you lay claim to the interest. Do not become so small and grasping that you would stoop to the practice of usury. Never permit yourself to be so selfish as to employ money-power to gain unfair advantage over your struggling fellows. Yield not to the temptation to take usury from your brother in financial distress._

[UB 132:5.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_20) _“6. If you chance to secure wealth by flights of genius, if your riches are derived from the rewards of inventive endowment, do not lay claim to an unfair portion of such rewards. The genius owes something to both his ancestors and his progeny; likewise is he under obligation to the race, nation, and circumstances of his inventive discoveries; he should also remember that it was as man among men that he labored and wrought out his inventions. It would be equally unjust to deprive the genius of all his increment of wealth. And it will ever be impossible for men to establish rules and regulations applicable equally to all these problems of the equitable distribution of wealth. You must first recognize man as your brother, and if you honestly desire to do by him as you would have him do by you, the commonplace dictates of justice, honesty, and fairness will guide you in the just and impartial settlement of every recurring problem of economic rewards and social justice._

[UB 132:5.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_21) _“7. Except for the just and legitimate fees earned in administration, no man should lay personal claim to that wealth which time and chance may cause to fall into his hands. Accidental riches should be regarded somewhat in the light of a trust to be expended for the benefit of one’s social or economic group. The possessors of such wealth should be accorded the major voice in the determination of the wise and effective distribution of such unearned resources. Civilized man will not always look upon all that he controls as his personal and private possession._

[UB 132:5.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_22) _“8. If any portion of your fortune has been knowingly derived from fraud; if aught of your wealth has been accumulated by dishonest practices or unfair methods; if your riches are the product of unjust dealings with your fellows, make haste to restore all these ill-gotten gains to the rightful owners. Make full amends and thus cleanse your fortune of all dishonest riches._

[UB 132:5.23](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_23) _“9. The trusteeship of the wealth of one person for the benefit of others is a solemn and sacred responsibility. Do not hazard or jeopardize such a trust. Take for yourself of any trust only that which all honest men would allow._

[UB 132:5.24](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_24) _“10. That part of your fortune which represents the earnings of your own mental and physical efforts—if your work has been done in fairness and equity—is truly your own. No man can gainsay your right to hold and use such wealth as you may see fit provided your exercise of this right does not work harm upon your fellows.”_

[UB 132:5.25](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p5_25) _When Jesus had finished counseling him, this wealthy Roman arose from his couch and, in saying farewell for the night, delivered himself of this promise: “My good friend, I perceive you are a man of great wisdom and goodness, and tomorrow I will begin the administration of all my wealth in accordance with your counsel.”_

## THE TRUTH

[Quran 18-29](/en/book/Islam/Quran/18#v29) _And say: “The truth is from my Lord.” Then whoever believes, let him believe; and whoever disbelieves, let him disbelieve..._

[Quran 19-34](/en/book/Islam/Quran/19#v34) _That was Jesus, the son of Mary, the word of truth about which you have doubted._

[UB 130:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p1_1) _During their stay in Joppa, Jesus met Gadiah, a Philistine interpreter who worked for one Simon a tanner. Gonod’s agents in Mesopotamia had transacted much business with this Simon; so Gonod and his son desired to pay him a visit on their way to Caesarea. While they tarried at Joppa, Jesus and Gadiah became warm friends. This young Philistine was a truth seeker. Jesus was a truth giver; ***<ins>he was the truth for that generation on Urantia.</ins>*** When a great truth seeker and a great truth giver meet, the result is a great and liberating enlightenment born of the experience of new truth._ (bold and underlining added)

Truth is a fact we live by; truth lies everywhere. Every man is the truth when he cultivates it.

In my experience, the truth is not only in books but in every situation we experience.

The truth is like a medicine that we don't want to take, but it is also the best medicinal antidote for our spiritual well-being.

## THE STORY OF JONAH

_And (he also mentions) Zu'n-Nun (Jonah). He turned away in anger (from his people who persistently disbelieved and paid no heed to his warnings) and was certain that We would not restrict (his life) to him. But finally he cried out in the veils of darkness in the belly of the fish, the sea, and in the dark and rainy night): “There is no Deity but You! Glory to You (for You are absolutely above having any fault). Surely I have been of the wrongdoers (who were wronged by themselves).”_

[Quran 37-139,144](/en/book/Islam/Quran/37#v139) _And Jonah was surely one of the messengers,_

_(Remember) when he left as a runaway slave on a fully loaded ship_

_And then he cast lots (with his consent), and he was one of those who lost_

_(They threw him into the sea and) the big fish swallowed him, while he was accused (by his conscience)_

_If he had not been someone, he was someone who always glorified God (declaring to Him that he was absolutely above having defects)_

_He would certainly have remained in her womb (serving as her tomb) until the day when all will be resurrected (from the dead)_ (See [Jonah 1-1,17](/en/Bible/Jonah/1#v1); [Jonah 2-1,10](/en/Bible/Jonah/2#v1))

Throughout human history, God has sent messengers to each generation, each local or national people, to convey his divine message.

[UB 130:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p1_2) _One day after the evening meal Jesus and the young Philistine strolled down by the sea, and Gadiah, not knowing that this “scribe of Damascus” was so well versed in the Hebrew traditions, pointed out to Jesus the ship landing from which it was reputed that Jonah had embarked on his ill-fated voyage to Tarshish. And when he had concluded his remarks, he asked Jesus this question: “But do you suppose the big fish really did swallow Jonah?” Jesus perceived that this young man’s life had been tremendously influenced by this tradition, and that its contemplation had impressed upon him the folly of trying to run away from duty; Jesus therefore said nothing that would suddenly destroy the foundations of Gadiah’s present motivation for practical living. In answering this question, Jesus said: “My friend, we are all Jonahs with lives to live in accordance with the will of God, and at all times when we seek to escape the present duty of living by running away to far-off enticements, we thereby put ourselves in the immediate control of those influences which are not directed by the powers of truth and the forces of righteousness. The flight from duty is the sacrifice of truth. The escape from the service of light and life can only result in those distressing conflicts with the difficult whales of selfishness which lead eventually to darkness and death unless such God-forsaking Jonahs shall turn their hearts, even when in the very depths of despair, to seek after God and his goodness. And when such disheartened souls sincerely seek for God—hunger for truth and thirst for righteousness—there is nothing that can hold them in further captivity. No matter into what great depths they may have fallen, when they seek the light with a whole heart, the spirit of the Lord God of heaven will deliver them from their captivity; the evil circumstances of life will spew them out upon the dry land of fresh opportunities for renewed service and wiser living.”_

[UB 130:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p1_3) _Gadiah was mightily moved by Jesus’ teaching, and they talked long into the night by the seaside, and before they went to their lodgings, they prayed together and for each other. This was the same Gadiah who listened to the later preaching of Peter, became a profound believer in Jesus of Nazareth, and held a memorable argument with Peter one evening at the home of Dorcas. And Gadiah had very much to do with the final decision of Simon, the wealthy leather merchant, to embrace Christianity._

## WORLDLY LIFE

[Quran 28-60](/en/book/Islam/Quran/28#v60) _All that is given to you (of the world) is but for the temporary enjoyment of this present and worldly life and its trappings, but that which God has provided for you (as a reward for your good deeds, which He will give you above your due) is far better and more lasting. Will you not reason and understand?_

[UB 84:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p8_6) _Let man enjoy himself; let the human race find pleasure in a thousand and one ways; let evolutionary mankind explore all forms of legitimate self-gratification, the fruits of the long upward biologic struggle. Man has well earned some of his present-day joys and pleasures. But look you well to the goal of destiny! Pleasures are indeed suicidal if they succeed in destroying property, which has become the institution of self-maintenance; and self-gratifications have indeed cost a fatal price if they bring about the collapse of marriage, the decadence of family life, and the destruction of the home—man’s supreme evolutionary acquirement and civilization’s only hope of survival._

[UB 28:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p6_9) _3. The Import of Time. Time is the one universal endowment of all will creatures; it is the “one talent” intrusted to all intelligent beings. You all have time in which to insure your survival; and time is fatally squandered only when it is buried in neglect, when you fail so to utilize it as to make certain the survival of your soul. Failure to improve one’s time to the fullest extent possible does not impose fatal penalties; it merely retards the pilgrim of time in his journey of ascent. If survival is gained, all other losses can be retrieved._

## RECTITUDE

[Quran 28-80](/en/book/Islam/Quran/28#v80) _...the reward from God for anyone who believes and does righteous deeds is far better. But none except those who are patient (who persevere in adversity, and in obedience to God, as well as in avoiding sins) can attain it._

[UB 16:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p7_6) _Virtue is righteousness—conformity with the cosmos. To name virtues is not to define them, but to live them is to know them. Virtue is not mere knowledge nor yet wisdom but rather the reality of progressive experience in the attainment of ascending levels of cosmic achievement. In the day-by-day life of mortal man, virtue is realized by the consistent choosing of good rather than evil, and such choosing ability is evidence of the possession of a moral nature._

## MELCHISEDEK AND ABRAHAM

[Quran 37-99,109](/en/book/Islam/Quran/37#v99) _And he said: “Now I am going to my Lord (to leave my homeland only for His pleasure, in the full conviction that) He will guide me (to a Land where I will be able to worship Him freely)”_

_(And he prayed) “My Lord, grant me (a gift of a son who will be) one of the righteous.”_

_Therefore, We gave him the good news of a son (who would grow up to be someone) gentle and patient_

_Then, when (his son) grew up beside him to the age of striving (for the necessities of life), he said, “O my dear son! I dreamt that I must offer you as a sacrifice. So think about it and tell me your opinion!” He said (without hesitation), “O my dear father! Do as you have been commanded. You will find me, by the will of God, of those who show firm patience (in obeying God's commands).”_

_Later, when both had submitted to the will of God, and Abraham had laid him on the side of his forehead,_

_(Just at that moment) we said to him: "Oh, Abraham!_

“You have already fulfilled the dream (which proved your loyal obedience to the command; so you do not have to offer your son as a sacrifice). Thus We reward those who dedicate themselves to doing good, as if they contemplate God.”

_Look, indeed, indeed, all this was clear proof_

_And we redeemed him with a sacrifice of enormous value._

_And We left for him among those who will appear later (until the end of time), this remembrance and memory of him and his Messenger._

“Peace be upon Abraham.”

[Genesis 22-1](/en/Bible/Genesis/22#v1) _And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham. And he said, Here am I._

2 _And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of._

3 _And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and hewed wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him._

4 _On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar._

5 Then Abraham said to his servants, “Stay here with the donkey, while I and the lad go over there and worship, and then we will come back to you.”

6 _And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon his son Isaac; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and they went both together._

7 _Then Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, My father. And he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?_

8 _And Abraham said, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering, my son. And they went together._

9 _And when they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood._

10 _And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son._

11 _Then the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here am I._

12 _And he said, Lay not your hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me._

13 _Then Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram caught in a thicket by its horns. So Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son._

14 _And Abraham called the name of that place, Jehovah Will Provide. Therefore it is said this day, In the mountain of Jehovah it will be provided._

15 _And the angel of the Lord called to Abraham from heaven the second time,_

16 _And he said, By myself I have sworn, saith the LORD, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:_

17 _I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars of the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will possess the gates of their enemies._

18 _In your seed all the nations of the earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice._

19 _And Abraham returned to his servants, and they arose and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt in Beersheba._

20 _And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah also hath borne children unto thy brother Nahor:_

21 _Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,_

22 _Quesed, Hazo, Pildas, Jidlaf and Betuel._

23 _And Bethuel was the father of Rebekah. These are the eight sons whom Milcah bore to Abraham's brother Nahor._

24 _And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Teba, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah._

[Hebrews 7-1](/en/Bible/Hebrews/7#v1) _For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him,_

2 _To whom Abraham also gave a tenth of all; whose name is translated first of all, King of Righteousness, and also King of Salem, that is, King of Peace;_

3 _without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest forever._

[UB 93:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p2_1) _It was 1,973 years before the birth of Jesus that Machiventa was bestowed upon the human races of Urantia. His coming was unspectacular; his materialization was not witnessed by human eyes. He was first observed by mortal man on that eventful day when he entered the tent of Amdon, a Chaldean herder of Sumerian extraction. And the proclamation of his mission was embodied in the simple statement which he made to this shepherd, “I am Melchizedek, priest of El Elyon, the Most High, the one and only God.”_

[UB 93:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p0_1) _THE Melchizedeks are widely known as emergency Sons, for they engage in an amazing range of activities on the worlds of a local universe. When any extraordinary problem arises, or when something unusual is to be attempted, it is quite often a Melchizedek who accepts the assignment. The ability of the Melchizedek Sons to function in emergencies and on widely divergent levels of the universe, even on the physical level of personality manifestation, is peculiar to their order. Only the Life Carriers share to any degree this metamorphic range of personality function._

[UB 93:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p0_2) _The Melchizedek order of universe sonship has been exceedingly active on Urantia. A corps of twelve served in conjunction with the Life Carriers. A later corps of twelve became receivers for your world shortly after the Caligastia secession and continued in authority until the time of Adam and Eve. These twelve Melchizedeks returned to Urantia upon the default of Adam and Eve, and they continued thereafter as planetary receivers on down to the day when Jesus of Nazareth, as the Son of Man, became the titular Planetary Prince of Urantia._

## TWO PATHS

[Quran 72-11](/en/book/Islam/Quran/72#v11) _There are among us those who are upright (in conduct and fit to believe) and those who are contrary. We have been sects with ways_

[Genesis 3-15](/en/Bible/Genesis/3#v15) _And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he will bruise your head, and you will bruise his heel._

[UB 151:3.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p3_15) _Before he dismissed the group for the night, Jesus said: “Now will I tell you the last of the parable of the sower. I would test you to know how you will receive this: The kingdom of heaven is also like a man who cast good seed upon the earth; and while he slept by night and went about his business by day, the seed sprang up and grew, and although he knew not how it came about, the plant came to fruit. First there was the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. And then when the grain was ripe, he put forth the sickle, and the harvest was finished. He who has an ear to hear, let him hear.”_

## OPEN SKIES

[Quran 78-19](/en/book/Islam/Quran/78#v19) _And the heavens open (so that the angels descend), and they become doors (so that the world of angels and the world of humanity are united)._

[Matthew 3-16](/en/Bible/Matthew/3#v16) _And Jesus, after he was baptized, went up immediately from the water; and, behold, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him._

## NOAH

[Quran 54-9,15](/en/book/Islam/Quran/54#v9) _Before them the people of Noah denied; they denied Our servant, and they said: “This is a madman!” and they reproached him (with insolence and prevented him from preaching)_

_So I pray to your Lord, saying: “I have been defeated, help me!”_

_So we opened the gates of heaven, with the water pouring out;_

_And We made the Earth pour out springs, so the waters (of heaven and Earth) will combine for (the fulfillment of) a matter already decreed._

_And we carried him on (a construction of) boards and nails._

_Plying (through the water) under Our Gaze as a reward for the one who had been (unjustly) rejected with ingratitude._

_And indeed We left (the Ark) as a sign (of the truth), so is there anyone who remembers and pays attention?_

[Genesis 7-1](/en/Bible/Genesis/7#v1) _Then the Lord said to Noah, “Come into the ark, you and all your household, for you have been righteous before me in this generation.”_

2 _Of every clean animal you shall take seven pairs, a male and its female; and of the animals that are not clean, a pair, a male and its female._

3 _Also of the birds of the heavens, seven pairs, male and female, to keep the species alive on the face of the earth._

4 _For after seven more days I will send rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, and I will destroy every living creature that I have made from the face of the ground._

5 _And Noah did according to all that the Lord commanded him._

6 _Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came upon the earth._

7 _And Noah entered the ark because of the waters of the flood, and his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives with him._

8 _Of clean animals, and of animals that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creeps on the earth,_

9 _Two by two they entered the ark with Noah, male and female, as God had commanded Noah._

10 _And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth._

11 _In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of heaven were opened,_

12 _and there was rain on the earth forty days and forty nights._

13 _On that very day Noah, and Noah's sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with him, entered the ark._

14 _they, and every wild animal according to its kind, and every domestic animal according to its kind, and every creeping thing that creeps on the ground according to its kind, and every bird according to its kind, and every bird of every kind._

15 _So they came into the ark with Noah, two by two of all flesh in which was the breath of life._

16 _And they that came, male and female of all flesh, came, as God had commanded him; and the Lord shut him in._

17 _And the flood was upon the earth forty days: and the waters increased, and lifted up the ark, and it was lifted above the earth._

18 _And the waters rose and increased exceedingly upon the earth; and the ark floated upon the face of the waters._

19 _And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth, and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered._

20 _The waters rose fifteen cubits higher, after the mountains were covered._

21 _And all flesh that moved upon the earth died: birds, cattle, and beasts, and every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth, and every man._

22 _Everything in whose nostrils was the breath of life, everything on the earth, died._

23 _So every living thing that lived on the face of the ground was destroyed, from man and beast, and the creeping things and the birds of the air; and they were blotted out from the earth, and only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ark._

24 _And the waters prevailed upon the earth one hundred and fifty days._

[UB 78:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p7_3) _Almost five thousand years later, as the Hebrew priests in Babylonian captivity sought to trace the Jewish people back to Adam, they found great difficulty in piecing the story together; and it occurred to one of them to abandon the effort, to let the whole world drown in its wickedness at the time of Noah’s flood, and thus to be in a better position to trace Abraham right back to one of the three surviving sons of Noah._

[UB 78:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p7_4) _The traditions of a time when water covered the whole of the earth’s surface are universal. Many races harbor the story of a world-wide flood some time during past ages. The Biblical story of Noah, the ark, and the flood is an invention of the Hebrew priesthood during the Babylonian captivity. There has never been a universal flood since life was established on Urantia. The only time the surface of the earth was completely covered by water was during those Archeozoic ages before the land had begun to appear._

[UB 78:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/78#p7_5) _But Noah really lived; he was a wine maker of Aram, a river settlement near Erech. He kept a written record of the days of the river’s rise from year to year. He brought much ridicule upon himself by going up and down the river valley advocating that all houses be built of wood, boat fashion, and that the family animals be put on board each night as the flood season approached. He would go to the neighboring river settlements every year and warn them that in so many days the floods would come. Finally a year came in which the annual floods were greatly augmented by unusually heavy rainfall so that the sudden rise of the waters wiped out the entire village; only Noah and his immediate family were saved in their houseboat._

## DISCERNMENT

[Quran 6-140](/en/book/Islam/Quran/6#v140) _Surely those are lost who, in their folly and ignorance, kill their children and make unlawful what God has provided for them as sustenance, falsely attributing it to God. Surely they have gone astray, and they have never been able to find the straight path._

This verse of the Quran, despite its severity at the time it was spoken, makes me reflect that this lack of intellectual acuity and spiritual discernment leads to the ruin of one's family and surroundings. Lack of faith and spiritual guidance leads to this loss of spiritual life, the annihilation of the soul.

The revelators in their wisdom guide man to the search for God in his own heart and such discovery guided by living faith leads to such an act of kindness that drives him to better serve his fellow men.

[UB 102:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p3_4) _Religious desire is the hunger quest for divine reality. Religious experience is the realization of the consciousness of having found God. And when a human being does find God, there is experienced within the soul of that being such an indescribable restlessness of triumph in discovery that he is impelled to seek loving service-contact with his less illuminated fellows, not to disclose that he has found God, but rather to allow the overflow of the welling-up of eternal goodness within his own soul to refresh and ennoble his fellows. Real religion leads to increased social service._

## GARDENS OF GOD

[Quran 2-25](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v25). _Give glad tidings to those who believe and do good and righteous deeds: for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with fruits (varied in color, shape, taste, fragrance, and constantly renewed) from thereon they will say: “This is what was provided to us before,” because what is given to them is similar (to what was given to them both in this world, and a little while ago before entering the Gardens, known in their form and color so that they do not find them unattractive through ignorance of them). Also, for them are wives eternally pure, and they will abide therein._

[Quran 3-136](/en/book/Islam/Quran/3#v136) _Such are those who have as their rewards forgiveness from their Lord and Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they dwell. How excellent is the reward for those who always perform good deeds!_

[Quran 3-198](/en/book/Islam/Quran/3#v198) _Considering those who turn away from disobedience to their Lord (Who created them and brought them up, and sustains them, and has sent down to them the best law and order for their lives), and act within the bounds of piety, for them are Gardens through which rivers flow, wherein they dwell: the hospitality of God’s Presence. And what is with God is best for the truly devout and virtuous._

[Quran 4-95](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v95) _There are not equal those who believe (though not all believers should be mobilized in the cause of God) who remain passive without a justifiable cause (and without causing any harm to the cause of God) and those who strive (and fight) in the cause of God with their wealth and their lives. God has exalted in rank those who fight with their wealth and their lives over those who remain passive. To both of them, God has promised the best reward (Paradise), although God has exalted those who strive above those who remain passive with a tremendous reward._

This verse reveals to me the message of the angels of the churches who said in Laodicea in [Revelation 3-14, 16](/en/Bible/Revelation/3#v14):

14 _And the angel of the church in Laodicea writes: These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God:_

15 I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were cold or hot!

16 But because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of my mouth.

Now let us look at who the angels of the churches are: [UB 114:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p6_7) _3. The religious guardians. These are the “angels of the churches,” the earnest contenders for that which is and has been. They endeavor to maintain the ideals of that which has survived for the sake of the safe transit of moral values from one epoch to another. They are the checkmates of the angels of progress, all the while seeking to translate from one generation to another the imperishable values of the old and passing forms into the new and therefore less stabilized patterns of thought and conduct. These angels do contend for spiritual forms, but they are not the source of ultrasectarianism and meaningless controversial divisions of professed religionists. The corps now functioning on Urantia is the fifth thus to serve._

How beautiful it is to look at the influence of angels on human evolution and even more so giving a warning to humanity without looking at their creed.

[Quran 4-122](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v122) _As for those who believe and do good and righteous deeds, We will admit them to Gardens through which rivers flow, therein they will dwell forever. This is the true promise of God. And who is more truthful than God in His Word?_

[Quran 4-124](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v124) _And whoever does righteous deeds, whether male or female, and is a true Believer - these will enter Paradise..._

[Quran 5-85](/en/book/Islam/Quran/5#v85) _So God (decided) that He will reward them for what they said with Gardens through which rivers flow, therein they will dwell. Such is the reward of those who do good, knowing that God is watching them._

[UB 43:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p6_1) _The system capitals are particularly beautified with material and mineral constructions, while the universe headquarters is more reflective of spiritual glory, but the capitals of the constellations are the acme of morontia activities and living embellishments. On the constellation headquarters worlds living embellishment is more generally utilized, and it is this preponderance of life—botanic artistry—that causes these worlds to be called “the gardens of God.”_

[UB 43:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p6_2) _About one half of Edentia is devoted to the exquisite gardens of the Most Highs, and these gardens are among the most entrancing morontia creations of the local universe. This explains why the extraordinarily beautiful places on the inhabited worlds of Norlatiadek are so often called “the garden of Eden.”_

[UB 43:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p6_3) _Centrally located in this magnificent garden is the worship shrine of the Most Highs. The Psalmist must have known something about these things, for he wrote: “Who shall ascend the hill of the Most Highs? Who shall stand in this holy place? He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who has not lifted up his soul to vanity nor sworn deceitfully.” At this shrine the Most Highs, on every tenth day of relaxation, lead all Edentia in the worshipful contemplation of God the Supreme._

[Quran 2-82](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v82) _While those who believe and do good deeds, those are the companions of (Paradise) Gardens, therein they will dwell._

[Quran 4-13](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v13) _These are the limits set by God, Whoever obeys God and His Messenger, God will admit him to Gardens through which rivers flow, therein He will dwell. That is the Supreme Triumph._

[Quran 4-57](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v57) _But those who believe and do good and righteous deeds—they We will admit into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, therein they will dwell forever. Therein will they have spouses, and We will admit them under a shadow of protection._

[Quran 5-119](/en/book/Islam/Quran/5#v119) _God will say: "This is the Day when their sincerity (faithfulness and steadfastness) will benefit all those who were truthful in their words. For them are Gardens through which rivers flow, and they will dwell therein forever. God is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. That is the Supreme triumph._

[Quran 7-42](/en/book/Islam/Quran/7#v42) _But those who believe and do good and righteous deeds - We do not burden anyone with responsibility except to the extent of their ability - they will be the companions of (Paradise) Garden, wherein they will be immortals._

[Quran 7-49](/en/book/Islam/Quran/7#v49) _... “Enter the Garden, you will have nothing to fear nor grieve”_

[Quran 9-21,22](/en/book/Islam/Quran/9#v21) _Their Lord gives them good news of mercy from Him (which brings unexpected blessings) and of His good pleasure towards them and of Gardens of everlasting bounty:_

_There they will dwell forever. Truly, with God there is a tremendous reward._

[Quran 9-72](/en/book/Islam/Quran/9#v72) _God has promised the believers, whether men or women, Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will dwell, and blessed homes in Gardens of everlasting bliss; and better (than that) is that God is pleased with them._

_That is truly the Supreme Triumph._

[Quran 9-89](/en/book/Islam/Quran/9#v89) _God has provided for them Gardens beneath which rivers flow, therein they will dwell. That is the Supreme Achievement._

[Quran 9-100](/en/book/Islam/Quran/9#v100) _The first and foremost of the emigrants and the helpers, and those who followed them in devotion and doing good, knowing that God is looking upon them, God is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. He has provided for them Gardens beneath which rivers flow, therein they will dwell. That is the final triumph._

[Quran 10-9](/en/book/Islam/Quran/10#v9) _Surely, those who believe and do good and righteous deeds, their Lord will guide them by virtue of their belief to a happy end: Rivers will flow beneath them in Gardens of bounty and blessing._

[Quran 11-23](/en/book/Islam/Quran/11#v23) _As for those who believe, and do good and righteous deeds, and humble themselves before their Lord, they are the companions of Paradise; they will dwell therein._

[Quran 11-107, 108](/en/book/Islam/Quran/11#v107) _Therein will they dwell as long as the heavens and the earth remain, except that your Lord is the Sovereign Doer of what He wills._

_And as for the happy ones (having been blessed by God with faith and good deeds) they will be in Paradise, they will dwell there as long as the Heavens and the Earth remain, unless your Lord so wills, as an uninterrupted gift._

[Quran 13-22,23](/en/book/Islam/Quran/13#v22) _And those who endure patiently (in the face of all adversities that are encountered in the cause of God) in the path wherein resides the eternal pleasure of God, and establish prayer according to its conditions..._

_Gardens of perpetual bliss they will enter, along with those righteous among their ancestors, wives, and descendants; and angels will come before them through every gate (saying):_

“Peace be upon you for having endured patiently. How excellent is the final (and eternal) home!”

[Quran 14-23,26](/en/book/Islam/Quran/14#v23) _But those who have believed and done good and righteous deeds, they will be admitted to Gardens beneath which rivers flow, and they will look upon them by the permission of their Lord. Their greeting therein (between themselves and God and the angels) will be: “Peace!”_

_Don't you see how God presents a parable of a good word? (A good word is) like a good tree, its roots firmly planted in the earth and its branches in the sky._

_It bears fruit in every season by the permission of its Lord. God shows parables to human beings so that they may reflect on them and draw the necessary lessons._

_And the parable of a corrupt word is like a rotten tree uprooted from the ground that has no stability._

## THE MOUNT OF ASSEMBLY AND THE CONSTELLATIONS

[Quran 14-15, 16](/en/book/Islam/Quran/14#v15) _(As evidence for a generation open to belief) We have certainly established in the Heaven great Constellations and made it (the heaven) beautiful for those who behold it_

_And we have made it safe from any cursed Satan rejected (from the mercy of God)._

In this verse, we see a meeting in the Constellation where the planetary princes appeared, and Satan, planetary supervisor of our system of inhabited worlds, appeared on behalf of the fallen worlds in rebellion. We see that this fallen Son of light was cast out, and there was no more room for him, and this is corroborated in the revelation of The Urantia Book and in the Bible in the following quotations:

[Job 1-6](/en/Bible/Job/1#v6) _One day the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them._

[UB 43:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p4_1) _The most holy mount of assembly is the dwelling place of the Faithful of Days, the representative of the Paradise Trinity who functions on Edentia._

[UB 43:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p4_2) _This Faithful of Days is a Trinity Son of Paradise and has been present on Edentia as the personal representative of Immanuel since the creation of the headquarters world. Ever the Faithful of Days stands at the right hand of the Constellation Fathers to counsel them, but never does he proffer advice unless it is asked for. The high Sons of Paradise never participate in the conduct of the affairs of a local universe except upon the petition of the acting rulers of such domains. But all that a Union of Days is to a Creator Son, a Faithful of Days is to the Most Highs of a constellation._

[UB 43:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p4_3) _The residence of the Edentia Faithful of Days is the constellation center of the Paradise system of extrauniverse communication and intelligence. These Trinity Sons, with their staffs of Havona and Paradise personalities, in liaison with the supervising Union of Days, are in direct and constant communication with their order throughout all the universes, even to Havona and Paradise._

[UB 43:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p4_4) _The most holy mount is exquisitely beautiful and marvelously appointed, but the actual residence of the Paradise Son is modest in comparison with the central abode of the Most Highs and the surrounding seventy structures comprising the residential unit of the Vorondadek Sons. These appointments are exclusively residential; they are entirely separate from the extensive administrative headquarters buildings wherein the affairs of the constellation are transacted._

[UB 43:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p4_5) _The residence of the Faithful of Days on Edentia is located to the north of these residences of the Most Highs and is known as the “mount of Paradise assembly.” On this consecrated highland the ascending mortals periodically assemble to hear this Son of Paradise tell of the long and intriguing journey of progressing mortals through the one billion perfection worlds of Havona and on to the indescribable delights of Paradise. And it is at these special gatherings on Mount Assembly that the morontia mortals become more fully acquainted with the various groups of personalities of origin in the central universe._

[UB 43:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p4_6) _The traitorous Lucifer, onetime sovereign of Satania, in announcing his claims to increased jurisdiction, sought to displace all superior orders of sonship in the governmental plan of the local universe. He purposed in his heart, saying: “I will exalt my throne above the Sons of God; I will sit upon the mount of assembly in the north; I will be like the Most High.”_

[UB 43:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p4_7) _The one hundred System Sovereigns come periodically to the Edentia conclaves which deliberate on the welfare of the constellation. After the Satania rebellion the archrebels of Jerusem were wont to come up to these Edentia councils just as they had on former occasions. And there was found no way to stop this arrogant effrontery until after the bestowal of Michael on Urantia and his subsequent assumption of unlimited sovereignty throughout all Nebadon. Never, since that day, have these instigators of sin been permitted to sit in the Edentia councils of the loyal System Sovereigns._

[UB 43:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p4_8) _That the teachers of olden times knew of these things is shown by the record: “And there was a day when the Sons of God came to present themselves before the Most Highs, and Satan came also and presented himself among them.” And this is a statement of fact regardless of the connection in which it chances to appear._

[UB 43:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p4_9) _Since the triumph of Christ, all Norlatiadek is being cleansed of sin and rebels. Sometime before Michael’s death in the flesh the fallen Lucifer’s associate, Satan, sought to attend such an Edentia conclave, but the solidification of sentiment against the archrebels had reached the point where the doors of sympathy were so well-nigh universally closed that there could be found no standing ground for the Satania adversaries. When there exists no open door for the reception of evil, there exists no opportunity for the entertainment of sin. The doors of the hearts of all Edentia closed against Satan; he was unanimously rejected by the assembled System Sovereigns, and it was at this time that the Son of Man “beheld Satan fall as lightning from heaven.”_

[UB 43:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p4_10) _Since the Lucifer rebellion a new structure has been provided near the residence of the Faithful of Days. This temporary edifice is the headquarters of the Most High liaison, who functions in close touch with the Paradise Son as adviser to the constellation government in all matters respecting the policy and attitude of the order of Days toward sin and rebellion._

[Quran 15-45, 46](/en/book/Islam/Quran/15#v45) _The pious devotees are, without a doubt, in Gardens and springs._

_(and it will be said to them): “Enter them in peace and in perfect safety!”_

[Quran 16-31](/en/book/Islam/Quran/16#v31) _Gardens of everlasting bliss are theirs, beneath which rivers flow. Therein they will have whatever they desire; thus God rewards the pious._

Those whose souls the angels take while they are in a state of piety (free from evil and worshipping only God), saying: “Peace be upon you! Enter Paradise for what you have been doing!”

[Quran 18-31](/en/book/Islam/Quran/18#v31) _Those are they for whom are Gardens of Eternal Bliss, beneath which rivers flow; where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold, and dressed in green garments of pure silk and rich brocade, reclining on thrones. How excellent a reward is that, and how beautiful a bed to rest on!_

[Quran 19-61,63](/en/book/Islam/Quran/19#v61) _Gardens of everlasting bliss which the Merciful has promised to His Servants unseen (beyond the perception and knowledge of the servants). His promise will surely be fulfilled._

_Where you will not hear idle talk, but only peace (contentment and security). And there you will have your sustenance morning and evening._

_That is the paradise which We shall give to those of Our pious and devoted servants (as theirs eternally)._

[Quran 20-75, 76](/en/book/Islam/Quran/20#v75) _Whereas whoever comes before Him as a believer who has done good and righteous deeds, for him will be high ranks and exalted stations._

_Gardens of eternal bliss through which rivers flow where they will dwell. That is the reward of the one who attains purity._

[Quran 22-23, 24](/en/book/Islam/Quran/22#v23) _God will admit those who believe and do good and righteous deeds into Gardens through which rivers flow, adorned there with bracelets of gold and pearls, there their garments will be of silk_

_They have been guided to believe and declare the purest of words; and they have been guided to the Praiseworthy path_

[Quran 22-56](/en/book/Islam/Quran/22#v56) _On that Day, absolute authority belongs exclusively to God. He judges (all people and distinguishes) among them. Therefore, those who believe and do good and righteous deeds will be in Gardens of goodness and blessing._

[Quran 25-10](/en/book/Islam/Quran/25#v10) _Blessed and Supreme is He Who, if He wills, can grant you (O Messenger) better than all that (they propose) - Gardens through which rivers flow - and grant you palaces._

[Quran 25-15, 16](/en/book/Islam/Quran/25#v15) _Say (O Messenger): << Is this better to prefer or the Garden of Eternal Life, which is promised to the pious devotees? >>. This will be their reward and their final destination._

_For them, there will be everything they desire, they will dwell there. This is a promise that your Lord will surely fulfill._

[Quran 25-61, 63](/en/book/Islam/Quran/25#v61) _Blessed and Supreme is He Who has established in the Heaven great constellations, and placed in it a lamp (sun) and a shining moon._

_It is He Who has appointed the night and the day to succeed one another, providing a sign for one who wishes to reflect and therefore be considerate, or wishes to be grateful._

_The true servants of the Merciful are those who move on Earth with delicacy and humility and when the ignorant and imprudent address them (with insolence and vulgarity, as befits their ignorance and folly), they respond with (a word of) peace (without establishing hostility with them)._

[Quran 29-57, 58](/en/book/Islam/Quran/29#v57) _Every soul will surely taste death, and then you will be returned to Us_

_Those who believe and perform good and righteous deeds, We will surely lodge them in noble and lofty mansions in Paradise through which the rivers flow, where they will reside. How excellent is the reward for those who always perform good deeds!_

[Quran 31-8, 9](/en/book/Islam/Quran/31#v8) _... Those who believe and do good and righteous deeds, for them are Gardens of bounty and blessing._

_In which they will dwell. This is a promise from God indeed. He is the Glorious One, possessed of irresistible power, the All-Wise._

[Quran 35-33, 35](/en/book/Islam/Quran/35#v33) _They will enter Gardens of Eternal Bliss, therein adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their clothing therein will be of silk._

_And they will say: "All praise and greatness are for God, Who has removed the punishment for us. Surely our Lord is Forgiving, He Who reciprocates._

_Who by his grace has accommodated us in the abode of eternal residence, where no labor touches us, and where no fatigue afflicts us»_

[Quran 37-40, 49](/en/book/Islam/Quran/37#v40) _But the sincere servants of God, endowed with sincerity in faith and practicing the religion (of the spirit)._

_For those there is given (in paradise) a specially prepared provision:_

_Fruits and they will be honored_

_In the Gardens of Generosity and Blessing_

_Sitting on thrones, face to face._

_A cup will be passed between them with a drink from a spring that flows pure:_

_Clear and delicious to those who drink it,_

_Free from any intoxicating effects or harm; and they will not suffer intoxication from it._

_And with them will be pure spouses with modest eyes, with very beautiful eyes_

_Like hidden pearls._

[Quran 38 - 50, 51](/en/book/Islam/Quran/38#v50) : _Gardens of eternal bliss whose gates are wide open to them,_

_On which they will recline (on the thrones) asking there for many fruits and drinks._

[Quran 39-73,75](/en/book/Islam/Quran/39#v73) : _Those who turn away from disobedience to their Lord in worship of Him and piety will be led in groups to the Gardens (Paradise). When they arrive there, its gates will be opened (by the grace of God), and its guardians will welcome them, saying: “Peace be upon you! Good for you and you are purified (from the evil residue of sin, and freed from all suffering), so enter (Paradise) to dwell!”_

_And they say: “All praise and thanksgiving are due to God, Who has fulfilled His promises to us, and made us heirs of this Land (of bliss), so that we may dwell in Paradise as we please!” Then how excellent is the reward of the doers (of good deeds in obedience and devotion to God)!_

_And you (O Messenger) will behold the angels surrounding the Supreme Kingdom (of God), glorifying their Lord with their Praise. Judgment has been passed between them with truth and justice, and it will be said (by all the people [personalities] of Paradise): “All praise and thanksgiving are due to God, the Lord of the worlds!”_

[UB 27:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p7_1) _Worship is the highest privilege and the first duty of all created intelligences. Worship is the conscious and joyous act of recognizing and acknowledging the truth and fact of the intimate and personal relationships of the Creators with their creatures. The quality of worship is determined by the depth of creature perception; and as the knowledge of the infinite character of the Gods progresses, the act of worship becomes increasingly all-encompassing until it eventually attains the glory of the highest experiential delight and the most exquisite pleasure known to created beings._

[UB 27:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p7_2) _While the Isle of Paradise contains certain places of worship, it is more nearly one vast sanctuary of divine service. Worship is the first and dominant passion of all who climb to its blissful shores—the spontaneous ebullition of the beings who have learned enough of God to attain his presence. Circle by circle, during the inward journey through Havona, worship is a growing passion until on Paradise it becomes necessary to direct and otherwise control its expression._

[UB 27:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p7_3) _The periodic, spontaneous, group, and other special outbursts of supreme adoration and spiritual praise enjoyed on Paradise are conducted under the leadership of a special corps of primary supernaphim. Under the direction of these conductors of worship, such homage achieves the creature goal of supreme pleasure and attains the heights of the perfection of sublime self-expression and personal enjoyment. All primary supernaphim crave to be conductors of worship; and all ascendant beings would enjoy forever remaining in the attitude of worship did not the chiefs of assignment periodically disperse these assemblages. But no ascendant being is ever required to enter upon the assignments of eternal service until he has attained full satisfaction in worship._

[UB 27:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p7_4) _It is the task of the conductors of worship so to teach the ascendant creatures how to worship that they may be enabled to gain this satisfaction of self-expression and at the same time be able to give attention to the essential activities of the Paradise regime. Without improvement in the technique of worship it would require hundreds of years for the average mortal who reaches Paradise to give full and satisfactory expression to his emotions of intelligent appreciation and ascendant gratitude. The conductors of worship open up new and hitherto unknown avenues of expression so that these wonderful children of the womb of space and the travail of time are enabled to gain the full satisfactions of worship in much less time._

[UB 27:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p7_5) _All the arts of all the beings of the entire universe which are capable of intensifying and exalting the abilities of self-expression and the conveyance of appreciation, are employed to their highest capacity in the worship of the Paradise Deities. Worship is the highest joy of Paradise existence; it is the refreshing play of Paradise. What play does for your jaded minds on earth, worship will do for your perfected souls on Paradise. The mode of worship on Paradise is utterly beyond mortal comprehension, but the spirit of it you can begin to appreciate even down here on Urantia, for the spirits of the Gods even now indwell you, hover over you, and inspire you to true worship._

[UB 27:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p7_6) _There are appointed times and places for worship on Paradise, but these are not adequate to accommodate the ever-increasing overflow of the spiritual emotions of the growing intelligence and expanding divinity recognition of the brilliant beings of experiential ascension to the eternal Isle. Never since the times of Grandfanda have the supernaphim been able fully to accommodate the spirit of worship on Paradise. Always is there an excess of worshipfulness as gauged by the preparation therefor. And this is because personalities of inherent perfection never can fully appreciate the tremendous reactions of the spiritual emotions of beings who have slowly and laboriously made their way upward to Paradise glory from the depths of the spiritual darkness of the lower worlds of time and space. When such angels and mortals of time attain the presence of the Powers of Paradise, there occurs the expression of the accumulated emotions of the ages, a spectacle astounding to the angels of Paradise and productive of the supreme joy of divine satisfaction in the Paradise Deities._

[UB 27:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p7_7) _Sometimes all Paradise becomes engulfed in a dominating tide of spiritual and worshipful expression. Often the conductors of worship cannot control such phenomena until the appearance of the threefold fluctuation of the light of the Deity abode, signifying that the divine heart of the Gods has been fully and completely satisfied by the sincere worship of the residents of Paradise, the perfect citizens of glory and the ascendant creatures of time. What a triumph of technique! What a fruition of the eternal plan and purpose of the Gods that the intelligent love of the creature child should give full satisfaction to the infinite love of the Creator Father!_

[UB 27:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p7_8) _After the attainment of the supreme satisfaction of the fullness of worship, you are qualified for admission to the Corps of the Finality. The ascendant career is well-nigh finished, and the seventh jubilee prepares for celebration. The first jubilee marked the mortal agreement with the Thought Adjuster when the purpose to survive was sealed; the second was the awakening in the morontia life; the third was the fusion with the Thought Adjuster; the fourth was the awakening in Havona; the fifth celebrated the finding of the Universal Father; and the sixth jubilee was the occasion of the Paradise awakening from the final transit slumber of time. The seventh jubilee marks entrance into the mortal finaliter corps and the beginning of the eternity service. The attainment of the seventh stage of spirit realization by a finaliter will probably signalize the celebration of the first of the jubilees of eternity._

How beautiful it is to know that the Father's heart is satisfied with us! The key is sincerity with Him.

[Quran 43-71-73](/en/book/Islam/Quran/43#v71) _Golden trays and cups will be passed between them; and there will be given whatever souls desire, and what the eyes delight in: "And there you will dwell_

_This is the Garden which is your inheritance, in exchange for what you used to do (in the world)_

_There will be given to you fruit (of all kinds) in abundance to eat there._

[Quran 47-5, 7](/en/book/Islam/Quran/47#v5): _(Moreover,) He will guide them (to the attainment of their goal in both worlds) and improve their conditions_

_And He will admit them into Gardens that will be made known to them fully._

_O you who believe! If you help God (in His cause, by striving in it), He will help you and make your feet firm (so that you may be firm in His cause and ultimately victorious)._

[Quran 47-12](/en/book/Islam/Quran/47#v12) _God will admit those who believe and do good and righteous deeds into Gardens, through which rivers flow...._

[Quran 47-15](/en/book/Islam/Quran/47#v15) _An analogy of the Garden (Paradise) that is promised to those pious devotees is this: In it are given rivers of water that is incorruptible (in taste, color, and smell); and rivers of milk whose taste never changes; and rivers of delicious wine for those who delight in drinking it; and rivers of honey that is clear and pure. And in it are also fruits of every kind for them, as well as forgiveness from your Lord (which will bring unexpected blessings) ..._

[Exodus 3-17](/en/Bible/Exodus/3#v17): _and I have said (God): I will bring you up from the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey._

That promised land that both the Bible and the Koran speak of is a reflection or an analogy of the celestial world where rivers of milk and honey flow.

Milk represents knowledge; there is nothing fresher for the soul than knowledge, and there is nothing sweeter than honey than the wisdom of God. The universe is a great source of wisdom and knowledge for all its inhabitants, mortals, morontia, angels, and celestial beings.

[Quran 48-5](/en/book/Islam/Quran/48#v5): _And that He admits the believing men and women into Gardens through which rivers flow, therein to dwell; and that He blots out their evil deeds. This is a supreme triumph with God._

[Quran 48-17](/en/book/Islam/Quran/48#v17): _Whoever obeys God and His Messenger (in the religious duties with which he is entrusted and able to perform), God will admit him to Gardens through which rivers flow._

[Quran 51-22, 23](/en/book/Islam/Quran/51#v22): _And in the Heavens is your provision and what was promised to you._

_Then, by the Lord of the Heavens and the Earth, this (promise) is (a reality conveyed to you) just as (it is a truth that) you speak._

[Quran 57-21](/en/book/Islam/Quran/57#v21): _And (instead of vying for the things of this world) vie with one another for forgiveness from your Lord, and for a Garden whose immensity is like the immensity of the heavens and the earth, prepared for those who truly believe in God and His Messengers. That is the bounty of God, which He grants to whomever He wills. God is of great bounty._

[Quran 59-22](/en/book/Islam/Quran/59#v22): _You will never find a person who truly believes in God and the Last Day who loves those who oppose God and His Messenger, even if they are his (own parents), children, brothers (and sisters), and his clan. Those (are) the ones in whose hearts God has inscribed faith and strengthened them with a spirit from Himself (which is the source of their spiritual vigor and intellectual illumination). And He will admit them to Gardens through which rivers flow, therein they will dwell. God is pleased with them, and they are the party of God. Let you know that the party of God is those who are prosperous._

[Quran 61-11,12](/en/book/Islam/Quran/61#v11): _That you may believe in God and His Messenger, and strive in the cause of God with your wealth and persons, if only you knew._

_So that He may forgive you and admit you into the Gardens through which rivers flow, and into the precious abodes in the Gardens of perpetual bliss. That is the Supreme triumph._

[Quran 64-9](/en/book/Islam/Quran/64#v9): _The Day He gathers you all together for the Day of Gathering, that will be the Day of loss (for the disbelievers) and gain (for the believers). Whoever believes in God and does good and righteous deeds, He will erase from them their evil deeds (that they may commit), and admit them to Gardens through which rivers flow, to abide therein forever. That is the Supreme Triumph._

[Quran 65-11](/en/book/Islam/Quran/65#v11): _A Messenger reciting to you the signs and revelations of God that make the truth clear and illuminate your path, so that he may lead you out of every form of darkness into the light, and keep you therein. Whoever believes (truly and sincerely) in God and does good and righteous deeds will admit them to Gardens through which rivers flow, therein they will dwell forever. Indeed, God has granted them an excellent provision (such as faith and good deeds in this world, in Paradise, and in the Hereafter)._

[Quran 76-5,6](/en/book/Islam/Quran/76#v5): _The virtuous and the devout will certainly drink from a cup of heavenly wine seasoned with heavenly additives._

_A source from which the servants (virtuous and devoted) of God will drink, causing it to gush forth abundantly._

[Quran 85-1,3](/en/book/Islam/Quran/85#v1): _By the sky with its constellations_

_And for the Promised Day,_

_By him who testifies and that which is witnessed._

[Quran 85-11](/en/book/Islam/Quran/85#v11): _But those who believe and do good and righteous deeds, they are given Gardens through which rivers flow. That is the great triumph._

[Quran 87-1,4](/en/book/Islam/Quran/87#v1): _Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High_

_Who creates and forms with due proportions_

_And Who determines (a life, a nature and a particular goal for each creature), and guides (it toward the fulfillment of that goal);_

_Who makes vegetation sprout._

[Quran 88-8,11](/en/book/Islam/Quran/88#v8): _And some faces on that Day will be delighted,_

Pleased with (the fruit of) their effort (in the world)

_In a high Garden,_

_Where they will not hear idle talk._

[Quran 89-27,30](/en/book/Islam/Quran/89#v27): _«O you soul that is at rest_

_Return to your Lord, pleased and worthy of his pleasure_

_Enter, then, among My Servants_

_And enter My Paradise (The Garden)_

_This verse reveals to me the body of the finalists of Paradise._

[UB 31:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p3_1) _Ascendant Adjuster-fused mortals compose the bulk of the primary Corps of the Finality. Together with the adopted and glorified seraphim they usually constitute 990 in each finaliter company. The proportion of mortals and angels in any one group varies, though the mortals far outnumber the seraphim. The Havona natives, glorified Material Sons, glorified midway creatures, the Gravity Messengers, and the unknown and missing member make up only one per cent of the corps; each company of one thousand finaliters has places for just ten of these nonmortal and nonseraphic personalities._

[Quran 92-20,21](/en/book/Islam/Quran/92#v20): _And only desiring the pleasure of his Lord, the Most High._

_He will surely be pleased (he with his Lord and his Lord with him)._

[Quran 98-7,8](/en/book/Islam/Quran/98#v7): _And those who believe and do good and righteous deeds, they are the best of creatures._

_Their reward is with their Lord: Gardens of everlasting bliss beneath which rivers flow, they will dwell there forever. God is pleased with them, and they with Him. That is for him who stands in awe of his Lord._

## WORSHIP AND PRAYER

[Quran 2-21,22](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v21) _Now, O mankind! Worship your Lord Who created you, and those before you, that perhaps you may acquire reverent piety for Him and His Protection;_

_And He Who has made the earth a comfortable bed for you and the sky a blanket. He sends down water from the sky and brings forth fruits as a provision for you. So do not attribute rivals to God once you know._

[Quran 2-129](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v129) _“Our Lord! Send forth for this community a Messenger from among themselves, who will recite to them Your Revelation and instruct them in the Book (which You will reveal to them) and Wisdom, and purify them (from false beliefs and doctrines, from sins and from all impurities). Indeed, You are the Glorious, the All-Glorious, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”_

[Quran 2-225](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v225) _God does not take into account a slip in your oaths, but He does take into account what your hearts have acquired (through intention). And God is Forgiving and Merciful._

These verses demonstrate the spiritual intent of communing or speaking with God. But prayers are more than just words or reciting prayerful words:

[UB 91:8.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p8_12) _Words are irrelevant to prayer; they are merely the intellectual channel in which the river of spiritual supplication may chance to flow. The word value of a prayer is purely autosuggestive in private devotions and sociosuggestive in group devotions. God answers the soul’s attitude, not the words._

[UB 91:8.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p8_13) _Prayer is not a technique of escape from conflict but rather a stimulus to growth in the very face of conflict. Pray only for values, not things; for growth, not for gratification._

[Quran 2-286](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v286) _God burdens no soul except to the extent of its ability; to it is found what it has earned, and against it what it deserves. Therefore, pray to your Lord: “Our Lord, do not hold us accountable if we forget or if we commit errors. Our Lord, do not burden us like those before us.”_

“Our Lord, do not impose upon us what we are unable to bear. And overlook our sins, forgive us, and have mercy on us. You are Guardian and Teacher (the One to whom we entrust our affairs and in whom we trust), so help us and grant us victory over the unbelievers.”

[Quran 2-128](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v128) _Our Lord! Make us subject to You and make our offspring a community subject to You._

This verse refers to that new community of believers who will bring about change in the world, and the revelators emphasize this with their words:

[UB 99:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p5_7) _... Someday religionists will get together and actually effect co-operation on the basis of unity of ideals and purposes rather than attempting to do so on the basis of psychological opinions and theological beliefs. Goals rather than creeds should unify religionists..._

[Quran 2-225](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v225) _God does not take into account a slip in your oaths, but He does take into account what your hearts have acquired (through intention) and God is Merciful and Compassionate._

[UB 91:8.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p8_12) _Words are irrelevant to prayer; they are merely the intellectual channel in which the river of spiritual supplication may chance to flow. The word value of a prayer is purely autosuggestive in private devotions and sociosuggestive in group devotions. God answers the soul’s attitude, not the words._

[Quran 2-286](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v286) _God does not burden a soul except to the extent of its ability: to its credit is what it has earned, and against it what it deserves. Therefore, pray to your Lord: “Our Lord, do not hold us accountable if we forget or commit errors. Our Lord, do not burden us like those before us. Our Lord, do not burden us with what we are not able to bear. And overlook our sins, forgive us, and have mercy on us. You are our Guardian and Master (the One to whom we entrust our affairs and in Whom we trust), so help us and grant us victory over disbelief!”_

[Quran 3-147](/en/book/Islam/Quran/3#v147) _What they said was: “Our Lord! Forgive us our sins and any sin we have committed in our duties, and grant us firmness and help us overcome disbelief!”_

[Quran 3-193](/en/book/Islam/Quran/3#v193) _Our Lord! We have certainly heard a call to faith, saying, “Believe in your Lord,” and we have believed. Our Lord, forgive us, pardon our sins, blot out our evil deeds, and take us to You in death with the truly devout and righteous._

[Quran 5-89](/en/book/Islam/Quran/5#v89) _God does not take into account a slip (or a verbal error) in your oaths, but He does take into account what you have finished by solemn and determined oaths. The expiation (for breaking such oaths) is to feed ten poor people (or one person for ten days) according to the average food with which you feed your families, clothe them, or free a slave. Whoever does not find (the means to do this) must fast for three days. That is the expiation for the oaths you swear (and break). But be careful of your oaths (do not make them lightly, and when you swear, fulfill them). Thus God explains to you His Revelations (the lights of His path) so that you may be thankful (in your heart, in word and in deed, fulfilling His commandments)._

[Quran 7-29](/en/book/Islam/Quran/7#v29) _Say: “My Lord commands what is right and justice.” Turn your faces (your whole being) towards Him whenever you stand up for prayer, and call upon Him with sincere faith in Him and practicing Religion for Him alone. As He brought you into existence, so will you return to Him._

[Quran 8-35](/en/book/Islam/Quran/8#v35) _(1002-4) Their prayers in the House (in the Sacred Mosque) are nothing but whistling and clapping. So taste the punishment for persistent disbelief!_

## WORSHIP

[Quran 8-39](/en/book/Islam/Quran/8#v39) _And (if they still persist in disbelief and hostility) then fight them until there is no more disorder and oppression rooted in rebellion against God, and the whole religion (the full authority to order the way of life is recognized as) is God's alone. If they cease (persisting in disbelief and continuing with hostility towards the believers), verily, God surely sees whatever they do._

[Quran 9:31-33](/en/book/Islam/Quran/9#v31) _The Jews have adopted their rabbis (teachers of the law) and the Christians have adopted their monks, and the Messiah, son of Mary, as lords in place of God (making lawful or unlawful what their teachers of the law and monks have decreed as lawful or unlawful contrary to God’s commandments), while they were commanded to worship One God. There is no deity but He. Glorified be He Who is absolutely above the partners who attribute to Him._

32 _They strive (with renewed plans and schemes) to extinguish the light of God (His favor, which is Islam, as if they were blowing) with their mouths. However, God refuses anything less than the completion of His light, no matter how odious it may be to the criminal disbelievers._

33 _He it is Who sent His Messenger with guidance and the Religion of truth to make it prevail over all other religions, no matter how hateful it may be to those who attribute partners to God._

[Quran 9:103-104](/en/book/Islam/Quran/9#v103) _Take from them alms (prescribed or voluntary) from their wealth that you (O Messenger) may purify them and increase them in purity and sincerity, and pray for them. Indeed, your prayers are a source of comfort to them. God is All-Hearing and All-Knowing._

104 _Do they not know that God is surely the One Who accepts the repentance of His servants and accepts what is offered in charity (prescribed or voluntary) for His sake and that God is surely the One Who accepts repentance and reciprocates it with generous forgiveness and additional reward, the Most Merciful (especially to His believing servants)?_

[Quran 10-10](/en/book/Islam/Quran/10#v10) _Therein their invocation will be: “Glory to You, O God! (You have exalted Yourself above having any fault and doing anything wrong).” And their greeting (between themselves and God and the angels) will be: “Peace!” And their invocation will end with: “All praise and thanksgiving are due to the Lord of the worlds!”_

[UB 143:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p7_3) _Worship—contemplation of the spiritual—must alternate with service, contact with material reality. Work should alternate with play; religion should be balanced by humor. Profound philosophy should be relieved by rhythmic poetry. The strain of living—the time tension of personality—should be relaxed by the restfulness of worship. The feelings of insecurity arising from the fear of personality isolation in the universe should be antidoted by the faith contemplation of the Father and by the attempted realization of the Supreme._

[UB 143:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p7_4) _Prayer is designed to make man less thinking but more realizing; it is not designed to increase knowledge but rather to expand insight._

[UB 143:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p7_5) _Worship is intended to anticipate the better life ahead and then to reflect these new spiritual significances back onto the life which now is. Prayer is spiritually sustaining, but worship is divinely creative._

[UB 143:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p7_6) _Worship is the technique of looking to the One for the inspiration of service to the many. Worship is the yardstick which measures the extent of the soul’s detachment from the material universe and its simultaneous and secure attachment to the spiritual realities of all creation._

[UB 143:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p7_7) _Prayer is self-reminding—sublime thinking; worship is self-forgetting—superthinking. Worship is effortless attention, true and ideal soul rest, a form of restful spiritual exertion._

[UB 143:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p7_8) _Worship is the act of a part identifying itself with the Whole; the finite with the Infinite; the son with the Father; time in the act of striking step with eternity. Worship is the act of the son’s personal communion with the divine Father, the assumption of refreshing, creative, fraternal, and romantic attitudes by the human soul-spirit._

[Quran 10-87](/en/book/Islam/Quran/10#v87) _And We revealed to Moses and his brother: “Provide houses for your people in Egypt (as places of refuge and gathering in the Way of God) and (as a community) make your houses places of reverence for God and establish the Prescribed Prayer according to its conditions. And (O Moses) give glad tidings to the believers.”_

[Quran 11-61](/en/book/Islam/Quran/11#v61) _And to (the people of) Thamud (We sent) their brother Salih (as a Messenger to convey the same message): O my people! Worship God alone, besides Him you have no deity. He created you from the earth and established you therein, giving you dignity and prosperity. Ask forgiveness (for the sins you have committed until now) and turn to Him in repentance. Indeed, my Lord is Near and Responds (to the appeal of all who call upon Him)._

[Quran 11-123](/en/book/Islam/Quran/11#v123) _To God belongs the dominion and knowledge of the unseen of the heavens and the earth, and to Him alone are all matters committed (for the Final Judgment). Worship Him and put your trust in Him. Your Lord is not heedless, nor does He disregard what you do._

[Quran 12-40](/en/book/Islam/Quran/12#v40) _Whatever you worship besides Him is nothing but names you and your ancestors have invented for them. (In the absolute sense) judgment and authority are with God alone. He has commanded you not to worship anyone except Him. This is the complete and true religion, but most people do not know it (and act in ignorance)._

[Quran 15:98-99](/en/book/Islam/Quran/15#v98) _But glorify your Lord with His praise (proclaim that He is above all partners and that all praise belongs to Him alone exclusively), and be of those who prostrate to Him (regularly in Prayer)._

99 _And (continue) worshipping your Lord until the truth (death) comes to you._

[Quran 16-49](/en/book/Islam/Quran/16#v49) _To God prostrates everything in the heavens and on the earth from among the living creatures and the angels (likewise, since) they are not arrogant._

[Quran 16-52](/en/book/Islam/Quran/16#v52) _To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on the earth, and to Him alone is due absolute obedience. So will you fear and obey anyone other than Allah with piety and reverence?_

53 _Whatever blessing you have comes from God; and when you suffer a calamity, it is to Him you turn for help._

54 _But then, when He removes calamity from you, some of you attribute partners to their Lord (Who alone sustains, provides for, and saves you from calamities)._

[Quran 16-114](/en/book/Islam/Quran/16#v114) _Therefore (O people) eat of the pure, lawful and good that God has provided for you and be grateful for His bounties, if it is indeed Him that you worship._

[Quran 16-125](/en/book/Islam/Quran/16#v125) _Invite to the Way of your Lord with wisdom and good exhortation, and argue with them in a way that is good. Your Lord surely knows best those who have strayed from His Way, and He knows best those who are rightly guided._

## FORGIVENESS

[Quran 17, 24-25](/en/book/Islam/Quran/17#v24) _Send down upon them the wing of humility out of mercy, and say: “My Lord, have mercy on them, for they were the ones who took care of me during my childhood.”_

25 _Your Lord knows well what is in your souls (regarding all matters, including what you think about your parents). If you are righteous (in your thoughts and actions), then He is certainly Forgiving to those who turn to Him in humble contrition._

[Quran 47-19](/en/book/Islam/Quran/47#v19). _So know (consider) that there is no deity but God, and ask forgiveness for your sins, and for the believing men and women. God knows from what (internal) state and (social) condition to what state and condition you move and will move, and in what state and condition you will stop._

[UB 174:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p1_4) _“When a wise man understands the inner impulses of his fellows, he will love them. And when you love your brother, you have already forgiven him. This capacity to understand man’s nature and forgive his apparent wrongdoing is Godlike. If you are wise parents, this is the way you will love and understand your children, even forgive them when transient misunderstanding has apparently separated you. The child, being immature and lacking in the fuller understanding of the depth of the child-father relationship, must frequently feel a sense of guilty separation from a father’s full approval, but the true father is never conscious of any such separation. Sin is an experience of creature consciousness; it is not a part of God’s consciousness._

[UB 174:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/174#p1_5) _“Your inability or unwillingness to forgive your fellows is the measure of your immaturity, your failure to attain adult sympathy, understanding, and love. You hold grudges and nurse vengefulness in direct proportion to your ignorance of the inner nature and true longings of your children and your fellow beings. Love is the outworking of the divine and inner urge of life. It is founded on understanding, nurtured by unselfish service, and perfected in wisdom.”_

## SEEK THE RIGHT PATH

[Quran 17:28-30](/en/book/Islam/Quran/17#v28) _But if you are to turn away from them (those in need, for you yourself are in need, and) seek mercy from your Lord in hope, then (at least) speak to them gently and kindly._

29 _Do not keep your hand tied around your neck (with stinginess), nor stretch it out without limit; otherwise you will be left reproached and stripped._

30 _Surely your Lord increases provision for whom He wills and spares it (for whom He wills). Truly, He is well aware of His servants and sees them well._

[Quran 17:80-81](/en/book/Islam/Quran/17#v80) _And say: “My Lord! Bring me in truthfully and truthfully, and bring me out truthfully and truthfully, and grant me a firm support from Your Presence, a powerful proof.”_

81 _And say: “Truth has come and falsehood has vanished. Surely falsehood must always vanish by its very nature.”_

[Quran 19:36-37](/en/book/Islam/Quran/19#v36). _“Surely, God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is the straight path (to follow).”_

37 _And yet the parties (the Jews and the Christians) disagreed among themselves (about it). Woe, then, to those who disbelieve because of the encounter of a terrible Day!_

[Quran 19-65](/en/book/Islam/Quran/19#v65) _(He is) the Lord of the heavens and the earth and everything between them; so worship Him alone and be steadfast and patient in His worship. Do you know anyone whose name is worthy of being mentioned beside His (as a Deity and Lord to worship)?_

[Quran 22:77-78](/en/book/Islam/Quran/22#v77) _O you who believe! Bow down and prostrate yourselves (thus perform the Prayer), and fulfill all the other duties of your worship to your Lord, and fulfill (all the other commandments of your Religion, all of which are) good, so that you may prosper._

78 _Strive in the cause of God and for Him alone (against His enemies to elevate His word, and against Satan and your carnal souls who order evil), in a manner worthy of such effort. He has chosen you (especially for this task) and has not imposed any difficulties upon you in Religion. This is the way of your father Abraham. God appointed you Muslims before, and in this Book, that the (most noble) Messenger may be a witness for you (as to the ways you follow), and that you may be witnesses for the people. So establish the Prayer according to its conditions, pay the Prescribed Alms, and remain steadfast to God. He is your Owner and Guardian. How excellent a Guardian and Owner He is, and how excellent a Helper He is!_

## PRAY THREE TIMES A DAY

[Quran 24-58](/en/book/Islam/Quran/24#v58) _O you who believe! (Even) those of whom your right hands are held (as slaves), and those of you (your children) who have not yet attained puberty, ask your permission (before entering your private rooms) at three times (of the day): before the Morning Prayer, and when you remove your clothes at midday to rest, and after the Night Prayer. These are your three times of privacy. Apart from these occasions, you do not fall into fault, nor do they, if they enter without permission; they will surely circulate around you, some of you attending to others. So, God makes clear to you (the instructions in) the Revelations. God is All-Knowing, All-Wise._

[UB 144:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p2_2) _“Prayer is entirely a personal and spontaneous expression of the attitude of the soul toward the spirit; prayer should be the communion of sonship and the expression of fellowship. Prayer, when indited by the spirit, leads to co-operative spiritual progress. The ideal prayer is a form of spiritual communion which leads to intelligent worship. True praying is the sincere attitude of reaching heavenward for the attainment of your ideals._

[UB 144:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p2_3) _“Prayer is the breath of the soul and should lead you to be persistent in your attempt to ascertain the Father’s will. If any one of you has a neighbor, and you go to him at midnight and say: ‘Friend, lend me three loaves, for a friend of mine on a journey has come to see me, and I have nothing to set before him’; and if your neighbor answers, ‘Trouble me not, for the door is now shut and the children and I are in bed; therefore I cannot rise and give you bread,’ you will persist, explaining that your friend hungers, and that you have no food to offer him. I say to you, though your neighbor will not rise and give you bread because he is your friend, yet because of your importunity he will get up and give you as many loaves as you need. If, then, persistence will win favors even from mortal man, how much more will your persistence in the spirit win the bread of life for you from the willing hands of the Father in heaven. Again I say to you: Ask and it shall be given you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you. For every one who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks the door of salvation will be opened._

[UB 144:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p2_6) _“But when you pray, you exercise so little faith. Genuine faith will remove mountains of material difficulty which may chance to lie in the path of soul expansion and spiritual progress.”_

[UB 144:3.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p3_14) _Jesus taught the twelve always to pray in secret; to go off by themselves amidst the quiet surroundings of nature or to go in their rooms and shut the doors when they engaged in prayer._

## SINCERITY

[Quran 29-65](/en/book/Islam/Quran/29#v65) _When they embark on a ship (and find themselves in danger), they call upon God, believing in Him alone (as the only Deity, the Lord, and the Sovereign). But when He brings them safely to land, behold, they begin again to associate partners with God!_

[Quran 36:36-40](/en/book/Islam/Quran/36#v36) _Glorified is He (who is above having a partner or a partner), Who created the pairs together from what the Earth produces, as well as from themselves, and from what they do not know!_

37 _Another clear sign for them is the night: We take away the day from it, and behold, they are plunged in darkness._

38 _And the Sun runs its appointed orbit for a period toward its final resting place, for the stability (of the system). This is the measured determination of the Glorious One, possessor of irresistible power (to Whose omnipotent decree the entire universe is subjected), All- Knowing._

39 _And for the Moon, We have fixed mansions until it returns like an old withered palm leaf._

40 _It is not proper for the Sun to overtake the Moon, nor for the night to overtake the day. All (celestial bodies and systems) are in an orbit (determined for each)._

[Quran 36-83](/en/book/Islam/Quran/36#v83) _So, Glorified is He in Whose Hand is the absolute dominion over all things, and to Whom all will be returned._

[Quran 37:180-182](/en/book/Islam/Quran/37#v180) _Glorified be your Lord, the Lord of power and glory Who is above all that they attribute to Him!_

181 _And peace be upon the Messengers._

182 _And all praise and thanksgiving are for God, the Lord of the worlds._

[Quran 39:1-2](/en/book/Islam/Quran/39#v1) _(This is) the Book that is sent down in parts from God, the Glorious, possessor of irresistible power, the Omniscient._

2 _We have sent down to you the Book with the truth (embodied of it, and with nothing false in it); so worship_

_God, being sincere in your faith in Him, and practicing Religion only for the pleasure of God._

[Quran 39:10-11](/en/book/Islam/Quran/39#v10) _Say (quoting Me): “O My servants who believe! Turn away from disobedience to your Lord in reverence for Him and piety. For those who dedicate themselves to doing good in this world, knowing that God is looking upon them, goodness is given (as a reward). And God’s Earth is vast (for worshipping Him). Those who are patient (persevering in adversity, worshipping God, and abstaining from sins) will certainly have their reward beyond measure.”_

11 _Say: "I have been commanded to worship God, to be sincere in faith in Him and to practice Religion exclusively for Him._

[Quran 39-40](/en/book/Islam/Quran/39#v40) _Who are those upon whom (in the world) will come a punishment that will humiliate them, and upon whom will be an eternal punishment (in the Hereafter)?_

## THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN

[Quran 39-63](/en/book/Islam/Quran/39#v63) _To them are the keys to the heavens and the earth. So those who disbelieve in the revelations of God and the signs - they are the losers._

[Quran 64-16](/en/book/Islam/Quran/64#v16) _So keep away from disobedience to God in worship of Him and piety as much as you can, and listen attentively and submit (to His commands), obey Him, and spend (in His cause and for the needy) as it is a cause of the improvement of your souls. Whoever is protected from the avarice of his soul, is indeed prosperous._

[Quran 40:7-8](/en/book/Islam/Quran/40#v7) _Those (angels) who carry the Supreme Throne (of God), and others around it, glorify their Lord with His praise; and they believe in Him (as the Sole Deity, Lord, and Sovereign of all Creation), and they ask His forgiveness for those (among His creation) who believe, saying: "Our Lord! You encompass all things with mercy and knowledge (having perfect knowledge of the need of every creature, and answering this need with mercy), so forgive those who repent (of their sins) and who follow Your way, and protect them from the punishment of the Blazing Fire._

8 _Our Lord! Admit them to the Gardens of perpetual bliss that You have promised them, those who are righteous among their ancestors, and their spouses, and their offspring. Surely You are the Glorious, possessor of irresistible power, All-Knowing._

[Quran 40:64-65](/en/book/Islam/Quran/40#v64) _God is the One who made the earth a fixed dwelling place and the sky a covering, and shaped you and perfected your forms and provides for you pure and wholesome things. So blessed and Supreme is God, the Lord of the worlds._

65 _He is Living; there is no deity but He. So pray to Him, being sincere in your faith in Him and practicing Religion only for Him. All praise and thanksgiving are due to God, the Lord of the worlds._

[Quran 43:80-82](/en/book/Islam/Quran/43#v80) _Or do they think that We do not hear their secrets (which they whisper only to themselves,) and their secret counsels? Indeed, We do, and Our messengers (angels) are with them, recording._

81 _Say: “If the Merciful had a son, I would be the first to worship him.”_

82 _Glorified be the Lord of the Heavens and the Earth, the Lord of the Supreme Throne, (exalted) above all that they attribute (to Him in ignorance and falsehood)._

[UB 39:4.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p4_14) _The keys of the kingdom of heaven are: sincerity, more sincerity, and more sincerity. All men possess these keys. Men use them—they advance in spiritual status—by decision, more decision, and more decision. The highest moral choice is the choice of the highest possible value, and always—in any sphere, in all spheres—that is choosing to do the will of God. If a man thus makes that choice, he is great, even if he be the humblest citizen of Jerusem or even the lowest mortal on Urantia._

[Quran 43, 84-86](/en/book/Islam/Quran/43#v84) _And He is God in the heavens (worthy of worship alone), and God on earth (worthy of worship alone). He is the All-Knowing, All-Aware._

85 _Blessed and Supreme is He, to Whom belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them; and with Him is the knowledge of the Last Hour. And to Him you will be returned._

86 _Those whom you (then deify) invoke apart from God have no power or permission to intercede (with God in either world); only those who bear witness to the truth (of God's absolute Oneness in Divinity, Lordship, and Sovereignty), and who have knowledge (of the truth, will have it)._

## MERCY

[Quran 45, 36-37](/en/book/Islam/Quran/45#v36) _And all praise and thanksgiving are due to God, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth, the Lord of the worlds._

37 _And to Him belongs greatness and sovereignty in the Heavens and the Earth, and He is the Glorious possessor of irresistible power, omniscient._

[Quran 49:16](/en/book/Islam/Quran/49#v16) If those who dwell in the desert still insist on believing in themselves, then say: “Would you teach God (how truly devout you are) your religion, when God knows all that is in the heavens and the earth?” God is fully aware of all things.

[Quran 52:43](/en/book/Islam/Quran/52#v43) _Or do they have a deity besides Allah (whom they vainly look to for sustenance, help, and protection)? Glory to Him (for He is most exalted) above the partners they attribute to Him._

[Quran 53, 62](/en/book/Islam/Quran/53#v62) _Rather: Prostrate yourselves to God (in submission) and worship Him (so that He may protect you from the terror and suffering of the Last Hour)._

[Quran 59:24](/en/book/Islam/Quran/59#v24) He is God, the Creator, the All-Maker (Who creates without defect), the Giver of Form. To Him belong all the Beautiful Names. Everything in the heavens and on the earth glorifies Him, (declaring that it is absolutely above having any defect). He is the Glorious, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing.

[Quran 60:4](/en/book/Islam/Quran/60#v4) _Verily, you have an excellent example to follow in Abraham and those in his company, when they said to their (idolatrous) people (who were his kinsmen): “We will turn away from you and from anything you worship besides God. We have rejected you (in your polytheism), and enmity and hatred have arisen between us and you forever until you believe in God alone (as the One to be worshipped).” (So it was) except for what Abraham said to his father: “I will surely ask forgiveness of God for you, although I have no power to do anything for you against God.” (And his prayer was):_

_O our Lord! It is in You that we place our trust, and it is to You that we turn with the greatest sincerity and devotion, and to You is our return._

[Quran 62, 1](/en/book/Islam/Quran/62#v1) _Everything in the heavens and everything on earth glorifies God, the Absolute Sovereign, the Holy and Pure, the Glorious, the possessor of irresistible power, the Omniscient._

[Quran 62, 10-11](/en/book/Islam/Quran/62#v10) _And when the Prayer is performed, disperse throughout the earth and seek (your share) of God's bounty, and make great mention of God (in performing the Prayer and also on other occasions), that you may prosper (in both worlds)._

11 _But (it happened that) when they saw (an opportunity for) business or amusement, they abandoned it and left you standing (while you were preaching the sermon). Say: “That which is with God is better (for you) than amusement and business. God is the Best of Providers with the supreme rank of provision.”_

[Quran 63:9](/en/book/Islam/Quran/63#v9) _O you who believe! Do not let your wealth or your children distract you from the remembrance of God. Those who do this are only the losers._

## GOD FIRST ABOVE ALL THINGS

[Quran 71, 28](/en/book/Islam/Quran/71#v28) _My Lord! Forgive me and my parents, and all who join my family as a believer, and all the believing men and women, and do not increase these wrongdoers in anything but ruin._

[Quran 76, 25-26](/en/book/Islam/Quran/76#v25) _And remember and mention the Name of your Lord (in worship) in the early morning and in the evening._

26 _And for part of the night fall down before Him, and glorify Him for a great part of the night._

[Quran 110, 1-3](/en/book/Islam/Quran/110#v1) _When God's help comes and victory (which is a door opening to other victories), 2 And you see the people entering in droves to the Religion of God,_

3 _Then glorify your Lord with His praise, and ask forgiveness of Him, for He is surely the One Who accepts repentance and reciprocates it with generous forgiveness and additional reward._

## TRUE PRAYER AND WORSHIP

[UB 5:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p3_1) _Though the Paradise Deities, from the universe standpoint, are as one, in their spiritual relations with such beings as inhabit Urantia they are also three distinct and separate persons. There is a difference between the Godheads in the matter of personal appeals, communion, and other intimate relations. In the highest sense, we worship the Universal Father and him only. True, we can and do worship the Father as he is manifested in his Creator Sons, but it is the Father, directly or indirectly, who is worshiped and adored._

[Quran 114, 1-6](/en/book/Islam/Quran/114#v1) _Say: "I seek refuge with the Lord of mankind,_

2 _The Sovereign of human beings;_

3 _The Deity of human beings,_

4 _From the evil of the whisperer (Satan) who sneaks away,_

5 _Who whispers in the hearts of human beings,_

6 _Among the genies and human beings»._

[Quran 46-15](/en/book/Islam/Quran/46#v15) _Now (among the good deeds) We have enjoined upon man the best of treatment for his parents. His mother carried him in pain, and in pain she conceived him. The pregnancy and his suckling (until he is weaned) are thirty months, until finally he has reached his full maturity and arrived at the age of forty, he says: “My Lord! Inspire me to be grateful for all Your Favors (life, health, sustenance, faith, submission, and many more) that You have granted to me and my parents, and to do good and righteous deeds, with which You will be pleased; and grant me righteous offspring (so that they will treat me righteously, just as I behave towards my parents). I have turned to You, and I am one of those who have submitted to You.”_

[Quran 87, 1-5](/en/book/Islam/Quran/87#v1) _Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High,_

2 _Who creates and forms with due proportions,_

3 _And Who determines (a life, a nature, and a particular goal for each creature), and guides (it toward the fulfillment of that goal);_

4 _And He who makes vegetation sprout,_

5 _Then it transforms it into dark-colored rotten stubble._

[Quran 55, 5-6](/en/book/Islam/Quran/55#v5) _The sun and the moon are given by an exact calculation (of the Merciful)._

6 _And the stars and the trees both bow down (before God in perfect submission to His laws)._

## PRAYER OF PROTECTION

[Quran 23, 96-98](/en/book/Islam/Quran/23#v96) _(However, whatever they may say or do) repel the evil (done to you and committed against your mission) with the best (of what You can do). We know best all that they falsely attribute to Us._

97 _And say: "My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the incitements and provocations of the devils (of the jinn and of humanity, especially in my dealings with people, while I am fulfilling my mission)._

98 _I seek refuge in You, my Lord, so that they may not be present with me._

## MESSENGERS OF THE FATHER

[Quran 2:87](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v87) _(That is their just due. For) We granted the Book to Moses, and after him We sent Messengers after him (following in the footsteps of Moses and judging by the Book, so that We have never left them without guidance and light). And (in the same succession) We provided Jesus, son of Mary, with clear proofs of the truth and (of his status as a Messenger), and We confirmed him with the Spirit of Holiness. Was it (whenever) a Messenger came to you with (a message and commandments) that your souls did not desire, that you used to become arrogant, refuting some (of the Messengers) and killing others?_

[Quran 2-91](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v91) _And when it is said to them (for the sign of the believer is to believe in whatever God has sent down): “Believe in what He has sent down (upon Muhammad, i.e., the Quran),” they say: “We believe only in what was sent down to us,” and they do not believe in what came afterward, although it is the truth confirming what they had (of the truth). Say (to them, O Messenger): “Why then did you kill the prophets of God before, if you were indeed believers (and loyal to what was sent down to you)?”_

[Quran 2-119](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v119) _(O Messenger! Let not what they say grieve you). We have certainly sent you as a Messenger with the truth, a bringer of good news (of prosperity in return for faith and righteousness) and a warner (of the consequences of straying and transgression). You (perform your mission perfectly, and consequently) you will not be questioned about the companions of the Blazing Fire._

[Quran 2-129](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v129) _“Our Lord! Send forth for that community a Messenger from among themselves, who will recite to them Your Revelation and instruct them in the Book (which You will reveal to them) and Wisdom, and purify them (from false beliefs and doctrines, from sins and from all impurities). Indeed, You are the Glorious, the All-Glorious, the All-Knowing.”_

[Quran 2-151](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v151) _We have also sent to you a Messenger from among yourselves, who recites to you_

_Our Revelations purify you (from false beliefs, faults and all kinds of impurities), instruct you in the Book and Wisdom and instruct you in what you do not know._

[Quran 2-213](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v213) _Human beings were (initially) a community (following one way of life without arguing about provision or the like. Later differences arose and) God sent Prophets as bearers of glad tidings (of prosperity in return for faith and righteousness) and warners (against the consequences of misguidance and transgression), and He sent down with them the Book in truth (containing nothing false in it) so that He may judge between people concerning that over which they differed. Only those to whom it was given differed concerning it, after clear proofs had reached them, out of envy and insolence among themselves. God has guided, with His permission, those who have believed (in the book and in the prophets, those who now believe in the Quran and in Muhammad) God guides whomever His Will dictates to the straight path._

[Quran 2-285](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v285) _The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and the believers believe in this, each one believing in God, His angels, His Books, and His Messengers: “We make no distinction between any of His Messengers (by believing in them).” And they say: “We have heard (the call to faith and right conduct) and (unlike many of the followers of Moses) we have obeyed. Our Lord, grant us forgiveness, and to You is the return.”_

[Quran 3-164](/en/book/Islam/Quran/3#v164) _Surely, God has bestowed a favor upon the believers by raising among them a Messenger from among their own people, who recites to them His Revelations, and purifies them (from false doctrines, sins, and all kinds of impurities), and instructs them in the Book and Wisdom. Whereas before they were lost in obvious error._

[Quran 3-79](/en/book/Islam/Quran/3#v79) _It cannot be conceived that God would bestow upon a human being the Book, authority with righteousness and sound judgment, as well as the Prophetic Mission, and then say to the people: “Be My servants apart from God.” Rather, He would say: “Be pure and totally dedicated servants of the Lord by teaching the Book and studying it.”_

[Quran 4-152](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v152) _And as for those who believe in God and His Messengers and make no distinction between them (between God and His Messengers, or between His Messengers themselves), to them God will give their (full) reward. God is, surely, Forgiving and Merciful._

## BE TEACHERS

[Quran 3-179](/en/book/Islam/Quran/3#v179) _It was not God’s will to leave the believers in the state you are in until He distinguishes the corrupt from the pure. Nor was it God’s will that He would reveal to you the Unseen (that you may know your future and have access to people’s hearts). But God chooses from among His Messengers whom He wills (and imparts to him some of the knowledge of the Unseen and completes the test to which He puts you in the world). So believe in God and His Messengers: If you believe and live righteously and avoid disobedience to Him and His Messenger, you will have a great reward._

[Quran 4:6-9](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v6) _(City and) examine the orphans well when they have reached the age of marriage. If you find them to be wise, then transfer their wealth to them; and do not waste it in vain, nor be hasty lest they grow old (and seize it). If the guardian is rich (enough to support himself and his family), let him abstain (from his ward's property); but if he is poor, let him spend it justly and reasonably. When you transfer (their property) to them, let there be witnesses on their part. Sufficient is God, as the One Who settles accounts (of His servants)._

7 _Male heirs are entitled to a share of what their parents and close relatives leave behind, and female heirs are entitled to a share of what their parents and close relatives leave behind, whether it is abundant or meager - it is a share prescribed by God._

8 _If some of the other relatives (who do not possess a defined legitimate share), the orphans and the destitute are present at the share (of the inheritance), grant them something from it (for their provision) and speak to them kindly and pleasantly._

9 _Let those who, if they themselves were to leave behind weak offspring, would fear for them, be concerned (about the rights of orphans) - and let them refrain from disobedience to God for fear of His punishment and let them speak the truth in appropriate words (regarding the sharing of the inheritance and their treatment of orphans)._

## BELIEVE IN THE MESSENGERS

[Quran 4-59](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v59) _O you who believe! Obey God, and the Messenger, and those among you who are entrusted with authority. And if you quarrel about anything, refer it to God and the Messenger, if indeed you believe in God and the Last Day. This is best (for you) and most righteous in the end._

[Quran 4-69](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v69) _Whoever obeys God and the Messenger (as they ought to be obeyed), they are (and will be in the Hereafter, in Paradise) with those whom God has favored (with perfect guidance): the Prophets, the truthful (loyal to the cause of God and truthful in all they say and do), the witnesses (those who see the Hidden Divine Truths and attest to them with their lives), the righteous (in all their deeds and words, and are dedicated to correcting wrongdoing). What excellent companions they are!_

[Quran 33-71](/en/book/Islam/Quran/33#v71) _May He make your deeds good and righteous and forgive you your sins. Whoever obeys God and His Messenger has certainly achieved a tremendous triumph._

[Quran 36, 20-21](/en/book/Islam/Quran/36#v20) _A man came running from the far side of the city and said: "O my people! Follow those who have been sent (to you as Messengers of God)._

21 _Follow those who do not ask any reward from you (for their service), and are rightly guided._

[Quran 6-33](/en/book/Islam/Quran/6#v33) _(O Messenger!) We know that what they say (lies, mockery, and slander) grieves you; but it is not you they deny (they cannot call you a liar since they previously called you “The Trustworthy”); rather, it is the signs and Revelations of God that the wrongdoers stubbornly reject._

## MELCHISEDEK AND ABRAHAM

[Quran 2-124](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v124) _(You reject belief and the following of Muhammad primarily because the Prophethood neither remained nor appeared among you. Now you certainly accept the Prophethood of Abraham, therefore,) remember that his Lord tested Abraham with commandments and harsh experiences (such as being thrown into the Fire, the destruction of the people of Lot who was his kinsman, and the command to sacrifice his son Ishmael) which he did conscientiously. He (Abraham) said: “And I will make you an imam for all people.” He (Abraham) pleaded: “Will you appoint imams) from among my descendants also?”_

[Genesis 18-18](/en/Bible/Genesis/18#v18) _...should Abraham become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth should be blessed in him?_

[UB 93:9.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p9_11) _But one of the writers of the Book of Hebrews understood the mission of Melchizedek, for it is written: “This Melchizedek, priest of the Most High, was also king of peace; without father, without mother, without pedigree, having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like a Son of God, he abides a priest continually.” This writer designated Melchizedek as a type of the later bestowal of Michael, affirming that Jesus was “a minister forever on the order of Melchizedek.” While this comparison was not altogether fortunate, it was literally true that Christ did receive provisional title to Urantia “upon the orders of the twelve Melchizedek receivers” on duty at the time of his world bestowal._

[Hebrews 7-1](/en/book/Islam/Quran/7#v1) _For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,_

2 _whom Abraham also gave a tenth of all; whose name is translated first of all, King of Righteousness, and also King of Salem, that is, King of Peace;_

3 _without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest forever._

[Quran 2-130](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v130) _Who then turns away from the way of Abraham except he who acts like a fool? We chose him as pure and distinguished in this life, and he will certainly be among the most righteous in the Hereafter._

[UB 93:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p6_3) _And Melchizedek made a formal covenant with Abraham at Salem. Said he to Abraham: “Look now up to the heavens and number the stars if you are able; so numerous shall your seed be.” And Abraham believed Melchizedek, “and it was counted to him for righteousness.” And then Melchizedek told Abraham the story of the future occupation of Canaan by his offspring after their sojourn in Egypt._

The revealers conclude with the following quote:

[UB 93:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p6_4) _This covenant of Melchizedek with Abraham represents the great Urantian agreement between divinity and humanity whereby God agrees to do everything; man only agrees to believe God’s promises and follow his instructions. Heretofore it had been believed that salvation could be secured only by works—sacrifices and offerings; now, Melchizedek again brought to Urantia the good news that salvation, favor with God, is to be had by faith. But this gospel of simple faith in God was too advanced; the Semitic tribesmen subsequently preferred to go back to the older sacrifices and atonement for sin by the shedding of blood._

Although such statements are hopeful, humanity does not live up to the divine promises of God's Revealers or Teachers.

## MASTERS OF THE FUTURE

[Quran 2-129](/en/book/Islam/Quran/2#v129) _<< Our Lord! Send forth for that community a Messenger from among themselves, who will recite to them Your Revelation and instruct them in the Book and wisdom and purify them. Indeed, You are the Glorious, the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing._

[UB 92:5.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p5_16) _The future of Urantia will doubtless be characterized by the appearance of teachers of religious truth—the Fatherhood of God and the fraternity of all creatures. But it is to be hoped that the ardent and sincere efforts of these future prophets will be directed less toward the strengthening of interreligious barriers and more toward the augmentation of the religious brotherhood of spiritual worship among the many followers of the differing intellectual theologies which so characterize Urantia of Satania._

[Quran 3-3](/en/book/Islam/Quran/3#v3) _He sends down to you the Book in parts with the Truth, confirming (the Divine Origin and the truths it contains) the Revelations that came before it; and He sent down the Torah and the Gospel._

This verse tells us that God the Father sends revelations to every generation. The Gospel alludes to the Master Jesus and hints at other revelations before Him.

[UB 92:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p4_4) _There have been many events of religious revelation but only five of epochal significance. These were as follows:_

[UB 92:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p4_5) _1. The Dalamatian teachings. The true concept of the First Source and Center was first promulgated on Urantia by the one hundred corporeal members of Prince Caligastia’s staff. This expanding revelation of Deity went on for more than three hundred thousand years until it was suddenly terminated by the planetary secession and the disruption of the teaching regime. Except for the work of Van, the influence of the Dalamatian revelation was practically lost to the whole world. Even the Nodites had forgotten this truth by the time of Adam’s arrival. Of all who received the teachings of the one hundred, the red men held them longest, but the idea of the Great Spirit was but a hazy concept in Amerindian religion when contact with Christianity greatly clarified and strengthened it._

[UB 92:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p4_6) _2. The Edenic teachings. Adam and Eve again portrayed the concept of the Father of all to the evolutionary peoples. The disruption of the first Eden halted the course of the Adamic revelation before it had ever fully started. But the aborted teachings of Adam were carried on by the Sethite priests, and some of these truths have never been entirely lost to the world. The entire trend of Levantine religious evolution was modified by the teachings of the Sethites. But by 2500 B.C. mankind had largely lost sight of the revelation sponsored in the days of Eden._

[UB 92:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p4_7) _3. Melchizedek of Salem. This emergency Son of Nebadon inaugurated the third revelation of truth on Urantia. The cardinal precepts of his teachings were trust and faith. He taught trust in the omnipotent beneficence of God and proclaimed that faith was the act by which men earned God’s favor. His teachings gradually commingled with the beliefs and practices of various evolutionary religions and finally developed into those theologic systems present on Urantia at the opening of the first millennium after Christ._

[UB 92:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p4_8) _4. Jesus of Nazareth. Christ Michael presented for the fourth time to Urantia the concept of God as the Universal Father, and this teaching has generally persisted ever since. The essence of his teaching was love and service, the loving worship which a creature son voluntarily gives in recognition of, and response to, the loving ministry of God his Father; the freewill service which such creature sons bestow upon their brethren in the joyous realization that in this service they are likewise serving God the Father._

[UB 92:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p4_9) _5. The Urantia Papers. The papers, of which this is one, constitute the most recent presentation of truth to the mortals of Urantia. These papers differ from all previous revelations, for they are not the work of a single universe personality but a composite presentation by many beings. But no revelation short of the attainment of the Universal Father can ever be complete. All other celestial ministrations are no more than partial, transient, and practically adapted to local conditions in time and space._

_Although these admissions may perhaps detract from the immediate force and authority of all the revelations, the time has come on Urantia when it is advisable to make these frank statements, even at the risk of weakening the future influence and authority of these, the most recent revelations of truth to the mortal races of Urantia._

[Quran 3-43](/en/book/Islam/Quran/3#v43) _And remember when the angels said: “O Mary! God has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of all nations.”_

[UB 122:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p3_1) _One evening about sundown, before Joseph had returned home, Gabriel appeared to Mary by the side of a low stone table and, after she had recovered her composure, said: “I come at the bidding of one who is my Master and whom you shall love and nurture. To you, Mary, I bring glad tidings when I announce that the conception within you is ordained by heaven, and that in due time you will become the mother of a son; you shall call him Joshua, and he shall inaugurate the kingdom of heaven on earth and among men. Speak not of this matter save to Joseph and to Elizabeth, your kinswoman, to whom I have also appeared, and who shall presently also bear a son, whose name shall be John, and who will prepare the way for the message of deliverance which your son shall proclaim to men with great power and deep conviction. And doubt not my word, Mary, for this home has been chosen as the mortal habitat of the child of destiny. My benediction rests upon you, the power of the Most Highs will strengthen you, and the Lord of all the earth shall overshadow you.”_

[Quran 3-43, 44](/en/book/Islam/Quran/3#v43) _And remember when the angels said: "O Mary! God has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of all nations._

“Oh, Mary! Be obedient to your Lord and bow down and worship God only with those who worship him.”

_O Messenger! Convey to the people what has been revealed to you by your Lord; for if you do not, you would not have proclaimed His Message at all. And God will protect you from men. Indeed, God does not guide the disbelieving people._

[Quran 4-69](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v69) _Whoever obeys God and this Messenger of His will be among those upon whom Allah has bestowed His blessings: the Prophets, the Truthful, the Martyrs, and the Righteous. What excellent companions are these!_

[Quran 5-92](/en/book/Islam/Quran/5#v92) _Obey Allah and the Messenger, and be on your guard. But if you turn away, to our Messenger belongs only the clear transmission of the Message._

## DEATH OF JESUS

[Quran 4-157, 158](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v157) _And because they say, “We have killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of God,” when in fact they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, but he appeared to them crucified. But those who differ on this matter are, verily, in doubt about this matter; they have no direct knowledge of it, but only conjecture; but certainly they did not kill him._

_On the contrary, God exalted him to Himself. For God is Powerful, Wise._

[UB 187:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p3_1) _At about half past nine o’clock this Friday morning, Jesus was hung upon the cross. Before eleven o’clock, upward of one thousand persons had assembled to witness this spectacle of the crucifixion of the Son of Man. Throughout these dreadful hours the unseen hosts of a universe stood in silence while they gazed upon this extraordinary phenomenon of the Creator as he was dying the death of the creature, even the most ignoble death of a condemned criminal._

[UB 187:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p3_2) _Standing near the cross at one time or another during the crucifixion were Mary, Ruth, Jude, John, Salome (John’s mother), and a group of earnest women believers including Mary the wife of Clopas and sister of Jesus’ mother, Mary Magdalene, and Rebecca, onetime of Sepphoris. These and other friends of Jesus held their peace while they witnessed his great patience and fortitude and gazed upon his intense sufferings._

[UB 187:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p3_3) _Many who passed by wagged their heads and, railing at him, said: “You who would destroy the temple and build it again in three days, save yourself. If you are the Son of God, why do you not come down from your cross?” In like manner some of the rulers of the Jews mocked him, saying, “He saved others, but himself he cannot save.” Others said, “If you are the king of the Jews, come down from the cross, and we will believe in you.” And later on they mocked him the more, saying: “He trusted in God to deliver him. He even claimed to be the Son of God—look at him now—crucified between two thieves.” Even the two thieves also railed at him and cast reproach upon him._

[UB 187:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p3_4) _Inasmuch as Jesus would make no reply to their taunts, and since it was nearing noontime of this special preparation day, by half past eleven o’clock most of the jesting and jeering crowd had gone its way; less than fifty persons remained on the scene. The soldiers now prepared to eat lunch and drink their cheap, sour wine as they settled down for the long deathwatch. As they partook of their wine, they derisively offered a toast to Jesus, saying, “Hail and good fortune! to the king of the Jews.” And they were astonished at the Master’s tolerant regard of their ridicule and mocking._

[UB 187:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p3_5) _When Jesus saw them eat and drink, he looked down upon them and said, “I thirst.” When the captain of the guard heard Jesus say, “I thirst,” he took some of the wine from his bottle and, putting the saturated sponge stopper upon the end of a javelin, raised it to Jesus so that he could moisten his parched lips._

[UB 187:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p3_6) _Jesus had purposed to live without resort to his supernatural power, and he likewise elected to die as an ordinary mortal upon the cross. He had lived as a man, and he would die as a man—doing the Father’s will._

[UB 187:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p4_1) _One of the brigands railed at Jesus, saying, “If you are the Son of God, why do you not save yourself and us?” But when he had reproached Jesus, the other thief, who had many times heard the Master teach, said: “Do you have no fear even of God? Do you not see that we are suffering justly for our deeds, but that this man suffers unjustly? Better that we should seek forgiveness for our sins and salvation for our souls.” When Jesus heard the thief say this, he turned his face toward him and smiled approvingly. When the malefactor saw the face of Jesus turned toward him, he mustered up his courage, fanned the flickering flame of his faith, and said, “Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom.” And then Jesus said, “Verily, verily, I say to you today, you shall sometime be with me in Paradise.”_

[UB 187:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p4_2) _The Master had time amidst the pangs of mortal death to listen to the faith confession of the believing brigand. When this thief reached out for salvation, he found deliverance. Many times before this he had been constrained to believe in Jesus, but only in these last hours of consciousness did he turn with a whole heart toward the Master’s teaching. When he saw the manner in which Jesus faced death upon the cross, this thief could no longer resist the conviction that this Son of Man was indeed the Son of God._

[UB 187:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p4_3) _During this episode of the conversion and reception of the thief into the kingdom by Jesus, the Apostle John was absent, having gone into the city to bring his mother and her friends to the scene of the crucifixion. Luke subsequently heard this story from the converted Roman captain of the guard._

[UB 187:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p4_4) _The Apostle John told about the crucifixion as he remembered the event two thirds of a century after its occurrence. The other records were based upon the recital of the Roman centurion on duty who, because of what he saw and heard, subsequently believed in Jesus and entered into the full fellowship of the kingdom of heaven on earth._

[UB 187:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p4_5) _This young man, the penitent brigand, had been led into a life of violence and wrongdoing by those who extolled such a career of robbery as an effective patriotic protest against political oppression and social injustice. And this sort of teaching, plus the urge for adventure, led many otherwise well-meaning youths to enlist in these daring expeditions of robbery. This young man had looked upon Barabbas as a hero. Now he saw that he had been mistaken. Here on the cross beside him he saw a really great man, a true hero. Here was a hero who fired his zeal and inspired his highest ideas of moral self-respect and quickened all his ideals of courage, manhood, and bravery. In beholding Jesus, there sprang up in his heart an overwhelming sense of love, loyalty, and genuine greatness._

[UB 187:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p4_6) _And if any other person among the jeering crowd had experienced the birth of faith within his soul and had appealed to the mercy of Jesus, he would have been received with the same loving consideration that was displayed toward the believing brigand._

[UB 187:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p4_7) _Just after the repentant thief heard the Master’s promise that they should sometime meet in Paradise, John returned from the city, bringing with him his mother and a company of almost a dozen women believers. John took up his position near Mary the mother of Jesus, supporting her. Her son Jude stood on the other side. As Jesus looked down upon this scene, it was noontide, and he said to his mother, “Woman, behold your son!” And speaking to John, he said, “My son, behold your mother!” And then he addressed them both, saying, “I desire that you depart from this place.” And so John and Jude led Mary away from Golgotha. John took the mother of Jesus to the place where he tarried in Jerusalem and then hastened back to the scene of the crucifixion. After the Passover Mary returned to Bethsaida, where she lived at John’s home for the rest of her natural life. Mary did not live quite one year after the death of Jesus._

[UB 187:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p4_8) _After Mary left, the other women withdrew for a short distance and remained in attendance upon Jesus until he expired on the cross, and they were yet standing by when the body of the Master was taken down for burial._

## UNREVEALED AND REVEALED MASTERS

[Quran 4-164](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v164) _And We sent some Messengers whom We have mentioned to you and some whom We have not mentioned to you - and Allah spoke to Moses, giving him the Commandments-_

[UB 30:1.41](/en/The_Urantia_Book/30#p1_41) _11. Unrevealed Universe Aids._

[UB 30:1.42](/en/The_Urantia_Book/30#p1_42) _12. Unrevealed Sons of God._

[UB 30:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/30#p0_2) _It is not possible to formulate comprehensive and entirely consistent classifications of the personalities of the grand universe because all of the groups are not revealed._

[Quran 5-20](/en/book/Islam/Quran/5#v20) _O People of the Book! Our Messenger has come to you, after a break in the series of Messengers, to make things clear to you, lest you say, “No bearer of good news has come to us, nor any warner.” So there has come to you indeed a bearer of good news and a warner. And God is able to do all things._

[Quran 4-170, 171](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v170) O People of the Book! Do not transgress the bounds of your religion, and do not say of God except the truth. Verily, the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, was only a Messenger of Allah and the fulfillment of His word which He revealed to Mary, and a grace from Him. So believe in God and His Messengers and do not say, “There are three of them.” Refuse; it will be better for you. Verily, God is the One God. Far be it from His Holiness that He should have a son. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. And God is Sufficient as a Protector.

_Truly, the Messiah will never disdain to be God's servant, nor will the angels who are close to God; but those who disdain to worship him and fall into pride, know that he will gather them all to himself._

[Quran 4-174](/en/book/Islam/Quran/4#v174) _O mankind! Verily, a clear proof has come to you from your Lord, and We have revealed to you a clear Light._

## THE LAST SUPPER

[Quran 5-112, 115](/en/book/Islam/Quran/5#v112) _They said: “We wish to eat of it so that our hearts may be at ease, and we may know that You have spoken to us the truth, and we may bear witness to it.”_

Jesus, son of Mary, said: “O Father, our Lord, send us from heaven a table spread with delicacies, which will be a feast for us, from the first to the last of us, and a Sign from You; and provide for us, for You are the Best of Providers.”

God said, “I will indeed send it to you, but if any of you disbelieve after that, I will inflict upon you a punishment such as I will not inflict on any other people.”

[UB 179:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_1) _As they brought Jesus the third cup of wine, the “cup of blessing,” he arose from the couch and, taking the cup in his hands, blessed it, saying: “Take this cup, all of you, and drink of it. This shall be the cup of my remembrance. This is the cup of the blessing of a new dispensation of grace and truth. This shall be to you the emblem of the bestowal and ministry of the divine Spirit of Truth. And I will not again drink this cup with you until I drink in new form with you in the Father’s eternal kingdom.”_

[UB 179:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_2) _The apostles all sensed that something out of the ordinary was transpiring as they drank of this cup of blessing in profound reverence and perfect silence. The old Passover commemorated the emergence of their fathers from a state of racial slavery into individual freedom; now the Master was instituting a new remembrance supper as a symbol of the new dispensation wherein the enslaved individual emerges from the bondage of ceremonialism and selfishness into the spiritual joy of the brotherhood and fellowship of the liberated faith sons of the living God._

[UB 179:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_3) _When they had finished drinking this new cup of remembrance, the Master took up the bread and, after giving thanks, broke it in pieces and, directing them to pass it around, said: “Take this bread of remembrance and eat it. I have told you that I am the bread of life. And this bread of life is the united life of the Father and the Son in one gift. The word of the Father, as revealed in the Son, is indeed the bread of life.” When they had partaken of the bread of remembrance, the symbol of the living word of truth incarnated in the likeness of mortal flesh, they all sat down._

[UB 179:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_4) _In instituting this remembrance supper, the Master, as was always his habit, resorted to parables and symbols. He employed symbols because he wanted to teach certain great spiritual truths in such a manner as to make it difficult for his successors to attach precise interpretations and definite meanings to his words. In this way he sought to prevent successive generations from crystallizing his teaching and binding down his spiritual meanings by the dead chains of tradition and dogma. In the establishment of the only ceremony or sacrament associated with his whole life mission, Jesus took great pains to suggest his meanings rather than to commit himself to precise definitions. He did not wish to destroy the individual’s concept of divine communion by establishing a precise form; neither did he desire to limit the believer’s spiritual imagination by formally cramping it. He rather sought to set man’s reborn soul free upon the joyous wings of a new and living spiritual liberty._

[UB 179:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_5) _Notwithstanding the Master’s effort thus to establish this new sacrament of the remembrance, those who followed after him in the intervening centuries saw to it that his express desire was effectively thwarted in that his simple spiritual symbolism of that last night in the flesh has been reduced to precise interpretations and subjected to the almost mathematical precision of a set formula. Of all Jesus’ teachings none have become more tradition-standardized._

[UB 179:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_6) _This supper of remembrance, when it is partaken of by those who are Son-believing and God-knowing, does not need to have associated with its symbolism any of man’s puerile misinterpretations regarding the meaning of the divine presence, for upon all such occasions the Master is really present. The remembrance supper is the believer’s symbolic rendezvous with Michael. When you become thus spirit-conscious, the Son is actually present, and his spirit fraternizes with the indwelling fragment of his Father._

[UB 179:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_7) _After they had engaged in meditation for a few moments, Jesus continued speaking: “When you do these things, recall the life I have lived on earth among you and rejoice that I am to continue to live on earth with you and to serve through you. As individuals, contend not among yourselves as to who shall be greatest. Be you all as brethren. And when the kingdom grows to embrace large groups of believers, likewise should you refrain from contending for greatness or seeking preferment between such groups.”_

We do not send the Messengers except as bearers of good news and as warners. Therefore, those who believe and reform will not be overcome by fear, nor will they grieve.

[Quran 6-130](/en/book/Islam/Quran/6#v130) _“O assembly of jinn and mankind! Did not Messengers come to you from among yourselves, recounting My Signs to you and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?” They will say, “We are witnesses against ourselves.” For the worldly life has enticed them. And they will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers._

[Jeremiah 23-11](/en/Bible/Jeremiah/23#v11) _For both prophet and priest are wicked; even in my house I have found their wickedness, says the Lord._

[Matthew 7-21,23](/en/Bible/Matthew/7#v21) _Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven._

22 _Many will say to me on that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?_

23 _And then I will declare to them, I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of iniquity._

[2 Thessalonians 2-9](/en/Bible/2_Thessalonians/2#v9) _the coming of the wicked one is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,_

10 _and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness for those who are perishing, because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved._

[Deuteronomy 18-20](/en/Bible/Deuteronomy/1#v20) _The prophet who presumes to speak a word in my name that I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet shall die._

[UB 140:3.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p3_19) _“I warn you against false prophets who will come to you in sheep’s clothing, while on the inside they are as ravening wolves. By their fruits you shall know them. Do men gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles? Even so, every good tree brings forth good fruit, but the corrupt tree bears evil fruit. A good tree cannot yield evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit. Every tree that does not bring forth good fruit is presently hewn down and cast into the fire. In gaining an entrance into the kingdom of heaven, it is the motive that counts. My Father looks into the hearts of men and judges by their inner longings and their sincere intentions._

[UB 140:3.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p3_20) _“In the great day of the kingdom judgment, many will say to me, ‘Did we not prophesy in your name and by your name do many wonderful works?’ But I will be compelled to say to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me you who are false teachers.’ But every one who hears this charge and sincerely executes his commission to represent me before men even as I have represented my Father to you, shall find an abundant entrance into my service and into the kingdom of the heavenly Father.”_

## TEACHERS MURDERED

[Quran 3-183](/en/book/Islam/Quran/3#v183) _... Say: “As for Messengers, they came to you before me with clear Signs and with what you have just said. So why did you seek to kill them if you are truthful?”_

[Jeremiah 7-23, 26](/en/Bible/Jeremiah/7#v23). _But this is what I commanded them, saying: Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people; and walk in all the ways that I command you, that it may be well with you._

24 _And they did not listen nor incline their ear, but walked in their own counsels, in the hardness of their evil heart, and went backward and not forward,_

25 _from the day your fathers came out of the land of Egypt until today. And I sent you all my servants the prophets, sending them early and continually._

26 _But they did not listen to me nor incline their ear, but stiffened their necks and did worse than their fathers._

[UB 163:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p1_4) _“And everywhere you go, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand,’ and minister to all who may be sick in either mind or body. Freely you have received of the good things of the kingdom; freely give. If the people of any city receive you, they shall find an abundant entrance into the Father’s kingdom; but if the people of any city refuse to receive this gospel, still shall you proclaim your message as you depart from that unbelieving community, saying, even as you leave, to those who reject your teaching: ‘Notwithstanding you reject the truth, it remains that the kingdom of God has come near you.’ He who hears you hears me. And he who hears me hears Him who sent me. He who rejects your gospel message rejects me. And he who rejects me rejects Him who sent me.”_

[Quran 10-13](/en/book/Islam/Quran/10#v13) _And We destroyed many generations before you when they transgressed; although Messengers came to them before with clear Signs, but they refused to believe. Thus We punished the guilty people._

[UB 166:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p1_5) _When Jesus would have risen to depart, one of the lawyers who was at the table, addressing him, said: “But, Master, in some of your statements you reproach us also. Is there nothing good in the scribes, the Pharisees, or the lawyers?” And Jesus, standing, replied to the lawyer: “You, like the Pharisees, delight in the first places at the feasts and in wearing long robes while you put heavy burdens, grievous to be borne, on men’s shoulders. And when the souls of men stagger under these heavy burdens, you will not so much as lift with one of your fingers. Woe upon you who take your greatest delight in building tombs for the prophets your fathers killed! And that you consent to what your fathers did is made manifest when you now plan to kill those who come in this day doing what the prophets did in their day—proclaiming the righteousness of God and revealing the mercy of the heavenly Father. But of all the generations that are past, the blood of the prophets and the apostles shall be required of this perverse and self-righteous generation. Woe upon all of you lawyers who have taken away the key of knowledge from the common people! You yourselves refuse to enter into the way of truth, and at the same time you would hinder all others who seek to enter therein. But you cannot thus shut up the doors of the kingdom of heaven; these we have opened to all who have the faith to enter, and these portals of mercy shall not be closed by the prejudice and arrogance of false teachers and untrue shepherds who are like whited sepulchres which, while outwardly they appear beautiful, are inwardly full of dead men’s bones and all manner of spiritual uncleanness.”_

[UB 175:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/175#p1_4) _“My Father has long dealt in mercy with this people. Generation after generation have we sent our prophets to teach and warn them, and generation after generation have they killed these heaven-sent teachers. And now do your willful high priests and stubborn rulers go right on doing this same thing. As Herod brought about the death of John, you likewise now make ready to destroy the Son of Man._

[UB 175:1.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/175#p1_22) _“But even now I offer you in my Father’s name mercy and forgiveness; even now I proffer the loving hand of eternal fellowship. My Father has sent you the wise men and the prophets; some you have persecuted and others you have killed. Then appeared John proclaiming the coming of the Son of Man, and him you destroyed after many had believed his teaching. And now you make ready to shed more innocent blood. Do you not comprehend that a terrible day of reckoning will come when the Judge of all the earth shall require of this people an accounting for the way they have rejected, persecuted, and destroyed these messengers of heaven? Do you not understand that you must account for all of this righteous blood, from the first prophet killed down to the times of Zechariah, who was slain between the sanctuary and the altar? And if you go on in your evil ways, this accounting may be required of this very generation._

[Quran 7-35](/en/book/Islam/Quran/7#v35) _O Children of Adam! If Messengers come to you from among yourselves, explaining My Signs to you, then know that whoever fears God and does righteous deeds, fear will not overtake them, nor will they grieve._

[Quran 7-43](/en/book/Islam/Quran/7#v43) Rivers will flow beneath them. They will say, “Praise belongs to God who has guided us thus far. We would not have found guidance had not God guided us. The Messengers of Our Lord have indeed brought the truth. And it will be proclaimed to them, ‘This is Heaven which has been given to you as an inheritance as a reward for what you did.’”

[Quran 7-61, 62](/en/book/Islam/Quran/7#v61) _He said: “O my people! There is no error in me, for I am the Messenger of the Lord of the worlds.”_

_I convey to you the messages of my Lord and give you my most sincere advice, since I know from God what you do not know._

[Quran 8-64, 65](/en/book/Islam/Quran/8#v64) _O Prophet! God is sufficient for you and for those who follow you from among the believers._

_O Prophet! Urge the believers to battle. If there were twenty of you who persevered, they would be able to overcome two hundred; if there were a hundred of you, they would overcome a thousand of the disbelievers, for they are a people who do not understand._

[UB 155:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p6_2) _... Our Father did indeed speak through Moses, Elijah, Isaiah, Amos, and Hosea, but he did not cease to minister words of truth to the world when these prophets of old made an end of their utterances. My Father is no respecter of races or generations in that the word of truth is vouchsafed one age and withheld from another. Commit not the folly of calling that divine which is wholly human, and fail not to discern the words of truth which come not through the traditional oracles of supposed inspiration._

[Quran 9-128](/en/book/Islam/Quran/9#v128) _Indeed, a Messenger has come to you from among yourselves; it is painful for him that you suffer misfortune; he desires your well-being; and he is compassionate and merciful to the believers._

## PARABLE OF THE WEDDINGS

[Quran 11-57](/en/book/Islam/Quran/11#v57) _“But if you turn away, I have conveyed to you that with which I was sent to you, and my Lord will raise up another people in your place. You cannot harm him in any way. Indeed, my Lord is the Guardian of all things.”_

[Matthew 22-1,14](/en/Bible/Matthew/22#v1) _Jesus answered and spoke to them again in parables, saying:_

2 _The kingdom of heaven is like a king who gave a wedding feast for his son._

3 _and he sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the wedding, but they refused to come._

4 _Again he sent other servants, saying, Tell those who are invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings have been killed, and everything is ready. Come to the marriage._

5 _But they, without paying attention, went away, one to his farm, and another to his merchandise._

6 _and others, taking the servants, insulted them and killed them._

7 _When the king heard this, he was furious, and he sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city._

8 _Then he said to his servants, “The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.”_

9 _Go therefore to the highways, and invite to the wedding as many as you find._

10 _And the servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all whom they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was filled with guests._

11 _And the king came in to see the guests, and he saw there a man who was not wearing wedding clothes._

12 _And he said to him, Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes? But he remained silent._

13 _Then the king said to the attendants, Bind him hand and foot, and cast him into the outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth._

14 _For many are called, but few are chosen._

[UB 173:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/173#p5_2) _“The kingdom of heaven may be likened to a certain king who made a marriage feast for his son and dispatched messengers to call those who had previously been invited to the feast to come, saying, ‘Everything is ready for the marriage supper at the king’s palace.’ Now, many of those who had once promised to attend, at this time refused to come. When the king heard of these rejections of his invitation, he sent other servants and messengers, saying: ‘Tell all those who were bidden, to come, for, behold, my dinner is ready. My oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all is in readiness for the celebration of the forthcoming marriage of my son.’ But again did the thoughtless make light of this call of their king, and they went their ways, one to the farm, another to the pottery, and others to their merchandise. Still others were not content thus to slight the king’s call, but in open rebellion they laid hands on the king’s messengers and shamefully mistreated them, even killing some of them. And when the king perceived that his chosen guests, even those who had accepted his preliminary invitation and had promised to attend the wedding feast, had finally rejected his call and in rebellion had assaulted and slain his chosen messengers, he was exceedingly wroth. And then this insulted king ordered out his armies and the armies of his allies and instructed them to destroy these rebellious murderers and to burn down their city._

[UB 173:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/173#p5_3) _“And when he had punished those who spurned his invitation, he appointed yet another day for the wedding feast and said to his messengers: ‘They who were first bidden to the wedding were not worthy; so go now into the parting of the ways and into the highways and even beyond the borders of the city, and as many as you shall find, bid even these strangers to come in and attend this wedding feast.’ And then these servants went out into the highways and the out-of-the-way places, and they gathered together as many as they found, good and bad, rich and poor, so that at last the wedding chamber was filled with willing guests. When all was ready, the king came in to view his guests, and much to his surprise he saw there a man without a wedding garment. The king, since he had freely provided wedding garments for all his guests, addressing this man, said: ‘Friend, how is it that you come into my guest chamber on this occasion without a wedding garment?’ And this unprepared man was speechless. Then said the king to his servants: ‘Cast out this thoughtless guest from my house to share the lot of all the others who have spurned my hospitality and rejected my call. I will have none here except those who delight to accept my invitation, and who do me the honor to wear those guest garments so freely provided for all.’”_

[Quran 14-10](/en/book/Islam/Quran/14#v10) _His Messengers said: “Do you have any doubt about God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth? He calls you together to forgive your sins and grant you respite until a fixed time.” They replied: “You are only men like us; you want us to turn away from what our fathers used to worship. So bring us clear proof.”_

## MESSENGER ANGELS

[Quran 15-8](/en/book/Islam/Quran/15#v8) _We do not send angels except with the truth, and then no respite is granted to them._

[Quran 16-36](/en/book/Islam/Quran/16#v36) _And We raised up from every people a Messenger, who preached: “Worship God and reject the Evil One” ..._

[Quran 17:94-96](/en/book/Islam/Quran/17#v94). What has prevented people from believing when the Way has come to them except that they said, “Has God sent a mortal as a Messenger?”

95 _Say: “If the angels had walked on the earth as if it were their dwelling place, then We would certainly have sent down to them an angel from heaven as a Messenger.”_

96 _Say: “God is sufficient as a witness between me and you. Surely He is well aware of His servants and sees them well.”_

[Quran 17:105](/en/book/Islam/Quran/17#v105) _It is with the truth that We have sent down (this Quran, embodying the truth and forever invulnerable to falsehood), and it is with the truth that it has come down. We have not sent you except as a bearer of glad tidings (of prosperity in return for faith and righteousness) and a warner (against the evil consequences of misguidance)._

## ZECHARIAH

[Quran 19:2-11](/en/book/Islam/Quran/19#v2) _A mention of the Mercy of your Lord towards His servant Zachariah._

3 _When he called upon his Lord in secret,_

4 _Saying: "My Lord! My bones have become weak and my hair shines with gray from old age and, my Lord, I have never been deprived and wretched in my supplication to You._

5 _I am worried about (how) my relatives (will act regarding the continuation of my mission and the protection of Maria's future), and my wife is barren. So grant me a successor of Your grace._

6 _Whoever is my heir (in my duty) and heir (of the right path) of the Family of Jacob; and make him, my Lord, someone with whom You are pleased._

7 _(The angels called him in the Name of God:) “O Zechariah! We give you the good news of a son whose name will be Yahya (John). No one before him has been given that name.”_

8 _He said, “My lord, how can I have a son, since my wife is barren and I am well along in age?”_

9 _The angel replied, mentioning God: “So be it. Your Lord says: ‘It is easy for Me, since I once created you from nothing.’”_

10 _Zechariah pleaded, “My Lord! Give me a clear sign.” God said, “Your sign is that you will not be able to speak to anyone for three nights.”_

11 _So he appeared to his people from the sanctuary and indicated to them (by signs): “Glorify your Lord in the morning and in the evening.”_

## BIRTH OF JESUS

[Quran 19:19-22](/en/book/Islam/Quran/19#v19) He replied: “I am only a Messenger from your Lord, to grant you a righteous son.”

20 _She said, “How could I have a child since no man has touched me, nor have I ever lost my chastity?”_

21 _He said (referring to God): So be it. Your Lord says: “It is easy for Me; and (you will have a child) so that We may make him a sign for human beings (of Our Power because of his birth) and a mercy from Us (because he is a Messenger). It is a matter already decreed.”_

22 So she conceived him and went with him to a distant place.

[UB 122:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p3_1) _One evening about sundown, before Joseph had returned home, Gabriel appeared to Mary by the side of a low stone table and, after she had recovered her composure, said: “I come at the bidding of one who is my Master and whom you shall love and nurture. To you, Mary, I bring glad tidings when I announce that the conception within you is ordained by heaven, and that in due time you will become the mother of a son; you shall call him Joshua, and he shall inaugurate the kingdom of heaven on earth and among men. Speak not of this matter save to Joseph and to Elizabeth, your kinswoman, to whom I have also appeared, and who shall presently also bear a son, whose name shall be John, and who will prepare the way for the message of deliverance which your son shall proclaim to men with great power and deep conviction. And doubt not my word, Mary, for this home has been chosen as the mortal habitat of the child of destiny. My benediction rests upon you, the power of the Most Highs will strengthen you, and the Lord of all the earth shall overshadow you.”_

## ANGELS AND MEN

[Quran 22:75](/en/book/Islam/Quran/22#v75) _God chooses the Messengers from among the angels [Messengers of the Universe (heaven)] as well as from among human beings (so they are all created beings who have no part in Divinity at all). Surely God is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing._

[UB 113:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p2_5) _The angels develop an abiding affection for their human associates; and you would, if you could only visualize the seraphim, develop a warm affection for them. Divested of material bodies, given spirit forms, you would be very near the angels in many attributes of personality. They share most of your emotions and experience some additional ones. The only emotion actuating you which is somewhat difficult for them to comprehend is the legacy of animal fear that bulks so large in the mental life of the average inhabitant of Urantia. The angels really find it hard to understand why you will so persistently allow your higher intellectual powers, even your religious faith, to be so dominated by fear, so thoroughly demoralized by the thoughtless panic of dread and anxiety._

## CLARIFICATION OF THOSE WHO HAVE COME

[Quran 24, 34](/en/book/Islam/Quran/24#v34) _Indeed, We have sent down to you Revelations that clearly demonstrate the truth and illuminate your path, and examples (of the stories) of those before you, and an instruction for the pious devotees._

[Quran 30:47](/en/book/Islam/Quran/30#v47) _Indeed, We sent before you (O Messenger, other) Messengers, each to his own people, and they came to them with clear proofs (of the truth of the Oneness and Sovereignty of God). So, We avenge those disbelievers who are engaged in accumulating sin. We have obligated Ourselves to save the believers._

[Quran 32:5-6](/en/book/Islam/Quran/32#v5) _He directs the matter from Heaven to Earth; then the matter ascends to Him in a day, which is a thousand years according to your reckoning._

6 _He is the Knower of the Unseen (of all that is beyond sense perception) and the witnessed (the perceived realm), the Glorious possessor of irresistible power, the Compassionate._

[Quran 36:15-17](/en/book/Islam/Quran/36#v15) They said, “You are only mortals like us. The Merciful has never sent down anything (through the Book, as you claim). You utter nothing but lies.”

16 _(The Messengers) said: "Our Lord knows that we are indeed Messengers sent to you._

17 _And it is only our concern to transmit (the Message of God) completely and clearly (we do not force faith)»._

[Quran 40:78](/en/book/Islam/Quran/40#v78) _Indeed, We sent Messengers before you; among them are those We have mentioned to you, and among them are those We have not mentioned. It is not fitting for a Messenger to perform a miracle except by God's permission. Then, when God's command is issued, it is judged with truth and justice, and those who invent lies (who attribute partners to God and strive to refute the truth) will lose and be ruined._

[UB 176:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_3) _... And when the kingdom shall have come to its full fruition, be assured that the Father in heaven will not fail to visit you with an enlarged revelation of truth and an enhanced demonstration of righteousness, even as he has already bestowed upon this world him who became the prince of darkness, and then Adam, who was followed by Melchizedek, and in these days, the Son of Man. And so will my Father continue to manifest his mercy and show forth his love, even to this dark and evil world. So also will I, after my Father has invested me with all power and authority, continue to follow your fortunes and to guide in the affairs of the kingdom by the presence of my spirit, who shall shortly be poured out upon all flesh. Even though I shall thus be present with you in spirit, I also promise that I will sometime return to this world, where I have lived this life in the flesh and achieved the experience of simultaneously revealing God to man and leading man to God. Very soon must I leave you and take up the work the Father has intrusted to my hands, but be of good courage, for I will sometime return. In the meantime, my Spirit of the Truth of a universe shall comfort and guide you._

## THE FATHER INSPIRES

[Quran 42, 3-5](/en/book/Islam/Quran/42#v3) _So He reveals to you just as He made those before you, God, the Glorious, the Most Powerful, the All-Knowing._

4 _His belongs everything in the heavens and everything on the earth. And He is the Exalted, the Great._

5 _The heavens are about to be rent asunder from above them (because of the majesty of the Revelation); and the angels glorify their Lord with their praise, and pray for (that He establish a way of guidance for) those on Earth, and for forgiveness (for those who follow Him). Beware! There is no doubt that God is the One Who is Forgiving, Compassionate._

## The Gift of Revelation

[Quran 42:27](/en/book/Islam/Quran/42#v27) If God had always provided for His servants in great abundance, they would surely have exceeded all the limits on earth; but He sends in due measure as He wills. Indeed, He is fully aware of His servants and sees them well.

[UB 92:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p4_1) _Revelation is evolutionary but always progressive. Down through the ages of a world’s history, the revelations of religion are ever-expanding and successively more enlightening. It is the mission of revelation to sort and censor the successive religions of evolution. But if revelation is to exalt and upstep the religions of evolution, then must such divine visitations portray teachings which are not too far removed from the thought and reactions of the age in which they are presented. Thus must and does revelation always keep in touch with evolution. Always must the religion of revelation be limited by man’s capacity of receptivity._

_But regardless of their apparent connections or derivations, revealed religions are always characterized by a belief in some Deity of final value and in some concept of the survival of personality identity after death._

[UB 155:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p6_2) _.... Our Father did indeed speak through Moses, Elijah, Isaiah, Amos, and Hosea, but he did not cease to minister words of truth to the world when these prophets of old made an end of their utterances. My Father is no respecter of races or generations in that the word of truth is vouchsafed one age and withheld from another. Commit not the folly of calling that divine which is wholly human, and fail not to discern the words of truth which come not through the traditional oracles of supposed inspiration._

[UB 176:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_3) _... The things which you now look down upon are coming to an end, but this will be a new beginning out of which the gospel of the kingdom will go to all the world and this salvation will spread to all peoples. And when the kingdom shall have come to its full fruition, be assured that the Father in heaven will not fail to visit you with an enlarged revelation of truth and an enhanced demonstration of righteousness, even as he has already bestowed upon this world him who became the prince of darkness, and then Adam, who was followed by Melchizedek, and in these days, the Son of Man. And so will my Father continue to manifest his mercy and show forth his love, even to this dark and evil world. So also will I, after my Father has invested me with all power and authority, continue to follow your fortunes and to guide in the affairs of the kingdom by the presence of my spirit, who shall shortly be poured out upon all flesh. Even though I shall thus be present with you in spirit, I also promise that I will sometime return to this world, where I have lived this life in the flesh and achieved the experience of simultaneously revealing God to man and leading man to God. Very soon must I leave you and take up the work the Father has intrusted to my hands, but be of good courage, for I will sometime return. In the meantime, my Spirit of the Truth of a universe shall comfort and guide you._

[UB 176:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_5) _“But the times of the reappearing of the Son of Man are known only in the councils of Paradise; not even the angels of heaven know when this will occur. However, you should understand that, when this gospel of the kingdom shall have been proclaimed to all the world for the salvation of all peoples, and when the fullness of the age has come to pass, the Father will send you another dispensational bestowal, or else the Son of Man will return to adjudge the age._

## GOD WILL WIN WITH HIS MESSENGERS

[Quran 3:79](/en/book/Islam/Quran/3#v79) _It cannot be conceived that God would bestow upon a human being the Book, authority with righteousness and sound judgment, as well as the Prophetic Mission, and then say to the people: “Be servants to Me apart from God.” Rather, He would say: “Be pure and totally dedicated servants of the Lord by teaching the Book and studying it.”_

[Quran 46:9](/en/book/Islam/Quran/46#v9) _I am not the first (either in my person or in the message I have brought) among the Messengers, and (being a human being) I do not know (unless God informs me) what (will happen in the future in the world and, therefore, what) will be done to me and to you. I follow only that which is revealed to me, and I am only a manifest warner._

[Quran 46:23](/en/book/Islam/Quran/46#v23) _He said: “The knowledge (of when they will come) is with God alone. I convey to you that with which I have been sent as a Messenger, but I see that you are a people acting ignorantly.”_

[Quran 48:26-28](/en/book/Islam/Quran/48#v26) _When those disbelievers were harboring in their hearts a fierce fanaticism (arising from self-worship, tribalism, and enmity), the fanaticism specific to the Age of Ignorance, God sent down His (gift of) inner peace and consolation upon His Messenger and the believers, and united them to the Word of faith, piety, and reverence for God. They were the most worthy of it and deserved it most. And God possesses full knowledge of all things._

27 _God has undoubtedly confirmed the vision for His Messenger as true (and will undoubtedly fulfill it) in reality: you will indeed enter the Sacred Mosque, God willing, in utmost security, with your heads shaved or your hair cropped, and you will have nothing to fear. But He always knows what you do not know, and (therefore, without allowing you to enter the Mosque this year) He has granted you a near victory before this._

28 _He it is Who has sent His Messenger with Divine guidance and the Religion of truth, that He may make it prevail over all religions. God is sufficient as a witness (to the truth of His promise and the mission of His Messenger)._

[Quran 49, 6-8](/en/book/Islam/Quran/49#v6) _O you who believe! If any transgressor brings you news (requiring action), then verify it carefully (before you believe and act upon it), lest you in ignorance harm a people and then regret what you have done._

7 _Always consider that the Messenger of God is among you (so that you have a duty to refer decisions to him). If he were to follow you in many matters of public concern, you would certainly be in trouble (and suffer loss). But God has made faith (O believers) beloved to you (and beautified it so that it may appear attractive to your hearts), and He has made disbelief, transgression, and rebellion detestable to you. Such are the rightly guided (in belief, thought, and action)._

8 _As a grace from God and as a favor. God is Omniscient, Omniscient._

[Quran 57:25](/en/book/Islam/Quran/57#v25) _We have certainly sent Our Messengers with clear truths (and clear proofs that they are Messengers), and We have sent down with them the Book and the Balance, that (relations between) human beings may live in equity. And We have sent down iron in which is severe power and benefits for mankind, so that God may distinguish those who help (the cause of) God and His Messengers, even though they do not see Him. Surely God is Mighty, Glorious, Possessor of irresistible power._

[Quran 58:21](/en/book/Islam/Quran/58#v21) _God has decreed: “I will surely prevail, I and My Messengers.” Surely God is the Mighty, the Glorious, the possessor of irresistible power._

## AUTHORITY AND POWER

[Quran 59:6-7](/en/book/Islam/Quran/59#v6) _As for what God bestowed upon His Messenger as spoils of war, and you did not spur any horse or camel thereto, but God gives His Messenger dominion over whomever He wills. God possesses complete authority over all things._

7 _That which God has given to His Messenger as spoils of war from the people of the nations: (a fifth) It belongs to God, and to the Messenger, and to his near relatives, orphans, the destitute, and the travelers (who lack the means to continue a journey), lest it become a circulating fortune among the rich among you. Whatever the Messenger gives you, accept it gladly, and whatever he forbids you, abstain from it. Turn away from disobedience to God in worship of Him and piety. Surely God is stern in punishment._

## GABRIEL

[Quran 19:64](/en/book/Islam/Quran/19#v64) _(In response to a gap in the coming of Revelation, Gabriel explained:) “We do not descend except by the commandment of your Lord. To Him belongs whatever is before us and whatever is behind us and whatever is between (of all time, space, and whatever we do at all times and places). And your Lord is never forgetful (so do not fear that He might forget you).”_

[Quran 64:12](/en/book/Islam/Quran/64#v12) _Obey God and the Messenger. If you deviate (from that command), then only is it upon Our Messenger to convey the Message fully and clearly._

[Quran 65:11](/en/book/Islam/Quran/65#v11) _(And as his incarnation, He has also sent to you) a Messenger reciting to you (and thus conveying) the Signs and Revelations of God that make the truth clear and illuminate your path, so that He may lead you out of every kind of darkness into the Light, and keep you firm therein. Whoever believes (truly and sincerely) in God and does good and righteous deeds will admit him to Gardens through which rivers flow, therein they will abide forever. God has indeed granted him an excellent provision (such as faith and good deeds in this world and Paradise in the Hereafter)._

12 _God is He Who created the seven Heavens and the Earth like unto them; His commands (concerning creation and its operation, and the life of the inhabitants of the Heavens and the Earth) descend upon them, so that they may know with certainty that surely God possesses full power over all things, and that God verily encompasses all things in (His) Knowledge._
