There are “lives” made for experimenting,
There are “nights” made for escape,
There are “rains” made for crying,
There are “ifs” just to doubt,

And this to love you,
But only if I can love.

There are “worst” for best,
There are “flees” to the interior,
There are “harms” to the outside world,
There are “enjoyments” for every labor,

And this to love you,
But only if I can love.

He is a “Father” for the feminine,
He is a “Mother” for the masculine,
They go “in pairs” for the child,
Let's not forget anything if you don't mind,

And this to love,
But only if I can love.

And, this,

To love each other,
Only if I know how to love.

Eric Iannucci
