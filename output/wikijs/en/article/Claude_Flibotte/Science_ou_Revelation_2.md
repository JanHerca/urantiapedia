Claude Flibotte Quebec

August 2021

> Claude Flibotte is the author of a very well-documented study entitled “The Evolution of Life on Earth”. It is based on solid archaeological documentation augmented by the facts that the authors of the _Urantia Book_ reveal to us.
> 
> It contains a number of geographical maps, photos and drawings illustrating in a playful way a study which, usually, remains quite austere. You will find it at the following address: https://www. urantia-quebec.ca/publications/textes-deslecteurs (two-thirds of the way down the web page)

My attention was drawn to a file from the journal Science \& Vie from July 2021 entitled: “The truth about the genetic history of France and our regions...”. Since my ancestors arrived in Quebec in 1656 on my mother's side, then around 1670 on my father's side, from France, my interest in reading this file was assured. Although very interesting, my disappointment grew as the author's words progressed. I will summarize the content of his article for you. According to him, there are four major genetic influences and some regional particularities in the French genome. Initially, he admits that there were archaic humans in France whose tools were found to be more than 1.2 million years old, but, still according to him, the true French genetic history begins with the arrival of foreigners from Africa.

## THE FIRST INFUBENCE

These foreigners, they identify them as being Homo heidelbergensis arriving from Africa, they spread to Europe 800,000 years ago. They would be the ancestors of the Neanderthals. According to his opinion, the French would have 2% in their DNA of genetic sequences of Neanderthal man.

## THE SECOND INFUBENCE

</figure>

Still according to the author, Homo Sapiens, modern man would have been born in Africa 300,000 years ago. He would have emigrated to Europe 70,000 years ago to finally arrive in France from the Near East 40,000 years ago. They are hunter-gatherers. The DNA of the French would contain on average 10% of sequences of this modern man.

<br style=“clear:both;”/>

## THE THIRD INFUBENCE

This third influence is indicated by the arrival, 7000 years ago from Anatolia in the Near East, of farmers who mingled generously with the French people. Thus, 49% of French DNA sequences would be attributable to them.

## THE FOURTH INFUBENCE

This last influence would be due, around 4900 years ago, to the arrival of nomads from the Eurasian steppes located north of the Black Sea. According to the author, in the DNA of the French there persists on average 39% of sequences from Eurasian nomads.

Conclusions according to the author of this file

So, if I add up what my body inherited from my ancestors, I would be made up of 2% Heidelberg man, 10% Homo Sapiens, 49% farmer from the Near East and 39% nomads from the steppes north of the Black Sea.

Let us compare his study with the revelation of the _Urantia Book_

According to the revelators, the history of humanity begins on the west coast of the Mesopotamian peninsula (now submerged) with the birth of the first two humans, Andon and Fonta, 993,419 years before the year 1934 of the Christian era (<a id="a84_238"></a>[UB 62:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p4_3). They come from a long lineage which can be described as follows: a sudden evolution of the descendants of the ancient North American lemurs gave rise to the mammalian precursors of man who had as descendants the intermediate mammals later giving rise to the lineage of primates, then finally to true man.

It should be noted that the revelators, in their evolutionary description of human ancestry, emphasize only the lineage that led to the appearance of man. After the appearance of Andon and Fonta, no less than seven thousand favorable lineages evolved that could have reached certain human types of development, some of which were later assimilated into the different branches of the human species (<a id="a86_398"></a>[UB 65:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p3_4)).

In short, these Andonites continued until their twenty-seventh generation where they did not disperse very far in Asia and Africa, but especially in Europe towards France and the British Isles (<a id="a88_194"></a>[UB 63:5.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p5_1)).

950,000 years ago, at the time of the third glaciation, they were settled in England in the west and had reached Java in the east and even Tasmania. This migration had the unfortunate consequence that some of these Andonites, especially those going east, degenerated by mixing with the simian races of the south (<a id="a90_313"></a>[UB 64:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p2_1)).

Around 900,000 years ago, degenerate individuals moved up from southern France to England, degrading the Andonites along the way. They were followed throughout Europe by a prolific and somewhat superior race, the Heidelberg race. Two centers of Andonites persisted in the traditions of Andon and the culture of Onagar, an ancient Andonite sage. The first, the people of Foxhall in England, migrated westward and became the ancestors of the Eskimos. The second center, the tribes of Badonan, a great-great-grandson of Andon, was located in northwest India (<a id="a92_556"></a>[UB 64:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p2_4)).

Long story short, these Badonan tribes went to war with the degenerates of their region 850,000 years ago. This campaign resulted in a slight improvement of the hill tribes and the mixture of these Badonites became the Neanderthal race (<a id="a94_237"></a>[UB 64:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p3_5)). They were great travelers, starting from their lands in northwest India, they spread east into China and west to France and even North Africa (<a id="a94_424"></a>[UB 64:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p4_1)). For nearly a million years they prospered, but made little progress culturally and spiritually.

500,000 years ago, another race war of the Badonite tribes of the northwestern highlands of India broke out, as a result of which, more than a hundred years later, only about a hundred families, the most intelligent, remained (<a id="a96_227"></a>[UB 64:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p5_1)). Suddenly, a couple from one of these families gave birth to nineteen exceptionally intelligent children. This was the Sangik family, the ancestors of the six colored races of Urantia (<a id="a96_455"></a>[UB 64:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p5_2)). Five were red, two orange, four yellow, two green, four blue and two indigo. Through unions with members of their tribe, their descendants tended to take on the skin color of their Sangik ancestor (<a id="a96_697"></a>[UB 64:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p5_3)). It was also at this time that our Planetary Prince and his staff arrived.

These six colored races dispersed all over the planet and their adventure is told to you in booklet 64:7. Basically, the red man headed east into Asia then crossed the Bering Strait into America. The yellow man followed the red man driving him out of Asia and established himself there. A red and yellow mixture, the brown man drifted south into the islands. The blue man migrated west into Europe. The orange man followed the Mediterranean coastline towards Africa where he was exterminated by the green man who followed him. The green man was partly absorbed and eliminated by the indigo man who took possession of Africa and remained there.

To the Andonite race and the six colored races must be included the Nodites and the Adamites, all these races constituting a joyous mixture which is distinguished today by three great subdivisions, the Caucasoids, the Mongoloids and the Negroids (81:4.11-13).

## Conclusion

By comparison between the hypotheses of science and the revelations contained in The Urantia Book, there is a gap that persists between the two accounts of human history. Scientific research is absolutely valid and desirable, but its great handicap is that it works from scattered fragments of our history and desperately tries to recreate the whole with hypotheses, perceptions, intuitions that are more or less valid and change according to the most recent discoveries.

The story told by the revelators is told by those who initiated, shaped, observed and guided it. They were there from the beginning and are infallible witnesses to its unfolding. They are still among us, moreover, they are our cosmic brothers!

I have an analogy to offer you! The history of humanity is like a big puzzle with a thousand pieces. The revelators have an overview of this puzzle. They even perceive the future of its expansion. Scientists work on the same puzzle, but they have only a few dozen pieces with which they try to reconstruct the whole picture. Why don't they look at the picture on the lid of the box (The Urantia Book), and then try, from the pieces they have, to correctly and tangibly reconstruct our great history? We would discover there one and the same great family, the Urantia cosmic family!
