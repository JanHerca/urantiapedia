We know from the revelators that our dear blue planet is a decimal planet (<a id="a44_75"></a>[UB 58:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/58#p0_1)). This means, as you probably know, that on every tenth planet where the Life Carriers implant life, it is the subject of new models of mechanical, chemical and electrical mobilization (<a id="a44_303"></a>[UB 57:8.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p8_8)) that is to say new forms of life with the aim of developing possible improvements.

## Failures

Obviously, since we live in an experiential universe that is not yet perfect, failures in attempts to improve life are possible. Among the failures that have occurred on Urantia, we can mention certain bacteria and fungi. The former have changed little since the early dawn of life and even show a certain degree of regression in their parasitic behavior. In the case of fungi, many of them show retrograde movement because they have lost their ability to produce chlorophyll and have become parasitic <a id="a48_502"></a>[UB 65:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p2_3)

The amoeba and its protozoan cousins have hardly changed since the beginning of life; they are considered a failure by the Carriers of Life, having failed to evolve (<a id="a50_166"></a>[UB 65:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p2_4)).

Single-celled animals of primitive types associated in colonies, like the volvox, and later like the jellyfish. Thousands of species appeared and then disappeared during these ancient ages. All these specimens were non-progressive. Even the family of fish, animals from the evolutionary point of view, remained stationary ( <a id="a52_324"></a>[UB 65:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p2_5) ).

From the fish emerged the frog and the salamander. The frog will inaugurate the series of differentiations which will culminate later with the appearance of man, but it will not succeed in progressing and remains stationary today ( <a id="a54_232"></a>[UB 65:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p2_7) ). The frogs gave birth to the reptiles, almost extinct today, but also to the birds and the mammals ( <a id="a54_377"></a>[UB 65:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p2_8) ). The reptiles of today are represented by four branches, two non-progressive, the lizards, the snakes, the alligators and the turtles; one partially progressive, the birds; the fourth represents the ancestors of the mammals ( <a id="a54_647"></a>[UB 65:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p2_10) ).

**Around -140 million years**, placenta-less mammals appeared. They represented an experimental effort to improve mammal types, but they ultimately proved to be a failure (<a id="a56_172"></a>[UB 60:1.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/60#p1_11)).

In the final analysis, fourteen phyla (evolutionary series of forms) appeared on Urantia, the last of which was the fishes. Since the birds and mammals, no new classes have developed (<a id="a58_184"></a>[UB 65:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p2_11)).

Of the three original life implantations, that of the eastern group did not have the capacity to reach the prehuman status of intelligence caused by losses of the highest types of its germinal plasm, so the Life Carriers manipulated the surrounding environment to circumscribe these unfit lineages until their total elimination (<a id="a60_329"></a>[UB 65:2.13-14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p2_13)).

**110 million years ago**, under the enormous pressure of carnivorous dinosaurs, two species took refuge in the sea to survive. They represent a step backward in evolution. Some lineages are stationary while others return to a previous state like the sea serpents (<a id="a62_265"></a>[UB 60:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/60#p2_10) 60:2.ro). Two other lineages took refuge in the air. These flying pterosaurs did not succeed in evolving as aerial navigators, they disappeared (<a id="a62_454"></a>[UB 60:2.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/60#p2_12)).

## Successes

From frogs emerged reptiles, one of the four branches mentioned above of which gave rise to the ancestors of mammals (<a id="a66_118"></a>[UB 65:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p2_10)).

From a small, agile, carnivorous reptilian dinosaur with a relatively large brain, placental mammals emerged. These new mammals developed rapidly in different ways into modern forms, but also into marine types such as whales and seals, and into aerial types such as bats (<a id="a68_272"></a>[UB 65:2.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p2_12)).

A great success concerns the chemical mechanism of repairing injured cells and multiplying healthy cells (<a id="a70_106"></a>[UB 65:4.3-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p4_3)).

Two other successes were the appearance of the Andonic race and the six Sangik races within one family (<a id="a72_104"></a>[UB 65:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p4_7)). The Andonic race represents the efforts of the Life Carriers to produce an early manifestation of the human will (<a id="a72_262"></a>[UB 65:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p4_11)). The second characteristic concerns the six colored races. Usually they appear one by one from prehuman forms over a long period of time. A long time passes for these colored men to attain the human will. On Urantia, the human will had existed since the first two Andonites nearly half a million years ago.

Among the successes that are not specific to our planet, we can name the ability of plants to produce chlorophyll, and the transformation of the spore into a seed (<a id="a74_164"></a>[UB 65:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p6_3)). We can also highlight the ability of iron to play the dual role of oxygen transporter, and carbon dioxide eliminator in blood cells (<a id="a74_341"></a>[UB 65:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p6_4)).

## The Ariadne's thread of the Urantian human lineage

Of the three settlements of life 550 million years ago (<a id="a78_56"></a>[UB 58:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/58#p4_2)), only the central or Eurasian-African and the western one including Greenland and the Americas really contributed to the emergence of man.

The primordial protoplasm (<a id="a80_27"></a>[UB 65:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p6_8)) in the form of primitive marine algae (65:2.I) passed through a transitional form towards the frontier of animal life, 450 million years ago (<a id="a80_212"></a>[UB 58:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/58#p6_1) and <a id="a80_258"></a>[UB 65:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p2_2)). Sponges are the survivors of one of these types. Amoebas, a unicellular animal type, are part of this initial stage of animal life (<a id="a80_434"></a>[UB 59:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p1_1)).

400 million years ago, the first multicellular animals appeared, trilobites dominated the underwater world (<a id="a82_108"></a>[UB 59:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p1_4)) shared by various crustaceans, their modern successors (<a id="a82_207"></a>[UB 59:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p2_10)).

Arthropods, or crustaceans, were the ancestors of the first vertebrates (<a id="a84_73"></a>[UB 59:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p4_10)).

Two of them transformed into what would become fish, true vertebrates around 250 million years ago (<a id="a86_100"></a>[UB 59:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p4_9)). From these arthropods emerged around 210 million years ago amphibians which invaded the mainland. Among them, frogs (<a id="a86_261"></a>[UB 59:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p5_6)).

**Around 170 million years ago**, pre-reptilian frogs appeared in Africa (<a id="a88_74"></a>[UB 59:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p6_8)). Then, 140 million years ago, true reptiles appeared (<a id="a88_171"></a>[UB 60:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/60#p1_9)).

**50 million years ago**, placental mammals appeared in North America, descended from a reptile ancestor, a small carnivorous dinosaur (<a id="a90_136"></a>[UB 61:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p1_2)).

**30 million years ago**, in western North America, the ancestors of the ancient lemurs appeared (<a id="a92_98"></a>[UB 61:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p2_10)). These lemur ancestors, ahead of other regions, were led to migrate across the Bering Bridge and along the southwest coast of Asia where they mixed with the lineages of the central group of life (<a id="a92_339"></a>[UB 62:1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p1) and <a id="a92_381"></a>[UB 65:2.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p2_15)).

**1,500,000 years ago**, the mammalian precursors of man emerged from the descendants of the ancient lemurs (<a id="a94_109"></a>[UB 61:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p6_1) and <a id="a94_155"></a>[UB 62:2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p2)). In their seventieth generation, a new group emerged, the intermediate mammals (6r:6.i and 62.3). During their third vital mutation, the latter gave birth to the primates (<a id="a94_366"></a>[UB 61:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p6_1) and <a id="a94_412"></a>[UB 62:4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p4)). From the higher primates emerged, approximately i million years ago, the first two primitive human beings (<a id="a94_559"></a>[UB 61:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p6_1) and <a id="a94_605"></a>[UB 62:5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p5)).

**Then, 500,000 years ago**, from the Andonic race emerged the six colored races (<a id="a96_82"></a>[UB 61:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p7_4) and <a id="a96_128"></a>[UB 64:5-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p5)). To these seven human races, we must add the Nodite races (<a id="a96_228"></a>[UB 67:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p4_2) and <a id="a96_274"></a>[UB 73:1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/73#p1)) and Adamic races (<a id="a96_331"></a>[UB 74:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p6_2)). This is a quick list of the common thread leading to the appearance of man.

## The determinant that reveals failure or success

For the Carriers of Life, the fact of having succeeded or failed is a matter of a single question: has the mechanism concerned adapted to its natural environment in a stable and viable manner while retaining its power of evolutionary adaptation? An original gift of adaptation is included in every living organism, if this gift is lost, this organism will prove to be a failure (<a id="a100_379"></a>[UB 65:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p6_2)). With the climatic changes that we have recently experienced, several forms of life have already disappeared or are on the verge of doing so! The study of the history of our planet reveals more than one extinction of life due to mainly climatic changes.

## Is the fifth epochal revelation a test?

Since we are a decimal planet, where new ideas can be tried to improve life for other planets, could it be possible that the fifth epochal revelation is also a test? Let me explain! Usually, on all normal planets the course of evolution, both physical, intellectual and spiritual, the revelation of the truth about the universe, its cosmology and the celestial hierarchy is gradually proclaimed as its inhabitants advance culturally, socially and religiously (see booklet 52). So, since we are a planet very backward in the normal course of things, giving us this fifth revelation exposing to us all or almost everything that the normal worlds have access to towards the age of light and life could be one more test on the part of our revelators to see how we get on with all this knowledge! If it turns out that beings as primitive as we are will manage to cope acceptably in the age to come, perhaps this knowledge will be disseminated more liberally to the other spheres populating the cosmos!

Our planet has already had more than one intervention outside the universe norms. In addition to being a decimal sphere (<a id="a106_121"></a>[UB 36:2.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p2_15)); we have been treated to a special nature of life patterns (<a id="a106_226"></a>[UB 65:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p7_3)); we have had a Melchizedek administration prior to the arrival of a Planetary Prince; then, the return of the Melchizedek administration after the failure of the Prince’s mission (<a id="a106_449"></a>[UB 67:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p6_5)); again, the same scenario is repeated after the failure of the mission of Adam and Eve, we have had the return of the Melchizedek administration (<a id="a106_638"></a>[UB 75:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p5_8) and <a id="a106_684"></a>[UB 93:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p0_2)); we have had an emergency mission with Machiventa Melchizedek (<a id="a106_790"></a>[UB 93:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p1_3)); in the sixth century before Christ, an exceptional coordination of spiritual factors provided Urantia with an unusual presentation of religious truth in multiple forms (94:6.I); we had a Son of bestowal well before the normal order was established (see booklet 52); we benefit from the administration of the group of twenty-four with its governor present on Urantia (<a id="a106_1201"></a>[UB 114:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p3_5)); finally, we received The Urantia Book. Clearly, our planet is proving to be an excellent candidate for experimenting with new means of expressing divinity! Could the great interest in studying our planetary history by cosmic students be linked, in addition to the bestowal of Michael of Nebadon, to these multiple breaches of the generally accepted rule and the means undertaken to bring our poor blue planet back on the right path?

**I'll leave you to ponder this question!**
