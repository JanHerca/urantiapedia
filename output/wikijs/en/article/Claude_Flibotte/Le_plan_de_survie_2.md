## The Survival Plan as detailed in The Urantia Book

### IV. Life in the flesh.

**1- The ascension during the “era of light and life”.**

By the time a world reaches the fourth stage of light and life, more than half of the mortals leave the planet by transference, rising out of the world of the living.

> The translated souls of the flowering ages of the settled spheres do not pass through the mansion worlds. Neither do they sojourn, as students, on the morontia worlds of the system or constellation. They do not pass through any of the earlier phases of morontia life. They are the only ascending mortals who so nearly escape the morontia transition from material existence to semispirit status. The initial experience of such Son-seized mortals in the ascension career is in the services of the progression worlds of the universe headquarters. And from these study worlds of Salvington they go back as teachers to the very worlds they passed by, subsequently going on inward to Paradise by the established route of mortal ascension. (<a id="a37_736"></a>[UB 55:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p2_9))

**2- Work of the Adjusters for the ascenders.**

When we awaken in the mansion world, despite the continuity of personal individuality, much of our mortal life will at first seem like a vague, foggy dream.

> The Thought Adjuster will recall and rehearse for you only those memories and experiences which are a part of, and essential to, your universe career. If the Adjuster has been a partner in the evolution of aught in the human mind, then will these worth-while experiences survive in the eternal consciousness of the Adjuster. But much of your past life and its memories, having neither spiritual meaning nor morontia value, will perish with the material brain; much of material experience will pass away as onetime scaffolding which, having bridged you over to the morontia level, no longer serves a purpose in the universe. But personality and the relationships between personalities are never scaffolding; mortal memory of personality relationships has cosmic value and will persist. On the mansion worlds you will know and be known, and more, you will remember, and be remembered by, your onetime associates in the short but intriguing life on Urantia. (<a id="a43_958"></a>[UB 112:5.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_22))

**3- The path to Paradise for mortal ascendants.**

From Urantia to Havona, the road will be long, but exciting. It will make us totally different beings from what we are currently.

> On Urantia you pass through a short and intense test during your initial life of material existence. On the mansion worlds and up through your system, constellation, and local universe, you traverse the morontia phases of ascension. On the training worlds of the superuniverse you pass through the true spirit stages of progression and are prepared for eventual transit to Havona. On the seven circuits of Havona your attainment is intellectual, spiritual, and experiential. And there is a definite task to be achieved on each of the worlds of each of these circuits. (<a id="a49_571"></a>[UB 14:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p5_1))

**4- Paradise, the destiny of all survivors.**

Heaven is the center of all creation, the source of all energies and the original place of origin of all personalities.

> After all, to mortals the most important thing about eternal Paradise is the fact that this perfect abode of the Universal Father is the real and far-distant destiny of the immortal souls of the mortal and material sons of God, the ascending creatures of the evolutionary worlds of time and space. Every God-knowing mortal who has espoused the career of doing the Father’s will has already embarked upon the long, long Paradise trail of divinity pursuit and perfection attainment. And when such an animal-origin being does stand, as countless numbers now do, before the Gods on Paradise, having ascended from the lowly spheres of space, such an achievement represents the reality of a spiritual transformation bordering on the limits of supremacy. (<a id="a55_751"></a>[UB 11:9.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/11#p9_8))

### V. The inevitabilities

**1- The life of evolving creatures is marked by inevitabilities.**

Human life is difficult and full of pitfalls, especially on Urantia, but we must maintain faith and trust in the love and goodness of our Paradise Father.

> The uncertainties of life and the vicissitudes of existence do not in any manner contradict the concept of the universal sovereignty of God. All evolutionary creature life is beset by certain *inevitabilities.* Consider the following:
>
> 1. Is *courage—*strength of character—desirable? Then must man be reared in an environment which necessitates grappling with hardships and reacting to disappointments.
>
> 2. Is *altruism—*service of one’s fellows—desirable? Then must life experience provide for encountering situations of social inequality.
>
> 3. Is *hope—*the grandeur of trust—desirable? Then human existence must constantly be confronted with insecurities and recurrent uncertainties.
>
> 4. Is *faith—*the supreme assertion of human thought—desirable? Then must the mind of man find itself in that troublesome predicament where it ever knows less than it can believe.
>
> 5. Is the *love of truth* and the willingness to go wherever it leads, desirable? Then must man grow up in a world where error is present and falsehood always possible.
>
> 6. Is *idealism—*the approaching concept of the divine—desirable? Then must man struggle in an environment of relative goodness and beauty, surroundings stimulative of the irrepressible reach for better things.
>
> 7. Is *loyalty—*devotion to highest duty—desirable? Then must man carry on amid the possibilities of betrayal and desertion. The valor of devotion to duty consists in the implied danger of default.
>
> 8. Is *unselfishness—*the spirit of self-forgetfulness—desirable? Then must mortal man live face to face with the incessant clamoring of an inescapable self for recognition and honor. Man could not dynamically choose the divine life if there were no self-life to forsake. Man could never lay saving hold on righteousness if there were no potential evil to exalt and differentiate the good by contrast.
>
> 9. Is *pleasure—*the satisfaction of happiness—desirable? Then must man live in a world where the alternative of pain and the likelihood of suffering are ever-present experiential possibilities.” [LU 3:5.5-14](/fr/The_Urantia_Book/3#p5_14)

> The creatures of Havona are naturally brave, but they are not courageous in the human sense. They are innately kind and considerate, but hardly altruistic in the human way. They are expectant of a pleasant future, but not hopeful in the exquisite manner of the trusting mortal of the uncertain evolutionary spheres. They have faith in the stability of the universe, but they are utter strangers to that saving faith whereby mortal man climbs from the status of an animal up to the portals of Paradise. They love the truth, but they know nothing of its soul-saving qualities. They are idealists, but they were born that way; they are wholly ignorant of the ecstasy of becoming such by exhilarating choice. They are loyal, but they have never experienced the thrill of wholehearted and intelligent devotion to duty in the face of temptation to default. They are unselfish, but they never gained such levels of experience by the magnificent conquest of a belligerent self. They enjoy pleasure, but they do not comprehend the sweetness of the pleasure escape from the pain potential. (<a id="a83_1083"></a>[UB 3:5.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p5_17))

**2- But this mortal man is a son of God.**

As soon as fusion with the Adjuster takes place, we will be numbered among the ascending sons, but until the final amalgamation of the surviving human soul with one of the eternal and immortal spirit types, the status of the mortals of time and space is that of faith sons of God.

> It is a solemn and supernal fact that such lowly and material creatures as Urantia human beings are the sons of God, faith children of the Highest. “Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God.” “As many as received him, to them gave he the power to recognize that they are the sons of God.” While “it does not yet appear what you shall be,” even now “you are the faith sons of God”; “for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the spirit of sonship, whereby you cry, ‘our Father.’” Spoke the prophet of old in the name of the eternal God: “Even to them will I give in my house a place and a name better than sons; I will give them an everlasting name, one that shall not be cut off.” “And because you are sons, God has sent forth the spirit of his Son into your hearts.” (<a id="a89_874"></a>[UB 40:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p6_2))

**3- The choice of survival is indomitable.**

Knowledge of God or religious consciousness is a universal reality, but, however valid (real) the religious experience may be, it must be open to intelligent criticism and reasonable philosophical interpretation.

> Eternal survival of personality is wholly dependent on the choosing of the mortal mind, whose decisions determine the survival potential of the immortal soul. When the mind believes God and the soul knows God, and when, with the fostering Adjuster, they all *desire* God, then is survival assured. Limitations of intellect, curtailment of education, deprivation of culture, impoverishment of social status, even inferiority of the human standards of morality resulting from the unfortunate lack of educational, cultural, and social advantages, cannot invalidate the presence of the divine spirit in such unfortunate and humanly handicapped but believing individuals. The indwelling of the Mystery Monitor constitutes the inception and insures the possibility of the potential of growth and survival of the immortal soul. (<a id="a95_824"></a>[UB 5:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p5_13))

### VI. The outpouring of Jesus

**1- Purpose of the outpouring of Jesus.**

The erroneous concept of Jesus coming to earth has prevailed for centuries, but here at last, in fact, is the true purpose.

> A Creator Son did not incarnate in the likeness of mortal flesh and bestow himself upon the humanity of Urantia to reconcile an angry God but rather to win all mankind to the recognition of the Father’s love and to the realization of their sonship with God. After all, even the great advocate of the atonement doctrine realized something of this truth, for he declared that “God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself.” (<a id="a103_431"></a>[UB 98:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/98#p7_1))


**2- The new concept of the Messiah.**

This is the true concept of the bestowal of Michael of Nebadon incarnate as Jesus of Nazareth.

> The new and vital feature of Peter’s confession was the clear-cut recognition that Jesus was the Son of God, of his unquestioned divinity. Ever since his baptism and the wedding at Cana these apostles had variously regarded him as the Messiah, but it was not a part of the Jewish concept of the national deliverer that he should be *divine.* The Jews had not taught that the Messiah would spring from divinity; he was to be the “anointed one,” but hardly had they contemplated him as being “the Son of God.” In the second confession more emphasis was placed upon the *combined nature,* the supernal fact that he was the Son of Man *and* the Son of God, and it was upon this great truth of the union of the human nature with the divine nature that Jesus declared he would build the kingdom of heaven. (<a id="a110_803"></a>[UB 157:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p5_1))

> Jesus had sought to live his life on earth and complete his bestowal mission as the Son of Man. His followers were disposed to regard him as the expected Messiah. Knowing that he could never fulfill their Messianic expectations, he endeavored to effect such a modification of their concept of the Messiah as would enable him partially to meet their expectations. But he now recognized that such a plan could hardly be carried through successfully. He therefore elected boldly to disclose the third plan—openly to announce his divinity, acknowledge the truthfulness of Peter’s confession, and directly proclaim to the twelve that he was a Son of God. (<a id="a112_653"></a>[UB 157:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p5_2))

> For three years Jesus had been proclaiming that he was the “Son of Man,” while for these same three years the apostles had been increasingly insistent that he was the expected Jewish Messiah. He now disclosed that he was the Son of God, and upon the concept of the *combined nature* of the Son of Man and the Son of God, he determined to build the kingdom of heaven. He had decided to refrain from further efforts to convince them that he was not the Messiah. He now proposed boldly to reveal to them what he *is,* and then to ignore their determination to persist in regarding him as the Messiah. (<a id="a114_601"></a>[UB 157:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/157#p5_3))

### VII. Death and resurrection.

**1- The spirit returns to God who gave it.**

Our material body is the temple, the dwelling place where a part of the divinity of God resides in the human mind.

> When you are through down here, when your course has been run in temporary form on earth, when your trial trip in the flesh is finished, when the dust that composes the mortal tabernacle “returns to the earth whence it came”; then, it is revealed, the indwelling “Spirit shall return to God who gave it.” There sojourns within each moral being of this planet a fragment of God, a part and parcel of divinity. It is not yet yours by right of possession, but it is designedly intended to be one with you if you survive the mortal existence. (<a id="a122_542"></a>[UB 1:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p4_3))

</figure>

**2- Relationship of Adjusters with death.**

The Universal Censors are able to come into possession of a summary of human life. This information is used to confirm superuniverse orders which make it possible for certain ascenders to begin their morontia careers immediately, that is, to proceed to the mansion worlds immediately after their physical disintegration, in anticipation of the official termination of a planetary dispensation.

> Subsequent to physical death, except in individuals translated from among the living, the released Adjuster goes immediately to the home sphere of Divinington. The details of what transpires on that world during the time of awaiting the factual reappearance of the surviving mortal depend chiefly on whether the human being ascends to the mansion worlds in his own individual right or awaits a dispensational summoning of the sleeping survivors of a planetary age. (<a id="a133_468"></a>[UB 112:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p4_3))

**3- Survive without delay.**

If, at the time of death's overtaking you, you have attained to the third circle or a higher realm, and consequently a personal destiny guardian has been assigned to you, and if the final transcript of your survival character summary submitted by the Adjuster is unconditionally certified by the destiny guardian... if the Universal Censors and their reflective associates on Uversa confirm these data without equivocation or reservation, then the Ancients of Days will flash forth, over the communications circuits to Salvington, the command to upgrade your status. Thus covered, the courts of the Sovereign of Nebadon will decree the immediate passage of the surviving soul to the resurrection halls of the mansion worlds.

> If the human individual survives without delay, the Adjuster, so I am instructed, registers at Divinington, proceeds to the Paradise presence of the Universal Father, returns immediately and is embraced by the Personalized Adjusters of the superuniverse and local universe of assignment, receives the recognition of the chief Personalized Monitor of Divinington, and then, at once, passes into the “realization of identity transition,” being summoned therefrom on the third period and on the mansion world in the actual personality form made ready for the reception of the surviving soul of the earth mortal as that form has been projected by the guardian of destiny. (<a id="a139_671"></a>[UB 112:4.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p4_13))

**4- The resurrection rooms of the world of houses.**

This is a good description of where we will be resurrected!

> From the Temple of New Life there extend seven radial wings, the resurrection halls of the mortal races. Each of these structures is devoted to the assembly of one of the seven races of time. There are one hundred thousand personal resurrection chambers in each of these seven wings terminating in the circular class assembly halls, which serve as the awakening chambers for as many as one million individuals. These halls are surrounded by the personality assembly chambers of the blended races of the normal post-Adamic worlds. Regardless of the technique which may be employed on the individual worlds of time in connection with special or dispensational resurrections, the real and conscious reassembly of actual and complete personality takes place in the resurrection halls of mansonia number one. Throughout all eternity you will recall the profound memory impressions of your first witnessing of these resurrection mornings. (<a id="a145_936"></a>[UB 47:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p3_5))

**5- The reconstruction of survivors.**

The re-customization process is well described below.

> During the transit of surviving mortals from the world of origin to the mansion worlds, whether they experience personality reassembly on the third period or ascend at the time of a group resurrection, the record of personality constitution is faithfully preserved by the archangels on their worlds of special activities. These beings are not the custodians of personality (as the guardian seraphim are of the soul), but it is nonetheless true that every identifiable factor of personality is effectually safeguarded in the custody of these dependable trustees of mortal survival. As to the exact whereabouts of mortal personality during the time intervening between death and survival, we do not know.
>
> The situation which makes repersonalization possible is brought about in the resurrection halls of the morontia receiving planets of a local universe. Here in these life-assembly chambers the supervising authorities provide that relationship of universe energy—morontial, mindal, and spiritual—which makes possible the reconsciousizing of the sleeping survivor. The reassembly of the constituent parts of a onetime material personality involves:
>
> 1. The fabrication of a suitable form, a morontia energy pattern, in which the new survivor can make contact with nonspiritual reality, and within which the morontia variant of the cosmic mind can be encircuited.
>
> 2. The return of the Adjuster to the waiting morontia creature. The Adjuster is the eternal custodian of your ascending identity; your Monitor is the absolute assurance that you yourself and not another will occupy the morontia form created for your personality awakening. And the Adjuster will be present at your personality reassembly to take up once more the role of Paradise guide to your surviving self.
>
> 3. When these prerequisites of repersonalization have been assembled, the seraphic custodian of the potentialities of the slumbering immortal soul, with the assistance of numerous cosmic personalities, bestows this morontia entity upon and in the awaiting morontia mind-body form while committing this evolutionary child of the Supreme to eternal association with the waiting Adjuster. And this completes the repersonalization, reassembly of memory, insight, and consciousness—identity.” [LU 112:5.15-19](/fr/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_19)

### VIII. The survival of the self — the personality.

**1- The self must choose to survive as a personality.**

It is with the mind that we choose to survive or not.

> Selfhood is a cosmic reality whether material, morontial, or spiritual. The actuality of the *personal* is the bestowal of the Universal Father acting in and of himself or through his manifold universe agencies. To say that a being is personal is to recognize the relative individuation of such a being within the cosmic organism. The living cosmos is an all but infinitely integrated aggregation of real units, all of which are relatively subject to the destiny of the whole. But those that are personal have been endowed with the actual choice of destiny acceptance or of destiny rejection. (<a id="a167_596"></a>[UB 112:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_1))

**2- In the non-survivor, the personality joins the Supreme.**

The personality coming from the Father is perfect and will achieve its Deity destiny, but it is otherwise for the identity which must make its choice.

> That which comes from the Father is like the Father eternal, and this is just as true of personality, which God gives by his own freewill choice, as it is of the divine Thought Adjuster, an actual fragment of God. Man’s personality is eternal but with regard to identity a conditioned eternal reality. Having appeared in response to the Father’s will, personality will attain Deity destiny, but man must choose whether or not he will be present at the attainment of such destiny. In default of such choice, personality attains experiential Deity directly, becoming a part of the Supreme Being. The cycle is foreordained, but man’s participation therein is optional, personal, and experiential. (<a id="a173_697"></a>[UB 112:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_2))

**3- Experience the key to survival.**

The existential God knows everything. The experiential God learns through experience in the actualization of the potentials of his children.

> Nothing in the entire universe can substitute for the fact of experience on nonexistential levels. The infinite God is, as always, replete and complete, infinitely inclusive of all things except evil and creature experience. God cannot do wrong; he is infallible. God cannot experientially know what he has never personally experienced; God’s preknowledge is existential. Therefore does the spirit of the Father descend from Paradise to participate with finite mortals in every bona fide experience of the ascending career; it is only by such a method that the existential God could become in truth and in fact man’s experiential Father. The infinity of the eternal God encompasses the potential for finite experience, which indeed becomes actual in the ministry of the Adjuster fragments that actually share the life vicissitude experiences of human beings. (<a id="a179_862"></a>[UB 108:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p0_2))

**4- The permanence of personality.**

Two gifts come to us from the Father, the personality which is invariant and the divine Adjuster who seeks to divinize us. This is the essential for progress!

> THE evolutionary planets are the spheres of human origin, the initial worlds of the ascending mortal career. Urantia is your starting point; here you and your divine Thought Adjuster are joined in temporary union. You have been endowed with a perfect guide; therefore, if you will sincerely run the race of time and gain the final goal of faith, the reward of the ages shall be yours; you will be eternally united with your indwelling Adjuster. Then will begin your real life, the ascending life, to which your present mortal state is but the vestibule. Then will begin your exalted and progressive mission as finaliters in the eternity which stretches out before you. And throughout all of these successive ages and stages of evolutionary growth, there is one part of you that remains absolutely unaltered, and that is personality—permanence in the presence of change. (<a id="a185_873"></a>[UB 112:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_1))

</figure>

**5- Guardians of identity and survival values.**

As soon as, in the human mind, the pilot light disappears, the spiritual luminosity that the seraphim associate with the presence of the Adjuster, the accompanying angel reports it personally and successively to the angels commanding his group, his company, his battalion, his unit, his legion and his army... After the commander of this supreme organized unit has given him authorization, the guardian of destiny goes to the first mansion world to wait for the consciousness of his former ward to be reestablished in the flesh.

> The guardian seraphim is the custodial trustee of the survival values of mortal man’s slumbering soul as the absent Adjuster *is* the identity of such an immortal universe being. When these two collaborate in the resurrection halls of mansonia in conjunction with the newly fabricated morontia form, there occurs the reassembly of the constituent factors of the personality of the mortal ascender.
>
> The Adjuster will identify you; the guardian seraphim will repersonalize you and then re-present you to the faithful Monitor of your earth days.
>
> And even so, when a planetary age ends, when those in the lower circles of mortal achievement are forgathered, it is their group guardians who reassemble them in the resurrection halls of the mansion spheres, even as your record tells: “And he shall send his angels with a great voice and shall gather together his elect from one end of the realm to another.”” ” [LU 113:6.5-7](/fr/The_Urantia_Book/113#p6_7)

### IX. The worlds of houses.

**1- The Ministry of Human Deficiencies of the First World of Houses.**

The first lessons to learn about the first world of houses.

> Almost the entire experience of mansion world number one pertains to deficiency ministry. Survivors arriving on this first of the detention spheres present so many and such varied defects of creature character and deficiencies of mortal experience that the major activities of the realm are occupied with the correction and cure of these manifold legacies of the life in the flesh on the material evolutionary worlds of time and space. (<a id="a208_439"></a>[UB 47:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p3_8))

**2- Continuation of life on the mansion worlds.**

Normally, death is an end only for the material body, but not for the individual.

> On the mansion worlds the resurrected mortal survivors resume their lives just where they left off when overtaken by death. When you go from Urantia to the first mansion world, you will notice considerable change, but if you had come from a more normal and progressive sphere of time, you would hardly notice the difference except for the fact that you were in possession of a different body; the tabernacle of flesh and blood has been left behind on the world of nativity. (<a id="a214_477"></a>[UB 47:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p3_1))

**3- We must make up for our failures on earth.**

Nothing is left to chance, all life lessons must be mastered.

> Those things which you might have learned on earth, but which you failed to learn, must be acquired under the tutelage of these faithful and patient teachers. There are no royal roads, short cuts, or easy paths to Paradise. Irrespective of the individual variations of the route, you master the lessons of one sphere before you proceed to another; at least this is true after you once leave the world of your nativity. (<a id="a220_422"></a>[UB 48:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p5_7))

**4- Cosmic awakening on the mansion worlds.**

On the fifth mansonia you meet the first instructors who begin to prepare you for the further stay in the constellation.

> A real birth of cosmic consciousness takes place on mansonia number five. You are becoming universe minded. This is indeed a time of expanding horizons. It is beginning to dawn upon the enlarging minds of the ascending mortals that some stupendous and magnificent, some supernal and divine, destiny awaits all who complete the progressive Paradise ascension, which has been so laboriously but so joyfully and auspiciously begun. At about this point the average mortal ascender begins to manifest bona fide experiential enthusiasm for the Havona ascent. Study is becoming voluntary, unselfish service natural, and worship spontaneous. A real morontia character is budding; a real morontia creature is evolving. (<a id="a226_713"></a>[UB 47:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p7_5))

**5- Confirmation of the merger with the Adjuster.**

Finally, the long-awaited and hoped-for moment happens!

> The union of the evolving immortal soul with the eternal and divine Adjuster is signalized by the seraphic summoning of the supervising superangel for resurrected survivors and of the archangel of record for those going to judgment on the third day; and then, in the presence of such a survivor’s morontia associates, these messengers of confirmation speak: “This is a beloved son in whom I am well pleased.” This simple ceremony marks the entrance of an ascending mortal upon the eternal career of Paradise service.
>
> Immediately upon the confirmation of Adjuster fusion the new morontia being is introduced to his fellows for the first time by his new name and is granted the forty days of spiritual retirement from all routine activities wherein to commune with himself and to choose some one of the optional routes to Havona and to select from the differential techniques of Paradise attainment.” [LU 47:8.4-5](/fr/The_Urantia_Book/47#p8_5)

**6- Is there a second probation period?**

If our intentions and desires have survival value, decrees will be issued to extend our probationary period. We will be granted additional time to demonstrate our worth.

> If ever there is doubt as to the advisability of advancing a human identity to the mansion worlds, the universe governments invariably rule in the personal interests of that individual; they unhesitatingly advance such a soul to the status of a transitional being, while they continue their observations of the emerging morontia intent and spiritual purpose. Thus divine justice is certain of achievement, and divine mercy is accorded further opportunity for extending its ministry.
>
> The governments of Orvonton and Nebadon do not claim absolute perfection for the detail working of the universal plan of mortal repersonalization, but they do claim to, and actually do, manifest patience, tolerance, understanding, and merciful sympathy. We had rather assume the risk of a system rebellion than to court the hazard of depriving one struggling mortal from any evolutionary world of the eternal joy of pursuing the ascending career.
>
> This does not mean that human beings are to enjoy a second opportunity in the face of the rejection of a first, not at all. But it does signify that all will creatures are to experience one true opportunity to make one undoubted, self-conscious, and final choice. The sovereign Judges of the universes will not deprive any being of personality status who has not finally and fully made the eternal choice; the soul of man must and will be given full and ample opportunity to reveal its true intent and real purpose.” [LU 112:5.7-9](/fr/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_9)

### X. The Morontia Life.

**1- The resurrection launches us into a morontia career.**

Physical death is only one technique for progressing on the morontia level.

> Mortal death is a technique of escape from the material life in the flesh; and the mansonia experience of progressive life through seven worlds of corrective training and cultural education represents the introduction of mortal survivors to the morontia career, the transition life which intervenes between the evolutionary material existence and the higher spirit attainment of the ascenders of time who are destined to achieve the portals of eternity. (<a id="a257_457"></a>[UB 47:10.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p10_7))

**2- Morontia life really begins on Jerusem**

Before reaching Jerusalem, we must absolutely unify our personality.

> The mortal personality initiated on the evolutionary worlds and tabernacled in the flesh—indwelt by the Mystery Monitors and invested by the Spirit of Truth—is not fully mobilized, realized, and unified until that day when such a Jerusem citizen is given clearance for Edentia and proclaimed a true member of the morontia corps of Nebadon—an immortal survivor of Adjuster association, a Paradise ascender, a personality of morontia status, and a true child of the Most Highs. (<a id="a263_479"></a>[UB 47:10.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p10_6))

**3- Seven times the morontians sleep and are resurrected.**

After seven body changes on the morontia worlds, we will be done with loss of consciousness.

> Seven times do those mortals who pass through the entire mansonia career experience the adjustment sleep and the resurrection awakening. But the last resurrection hall, the final awakening chamber, was left behind on the seventh mansion world. No more will a form-change necessitate the lapse of consciousness or a break in the continuity of personal memory. (<a id="a269_362"></a>[UB 47:10.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p10_5))

**4- The survival of young children.**

Through his love and kindness, the Father does not forget children who die in infancy!

> Children who die when too young to have Thought Adjusters are repersonalized on the finaliter world of the local systems concomitant with the arrival of either parent on the mansion worlds. A child acquires physical entity at mortal birth, but in the matter of survival all Adjusterless children are reckoned as still attached to their parents.
>
> In due course Thought Adjusters come to indwell these little ones, while the seraphic ministry to both groups of the probationary-dependent orders of survival is in general similar to that of the more advanced parent or is equivalent to that of the parent in case only one survives. Those attaining the third circle, regardless of the status of their parents, are accorded personal guardians.
>
> Similar probation nurseries are maintained on the finaliter spheres of the constellation and the universe headquarters for the Adjusterless children of the primary and secondary modified orders of ascenders.” [LU 49:6.12-14](/fr/The_Urantia_Book/49#p6_14)

**5- Parental experience is required for all elevators.**

The parental experience is essential in our journey to Heaven and the Father.

> On the seven mansion worlds ascending mortals are afforded ample opportunities for compensating any and all experiential deprivations suffered on their worlds of origin, whether due to inheritance, environment, or unfortunate premature termination of the career in the flesh. This is in every sense true except in the mortal sex life and its attendant adjustments. Thousands of mortals reach the mansion worlds without having benefited particularly from the disciplines derived from fairly average sex relations on their native spheres. The mansion world experience can provide little opportunity for compensating these very personal deprivations. Sex experience in a physical sense is past for these ascenders, but in close association with the Material Sons and Daughters, both individually and as members of their families, these sex-deficient mortals are enabled to compensate the social, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual aspects of their deficiency. Thus are all those humans whom circumstances or bad judgment deprived of the benefits of advantageous sex association on the evolutionary worlds, here on the system capitals afforded full opportunity to acquire these essential mortal experiences in close and loving association with the supernal Adamic sex creatures of permanent residence on the system capitals.
>
> No surviving mortal, midwayer, or seraphim may ascend to Paradise, attain the Father, and be mustered into the Corps of the Finality without having passed through that sublime experience of achieving parental relationship to an evolving child of the worlds or some other experience analogous and equivalent thereto. The relationship of child and parent is fundamental to the essential concept of the Universal Father and his universe children. Therefore does such an experience become indispensable to the experiential training of all ascenders.
>
> The ascending midway creatures and the evolutionary seraphim must pass through this parenthood experience in association with the Material Sons and Daughters of the system headquarters. Thus do such nonreproducing ascenders obtain the experience of parenthood by assisting the Jerusem Adams and Eves in rearing and training their progeny.
>
> All mortal survivors who have not experienced parenthood on the evolutionary worlds must also obtain this necessary training while sojourning in the homes of the Jerusem Material Sons and as parental associates of these superb fathers and mothers. This is true except in so far as such mortals have been able to compensate their deficiencies on the system nursery located on the first transitional-culture world of Jerusem.” [LU 45:6.3-6](/fr/The_Urantia_Book/45#p6_6)

### XI. Games and leisure of the minds.

**1- All ascenders continue to play.**

Play and rest are essential for all creatures except the gods.

> The principles of Urantian play life are philosophically sound and continue to apply on up through your ascending life, through the circuits of Havona to the eternal shores of Paradise. As ascendant beings you are in possession of personal memories of all former and lower existences, and without such identity memories of the past there would be no basis for the humor of the present, either mortal laughter or morontia mirth. It is this recalling of past experiences that provides the basis for present diversion and amusement. And so you will enjoy the celestial equivalents of your earthly humor all the way up through your long morontia, and then increasingly spiritual, careers. And that part of God (the Adjuster) which becomes an eternal part of the personality of an ascendant mortal contributes the overtones of divinity to the joyous expressions, even spiritual laughter, of the ascending creatures of time and space. (<a id="a299_932"></a>[UB 48:4.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_20))

**2- The multiple functions of humor.**

The many uses of true humor.

> Humor should function as an automatic safety valve to prevent the building up of excessive pressures due to the monotony of sustained and serious self-contemplation in association with the intense struggle for developmental progress and noble achievement. Humor also functions to lessen the shock of the unexpected impact of fact or of truth, rigid unyielding fact and flexible ever-living truth. The mortal personality, never sure as to which will next be encountered, through humor swiftly grasps—sees the point and achieves insight—the unexpected nature of the situation be it fact or be it truth. (<a id="a305_604"></a>[UB 48:4.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_18))

**3- Those who need to relax the most.**

At the two opposite ends of life, humor is not present. Between the two, it is essential!

> The need for the relaxation and diversion of humor is greatest in those orders of ascendant beings who are subjected to sustained stress in their upward struggles. The two extremes of life have little need for humorous diversions. Primitive men have no capacity therefor, and beings of Paradise perfection have no need thereof. The hosts of Havona are naturally a joyous and exhilarating assemblage of supremely happy personalities. On Paradise the quality of worship obviates the necessity for reversion activities. But among those who start their careers far below the goal of Paradise perfection, there is a large place for the ministry of the reversion directors. (<a id="a311_671"></a>[UB 48:4.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_16))

**4- Increased spirituality reduces the need for diversion.**

Will the need for entertainment always be a part of us?

> The higher the mortal species, the greater the stress and the greater the capacity for humor as well as the necessity for it. In the spirit world the opposite is true: The higher we ascend, the less the need for the diversions of reversion experiences. But proceeding down the scale of spirit life from Paradise to the seraphic hosts, there is an increasing need for the mission of mirth and the ministry of merriment. Those beings who most need the refreshment of periodic reversion to the intellectual status of previous experiences are the higher types of the human species, the morontians, angels, and the Material Sons, together with all similar types of personality. (<a id="a317_676"></a>[UB 48:4.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_17))
