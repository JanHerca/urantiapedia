Claude Flibotte — Sainte-Julie (Quebec)

The origin of this text comes from an exchange of emails between several readers of the _Urantia Book_. We wondered if the Adjuster was an absolute entity before the fusion and if he remained so after the event. In order to get a better idea of this question, it is interesting to consider the Adjuster before his fusion with his human subject, then after the fusion.

## THE ADJUSTER BEFORE MERGER

Let's see together what a Thought Adjuster is. In quote ro7: I. 2, it is written:

> “Though there are diverse opinions regarding the mode of the bestowal of Thought Adjusters, there exist no such differences concerning their origin; all are agreed that they proceed direct from the Universal Father, the First Source and Center. They are not created beings; they are fragmentized entities constituting the factual presence of the infinite God. Together with their many unrevealed associates, the Adjusters are undiluted and unmixed divinity, unqualified and unattenuated parts of Deity; they are of God, and as far as we are able to discern, *they are God.*” (<a id="a45_578"></a>[UB 107:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p1_2))

Since the Adjuster is pure divinity, we should ask what the word divinity represents. In quotation o:I.I6 it is written:

> “DIVINITY is the characteristic, unifying, and co-ordinating quality of Deity.” (<a id="a49_83"></a>[UB 0:1.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p1_16))

Furthermore, it is written in 0:12.3 that

> “The first and second experiential Trinities, the post-Havona Trinities, cannot be infinite because they embrace *derived Deities,* Deities evolved by the experiential actualization of realities created or eventuated by the existential Paradise Trinity. Infinity of divinity is being ever enriched, if not enlarged, by finity and absonity of creature and Creator experience.” (<a id="a53_379"></a>[UB 0:12.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p12_3))

And again, in 0:1.17

> “Divinity is creature comprehensible as truth, beauty, and goodness; correlated in personality as love, mercy, and ministry; disclosed on impersonal levels as justice, power, and sovereignty.” (<a id="a57_196"></a>[UB 0:1.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p1_17))

This is what we are called to merge with! His function is to make us like him, divine, as he himself is divine. Isn't that fantastic!

## THE ADJUSTER AFTER THE MERGER

Now that we have a good idea of what an Adjuster is in its **nature** and **function** before fusion, let us see what happens at the time of fusion. Citation 107:2.7 helps us in this:

> “6. *Fused Adjusters—*finaliters—those who have become one with the ascending creatures of the superuniverses, the eternity partners of the time ascenders of the Paradise Corps of the Finality. Thought Adjusters ordinarily become fused with the ascending mortals of time, and with such surviving mortals they are registered in and out of Ascendington; they follow the course of ascendant beings. Upon fusion with the ascending evolutionary soul, it appears that the Adjuster translates from the absolute existential level of the universe to the finite experiential level of functional association with an ascending personality. While retaining all of the character of the existential divine nature, a fused Adjuster becomes indissolubly linked with the ascending career of a surviving mortal.” (<a id="a65_797"></a>[UB 107:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p2_7))

From this quote, we see that at the moment of fusion the Adjuster passes from his original absolute existential level, since he is a fragment of the Universal Father who is existential, absolute, infinite and eternal, to the subabsolute experiential level constrained to the space and time (finite) of his human subject. In this process of transformation, the Adjuster does not lose in any way the character of his divine existential nature, that is to say that everything that was proper to his divine nature described above is preserved in the process of fusion with the identity of his human subject. The following quote is perhaps more explicit to understand the ins and outs of this fusion.

> “The actual source of the Adjuster must be infinite, and before fusion with the immortal soul of an evolving mortal, the reality of the Adjuster must border on absoluteness. Adjusters are not absolutes in the universal sense, in the Deity sense, but they are probably true absolutes within the potentialities of their fragmented nature. They are qualified as to universality but not as to nature; in extensiveness they are limited, but in intensiveness of meaning, value, and fact *they are absolute.* For this reason we sometimes denominate the divine gifts as the qualified absolute fragments of the Father.” (<a id="a69_614"></a>[UB 107:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p4_2))

Why in this quote is it written that the Adjuster must “brush against absoluteness”? The reason is very simple! The Deity has as its first personality the person of the Universal Father, and this person of the Father is universal and absolute for all of its past, present and future creation. Since an Adjuster is a fragment of the divinity of this absolute Deity, the fragment cannot be the totality of this Deity, which is why expressing that the Adjuster only brushes against absoluteness in the universal sense is correct. However, since it is of the same nature as the Father, that is to say of a divine nature, in potential, it is a true absolute and it is this divinity that it brings to its human subject whose potentiality of divinity will have all eternity to reveal itself.

In order to see the results of this fusion, we may reread quotations 110:7.4 and 110:7.5 for this purpose.

> “Subsequent to mortal fusion the Adjusters share your destiny and experience; *they are you.* After the fusion of the immortal morontia soul and the associated Adjuster, all of the experience and all of the values of the one eventually become the possession of the other, so that the two are actually one entity. In a certain sense, this new being is of the eternal past as well as for the eternal future. All that was once human in the surviving soul and all that is experientially divine in the Adjuster now become the actual possession of the new and ever-ascending universe personality. But on each universe level the Adjuster can endow the new creature only with those attributes which are meaningful and of value on that level. An absolute *oneness* with the divine Monitor, a complete exhaustion of the endowment of an Adjuster, can only be achieved in eternity subsequent to the final attainment of the Universal Father, the Father of spirits, ever the source of these divine gifts.”
> When the evolving soul and the divine Adjuster are finally and eternally fused, each gains all of the experiencible qualities of the other. This co-ordinate personality possesses all of the experiential memory of survival once held by the ancestral mortal mind and then resident in the morontia soul, and in addition thereto this potential finaliter embraces all the experiential memory of the Adjuster throughout the mortal indwellings of all time. But it will require an eternity of the future for an Adjuster ever completely to endow the personality partnership with the meanings and values which the divine Monitor carries forward from the eternity of the past. (<a id="a76_669"></a>[UB 110:7.4-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p7_4))

In the definition of the absolute level recorded in 0:1.13 it is stated that the absolute level of unifying expression of the three Paradise Deities is not experientially fully unified.

> “*The absolute level* is beginningless, endless, timeless, and spaceless. For example: On Paradise, time and space are nonexistent; the time-space status of Paradise is absolute. This level is Trinity attained, existentially, by the Paradise Deities, but this third level of unifying Deity expression is not fully unified experientially. Whenever, wherever, and however the absolute level of Deity functions, Paradise-absolute values and meanings are manifest.” (<a id="a80_465"></a>[UB 0:1.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p1_13))

This is one of the reasons for the existence of the Adjusters and their fusion with the evolutionary creatures: to complete the unifying expression of the Deities on the experiential levels with the agreement and cooperation of the creatures, their children.

Thus, both the derived Deities that are the Supreme Being, God the Ultimate and God the Absolute (<a id="a84_98"></a>[UB 0:12.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p12_3)) and the creatures are winners by this process!
