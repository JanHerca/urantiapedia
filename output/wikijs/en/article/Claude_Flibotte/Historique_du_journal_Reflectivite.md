The first issue of Réflectivité appeared in 1982 under the direction, at the beginning, of Guy Hévey. Its mission was to connect Quebec readers of the _Urantia Book_. It included news from readers, activities and articles on various subjects. It had adopted the paper format 8 &half; x 11 in. It appeared in this form until 1984 at the rate of three issues per year.

It was in 1985, under the supervision of Jacques Tétrault, that the monthly publication of Réflectivité continued, but this time in a double-sided paper format of 8 x 14 inches.

It was in 1986 that Lise and Pierre Routhier took over. Still in the same paper format, but in the form of a leaflet. They valiantly continued the publication until September 2006.

It was in October 2006 that Reflectivity returned to the 8 ½ x 11 in. paper format, but included in the Tidings journal and in color until August 2010.

It was in September 2010 that Gaétan Charland, new president of the Urantia Association of Quebec, wrote his first message in Reflectivity, now published as a newsletter independent of Tidings. Normand Laperle has been acting as editor-in-chief of Reflectivity since 2016.

Finally, it was for the December-January 2021 issue that Claude Flibotte took over from Normand Laperle to assume the title of editor-in-chief. In January 2023, he inaugurated the new image of Reflectivity with a new, more airy layout, more in-depth articles, more illustrations and in two separate issues, one in paper format limited to four pages and an electronic format freed from the constraints imposed by paper printing. The new mission of Reflectivity was to become a journal of opinion for readers of the _Urantia Book_.
