## God is spirit and energy

In this simple description we have the personality aspect which is designated by the word “God”, because this term always designates personality (<a id="a23_146"></a>[UB 0:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p2_10)), then we have the description of the nature of God in that he is as much spirit as energy. Spirit in the sense that he is conscious, divine and perfect, capable of willing and choosing. In reference to the quote <a id="a23_401"></a>[UB 1:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p3_4), the spirit of God is absolute, in the Son it is unqualified and in the Spirit it is universal, then by the union of the three in deity, it is infinite. Energy because it is the origin of the Isle of Paradise, the perfect opposite of the spiritual Son in its nature and function, all that has to do with things and the multiple manifestations of energy. In fact, what distinguishes personality from material, mind and spirit is that these last three enumerations are all diversified manifestations of energy, while personality is something else. By his personality, as Universal Father and as First Source and Center, the Father far transcends what he is as material energy, mental energy and spirit energy (<a id="a23_1149"></a>[UB 1:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p7_7)).

## Return to the origin of reality to understand the personality

In order to get an idea of the personality other than the description given to us by the revelators in booklet 112, we must go back to the origin of all realities. At the theoretical moment when the I AM became the Eternal Father of the Original Son and simultaneously the eternal source of Paradise, the I AM manifested itself from then on as a personality, as the Universal Father (<a id="a27_384"></a>[UB 0:3.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p3_22)). The Infinite, personalized in the Universal Father, is a level of actual value representing all that is the nature and plans of the Eternal Father in his infinity of absolute and unhindered free will (<a id="a27_629"></a>[UB 0:3.24](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p3_24)). This is what indicates to us the first manifestation and the source of the personality. This is also why only the Father can confer the personality (<a id="a27_822"></a>[UB 0:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p5_11)), and this explains why the personality is a deified level of reality (<a id="a27_935"></a>[UB 0:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p5_1)).

When the I AM withdrew from its original condition of Unconditioned Absolute that which became the Conditioned and Qualified Absolute, it became the Deity Absolute in contrast to what it had just left, and which is called the Unqualified Absolute. The original unity of the I AM will be preserved by the Universal Absolute. The volitional power of the I AM was found in this Deity Absolute for what is potential and in the three persons of the Paradise Deity for what is actual expressed by the Paradise Trinity. Which leaves the Unqualified Absolute and the Isle of Paradise as that which responds to the will of the actuals and the potential. Thus, it is possible to say that the personality is superimposed on energy (<a id="a29_721"></a>[UB 0:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p5_4)) by its nature of free will and its function of unifying the components of its living system (<a id="a29_855"></a>[UB 9:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/9#p4_6)).

## Nature and role of the personality of creatures

By its very high origin, the personality is creative by nature (<a id="a33_64"></a>[UB 111:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p4_5)). It is superordinate (<a id="a33_131"></a>[UB 112:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p2_4)) by its search for unification in each individual because of its origin in the uniqueness and unification of the Original Deity. It is easy at this point to understand that the personality is fundamental for any progressive experience with spiritual reality (<a id="a33_434"></a>[UB 12:9.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p9_1)). It is that part of the individual that allows us to recognize and positively identify this person (<a id="a33_577"></a>[UB 16:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_4)). The personality is unique (<a id="a33_648"></a>[UB 112:0.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_12)). It is invariant in the presence of change (<a id="a33_739"></a>[UB 112:0.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_9)). This is what makes the median say that:

> Personality is that cosmic endowment, that phase of universal reality, which can coexist with unlimited change and at the same time retain its identity in the very presence of all such changes, and forever afterward. (<a id="a35_220"></a>[UB 130:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p4_6))

It is mentioned in quote <a id="a37_25"></a>[UB 16:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_3) that the granting of a Thought Adjuster to a personality increases the qualitative aspect of that personality, for the Adjuster is the very divinity of the Father in Himself, but the manifestation of the personality is further conditioned and qualified by the nature and qualities of the associated energies of a material, mental and spiritual nature which constitute the organic vehicle for the manifestation of that personality. Which suggests that in our future morontia bodies and then in a spirit body thereafter, our personality will have every chance of being able to express its full potential!

## Repercussion of the personality in the Supreme Being

It is undeniable that our existence is intimately linked to that of the Supreme Being since in him we move and we have our existence. It is thanks to the reality of the Supreme Being, this new experiential deity in formation, that we can exist!

> The experience of every evolving creature personality is a phase of the experience of the Almighty Supreme. The intelligent subjugation of every physical segment of the superuniverses is a part of the growing control of the Almighty Supreme. The creative synthesis of power and personality is a part of the creative urge of the Supreme Mind and is the very essence of the evolutionary growth of unity in the Supreme Being. (<a id="a43_426"></a>[UB 116:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p1_1))

Remember what is revealed to us about persons who do not survive and whose personality returns to the Supreme, for this personality is of a deified and perfect nature and cannot be destroyed unlike the identity.

Although each personality is unique, by its origin, they are all ONE! Hence without doubt the fact that personalities cannot be totalized, but only associable (<a id="a47_160"></a>[UB 112:0.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_12))

## Personality is a mystery

Personality is one of the unsolved mysteries of the universe (<a id="a51_62"></a>[UB 5:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p6_2)), and it will probably remain so, for to understand personality fully would be to understand fully what the Universal Father is. We can find its origin, but we cannot understand its nature completely. At most, we can only recognize that, on subabsolute levels, our personality is endowed with seven dimensions of self-expression and that this seventh dimension of totality can be experienced as a fact of personality.

> ***. . . But when an attempt is made to make plain the realities of the spirit world to the physical minds of the material order, mystery appears: mysteries so subtle and so profound that only the faith-grasp of the God-knowing mortal can achieve the philosophic miracle of the recognition of the Infinite by the finite, the discernment of the eternal God by the evolving mortals of the material worlds of time and space.*** (<a id="a57_428"></a>[UB 1:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p4_7))
