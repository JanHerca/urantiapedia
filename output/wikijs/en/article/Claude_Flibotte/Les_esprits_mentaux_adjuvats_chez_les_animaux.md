An article in the magazine “Science & Vie” from January 2023, titled “_How animals apprehend the world around them_” by Valentin Faivre caught my attention, and I had fun making a connection with the adjutant spirits-minds as taught in ***The Urantia Book***.

We know that these minds come into play when the ability to learn from experience (<a id="a22_83"></a>[UB 65:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p7_6)) manifests itself. In this article, the author drew up two tables. One focused on the cognitive abilities and the other on the emotional abilities of eleven livestock species, tables based on a study by Bob Fisher of Texas State University. This work concerned eighty-two behaviors present or not in their subjects.
<br style="clear:both;"/>

## The grand champion in all categories!

According to this study, the pig is the grand champion in all categories. Out of the 82 behaviors, it has 35 cognitive abilities and 47 emotional reactions. It may have other abilities, but these have not been studied. It should be noted in the table on cognitive abilities that the ability “_Express your personality_” does not make sense here for anyone who clearly differentiates between identity (<a id="a27_401"></a>[UB 112:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_4)) and personality (<a id="a27_463"></a>[UB 112:0.2-16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_2)). This ability should instead be read as “_Express your identity_”!

Surprisingly, it is poultry that stands out in second place as being endowed with the greatest number of abilities. They rank with 60% of emotions and 70% of cognitive traits. This “volatile” among birds may have benefited from human company to develop new skills!

## Invertebrates would require more study!

Although octopuses occupy fourth place among the most studied animals, they are exceptions among invertebrates (see my comments a little further on). “_It would be a good thing to do more research on fish and other invertebrates_”, the researchers indicate in the conclusion of this study.

| Spirit type | Characteristics | Animal category | Probable animal type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Spirit of intuition | Instinctive behavior, <br> elementary reflex | Elementary animal life | Amoeba, protozoa (<a id="a37_114"></a>[UB 65:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p2_4) and <br> <a id="a37_165"></a>[UB 65:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p7_6)) |
| Mind of understanding | Faculty of associating ideas | More evolved animal life | Insects, spiders (<a id="a38_102"></a>[UB 65:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p2_5)) |
| Spirit of courage | Protective conscience | Reptiles | Turtles, birds (<a id="a39_73"></a>[UB 65:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p2_8)) |
| Spirit of knowledge | Acquisition and retention of <br> experiences | Mammals | Dog, cat, etc. |
| Spirit of advice | Herd instinct, beginning of a <br> primitive social development | Higher mammals | Primates (<a id="a41_114"></a>[UB 62:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p6_4)) |

## So, what about dogs and cats?

If this study focuses on farm animals, the majority of which are those we eat, rather than domestic animals, “the results for dogs and cats should be close to those for pigs,” says Cédric Sueur.

## Warning from researchers!

It is difficult to deal with the cognitive and emotional capacities of animals without a certain bias. Thus, warns Cédric Sueur, ethnologist at the University of Strasbourg, the formulations used here take human capacities as a point of reference, so it is impossible to know if this is indeed how animals experience these capacities.

## In relation to our knowledge of adjutant mind-spirits!

Although this researcher warns us of certain biases, we know, with the help of this fifth epochal revelation, that the adjutant mind-spirits that support animals are exactly the same adjutants that do so for human beings, the adjutant of worship and the adjutant of wisdom in addition. Thus, referring to Table 1, we can see that the pig uses the five adjutant mind-spirits well as described in the characteristics column. It succeeds between 50 to 100% in the majority of the capacities. The same goes for the chicken which succeeds a little less well in the final total despite being under the probable influence of the first three adjutant mind-spirits, completely failing the mirror test. A test which must probably consist in the observation of the subject to know if he perceives himself or if he believes he sees another individual in the mirror. Its score is then between 0 and 100% depending on the capacities observed.

Still according to table 1, if we study the case of carp and salmon, both fish, therefore using only the first two adjutant mental minds, we find that their score is drastically lower than the pig or the chicken. Just 40% for carp and 25% for salmon in the table of cognitive abilities. Without doubt, carp being a bottom fish, it must make more choices in the search for its food, therefore greater mental stimulation, compared to salmon. From the point of view of emotional capacities, their scores improve with 50% for carp and less than 40% for salmon. Both fish being poor candidates for maternal instinct, carp having in addition a score between 25 to 50% only in caring for its young.

The octopus is a special case. According to Table 1 , we could classify it in the category of the first three adjutant mind-spirits, but based on my knowledge of this animal, I would opt for the first four adjutant mind-spirits. According to Tables 3 and 4 , the octopus, although doing well with a 50% cognitive capacity and a little over 50% emotional capacity, I believe that these scores do not really represent the totality of its capacities. The table gives it between 25 and 50% for cognitive capacity in the box “Learning using different methods”, while I have seen an octopus perform feats of imagination to reach its prey despite the pitfalls set by doctoral students in the laboratory. In the emotional categories of “Caring for its young” and “demonstrating maternal instinct”, the table gives it a poor score of 0 to 25%. Knowing the procedure for protecting octopus eggs, this rating is not very generous! During the hatching period of its eggs, the octopus completely stops feeding and devotes itself entirely to ventilating its eggs until they hatch. It thus loses its natural color, becoming almost white. When the little octopuses hatch, it dies without being able to provide any other care to its offspring. It has completed the cycle of perpetuating the life of octopuses, it has given its life for its young!

As for the shrimp, crab, lobster, black soldier fly, and silkworm, only the first two mental adjutant spirits are at work. Unsurprisingly, their scores barely exceed 20% in several abilities, failing most obviously in emotional abilities.

On the other hand, the bee, although under the supposed influence of the first two adjutant mental spirits, reaches 60% in its cognitive capacities and 30% in its emotional capacities. Could we grant it the third adjutant given the care it takes in caring for its larvae? It obtains a score of 25 to 50% for “Being capable of transitive inference”, which I would translate as its cognitive capacity to make the connection between new data and that already stored. Its system of communicating information through a directional rhythmic dance indicates to its fellows the location of a rich pollen site in relation to the sun and the distance to be covered.

## The panorama of the evolution of animal life on Urantia up to man!

Life on our planet began 550 million years ago with the implantation of the three independent life formulas deposited by the Life Carriers in the mud and silt of the hospitable waters of that time (<a id="a83_198"></a>[UB 58:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/58#p4_2) and <a id="a83_244"></a>[UB 65:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p2_1)). 500 million years ago, primitive plant life was well established (<a id="a83_354"></a>[UB 58:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/58#p4_3)). 450 million years ago, the transition between plant and animal life occurred (<a id="a83_476"></a>[UB 58:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/58#p6_1)). 400 million years ago, marine life, both plant and animal, was fairly well distributed throughout the world (<a id="a83_629"></a>[UB 59:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p1_2)). Suddenly, the first multicellular animals appeared, the trilobites (<a id="a83_741"></a>[UB 59:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p1_4)). 360 million years ago, marine life was almost uniform throughout the world and consisted of algae, single-celled organisms, simple sponges, trilobites, shrimps, crabs and lobsters (<a id="a83_966"></a>[UB 59:1.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p1_18)). Around 275 million years ago, true scorpions, truly breathing air, appeared (<a id="a83_1089"></a>[UB 59:3.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p3_11)). 250 million years ago, the fish family appeared (<a id="a83_1184"></a>[UB 59:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p4_9)). 210 million years ago, snails, scorpions and frogs emerged from brackish waters and crawled on land, followed by insects (<a id="a83_1350"></a>[UB 59:5.6-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p5_6)). 170 million years ago, the first stage of the transformation of frogs into reptiles occurred in Africa (<a id="a83_1500"></a>[UB 59:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p6_8)), these were two pre-reptilian ancestors. 140 million years ago, reptiles with all their attributes suddenly appeared, crocodiles, scaly reptiles, sea snakes and flying reptiles (<a id="a83_1721"></a>[UB 60:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/60#p1_9)). Several million years later, the first non-placental mammals appeared, but proved to be a failure (<a id="a83_1864"></a>[UB 60:1.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/60#p1_11)). 120 million years ago, the evolution and decline of dinosaurs occurred (<a id="a83_1982"></a>[UB 60:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/60#p2_1)). 55 million years ago, marks the sudden appearance of the first true bird (<a id="a83_2100"></a>[UB 60:3.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/60#p3_22)).

50 million years ago, placental mammals suddenly appeared in North America (<a id="a85_76"></a>[UB 61:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p1_2)). 45 million years ago, the ancestors of the future kangaroos roamed Australia. Soon there were small horses, agile rhinoceroses, trunked tapirs, primitive pigs, squirrels, lemurs, opossums and several tribes of monkey-like animals (<a id="a85_351"></a>[UB 61:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p1_9)). About 30 million years ago, the ancestor of the canine family appeared in Europe, giving rise to many species of small dogs. Rodents, beavers, squirrels, gophers, mice and rabbits also appeared (<a id="a85_590"></a>[UB 61:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p2_7)). 30 million years ago, modern types of mammals began to appear. Suddenly, the evolution of the plains ungulate type began, horses, rhinoceroses, peccaries, hippopotamuses, camels and llamas (<a id="a85_824"></a>[UB 61:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p2_8) and 9). In western North America, the primitive ancestors of the ancient lemurs appeared (<a id="a85_956"></a>[UB 61:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p2_10) and <a id="a85_1004"></a>[UB 62:1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p1)). A tribe of mammals returned to the sea, becoming whales, seals, dolphins, porpoises and sea lions (<a id="a85_1143"></a>[UB 61:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p2_11)). The majority of modern birds already existed. 20 million years ago, the first deer appeared, deer, oxen, camels, bison, rhinoceroses, elephants (<a id="a85_1334"></a>[UB 61:3.5-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p3_5) and 6 ). 5 million years ago, the horse reached its current point of evolution (<a id="a85_1458"></a>[UB 61:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p4_5)).

1,500,000 years ago, descendants of the ancient lemurs of North America who had migrated to Asia, produced the mammalian precursors of man (62:2), followed in their seventieth generation by the intermediate mammals (62:3). Barely established, the third mutation, the primates (<a id="a87_277"></a>[UB 61:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p6_1) and 62:4), emerged. 1 million years ago, the first two human beings, Andon and Fonta (<a id="a87_405"></a>[UB 61:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p6_2); <a id="a87_448"></a>[UB 62:5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p5) and [UB 63](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63) 63), finally appeared from the superior stock of primates. 500,000 years ago, from the same Andonic family emerged the six colored races (<a id="a87_661"></a>[UB 61:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p7_4) and [UB 64](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64)). To these human races, we must add the two races imported from elsewhere, the Nodites, descendants of the staff of Caligastia, and the Adamites, descendants of Adam and Eve.

There you have it! I hope that observing these two tables compared to the information received from the revealers about the adjutant mental spirits will have helped you to get a better idea of their essential role for our material and intellectual evolution leading towards the spiritual in our case! So, the next time you want a ham or a chicken breast, think about what you inflicted on them to feed yourself knowing that the plant kingdom would have served the same purpose! This living plant kingdom, if I interpret correctly what the revealers tell us, and who describe it as primitive, this kingdom falls into the category of “preadjutant mental spirits” defining themselves as having a non-experiential mental level and under the ministry of the Master Physical Controllers. The plant being a non-teachable and mechanical level of consciousness (<a id="a89_853"></a>[UB 42:10.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p10_3)). Indeed, considering the collaboration between plants and fungi (mycorrhiza) at the root level (symbiotic association) and the intercommunication they have between them, similar to the internet network connecting all the computers in the world, we can see that a certain control is undoubtedly carried out by the Master Physical Controllers for the vital maintenance of vegetation and the maintenance of life on the planet. In addition, it has been scientifically proven that a plant attacked by insect pests releases chemical signals to alert neighboring plants to secrete a defensive substance, proof that this plant life reacts to attacks, therefore has a certain level of consciousness, even minimal or at least automatic!
