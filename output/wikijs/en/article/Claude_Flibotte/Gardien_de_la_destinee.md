In this study we will see that the work of our guardian angels, also called seraphic guardians of destiny, is accomplished through our mental circuit as does our Adjuster (<a id="a20_172"></a>[UB 117:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p7_1)) although there does not appear to be any coordination between these two entities.

## Origin of the seraphim

The seraphim are a creation of the Divine Minister of our local universe of Nebadon (<a id="a25_85"></a>[UB 38:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/38#p1_1)). The Divine Minister being a daughter of the Infinite Spirit, the God of the mind. Although the seraphim are of spiritual nature and origin (<a id="a25_269"></a>[UB 38:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/38#p2_1)), they work as much on the spiritual level as on the physical level (<a id="a25_380"></a>[UB 38:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/38#p2_3)). This observation logically includes the intermediate level between the two levels described above, that is, in relation to its human subject, the morontia level of the soul and the intellect or material mind.

In the descending order of divine gifts concerning the mind, we observe the Infinite Mind of the Third Source and Center, a mind of absolute level (<a id="a27_148"></a>[UB 3:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p1_8)). The Infinite Spirit distributes the cosmic mind to all the superuniverses through its seven primary creations, the Seven Master Spirits (<a id="a27_327"></a>[UB 9:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/9#p4_3)). Taking over in each local universe, the Divine Ministers distribute a mental circuit, either morontia or material, according to the status of the receiving creatures (<a id="a27_536"></a>[UB 9:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/9#p5_4)). This human material mind is then associated with both energy (by the body) and spirit (by integrated spiritual values) (<a id="a27_698"></a>[UB 9:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/9#p6_5)). The greater the distance between them, the more the function of the mind is observable (<a id="a27_828"></a>[UB 9:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/9#p6_7)). This means that a typically materialistic thought observed in a human being is far removed from what is the essence of the spirit nature.

The mental gravity of the Infinite Spirit is manifest throughout the cosmos. In our universe this mental energy is bestowed by our Divine Minister. To picture this mental gravity, imagine all of Nebadon bathed in this presence of our Creative Mother, like the atmosphere that covers our entire planet. Here and there are a multitude of points of concentration of this mental energy. Each point is the focus of a creature's mental circuit. Thus our Divine Minister is constantly connected with us, dispensing mental energy, the evolving ministry of the seven adjutant mind-spirits culminating in her spiritual circuit of the Holy Spirit. To picture it another way, it might resemble the vast nebulae of space where stars are born.

## The mind, means used by the seraphim for their ministry

By what means can we conclude that the seraphim minister to our minds? A host of quotes in ***The Urantia Book*** mention this. It is interesting to note that their work with humans takes into account three categories, including intelligence, the result of biological heredity, culture, state of health, available means and the motivation of the subject concerned, which they subdivide into three classes. There are those whose mind is below normal; then those whose mind is normal; finally those whose mind is above normal. Here are some examples of quotes (the bold is mine):

> ...Seraphim are **mind stimulators**; they continually seek to promote circle-making decisions in human mind. (<a id="a40_113"></a>[UB 113:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p4_1))

> ... the seraphim is the **teacher of man’s evolving nature**—in this life the mortal mind, in the next the morontia soul. On the mansion worlds you will be conscious and aware of seraphic instructors, but in the first life men are usually unaware of them. (<a id="a42_259"></a>[UB 113:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p4_2))

> One of the most important things a destiny guardian does for her mortal subject is **to effect a personal co-ordination of the numerous impersonal spirit influences** which indwell, surround, and impinge upon the mind and soul of the evolving material creature. Human beings are personalities, and it is exceedingly difficult for nonpersonal spirits and prepersonal entities to make direct contact with such highly material and discretely personal minds. In the ministry of the guarding angel **all of these influences are more or less unified** and made more nearly appreciable by the expanding moral nature of the evolving human personality. (<a id="a44_647"></a>[UB 113:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p3_1))

> More especially can and does this seraphic guardian **correlate** the manifold agencies and influences of the Infinite Spirit, ranging from the domains of the physical controllers and the adjutant mind-spirits up to the Holy Spirit of the Divine Minister and to the Omnipresent Spirit presence of the Paradise Third Source and Center. Having thus unified and made more personal these vast ministries of the Infinite Spirit, the seraphim then undertakes **to correlate this integrated influence of the Conjoint Actor with the spirit presences of the Father and the Son**. (<a id="a46_574"></a>[UB 113:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p3_2))

> And herein is revealed the reason why the seraphic guardian eventually becomes the **personal custodian of the mind patterns, memory formulas, and soul realities** of the mortal survivor during that interval between physical death and morontia resurrection. (<a id="a48_261"></a>[UB 113:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p3_4))

> The guarding seraphim is **constantly manipulating the mortal environment** for the purpose of **augmenting the cosmic insight of the human ascender** to the end that such a survival candidate may acquire enhanced realization of the presence of the indwelling Adjuster and thus be enabled to yield increased co-operation with the spiritual mission of the divine presence. (<a id="a50_375"></a>[UB 113:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p4_4))

> Angels do not invade the sanctity of the human mind; (<a id="a52_56"></a>[UB 113:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p5_1))

> Upon your death, **your records, identity specifications, and the morontia entity of the human soul**—conjointly evolved by the ministry of mortal mind and the divine Adjuster—**are faithfully conserved by the destiny guardian** together with all other values related to your future existence, everything that constitutes you, the real you, except the identity of continuing existence represented by the departing Adjuster and the actuality of personality. (<a id="a54_460"></a>[UB 113:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p6_1))

> The guardian seraphim is the custodial trustee of the survival values of mortal man’s slumbering soul... (<a id="a56_108"></a>[UB 113:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p6_5))

> ...Already have the Universal Censors arbitrarily taken from these disobedient and unfaithful guardians all aspects of their soul trusts and lodged these morontia realities for safekeeping in the custody of volunteer seconaphim. (<a id="a58_232"></a>[UB 113:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p6_10))

Since our seraphim are so adept at unifying all the spiritual ministries around us here below, and our guardian angels know us better than we know ourselves, it is easily conceivable that they will be precious and invaluable guides during our resurrection on the mansion worlds.

## Destiny of guardian angels

Once arrived on the mansion world, our accompanying seraphim (there were two of them) openly become our companions. While continuing to stimulate us in our morontia and spiritual progress, they study in the complementary schools for evolutionary seraphim (<a id="a64_256"></a>[UB 113:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p7_2)). Eventually, it will be they who will certify our union with our Adjuster (<a id="a64_376"></a>[UB 113:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p7_4)).

After confirming the mastery of the lessons of the Satania system, our faithful companions will accompany us to Edentia and its seventy spheres of advanced social training (<a id="a66_173"></a>[UB 15:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p7_6)). The next stage will continue in the Melchizedek schools surrounding Salvington comprising 490 spheres of progress (<a id="a66_332"></a>[UB 35:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p3_1)). Next, they will take us to Salvington to meet Michael of Nebadon, our brother-father. The adventure of time does not end there, our guardian angels will follow us through the minor and major sectors of the superuniverse until the final moment when a seconaphim will take us on the long journey to Havona (<a id="a66_681"></a>[UB 113:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p7_4)).

A few follow their ward through Havona, but the rest bid their temporary farewells for the crossing of the Seraphington circles. They will be ready on the shores of Paradise to greet their former mortal associates upon awakening from the final sleep of transition from time to eternity. We, as finaliters, will be admitted to the Paradise finaliter corps, and our faithful companions will enter various departments of the finaliter corps and the Seraphic Corps of Completion (<a id="a68_476"></a>[UB 113:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p7_5)).

This friendship between man and angel will never end, because it will always be possible to communicate. The affectionate bonds woven between man and angel will never be forgotten (<a id="a70_181"></a>[UB 113:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p7_6))! ■
