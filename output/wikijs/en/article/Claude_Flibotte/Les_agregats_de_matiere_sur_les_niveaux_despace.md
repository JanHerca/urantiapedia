Hello dear readers of your journal Réflectivité!

In this article we will glimpse the grandeur and magnificence of the immense aggregations of matter located on the outer space levels, at least on the first level. It is revealed to us now that “at least seventy thousand aggregations of matter, each larger than any superuniverse of the present time” are being prepared for the coming ages of the universe. We all have a great interest in knowing these stellar immensities, for we will be called, as members of the Corps of the Finality, to some future service in these outer space universes.

In order to situate ourselves in this immense cosmos, we know from the revelators, beginning “_from the most distant system of inhabited worlds to the center of the superuniverse is just under two hundred and fifty thousand light years_” (<a id="a24_239"></a>[UB 32:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p2_11)). Which gives us a diameter of five hundred thousand light years for Orvonton. It is written that between the superuniverses and the first level of outer space there is a quiet zone whose width averages four hundred thousand light years (<a id="a24_521"></a>[UB 12:1.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p1_14)). Then, “_about half a million light years beyond the periphery of the present grand universe, we observe the beginnings of a zone of incredible energetic activity increasing in volume and intensity over a distance of more than twenty-five million light years_.” Logically, we can deduce that if this zone increases in intensity over twenty-five million light-years, it decreases over an equally large distance. Therefore, the total thickness would be fifty million light-years. This being the region of the first level of outer space.
<br style="clear:both;"/>

It is also revealed to us that more than “fifty million light-years beyond the outermost region of the phenomena of the first level of outer space” the physicists of Uversa have detected warning signs of manifestations of force (<a id="a27_229"></a>[UB 12:1.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p1_15)). This would be the organization of the material creations of the second level of outer space. I leave you to imagine and deduce the colossal dimensions of the third and fourth levels of outer space! William S. Sadler Jr. has made a detailed study of this in his Appendix XVI which you can read on the Urantia Foundation website.

So, let's leave our solar system and go explore these immense clusters found so far by our Urantian astronomers! Depending on the direction the telescopes are pointing, the clusters listed in the following list are either on the superuniverse level or in the first level of outer space or even in the second level. I would like to point out that all the illustrations are from the _Simply Space_ website. Each of the clusters described in this list contains billions of galaxies, nebulae, quasars, stars, etc.

## The Bouvier super cluster

It contains 2 super clusters. The closest is 830 million light years away. The second is 1 billion light years away.

There you have it! I hope that this foray into the realm of outer space has been useful in giving you an idea, even partial, of what the Father has planned for us!
