_Samuel Heine_
Reunion Island

Another little thought I had this morning that has nothing to do with the previous message is that; the faculty of imagination and visualization of our consciousness “always precedes words”, I have come to think that it is precisely imagination and visualization that have led man to speak, write and conceptualize on the basis of the material environment in which he lives.

This is why it is often difficult to understand certain things which are revealed in _The Urantia Book_, especially concerning that which is beyond space and time. This is why the Adjuster (which is us) causes us to perceive and feel things which are difficult to express and yet can be “sensed visually and inwardly.”

I don't know if you will understand, but I find this faculty of the soul extraordinary. The seeker of truth born of faith and who has an intimate relationship with God is automatically in relationship with the spirit of truth, and it is in this sense and with balance that there is something transformative at the level of the soul when we immerse ourselves in the revelations contained in the _Urantia Book_.

The revelators knew very well what they were doing and the midwayers who know us best have helped to give us the life and teachings of Jesus in a modern form or one adapted to the mentality of the times in which we live.

The insights or illuminations we may have are indisputable proof that God is working in us, because we are engaged in this conscious partnership.

You may find what is written useless or incomprehensible, but in fact, it is an encouragement (Smile).

> “The great challenge to modern man is to achieve better communication with the divine Monitor that dwells within the human mind. Man’s greatest adventure in the flesh consists in the well-balanced and sane effort to advance the borders of self-consciousness out through the dim realms of embryonic soul-consciousness in a wholehearted effort to reach the borderland of spirit-consciousness—contact with the divine presence. Such an experience constitutes God-consciousness, an experience mightily confirmative of the pre-existent truth of the religious experience of knowing God. Such spirit-consciousness is the equivalent of the knowledge of the actuality of sonship with God. Otherwise, the assurance of sonship is the experience of faith.” (<a id="a33_747"></a>[UB 196:3.34](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_34))

Despite the infinite distance between us and the Universal Father who is at the center of all things, every time we take a step toward Him, He takes a step toward us.

It is give and take in the eternal game (a transaction in which each party grants compensation to the other).

This reminds me of the reflection of Jean François Drouet in the zoom of the international meeting; NOT $=$ Prayer, Adoration, Service.

> _This departure from the more solemn and reverent modes of communication with Deity was a bit disconcerting to his parents, especially to his mother, but there was no persuading him to change; he [Jesus] would say his prayers just as he had been taught, after which he insisted on having “just a little talk with my Father in heaven.”_ (<a id="a48_339"></a>[UB 123:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p3_6))
