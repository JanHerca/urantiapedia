<p style="text-align:center;">
Thank you my God for having put this fabulous revelation of the time in my hands.<br>
What a joy to be able to have a clear perception of my being and its destiny in your creation.<br>
What joy before your greatness hierarchized to us and for us.<br>
What joy to be able to live the adventure of eternal progress with our brothers and sisters.<br>
What joy to be able to be the producers of a new world through the education given to our descendants.<br>
What a joy to finally be freed from an overload of questions in order to be able to live a more fully beautiful and simple life with all our senses.<br>
What a joy to experience your love and to be able to serve with love.<br>
What joy to carry you inside me and to be able to be like you over time.<br>
<br>
Thank you my God.<br>
</p>

Samuel Heine
