Jesus' faith reached the purity of a child's trust. ([UB 196:0.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p0_12))

The child is eminently receptive, he accepts everything that is said to him in this magnificent frame of mind that we could call “Childlike Faith” and in which there is not the shadow of a doubt.

This is how the child sticks to the teachings he has received until confirmation to the contrary.

This is, in my opinion, why Jesus said: “Unless you become like a little child, you will not enter the kingdom.”

(Although Jesus' faith was childish, it was by no means “infantile.”)

> Ultimate universe reality cannot be grasped by mathematics, logic, or philosophy, only by personal experience in progressive conformity to the divine will of a personal God. Neither science, philosophy, nor theology can validate the personality of God. Only the personal experience of the faith sons of the heavenly Father can effect the actual spiritual realization of the personality of God. ([UB 1:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p7_5))

> _Religious experience, being essentially spiritual, can never be fully understood by the material mind; hence the function of theology, the psychology of religion. The essential doctrine of the human realization of God creates a paradox in finite comprehension. It is well-nigh impossible for human logic and finite reason to harmonize the concept of divine immanence, God within and a part of every individual, with the idea of God’s transcendence, the divine domination of the universe of universes. These two essential concepts of Deity must be unified in the faith-grasp of the concept of the transcendence of a personal God and in the realization of the indwelling presence of a fragment of that God in order to justify intelligent worship and validate the hope of personality survival. The difficulties and paradoxes of religion are inherent in the fact that the realities of religion are utterly beyond the mortal capacity for intellectual comprehension._ ([UB 5:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p5_6))

Let us not forget that the progression of our consciousness goes hand in hand with our physical body. (From birth to adulthood to the spiritual worlds and God himself.)

> _On the evolutionary worlds, will creatures traverse three general developmental stages of being: From the arrival of the Adjuster to comparative full growth, about twenty years of age on Urantia, the Monitors are sometimes designated Thought Changers. From this time to the attainment of the age of discretion, about forty years, the Mystery Monitors are called Thought Adjusters. From the attainment of discretion to deliverance from the flesh, they are often referred to as Thought Controllers. These three phases of mortal life have no connection with the three stages of Adjuster progress in mind duplication and soul evolution._ ([UB 107:0.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p0_7))

> _The sum total of personality realization on a material world is contained within the successive conquest of the seven psychic circles of mortal potentiality. Entrance upon the seventh circle marks the beginning of true human personality function. Completion of the first circle denotes the relative maturity of the mortal being. Though the traversal of the seven circles of cosmic growth does not equal fusion with the Adjuster, the mastery of these circles marks the attainment of those steps which are preliminary to Adjuster fusion._ ([UB 110:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_1))

We also understand why it is so important to balance the physical, intellectual and spiritual.

In his search for total fulfillment, the man consecrated to God can live his existence as a fact in his being.

Faith in the existence of God is of no further use to such an individual.

Let us say that with the help of our adjuster we need faith concerning the logical analysis of the why and how of existence and its mechanism.

In this area the fifth revelation is there to help us.

Let us be filled with enthusiasm and confidence towards our Heavenly Father and know that we can concretely and palpably experience his positively constructive influence in our immediate lives.

God does not abandon his own.

> “Behold, the hand of the Lord is not shortened, that it cannot save; nor his ear heavy, that it cannot hear; but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.” ([Isaiah 59.1](/en/Bible/Isaiah/59#v1))
