A spiritual educator shares his individual experience in his progression towards God and this in relation to the level he finds himself at. Souls thirsting for truth take by their own choice and in accordance with mutual affinity what they need to make them grow spiritually.

True spirituality is not formalized or imposed.

This is why, in my humble opinion, any individual devoted in a living and balanced way to God is most certainly at his level a spiritual educator for the brothers and sisters with whom he has an affinity. To give an image, we could say that God is at the top of a mountain and that at the foot of it there are an infinity of different paths, which ultimately at the summit, meet in God.

We are therefore all on different paths, at different levels but nevertheless going towards one and the same destination. We therefore all have, as those consecrated to God in a living and balanced way, prerogatives of love which educate at a spiritual level for our neighbor.

Our differentiated experiences in the ascension towards God will adapt best to the differentiated multiplicity of truth seekers. It is certain that there are, in relation to a certain experience, to a greater intensity of consecration towards God and to a certain innate gift which comes from the Adjuster, spiritual educators who are much more experienced, especially in individual and group sharing. (And I would still say fortunate for humanity that there have always been some who synthesize what they have received in order to bring a more luminous and new meaning of truth.)

But hey[,] whatever happens, no one will state a truth superior to the universal reference of the significant essence of the message of our Creator Son who lived on our earth; “Jesus”. Because he is the only one to have qualitatively emitted a universally unsurpassable truth in a quantitatively minimal and simple way for the greater good of the level of understanding of all.

This is why when I personally read the objectives of our association concerning the training and preparation of teachers and spiritual leaders I was a little apprehensive because I said to myself:

Can we come together with the aim of defining training criteria in order to provide training that would culminate in a diploma for leaders and spiritual educators? I of course ask this question with a humorously fraternal teasing because I know that this is not the objective of our association and that we all know that the answer is of course no because we are talking here about true spirituality and not about plumbing, electricity, or masonry...etc.

A few days ago, following this same subject, one of my brothers made me understand that we are playing on words and that it would undoubtedly be more appropriate to say: “Provide means and resources in order to prepare the emergence of teachers and spiritual leaders”.

I think this way of expressing this objective is much more appropriate and correct than saying: “To train spiritual teachers and leaders.” I will end this text with the personal definition of one of my older brothers concerning spiritual teachers and leaders in the true sense of the term:

“The relationship of the human personality with its source will determine to what extent each human being will know God and make Him known, become divine and be able to love others. His technique of sharing, edifying and building the will of those who seek these sources will determine to what extent he is a spiritual educator. His work can be judged or evaluated according to the results obtained.”

In conclusion, let's wait for the tree to bear fruit so that we can judge it.

United in shared service in association with you and in partnership with the divine hierarchy in the ascending direction.

Samuel Heine
