May every reader of _The Urantia Book_ not stray from the essential.

The main thing is to know that we are all creatures of the one and only creator.

The essential thing is the consecration of choice in the fact of wanting and having to do what we sense to be the will of God.

This individual consecration is the enduring foundation of our eternal progression.

The individual development which results from this consecration will position us in the living fraternity between all our brothers and sisters.

This fraternal nucleus will have such a powerful attraction that a large number would be drawn to it. (Therefore to you.)

It is up to us to be living manifestations of harmony and the gift of love.

God has given us everything and it is in this awareness that it is up to us to give in turn.

What greater gift can we give our brothers and sisters than to give them the opportunity to experience the kingdom of God in eternal progression? Let us remember the words of Jesus to the young man who was afraid!

“Sit by me while I tell you of the paths of service and the highways of happiness that lead from the sorrows of self to the joys of benevolent activities in the brotherhood of men and in the service of the heavenly God.”

This is what we must be for the world! overflowing sources of inspiration and enhanced life.

May we be in our immediate sphere of life selfless spiritual educators filled with overflowing love.

May we submit completely to the greatest of trainers who is God in us.

And may we answer these few questions individually and share our answers with our neighbor who is searching.

How can the consciousness of the human being know God?

How can God be made clear to human thinking?

Is there a method to know God directly, to experience God every moment of the day?

Is there a method that works for all traditional religions, for all spiritual paths, for every human being?

Is there something in the consciousness of human beings that allows them to know God in this way?

Everything in us in the wisdom of God. [I don't understand this formula without the verb JR]

Samuel Heine
