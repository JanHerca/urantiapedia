_Samuel Heine_
Reunion Island

The greatest psychologist or psychotherapist of all time is once again Jesus (Smile).

Jesus was what he said, his message is what he is, and it is what he encourages us to be: “discover who we really are and access our conscious eternity”.

I think there are mainly two obstacles that prevent us from taking on the only challenge that is really worthwhile in a short life: either we are not yet ready and we will have to wait for maturity or a liberating inner crisis, or we do not read carefully enough and we do not put it into practice.

In all cases, our adjuster continues to point us in the right direction.

> “Forewarn all believers regarding the fringe of conflict which must be traversed by all who pass from the life as it is lived in the flesh to the higher life as it is lived in the spirit. To those who live quite wholly within either realm, there is little conflict or confusion, but all are doomed to experience more or less uncertainty during the times of transition between the two levels of living. In entering the kingdom, you cannot escape its responsibilities or avoid its obligations, but remember: The gospel yoke is easy and the burden of truth is light.” (<a id="a30_568"></a>[UB 159:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p3_7))

> Jesus’ religion consisted not merely in *believing,* but in actually *doing,* those things which the gospel required. He did not teach that the essence of his religion consisted in social service, but rather that social service was one of the certain effects of the possession of the spirit of true religion. (<a id="a32_312"></a>[UB 159:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p5_8))
