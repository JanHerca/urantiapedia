Concerning myself and with hindsight over the years, I have been able “for my personal case” to determine some conditions favorable to this kind of spontaneous experience, “difficult to explain” to others except on rare occasions with men or women who have personally had this kind of experience.

Nevertheless, I am one of those who hold on to the “discreet and modest” reserve concerning the fact of going to proclaim from the rooftops this kind of “intimate” experiences which are for many well beyond the objective and rational world. For me, these are intuitive and instantaneous manifestations which are consciously “received” in the association of ideas, but which are not “emitted” by the reasoning faculty of the thinker.

To be aware of it, one must first have attained an introspective and balanced nature of consciousness; it is a rare quality that is acquired over the years through the regular practice of prayer, in-depth meditation and the communion of adoration. When I speak of meditation, I express the regular habit of deep inner reflection that deepens a subject, matures a project or to resolve all the problems of everyday life. We are not always emotionally, mentally and physically in the right frame of mind to consciously receive what some call “the little inner voice”.

First of all, you must have unconditional love for God.

Very often overwork, alcohol, stimulants, poor diet, stress, anxiety, fatigue, negative emotion, headaches or untimely and unchanneled cogitation are factors which do not favor what I call “the practice of the presence of God” as a conscious manifestation of a growing degree of awareness of God in us.

There is therefore preliminary work to be done on oneself which is obtained through a certain “regular and lifelong discipline”. Furthermore, in my opinion, these are gifts of inner experiences which come to us without us needing to run towards them, it is simply natural.

I have realized that the best time for me to receive this kind of enlightenment or revealing intuition often occurs after a good night's sleep, between three and four in the morning when everyone is asleep, or even just before waking up.

This is what I can share without making myself seem like a crank (if I haven't already) who mistakes his dreams for reality.

I think that we must be humble and careful in this area and I agree with Dominikos when he said; "but to know if it came from a simple higher level of my own mind, or from a higher spirit... Who can know? Finally, in all cases, it remains the intimate experience of an individual, in his own relationship with his search for the truth. This can neither be proven nor demonstrated. (To others)

“The experience is normally nothing extraordinary. Here is the sharing of my little experience on this subject which is sometimes very delicate to share.

Friendships.

Samuel. H
