Correspondence of Samuel Heine

New Caledonia

If we put aside the part of the life and teachings of Jesus, the other parts of the book are quite technical and require time, interest and a certain good will to be read and understood as a whole allowing the reader/researcher to make a summary and a coherent synthesis for himself and his life.

Often I have met people who have told me that they bought The Urantia Book and were discouraged from reading it after the introduction.

This is undoubtedly why the emphasis was placed on the importance of coming together in fraternal book study groups and gradually integrating new readers to discuss our understandings and answer the questions of newcomers. (When the groups are too large, simply divide them into smaller groups at the geographical convenience of each.)

Readers of different levels of understanding share and study together the teachings of The Urantia Book.

For a greater realization of this, it is necessary that the oldest ones pray to God to find “researchers” in their surroundings and take “the initiative of contact” to thus bring those interested to join the group. (Sponsorship)

Gard Jameson shared in his article “The Value of Study Groups”: “There is great satisfaction in becoming a member of a group of readers whose primary goal is the in-depth study of The Urantia Book.

A study group has the potential to “expand cosmic consciousness and heighten spiritual perception. These are the two important objectives of the fifth epochal revelation.”

Behind our virtual screens surrounded by forests of fiber and wifi (Smile); the Urantia Ubis book Internet school, the Urantian internet forums and virtual groups like wwis. urantiastudygroup.org are of course practical and useful for “getting known” but also for isolated readers who cannot find a group near their home.

However, for the moment, we can still see that humanity in general is not interested in these things.

All the ideas for making The Urantia Book known are especially good to the extent that there are people who are seeking to know about it.

In a short time I believe; it will no longer be a few readers who will seek to make the Urantia Book known but it will be researchers who will come of their own accord towards the prodigious information contained in the book!

I think humanity is approaching a lot of “inner and outer” readjustments.

We also see it clearly in the various demands of the people, there is a “desire and a will” for social change which is not yet well “defined and realized”.

We could almost see the work of God in the progression of human consciousness! (Smile).

This is why, in my humble opinion, the most “essenkiel” thing for the moment is to:

1. continue the translations and publications of the book throughout the world. (Not forgetting that it is also “but above all” thanks to the generous financial donations and thanks to the voluntary services that this has been achieved over all these years.)
2. continue with pleasure the study of the Urantia book by meeting from time to time with friends to deepen and share our understanding in a fraternal atmosphere. (Without forgetting to let those around you know that all other researchers are welcome!)

I will end this sharing by saying; let's get ready!

New Caledonia is a French territory made up of dozens of islands in the South Pacific. It is known for its palm-fringed beaches and its lagoon, which is conducive to the development of marine life, and at 24,000 square kilometers, is one of the largest in the world. A huge coral reef surrounds the main island, Grande Terre, a popular destination for scuba diving. Noumea, the capital, is home to French-influenced restaurants and luxury boutiques in the style of Paris.
