Let us not underestimate the transformative power of prayer, because it can also allow us to unhinder ourselves, free ourselves or liberate ourselves from all our psychological and emotional limitations in order to be much more fulfilled, happy, filled with love and gratitude day after day.

We must not be afraid to ask God intensely and regularly for help.

There is also the regular practice of spiritual communion of silent worship and the conscious practice of making “all our activities” a Service to our neighbor and to God, for the realization of the program that God has developed for us (smile).

We can probably add balance in all things (intellectual, spiritual and physical).

Let’s be simple, humble and amazed by everything!

I think that already with this we can live much more fulfilled and arrive at the certainty of the presence of God at our side.

It is necessary to water with prayers, a high level of consciousness, water with worship and practice self-giving in service.

It is the living, intimate and personal religiosity between oneself and God. Over time this bears much fruit and makes the soul grow.

It's something we can't do for someone else, we can at most be living and contagious examples of it.

> It is the presence of the divine Spirit, the water of life, that prevents the consuming thirst of mortal discontent and that indescribable hunger of the unspiritualized human mind. Spirit-motivated beings “never thirst, for this spiritual water shall be in them a well of satisfaction springing up into life everlasting.” Such divinely watered souls are all but independent of material environment as regards the joys of living and the satisfactions of earthly existence. They are spiritually illuminated and refreshed, morally strengthened and endowed. ([UB 34:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_8))

## Simple faith

It took me a long time to understand that when we enter the life of simple faith, the life of the spirit (or spiritual level of consciousness), we enter a New World.

We must look ahead and the regrets of the past must be forgotten.

We must accept ourselves as we are, where we are, keeping only the best of ourselves to be even better.

We must stop devaluing ourselves and blaming ourselves (above all, we must “forget ourselves” and stop navel-gazing with “negative resentment”).

The world of Earth creation on which we find ourselves is our starting point and “no one is more perfect or greater than anyone else on Urantia.”

Let us simply be ourselves and humbly let the love within us guide us, for it is from love that all good fruits of the spirit are born.

It is never too late, in the birth of the spirit here and now we are eternally young and everything is to be done, everything is to be achieved with joy and enthusiasm.

It's a state of mind.

“By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to suffer ill-treatment with the people of God than to have the fleeting pleasure of sin.” Hebrews 11:24-25

“The quickest way to get an ulcer is to try to be something you are not.” (smile)

> “. . . Loyal persons are growing persons, and growth is an impressive and inspiring reality. Live loyally today—grow—and tomorrow will attend to itself. The quickest way for a tadpole to become a frog is to live loyally each moment as a tadpole.” ([UB 100:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p1_4))
