Recently, during our “Discovery” study group, while we were discussing “The Ordination Sermon” booklet 140:3, Line St-Pierre, from the AUQ Communications Committee, suggested that we read this text converted to “I” and see the effect.

I highly recommend it after experiencing it.

For a better impact, I suggest you 1. Relax, 2. Collect yourself, 3. Then read this text slowly with the eyes of the heart.

And converted to the “I”s

> “I am sending you out into the world to represent me and to act as ambassadors of my Father’s kingdom, and as you go forth to proclaim the glad tidings, put your trust in the Father whose messengers you are. Do not forcibly resist injustice; put not your trust in the arm of the flesh. If your neighbor smites you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. Be willing to suffer injustice rather than to go to law among yourselves. In kindness and with mercy minister to all who are in distress and in need.”
>
> “I say to you: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, and pray for those who despitefully use you. And whatsoever you believe that I would do to men, do you also to them.”
>
> “Your Father in heaven makes the sun to shine on the evil as well as upon the good; likewise he sends rain on the just and the unjust. You are the sons of God; even more, you are now the ambassadors of my Father’s kingdom. Be merciful, even as God is merciful, and in the eternal future of the kingdom you shall be perfect, even as your heavenly Father is perfect.”
>
> “You are commissioned to save men, not to judge them. At the end of your earth life you will all expect mercy; therefore do I require of you during your mortal life that you show mercy to all of your brethren in the flesh. Make not the mistake of trying to pluck a mote out of your brother’s eye when there is a beam in your own eye. Having first cast the beam out of your own eye, you can the better see to cast the mote out of your brother’s eye.”
>
> “Discern the truth clearly; live the righteous life fearlessly; and so shall you be my apostles and my Father’s ambassadors.. . .” <a id="a66_155"></a>[LU 140:3.14-18](/fr/The_Urantia_Book/140#p3_18)
