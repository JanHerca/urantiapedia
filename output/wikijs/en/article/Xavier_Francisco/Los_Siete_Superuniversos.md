**Introduction by Xavier Francisco**

Document 15 is a very descriptive document where the revelators, more specifically a Universal Censor from Uversa, show the physical, administrative and spiritual organization of the superuniverses, obviously emphasizing Orvonton.

The document consists of 14 points, going from an exposition of the physical properties of the space level of the superuniverses to explaining the different types of ruling personalities in the superuniverses and their divisions. Thus, this summary is organized following each of the points of the document.

## 1. The spatial level of the super universes

This part narrates the position of the different superuniverses in relation to Havona. The superuniverses trace an elliptical orbit around the central universe with their semimajor axis in the north-south direction, thus leaving east and west as the closest points to the central universe. It also indicates the current position of the different superuniverses.

Currently Urantia is on the outskirts of Nebadon, which in turn is on the periphery of Orvonton. It is possible that Urantia is on the north-pointing periphery of Orvonton.

## 2. The organization of the superuniverses

At this point we find the different divisions of a superuniverse, the number of minor elements that compose them and their rulers or administrators:

- System: 1,000 habitable worlds, ruled by a System Sovereign.
- Constellation: 100 systems, ruled by a Vorondadek Son and with a Faithful of Days as observer and ambassador of the Trinity.
- Local Universe: 100 constellations, governed by a Creator Son (Michael). It has a Union of Days as a representative of the Trinity.
- Minor Sector: 100 local universes, administered by 3 Recents of the Days.
- Major Sector: 100 minor sectors, presided over by 3 Perfections of Days. - Superuniverse: 10 major sectors, governed by 3 Ancients of Days.
- Great Universe: 7 superuniverses, administered indirectly and reflectively by the 7 Master Spirits.


## 3. The Orvonton Superuniverse

This part shows the view of the Orvonton superuniverse from Urantia, emphasizing the limitations to its observation. The Milky Way is the center of the superuniverse. Our astronomers have observed 8 of Orvonton's 10 major sectors. The core of the physical system to which the solar system belongs is the center of the ancient Andronover Nebula, a once spiral nebula, now slightly deformed into a globular shape due to the approach of another nebula. Urantia occupies a central position in one of the arms of this distorted spiral.

The limitations in the observation of the stars on Urantia are due to the rotations of the different stellar bodies and divisions:

- The movement of the Earth around the Sun
- The journey of our solar system
- The rotation of the Andronover star family
- The path of Nebadon around the center of its minor sector.


## 4. Nebulae

The formation of physical systems is not due to chance, but obeys an intelligent plan. The nebulae are originated by the paradise organizers of the force. These nebulae are not related to any administrative division. They can give material for one or several local universes. Not all spiral nebulae are responsible for producing suns; there are few active in Orvonton at this time.

The Milky Way is made up of old nebulae, but most of them have not lost their original shape due to the different gravitational accidents that have occurred over time.

## 5. The origin of space bodies

The mass of the suns and planets originates in the nebulae and the power directors do little directly (excepting the architectural spheres).

Based on their origin, the suns and planets can be of 10 types:

- Concentric concentration rings.
- Star whirlwinds
- Gravitational explosion planets (our solar system, for example)
- Planetary centrifugal daughters
- Spheres with deficiencies in gravity - Contracted stars
- Cumulative spheres (dense and dark islands, for example)
- Suns consumed
- Spheres produced by collisions
- Architectural worlds


## 6. The spheres of space

Except for the architectural spheres, the spheres of space have an evolutionary origin in the sense that they have not been brought into existence by direct action of divine will. The spheres of space can be classified as follows:

- Suns: accelerators of energy circulation
- Dark Space Islands: Gravity Balance Wheels
- Minor space bodies: comets, meteors, etc. Comets prove that light has weight, that it is a real substance.
- Planets: in the case of our solar system, there are only 3 planets that could harbor life.


## 7. Architectural spheres

The architectural spheres are custom-made worlds, with their sun emitting light without heat. The heat is received from the different currents of energy that circulate on its surface.

In the headquarters of the superuniverses, time is standardized. One Orvonton day is equal to 30 Urantia days. The Orvonton year lasts 100 superuniverse days, which is about 8 of our years.

The headquarters worlds are based on paradise archetypes. These are the ones that we will visit in our career towards Paradise:

- Jerusem, headquarters of the local system of Satania
- Edentia, seat of the constellation Norlatiadek
- Salvington, headquarters of the local universe of Nebadon
- Umenor the third, headquarters of the minor sector of Ensa
- Umayor the fifth, headquarters of the major sector of Splandon
- Uversa, home of the superuniverse of Orvonton.

## 8. The control and regulation of energy

These spheres regulate the energy and power of your sphere.

The power centers and physical controllers partially direct and control the 30 energy systems of gravity. They are intelligent beings but devoid of will.

The energy has a speed that varies according to the mass that is in its way and according to the criteria of these energetic controllers. Hot or charged objects also slow down the energy. Gravity would end up converting all energy into mass if it weren't for energy controllers, or because mass tends to disintegrate under extreme conditions.

## 9. The circuits of the superuniverses

The following paradise circuits permeate the 7 superuniverses:

- Universal Father Personality Gravity Circuit
- Eternal Son Spirit Gravity Circuit
- Joint Actor Mental Gravity Circuit
- Circuit of material gravity of the Eternal Island.

We also have another series of circuits and activities in the superuniverses, such as:

- The activities of the Absolutes and experiential deities
- The circuits of the superuniverses:
- Cosmic Mind Circuit
- Circuit of the reflecting service of the 7 Reflecting Spirits
- Thought Adjuster Circuit
- Circuit of the Eternal Son with his paradisiacal Sons
- The presence of the Infinite Spirit
- Transmissions from Paradise
- Circuits of power centers and physical controllers
- The circuits of the local universes:
- The Spirit of Truth
- The Holy Spirit
- Ministry of Intelligence: Helping Mind Spirits.

The local universes are admitted to the councils of the Ancients of Days when they have established themselves in light and life. Nebadon isn't even physically stabilized.

## 10. The rulers of the superuniverses

The superuniverses are isolated from one another, and this will be so until the Supreme is fully manifested and takes over the rule of the superuniverses.

## 11. The deliberative assembly

The deliberative assembly of the super universe is limited to the headquarters world. This legislative or advisory council is composed of seven chambers, and all local universes admitted to superuniverse councils elect a native representative to each chamber.

## 12. The Supreme Courts

In the headquarters of the superuniverses the sentences of extinction of the creatures are carried out, and only there. These sentences are not appealable.

## 13. The governments of the sectors

As for the major sectors, their government is related to the intellectual state. For this reason, the training that is given in the satellites that surround its headquarters is also of an intellectual nature.

Minor sector governments are primarily concerned with physical control and stabilization.

The local system headquarters are the only ones that do not have Trinity representatives.

## 14. The goals of the seven superuniverses

Each of the superuniverses is the expression of an objective. Orvonton, our superuniverse, is a universal demonstration of love and mercy.

Our world, Urantia, is the 606th world of Satania, containing a total of 619 inhabited worlds, with 200 more worlds in a condition to one day be inhabited. Satania is system number 24 of the constellation Norlatiadek, which in turn is number 70 of the local universe of Nebadon, number 84 of the minor sector of Ensa, number 3 of the major sector of Splandon, number 5 of Orvonton . The Urantia census number in the grand universe is 5,334,482,337,666.

Many readers agreed to identify the Orvonton superuniverse with the Milky Way, along with a few other star clusters. The Orvonton superuniverse is still growing, so it is a long way from physical stabilization. Since this comes when the entire superuniverse is established in light and life, it follows that physical stabilization is an achievement of human beings.

When the superuniverse is complete, it will increase in size, which currently seems very small to us; it is sure to host more suns and planets as time goes on.

There is a great disproportion between the absolute gravity used in the superuniverses and Havona (5%), compared to that which would be destined for outer space. This does not necessarily mean that outer space needs the current remaining 95%. Creation has not begun its final act. Much remains to be written in the work of creation.

The Book sometimes uses the term “galaxy”, sometimes identifying it with “superuniverse” (in this document it even speaks of the “seventh galaxy”). It is believed that the talk of superuniverses and galaxies interchangeably is done intentionally by the developers. On the other hand, it is very difficult to match the data provided by the Book with current science.

We could say as a conclusion that the universe is immense and that it is physically distributed on one side and administratively on the other, just as happens analogously on Earth. But even so, despite its immensity, we are at the beginning of Creation. A job awaits us all in eternity, most likely in the unfinished creation of outer space.

There is a pre-established purpose in creation. The seven superuniverses will be the kingdom of the Supreme; outer space will be the kingdom of the Ultimate. What will be the kingdom of God Absolute?
