We are involved in a movement and not in a Church. Movement is related to the Latin 'movere' which means to move. So it has to move!

In fact, things can only evolve through individuals. Each of us has our place, each of us must ask ourselves the question: Do I believe in these teachings? If the answer is no, just leave it at that. If the answer is yes, we must do something. But what? Nothing and no one can say what each person should do, it is always a personal choice. However, it is possible to think about what is possible.

Several historical data should help us here.

First of all, this idea that the book was given long before the time of its world mission. What does this _long before_ represent? A completely personal hypothesis, at least the time that the Seraphim of Progress replace the angels of the Churches to promote the _Urantia Book_, that is to say around 2035.

Then the idea that the study groups were instituted not for a large audience to study the book, but to train **teachers** and **leaders**. The study group is for essentially internal use, it recruits from those who have already read the book and as its name indicates it studies the book, it is neither a prayer group nor a social action group.

Finally, in parallel with this relatively closed internal structure, every freedom is left to individual initiative to attract those from outside who have not yet read the book or even heard of it. In a memorandum on the dissemination of The Urantia Book, Dr. Sadler writes: “One thing, however, should be clear. Nothing should be done to interfere with the energetic and enthusiastic efforts of any individual to present The Urantia Book to his various human contacts and associations.”

There are therefore two very different levels, the study group which studies, and the individuals of this group who, alone or together, can take action initiatives to promote teachings or social actions directed inwards or outwards.

Let's take some examples. First, inward.

I am not rich, I will not be able to finance the activities of the associations which ask me for money, but I know how to write and I will allow everyone to benefit from my thoughts by writing one or two articles for the Lien or for the Journal of the AUI.

Or, I would like to share some of my ideas, but I feel that my written expression is unsatisfactory. Never mind, there will always be a few “ghostwriters” who will correct me and, with their help, other people will be able to benefit from my experiences.

I am not rich but I have free time, I take charge of one of the association's activities such as responding to new readers, informing those responsible for the Link about events, placing books in libraries... You should know that any commitment of this order takes much more time than you might imagine at the beginning and that availability in the medium term is essential.

I am modestly wealthy and I can invest, admittedly very modestly, and at a loss, in one of the many AUI projects. Donations for the placement of books in libraries, funds for translations, general financial aid to the AFLUB or the AUI.

I am very busy with my activities, but I am reasonably wealthy and/or I have wealthy friends or acquaintances that I can call upon, I can help finance the activities of the AFLUB or the AUI.

So, a few years ago, when there was a meeting in France, there was always the indication that those who could not afford the pension could be supported by the Association (in fact what we call generous donors). This practice has disappeared due to lack of means. Wouldn't it be good if it could be reinstated, for example for certain young people? A donation specifying employment can always be made.

Of course, the action can also be manifested outwardly, noting that the greatest caution is required.

There are dozens of possible actions outside this framework, actions in civil society in which the _Urantia Book_ does not need to be mentioned, but in which the <ins>Teachings</ins> of the book can be put into practice and mentioned. There are already numerous texts which refer to what the UB calls service.

One last example. Would it not be good and easy, in these so-called gloomy times, to present some of the quotes from the chapter on morontia mota, even if it is only the following one?

We must abandon anxiety. The most difficult disappointments to bear are those that never happen ([UB 48:7.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_21)) But there are many others.
