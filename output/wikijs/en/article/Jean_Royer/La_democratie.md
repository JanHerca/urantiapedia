There is no single _Urantia Book_ viewpoint on democracy. On the one hand, we are told: _Neither democracy nor any other political panacea will replace spiritual progress._ ([UB 195:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_10)) _Popular elections do not always decide the right thing to do, but they represent the right way to make even a mistake._ ([UB 71:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p2_8))

We are also warned of the dangers of democracy: _For these are the dangers of democracy_:

> _La glorification de la médiocrité._
> _Le choix des chefs ignorants et vils._
> _L'incapacité de reconnaître les faits fondamentaux de l'évolution sociale._
> _Le danger du suffrage universel aux mains de majorités frustes et indolentes._
> _L'obéissance servile à l'opinion publique ; la majorité n'a pas toujours raison._ <a id="a44_85"></a>[LU 71:2.1-6](/fr/The_Urantia_Book/71#p2_1)

On the other hand, we are told that democracy is an ideal ([UB 71:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p2_1)) and that this democratic ideal is found on Uversa ([UB 15:11.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p11_1))

On all issues that did not involve survival, what Jesus called “matters of no spiritual importance,” he applied democratic principles. The best illustration of this is the way he operated in the practical questions that arose between his apostles and those of John. Jesus left them to their discussions on problems such as: prayer, meetings between the two groups, baptism and repentance, financial questions, etc. And they voted, it seems, unanimously. ([UB 144:6.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p6_11))

In light of what we know, it is unlikely that Jesus would have personally supported certain decisions, such as preaching “Repent and be baptized,” yet upon his return he “heard the account of their deliberations, listened to their decisions, and said, 'These then are your conclusions; I will help each of you to put into practice the spirit of your joint decisions.'” ([UB 144:6.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p6_12))

This is because he knew _that evolution does not instantly produce superlative perfection, but rather a comparative adjustment with practical progress._ ([UB 71:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p2_8))

Question: To what extent are we prepared to accept democratic decisions that do not go our way?
