Is there a version of The Urantia Book that we don't know about? A number of points lead us to believe that there is.

1. Jesus spoke Aramaic with his apostles.
2. During his trip to Rome with Ganid and Gonod he had to express himself partly in the common language of the time, namely, Greek.
3. In Rome itself, and with the common people, it is probable that he had to speak Latin.
4. We do not know in what language the Urmia talks took place.
5. We also do not know in what language Rodan spoke, was it Hebrew or Greek?
6. The mediators charged with revelation keep telling us things like: This is what Jesus said, transcribed in modern phraseology.
7. The bestowal of Jesus was known to all beings of all levels higher than that of humans at that time.
8. This bestowal was not only upon our planet but upon all of Nebadon.

It therefore had a historical character for our entire universe and it is doubtful that the words of Jesus' teaching were not collected “verbatim” by those who attended this teaching.

The question is therefore more about where the archives are located than whether these archives really exist. It is likely that they are on Salvington.

Records are known to come in three forms: material, morontia, and spiritual.

Who can view them? We'll assume anyone who reaches Salvington.

Are they frequently consulted? As far as the material archives are concerned, the number of consultants must not be very large because neither Hebrew, nor Aramaic, nor Greek, nor Latin are really part of the curriculum of the languages of the angels with the exception of those of Satania and a few student visitors.

Besides, if we asked the Archivists, they would tell us: “And that’s good, otherwise we would be overloaded with work.”

But for those of us who are a little curious, it's high time to get into these languages, some translation surprises await us up there.
