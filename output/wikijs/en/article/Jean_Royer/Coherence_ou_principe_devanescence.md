Our Australian friends who publish the excellent magazine “Interface International” have a section that should interest many French speakers, it is called “consistency” and examines The Urantia Book from its logical or non-contradictional aspects. At first glance, one of the things that seems to have most impressed a certain number of readers is the logic of the book, but is it as solid as we want to believe? Are there not contradictions, real or apparent in these 2097 pages? The electronic version allows us to verify what would otherwise be almost impossible or at least very random. For me, it is a test, provided that we remember two things:

1. As Emerson said, “a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds” and
2. that The Urantia Book was given to us in the 20th century because the first steps toward a non-Aristotelian logic had been taken by people like Korzybski allowing us, for the first time, to envisage at the same time an infinite static God and an evolutionary God in the finite.

So I shamelessly borrow the first example from our Australian friends in the hope that it will spark research here:

Page <a id="a44_5"></a>[UB 29:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p5_7) we read: “_The Master Force Organizers withstand temperatures and operate under physical conditions that would be intolerable even to the power centers and physical controllers of Orvonton, whose abilities are so varied. The ***only other*** types of beings revealed to be capable of operating in these outer space realms are the Solitary Messengers and the Inspired Spirits of the Trinity_.” Are these really the only ones? In <a id="a44_475"></a>[UB 29:4.36](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_36) we can read: “_They_ (the Frandalanks) _operate interchangeably in the central universe, the superuniverses and the outer space domains._” Similarly, in <a id="a44_672"></a>[UB 107:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p6_5) we can read: “_It is perfectly possible that they_ (the Mystery Monitors) _could even penetrate the outer space levels, they could certainly follow the gravitational presence of Paradise in these regions._” Is there a contradiction between these statements? It is up to you to think about it and find other problems of this type.

In fact, what is the search for coherence is part of a larger concept, of what our friend Antonio Moya Cerpa calls “the principle of elusiveness” which I have freely translated as principle of evanescence. In any study relating to a complex problem and which is not simply formal, what seems simple at the beginning always ends up showing a phase which refuses to fit the mold. We thought we had something and it escapes us.
