**EMERGENCE**

The three seas languished in the warmth of their waves
The inert salts still united their cleavage
In bristling shapes breaking on the shore
When the life bearers came to give them a soul.
Microcosm snatched from the carbon cycle
The vital DNA double helix is stirring
Multiplying mono- or trilobite forms
From proto to meta it's the sea that boils.
Then the earth turned green and the first reptiles
Swell into dinosaurs. In the shadow of their tails
The first lemurs were fierce and fragile.
From brain to brain and until the last leap,
Primates are breaking away from their ancestral lines
Finally Ecce Andon stands on its two legs.

**PRO MACHIVENTA**

Enough Caligastia, we must leave this world,
Regrets have no place among the Lanonandeks.
Satania's lightning at the last second
Through your nothingness shines in Norlatiadek.
So in Nebadon the chain of archangels
Seal in the light the rediscovered unity
And since Salvington the council of evangelists
Shout from Jerusem the renewed glory.
Lucifer is no more, Satan, Caligastia,
Only Michael sighs in Manotia
May the moment be marked with the seal of the Chronoldeks
Then the comforter of the world of the cross,
Christ, the Creator Son, said in a lowered voice:
Come down to them Machiventa Melchizedek.

Jean Royer
