The embalmed body of the suffering Christ
Lay in the cold of Joseph's tomb,
The shroud only covered his form without fief,
Already the work of time was destroying hope.

The celestial armies devoid of power
Felt morontia and matter vibrating everywhere
Manipulated by those from the Isle of Light.
Jesus median form begins to move.

The chief archangel approaches Gabriel
Allows, he said finally, that the carnal form
From the Creator, escapes an infamous fate.

The Most High of Edentia responds to their call,
And the form of the Son at this decree of heaven
By the heavenly sons is reduced to nothing.

Jean Royer
