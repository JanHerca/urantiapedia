Some women are outraged that the revised version kept the term “excited” in [UB 190:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p2_5) “_It has not been seen only by <ins>excited women</ins>; even brave men have begun to see it. I expect to see it myself._”

They find that it would have been better to translate “***<ins>excited</ins>***” as enthusiastic. However, we must always remember that the text must take into account the period. Those who speak are rough Galileans from the first century. If they were people from the 19th century, we would have found the word 'hysterical' there. The term is known from the _Urantia Book_, it is found in [UB 90:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/90#p1_2). But there is also the linguistic aspect that must be taken into account. If “_exciting_” used as an adjective means exciting, excited does indeed mean excited. Here is what the Larousse dictionary says about this term: _excited [Ik'saıtıd] adjective_

1. _[enthusiastic, eager] excited: to be excited about or at something = to be excited by something; the children were excited at the prospect of going to the seaside = the children were very excited at the prospect of going to the seaside; you must be very excited at being chosen to play for your country = you must be overjoyed at having been chosen to play for your country; don't get too excited = don't get too excited_
2. _[agitated] don't go getting excited, don't get excited = ne va pas te nerver_
3. _[sexually] excited_
4. _excited physics_

And here is what the Merriam-Webster writes: “_being in a state of increased activity or agitation_”; Synonyms agitated, excited, frenzied, heated, hectic, hyperactive, overactive, overwrought.

Refusing ***excitées*** would be a bit like refusing the word 'bitch' in Zola's text on the pretext that it is often pejorative. Or even refusing the use of the word 'comrade' in [UB 120:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p1_1) to translate “_comrade_”, on the pretext that it is recently associated with a communist connotation.

On this subject, I rediscovered that life is made of false memories. I was convinced that I had seen a note on the translators' site about the word “comrade”; well, this note does not exist and, I beat my breast, the translators let the translation of the previous editions pass without comment. Certainly, this does not change the general meaning of the text but it seems to me that it makes it less striking.

**JW** translated “_comrade_” as '_my dear companion_' and the proofreaders kept this name, wrongly, in my opinion. It also seems that the French translation influenced the other translations because we find the expression “_compaňero mio_” in Spanish, “_irmāo e companheiro_” in Portuguese and even “_Freund_” in German. As for Italian it is: “_mio caro compagno_”, a copy of French.

The English text is not prudish. In [UB 147:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p5_3), it is a question of “_brothels_” that is to say brothels. The French did not dare to use the term and said house of prostitution, just like the Poles “_domów publicznych_” the Romanians “_case de toleranţ̣̆ _” The Spanish say “burdeles” and the Italians “bordelli” the Portuguese “bordéis” the Germans “_Edelbordells_” the Dutch “_bordelen_” the Swedes “_bordeller_” the Estonians “_bordelli_”.
