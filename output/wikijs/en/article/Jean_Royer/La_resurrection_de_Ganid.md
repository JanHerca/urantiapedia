_The resurrection of Ganid seen by his guardian angel_

In the dim light of the resurrection room Ganid opens his eyes.

“Welcome to you, Ganid,” I said in his native language.

“_I am your guardian angel and you are now on the first world of the Father's houses._”

Ganid sees me for the first time and is astonished. He does not yet know that he is endowed with morontia vision and looks with astonishment at the six fingers of his hand.

“Do you remember the one you called Master when, with your father, you traveled the Mediterranean world?

“Yes, his name was Joshua ben Joseph and we met him in Palestine.”

“_Well, he has expressed his intention to see you as soon as you arrive on this world, but you will be surprised because you will see him in glory, the Master is indeed Mayor Son since his return from the planet Earth, which we here call Urantia; in fact, he is the Creator Son of this universe and now reigns over more than three million planets._”

“_But then_,” said Ganid, “_I won't recognize him._”

“_Don't worry, he has kept all his human qualities. Come on, come with me._”

We came out of the room and Michael was there, beaming and smiling. He said: “Ganid, my son, I am happy to see you again. We will have the opportunity to talk longer when I receive you in my residence in Salvington and to evoke some good times that we have lived together but I wanted to welcome you during your first awakening. In truth, you will not remain long in this world, but progress to the third world before taking the long road that will lead you to Paradise. ”

Ganid said nothing, too impressed by Micaël, but already happy to know that they would see each other again.

Micaël suddenly disappeared and I said to Ganid:

“Let’s go to the Melchizedek district where you will reside while waiting for the next step.”

“_The Melchizedeks, what are they?_” said Ganid.

“_Look, you'll see, because here's one who's also come to welcome you. It's a great and rare honor that he's giving you and it's undoubtedly because he knew that you were Micaël's friend._”

“Yes, I realize now how incredibly lucky I was to be close to the Creator Son throughout our Mediterranean journey.”

And suddenly, I thought that I had benefited from this same luck, I had also been close to the Creator Son for almost two years.

Almost true story.
