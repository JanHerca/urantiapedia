The Christian fundamentalist:
The Bible is the word of God,
However, The Urantia Book disagrees with the Bible,
So The Urantia Book is false, even demonic.

The Jewish fundamentalist:

The Torah says there is only one God,
Now, Christians and the New Testament say that Jesus is God,
So the New Testament and Christians are wrong.
And even more so The Urantia Book.

The Urantian Fundamentalist:

The Urantia Book comes in its time and after the Bible,
It takes into account the science of our time,
He disagrees with the Bible,
So the Bible is false and the Jews and Christians are wrong.

The Muslim fundamentalist:

Muhammad was inspired by Gabriel. There is only one God
And Muhammad is his prophet.
Now, The Urantia Book says that God has a son
And that Muhammad is not the last prophet
So The Urantia Book is false, even demonic.

The atheist fundamentalist:

God is a creation of man,
So God does not exist.
Now, religions tell us that man only exists through God, so religions are all wrong.
Wanting to discuss with a fundamentalist is wanting to discuss with a wall.
