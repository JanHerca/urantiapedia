We saw in the first part the case of Anova, the first inhabited planet of Nebadon and we estimated that it must now be in the seventh stage of light and life. Can we extend our estimates?

We are told that Lucifer had become Systemic Sovereign 500,000 years before, but be careful, these are indeed Nebadonian years (worth approximately 5 of our years) and not Urantian years, otherwise Lucifer would never have been able to send a message when our planet was recognized as an inhabited land (<a id="a39_304"></a>[UB 62:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p7_5)) We know that 37 Planetary Princes were caught up in Lucifer's Rebellion (<a id="a39_420"></a>[UB 53:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p7_1)). However, this rebellion took place approximately 200,000 years ago and the book tells us here that these are indeed our years (<a id="a39_591"></a>[UB 53:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p4_1)).

We are also told that Lucifer was chief administrator of 607 inhabited worlds (<a id="a41_79"></a>[UB 53:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p1_1))

This must mean at the time of the rebellion and not when it was named. But it also means that there has only been one new world in Satania in 200,000 years. We are far from our average of 71,428 years per planet. One conclusion is that planets do not become habitable on a regular basis but rather in groups, which seems to be confirmed by the following reference: “More than two hundred other planets in this system are evolving favorably to become inhabited worlds in an as yet undetermined future.” (<a id="a43_503"></a>[UB 15:14.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p14_5))

We must therefore return to general statistics. Are Sadler's calculations confirmed?

According to W. Sadler Jr the age of Orvonton would be approximately 40,000 billion years (4 x 10^16^) (See Appendices No. XVII)

We could calculate it in another way, as follows:

There are 5,342,482,337,666 inhabited planets in the seven superuniverses (<a id="a51_75"></a>[UB 15:14.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p14_8)) If we say that Nebadon is a normal universe and that the average time for a new world to appear is 52,081 years, rounded to 52,000 years, this gives us a universe that is 277,809,071,558,632 years old, but this is for the seven superuniverses. Unlike the local universes, we can think that they develop at about the same time, even if Orvonton is a little late. Now the previous figure divided by 7 gives us roughly 39,687 billion years, which is ultimately quite close to Sadler's 40,000 billion.

If there is still some disagreement, apart from the fact that we have rounded our figures, it is perhaps because Sadler is counting physical time and not habitation time. In my opinion, taking a third of the time for physical organization is too much. Indeed we are not at the level of billions of years as in the case of local universes, but at the level of billions, which makes a difference. In any case, we are in the same ORDER of time. Let the one who is within a billion throw us the first nebula.

After this foray into large numbers, let's come back to our system.

The 37 rebel Princes must be among those whose planets were not yet anchored in light and life, consequently planets that were less than 2,000,000 years old. It is difficult to imagine anchored planets entering into rebellion. But if we estimate that the 37 worlds were inhabited during these two million years we will have: 2,000,000: 37 = 54,054, or something quite close to the average of Nebadon;

We can speculate a little further and estimate that under these conditions the remaining 607 - 37 = 570 worlds were already all anchored in light and in life and that if Satania, number 24 of the 70th constellation had this contingent it is also because complete systems in Nebadon could be anchored in light and in life.
