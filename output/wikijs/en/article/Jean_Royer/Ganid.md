India had nourished it in the hearts of the multitudes,
But the world was vast and pressing its call
For a still young heart it is not a habit.
India was just an island, he wanted the archipelago.

Jerusalem finally, a suburb of Damascus,
But for him, without knowing, being unique in this place
The one to whom the crowd preferred Barabbas,
He who, for the worlds, was already a God.

Alexandria then Rome, from Gentiles to pagans
Until finally Tiberius, that sad potentate;
Athens after Corinth, latency of Christians.
God the loving Father, and all of us his children
Above the cynics Confucius and Mithra
It's our religion said Ganid innocent.

Jean Royer
