Since the dawn of time, man has sought the elixir of long life; yet the _Urantia Book_ tells us: _human beings are born, live, and die in a relatively instant_. (<a id="a37_162"></a>[UB 112:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_4))

The notion of time is variable for men and immortals.

Let us consider the following few facts:

> *987,000,000,000* years ago associate force organizer and then acting inspector number 811,307 of the Orvonton series, traveling out from Uversa, reported to the Ancients of Days that space conditions were favorable for the initiation of materialization phenomena in a certain sector of the, then, easterly segment of Orvonton. (<a id="a43_331"></a>[UB 57:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p1_3))

It took 87 billion years before the decision was made to do something with this news, sending a force organizer with his staff.

> *900,000,000,000* years ago, the Uversa archives testify, there was recorded a permit issued by the Uversa Council of Equilibrium to the superuniverse government authorizing the dispatch of a force organizer and staff to the region previously designated by inspector number 811,307. The Orvonton authorities commissioned the original discoverer of this potential universe to execute the mandate of the Ancients of Days calling for the organization of a new material creation. (<a id="a47_479"></a>[UB 57:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p1_4))

It only took 25 billion years to begin the work.

> *875,000,000,000* years ago the enormous Andronover nebula number 876,926 was duly initiated. Only the presence of the force organizer and the liaison staff was required to inaugurate the energy whirl which eventually grew into this vast cyclone of space. Subsequent to the initiation of such nebular revolutions, the living force organizers simply withdraw at right angles to the plane of the revolutionary disk, and from that time forward, the inherent qualities of energy insure the progressive and orderly evolution of such a new physical system. (<a id="a51_554"></a>[UB 57:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p1_6))

The Paradise force organizers retire “having prepared the space energy conditions for the activity of the power directors and physical controllers of the Orvonton superuniverse.” (<a id="a53_180"></a>[UB 57:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p1_7))

They worked quietly for 375 billion years before seeing the birth of the first sun.

> *500,000,000,000* years ago the first Andronover sun was born. This blazing streak broke away from the mother gravity grasp and tore out into space on an independent adventure in the cosmos of creation. Its orbit was determined by its path of escape. Such young suns quickly become spherical and start out on their long and eventful careers as the stars of space. Excepting terminal nebular nucleuses, the vast majority of Orvonton suns have had an analogous birth. These escaping suns pass through varied periods of evolution and subsequent universe service. (<a id="a57_563"></a>[UB 57:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p3_6))

> 3. *The Import of Time.* Time is the one universal endowment of all will creatures; it is the “one talent” intrusted to all intelligent beings. You all have time in which to insure your survival; and time is fatally squandered only when it is buried in neglect, when you fail so to utilize it as to make certain the survival of your soul. Failure to improve one’s time to the fullest extent possible does not impose fatal penalties; it merely retards the pilgrim of time in his journey of ascent. If survival is gained, all other losses can be retrieved.

Another 100 billion years pass.

> It was scarcely a million years subsequent to this epoch that Michael of Nebadon, a Creator Son of Paradise, selected this disintegrating nebula as the site of his adventure in universe building. Almost immediately the architectural worlds of Salvington and the one hundred constellation headquarters groups of planets were begun. It required almost one million years to complete these clusters of specially created worlds. The local system headquarters planets were constructed over a period extending from that time to about five billion years ago. (<a id="a64_554"></a>[UB 57:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p3_8))

The construction of all the headquarters planets of Nebadon therefore takes approximately 395 billion years.

Who takes part in this physical training? It seems to be the Creator Son and the Creator Daughter. But they follow the plans of the Master Architects, they do not do this according to their own whim.

> *300,000,000,000* years ago the Andronover solar circuits were well established, and the nebular system was passing through a transient period of relative physical stability. About this time the staff of Michael arrived on Salvington, and the Uversa government of Orvonton extended physical recognition to the local universe of Nebadon. (<a id="a70_340"></a>[UB 57:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p3_9))

> Now the completed universe mechanism of Nebadon first begins to function, and Michael’s creation is registered on Uversa as a universe of inhabitation and progressive mortal ascension. (<a id="a72_188"></a>[UB 57:3.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p3_11))

> After the completion of the physical organization of a starry and planetary cluster and the establishment of the energy circuits by the superuniverse power centers, subsequent to this preliminary work of creation by the agencies of the Infinite Spirit, operating through, and under the direction of, his local universe creative focalization, there goes forth the proclamation of the Michael Son that life is next to be projected in the newly organized universe. Upon the Paradise recognition of this declaration of intention, there occurs a reaction of approval in the Paradise Trinity, followed by the disappearance in the spiritual shining of the Deities of the Master Spirit in whose superuniverse this new creation is organizing. Meanwhile the other Master Spirits draw near this central lodgment of the Paradise Deities, and subsequently, when the Deity-embraced Master Spirit emerges to the recognition of his fellows, there occurs what is known as a “primary eruption.” This is a tremendous spiritual flash, a phenomenon clearly discernible as far away as the headquarters of the superuniverse concerned; and simultaneously with this little-understood Trinity manifestation there occurs a marked change in the nature of the creative spirit presence and power of the Infinite Spirit resident in the local universe concerned. In response to these Paradise phenomena there immediately personalizes, in the very presence of the Creator Son, a new personal representation of the Infinite Spirit. This is the Divine Minister. The individualized Creative Spirit helper of the Creator Son has become his personal creative associate, the local universe Mother Spirit. (<a id="a74_1669"></a>[UB 34:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p1_1))

> This personalized presence of the Infinite Spirit, the Creative Mother Spirit of the local universe, is known in Satania as the Divine Minister. To all practical intents and spiritual purposes this manifestation of Deity is a divine individual, a spirit person. And she is so recognized and regarded by the Creator Son. It is through this localization and personalization of the Third Source and Center in our local universe that the Spirit could subsequently become so fully subject to the Creator Son that of this Son it was truly said, “All power in heaven and on earth has been intrusted to him.” (<a id="a76_604"></a>[UB 34:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p1_4))

> Having undergone marked personality metamorphosis at the time of life creation, the Divine Minister thereafter functions as a person and co-operates in a very personal manner with the Creator Son in the planning and management of the extensive affairs of their local creation. To many universe types of being, even this representation of the Infinite Spirit may not appear to be wholly personal during the ages preceding the final Michael bestowal; but subsequent to the elevation of the Creator Son to the sovereign authority of a Master Son, the Creative Mother Spirit becomes so augmented in personal qualities as to be personally recognized by all contacting individuals. (<a id="a78_679"></a>[UB 34:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p2_1))

Thus, we have the only personality, which, undoubtedly because it is not given by the Father himself but by the Infinite Spirit, is 'progressive' <a id="a80_146"></a>[UB 118:9.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p9_8)

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right">
<img src="/image/article/Le_Lien/images_02/051.jpg">
</figure>

It will also be noted that the change of name corresponds to the fact that <ins>These Daughter Spirits are of the essence of the Infinite Spirit</ins>, but they cannot function simultaneously in the work of physical creation and spiritual ministry. <a id="a86_249"></a>[UB 34:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p0_3) [emphasis mine]

One final remark likely to shock the followers of most religions: There are no Urantians on Paradise yet and here is why: The first inhabited planets of Nebadon date back 200 billion years See <a id="a88_193"></a>[UB 57:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p3_10) and the first trinitization of Mighty Messengers was not effected until the group of candidates contained representatives from each of the seven superuniverses. And the last such group to qualify for Paradise included ascending pilgrims from the local universe of Nebadon.(<a id="a88_510"></a>[UB 22:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/22#p2_4))

Conclusion: it therefore takes approximately 200 billion years to reach Paradise. I say 'approximately' because the revelators do not tell us the time needed between arrival in Paradise and the time of trinitization, but can we argue about a million, a billion or even 10 billion years?
