You humans have what we, the Life Bearers, call a “short judgment.” Most of you can hardly see beyond the length of your life. On this scale things seem to stand still, evil and misfortune seem to dominate history. We see evolution differently. Perhaps a little historical reminder could be helpful.

I am one of 1200 Life Carriers who came to Urantia to implant life.

900 million years ago a group of which I was not a part came to this planet to assess the state of affairs.

600 million years ago I came to visit your blue planet for the first time, but it was not ready.

We had another 50 million years to develop the germ plasm we had planned.

Life took shape according to our plans.

The day came when two young beings were born with brains more complex than those of their parents, we knew, through the adjutant mental spirits and the physical Master Controllers, that they had the capacity to become human and our long wait ended 993574 years before your year 2000.

I was one of two senior Life Carriers allowed to remain on the planet along with twelve assistants.

I have witnessed the blossoming of thoughtful thought and sometimes the regression of the descendants of Andon and Fonta, I have seen the physical maturation of humanity and I was among those who asked for a Planetary Prince for this little planet. I was with Van and Amadon during the forfeiture of Caligastia. I received Adam and Eve and I knew their sorrow when they failed. I received Machiventa Melchizedek and I was also there at the birth of Michael of Nebadon. I have taken the measure of all the setbacks and all the advances of the human races. I sometimes participate in the advisory conference of the Governor General of Urantia and I can tell you that while we sometimes have concerns we all remain optimistic about the rebirth of the message of the Creator Son and about the culmination of the era of light and life. But it is true that I reason in millions of years, I have a “long judgment”.
