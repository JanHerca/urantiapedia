Gloom, despondency, lamentations, complaints, whining are some of the evils that seem to afflict our era. _The Urantia Book_ speaks to us of joy. As always, and better than some magazines, it is positive. The word joy is found 154 times while the word sadness is found only 31 times.

William Sadler Junior said that The Urantia Book is constructed like a symphony; one of the variations (or one of the motifs or one of the themes) is joy. We encounter this term from the <a id="a39_187"></a>[UB 1:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p5_4) and, as it should be, it applies to God: “_He finds his joy in his children_”. Just as naturally, the last reference to joy is found at the very end of the book and refers to Jesus: _Jesus revealed a religion of love and gave the example: security in the love of the Father, with the joy and satisfaction resulting from sharing this love in the service of the human brotherhood._ <a id="a39_607"></a>[[UB 196:3.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_19)]

## Where does joy come from?

> _“Your sonship is grounded in faith, and you are to remain unmoved by fear. Your joy is born of trust in the divine word, and you shall not therefore be led to doubt the reality of the Father’s love and mercy. It is the very goodness of God that leads men into true and genuine repentance. Your secret of the mastery of self is bound up with your faith in the indwelling spirit, which ever works by love. Even this saving faith you have not of yourselves; it also is the gift of God. And if you are the children of this living faith, you are no longer the bondslaves of self but rather the triumphant masters of yourselves, the liberated sons of God._ (<a id="a43_655"></a>[[UB 143:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p2_7))

> _Happiness and joy take origin in the inner life. You cannot experience real joy all by yourself. A solitary life is fatal to happiness. Even families and nations will enjoy life more if they share it with others._ (<a id="a45_218"></a>[[UB 111:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p4_7))

> _“No religionist may hope to attain the enlightenment of immortal wisdom who persists in being slothful, indolent, feeble, idle, shameless, and selfish. But whoso is thoughtful, prudent, reflective, fervent, and earnest—even while he yet lives on earth—may attain the supreme enlightenment of the peace and liberty of divine wisdom. Remember, every act shall receive its reward. Evil results in sorrow and sin ends in pain. Joy and happiness are the outcome of a good life. Even the evildoer enjoys a season of grace before the time of the full ripening of his evil deeds, but inevitably there must come the full harvest of evil-doing. Let no man think lightly of sin, saying in his heart: ‘The penalty of wrongdoing shall not come near me.’ What you do shall be done to you, in the judgment of wisdom. Injustice done to your fellows shall come back upon you. The creature cannot escape the destiny of his deeds._ (<a id="a47_917"></a>[[UB 131:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/131#p3_5))

> _“Cheerfulness and gladness are the rewards of deeds well done and to the glory of the Immortal. No man can rob you of the liberty of your own mind. When the faith of your religion has emancipated your heart, when the mind, like a mountain, is settled and immovable, then shall the peace of the soul flow tranquilly like a river of waters. Those who are sure of salvation are forever free from lust, envy, hatred, and the delusions of wealth. While faith is the energy of the better life, nevertheless, must you work out your own salvation with perseverance. If you would be certain of your final salvation, then make sure that you sincerely seek to fulfill all righteousness. Cultivate the assurance of the heart which springs from within and thus come to enjoy the ecstasy of eternal salvation._ (<a id="a49_801"></a>[[UB 131:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/131#p3_4))

> _As the apostles baptized believers, the Master talked with those who tarried. And a certain young man said to him: “Master, my father died leaving much property to me and my brother, but my brother refuses to give me that which is my own. Will you, then, bid my brother divide this inheritance with me?” Jesus was mildly indignant that this material-minded youth should bring up for discussion such a question of business; but he proceeded to use the occasion for the impartation of further instruction. Said Jesus: “Man, who made me a divider over you? Where did you get the idea that I give attention to the material affairs of this world?” And then, turning to all who were about him, he said: “Take heed and keep yourselves free from covetousness; a man’s life consists not in the abundance of the things which he may possess. Happiness comes not from the power of wealth, and joy springs not from riches. Wealth, in itself, is not a curse, but the love of riches many times leads to such devotion to the things of this world that the soul becomes blinded to the beautiful attractions of the spiritual realities of the kingdom of God on earth and to the joys of eternal life in heaven._ (<a id="a51_1195"></a>[[UB 165:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p4_1))

It is one of the fruits of the Spirit: “_For the fruits of the Spirit are love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faith, gentleness, self-control_” <a id="a53_161"></a>[[UB 34:6.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_13)]

## What is this joy?

It is perhaps first of all the joy of existence. Is it not curious that there are angels bearing this title of Joy of Existence and whose _principal activities are directed towards encouraging reactions of joy among the various orders of the angelic hosts and humble volitional creatures. ?_ <a id="a57_292"></a>[[UB 28:5.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p5_16)]

It is also _the joy of universal brotherhood_ (<a id="a59_47"></a>[UB 5.5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p5_2))

This will be, later, _prophetic joy._ (<a id="a61_39"></a>[UB 48:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_7)) with _the joy of discovering the futility of much of the seriousness of our personal anxiety._ <a id="a61_177"></a>[[UB 48:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_6)]

It is also: _the exhilarating joy of facing the perils of intellectual discovery._ (<a id="a63_84"></a>[UB 155:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p5_10))

It can even be the joy of physical pleasures: _Mortal man has a right to the joy of physical pleasures and to the satisfaction of human affections_ <a id="a65_148"></a>[[UB 100:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p2_6)]

It would have been very surprising if the revelators who know well that any virtue, if taken to the extreme, can become a vice (cf. <a id="a67_132"></a>[UB 149:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p4_3)) did not put a damper on the exaltation of joy; we therefore find: first a reminder of the complex reality of the meaning of the universe:

> _The mortal-survival plan has a practical and serviceable objective; you are not the recipients of all this divine labor and painstaking training only that you may survive just to enjoy endless bliss and eternal ease. There is a goal of transcendent service concealed beyond the horizon of the present universe age. If the Gods designed merely to take you on one long and eternal joy excursion, they certainly would not so largely turn the whole universe into one vast and intricate practical training school, requisition a substantial part of the celestial creation as teachers and instructors, and then spend ages upon ages piloting you, one by one, through this gigantic universe school of experiential training. The furtherance of the scheme of mortal progression seems to be one of the chief businesses of the present organized universe, and the majority of innumerable orders of created intelligences are either directly or indirectly engaged in advancing some phase of this progressive perfection plan._ (<a id="a69_1014"></a>[[UB 48:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p8_3))

> “Seek not, then, for false peace and transient joy but rather for the assurance of faith and the sureties of divine sonship which yield composure, contentment, and supreme joy in the spirit.” (<a id="a71_195"></a>[[UB 149:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p5_4))

> After Jesus had talked about marriage and divorce, later on that evening his apostles privately asked many additional questions, and his answers to these inquiries relieved their minds of many misconceptions. At the conclusion of this conference Jesus said: “Marriage is honorable and is to be desired by all men. The fact that the Son of Man pursues his earth mission alone is in no way a reflection on the desirability of marriage. That I should so work is the Father’s will, but this same Father has directed the creation of male and female, and it is the divine will that men and women should find their highest service and consequent joy in the establishment of homes for the reception and training of children, in the creation of whom these parents become copartners with the Makers of heaven and earth. And for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall become as one.” (<a id="a73_937"></a>[[UB 167:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/167#p5_7))

> _The Havona Servitals and the Graduate Guides manifest a transcendent devotion to their work and a touching affection for one another, an affection which, while spiritual, you could only understand by comparison with the phenomenon of human love. There is divine pathos in the separation of the servitals from the guides, as so often occurs when the servitals are dispatched on missions beyond the limits of the central universe; but they go with joy and not with sorrow. The satisfying joy of high duty is the eclipsing emotion of spiritual beings. Sorrow cannot exist in the face of the consciousness of divine duty faithfully performed. And when man’s ascending soul stands before the Supreme Judge, the decision of eternal import will not be determined by material successes or quantitative achievements; the verdict reverberating through the high courts declares: “Well done, good and *faithful* servant; you have been faithful over a few essentials; you shall be made ruler over universe realities.”_ (<a id="a75_1010"></a>[[UB 25:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/25#p1_6))

> _But the great problem of religious living consists in the task of unifying the soul powers of the personality by the dominance of love. Health, mental efficiency, and happiness arise from the unification of physical systems, mind systems, and spirit systems. Of health and sanity man understands much, but of happiness he has truly realized very little. The highest happiness is indissolubly linked with spiritual progress. Spiritual growth yields lasting joy, peace which passes all understanding._ (<a id="a77_504"></a>[UB 100:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p4_3))

> One of the young men who worked with Jesus one day on the steering paddle became much interested in the words which he dropped from hour to hour as they toiled in the shipyard. When Jesus intimated that the Father in heaven was interested in the welfare of his children on earth, this young Greek, Anaxand, said: “If the Gods are interested in me, then why do they not remove the cruel and unjust foreman of this workshop?” He was startled when Jesus replied, “Since you know the ways of kindness and value justice, perhaps the Gods have brought this erring man near that you may lead him into this better way. Maybe you are the salt which is to make this brother more agreeable to all other men; that is, if you have not lost your savor. As it is, this man is your master in that his evil ways unfavorably influence you. Why not assert your mastery of evil by virtue of the power of goodness and thus become the master of all relations between the two of you? I predict that the good in you could overcome the evil in him if you gave it a fair and living chance. There is no adventure in the course of mortal existence more enthralling than to enjoy the exhilaration of becoming the material life partner with spiritual energy and divine truth in one of their triumphant struggles with error and evil. It is a marvelous and transforming experience to become the living channel of spiritual light to the mortal who sits in spiritual darkness. If you are more blessed with truth than is this man, his need should challenge you. Surely you are not the coward who could stand by on the seashore and watch a fellow man who could not swim perish! How much more of value is this man’s soul floundering in darkness compared to his body drowning in water!” (<a id="a79_1752"></a>[[UB 130:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p2_4))

> As the dinner progressed, the joy of the diners mounted to heights of good cheer, and everybody was having such a splendid time that the onlooking Pharisees began, in their hearts, to criticize Jesus for his participation in such a lighthearted and carefree affair. Later in the evening, when they were making speeches, one of the more malignant of the Pharisees went so far as to criticize Jesus’ conduct to Peter, saying: “How dare you to teach that this man is righteous when he eats with publicans and sinners and thus lends his presence to such scenes of careless pleasure making.” Peter whispered this criticism to Jesus before he spoke the parting blessing upon those assembled. When Jesus began to speak, he said: “In coming here tonight to welcome Matthew and Simon to our fellowship, I am glad to witness your lightheartedness and social good cheer, but you should rejoice still more because many of you will find entrance into the coming kingdom of the spirit, wherein you shall more abundantly enjoy the good things of the kingdom of heaven. And to you who stand about criticizing me in your hearts because I have come here to make merry with these friends, let me say that I have come to proclaim joy to the socially downtrodden and spiritual liberty to the moral captives. Need I remind you that they who are whole need not a physician, but rather those who are sick? I have come, not to call the righteous, but sinners.” (<a id="a81_1439"></a>[[UB 138:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p3_6))

> Remember that you are commissioned to preach this gospel of the kingdom—the supreme desire to do the Father’s will coupled with the supreme joy of the faith realization of sonship with God—and you must not allow anything to divert your devotion to this one duty. Let all mankind benefit from the overflow of your loving spiritual ministry, enlightening intellectual communion, and uplifting social service; but none of these humanitarian labors, nor all of them, should be permitted to take the place of proclaiming the gospel. These mighty ministrations are the social by-products of the still more mighty and sublime ministrations and transformations wrought in the heart of the kingdom believer by the living Spirit of Truth and by the personal realization that the faith of a spirit-born man confers the assurance of living fellowship with the eternal God. (<a id="a83_864"></a>[[UB 178:1.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/178#p1_11))

As for us, we should never forget this injunction from Jesus to the unnamed woman: go your way in the joy and freedom of the kingdom
