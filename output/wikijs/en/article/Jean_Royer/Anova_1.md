> _The oldest inhabited world of Satania, world number one, is Anova, one of the forty-four satellites revolving around an enormous dark planet but exposed to the differential light of three neighboring suns. Anova is in an advanced stage of progressive civilization._ ([UB 49:0.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p0_5))

What does this mean?

In my opinion, this means that he has reached the seventh stage of light and life.

For what ?

There are two ways to count the age of Anova:

1) We know that Urantia was recognized as an inhabited planet about a million years ago and that it bears the number 606 of Satania. (cf. [UB 15:14.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p14_5); [UB 49:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p0_3); [UB 62:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p7_7))

We know that the last census* recognizes 619 inhabited planets in Satania. ([UB 15:14.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p14_5)); therefore there is a new planet every 71428 years. 1M:14 = 71,428.

2) Nebadon had 3,840,101 inhabited planets at the last count ([UB 32:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p2_9)) and the oldest planets in Nebadon are 200 billion years old. ([UB 57:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p3_10)); therefore that's a new planet every 52,081 years. 200,000,000,000: 3,840,101 = 52,081.

\* We do not know when the last census was but it seems reasonable to place it in the 1930s. A few years difference does not change the calculation.

According to 1) Anova would have: 71,428 x 619 = 44,213,932 years

According to 2) Anova would have: 52,081 x 619 = 32,238,139 years

Despite the difference, we are in the same order of magnitude and, since these are statistics, we will take the smaller number and round it up to 32 million. Remember that this is not the physical age of the planet, but its recognition as an inhabited planet.

Anova has therefore been recognized as an inhabited planet for at least 32 million years.

How long does it take for a normal planet to reach the first stage of light and life? Paper 52 gives us an idea.

1. Primitive man: from 150,000 to 1 million years ([UB 52:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p1_1))
2. Man after the Planetary Prince: on average 500,000 years ([UB 52:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p2_2))
3. Post-Adamic man: usually 25,000 years ([UB 52:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p3_3))
4. The man after the Magisterial Son: from 25,000 to 50,000 years ([UB 52:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p4_10))
5. Man after the Son of bestowal: from 10,000 to 100,000 years ([UB 52:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p5_8))
6. The man after the Instructor Son: not less than 1000 years and often much more. ([UB 52:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p7_4)) “But sooner or later... the System Sovereign appears to proclaim the entry of this world into the era of light and life.” ([UB 52:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p7_10))

It seems reasonable to estimate the “much more” as possibly meaning between 10,000 and 25,000 years.

Adding all these numbers brings us to 1,690,000 years. Let's round it to
2,000,000 years to have some margin.

Thus, Anova would have reached the first stage of light and life at least 30 million years ago. Although no time is specified for each of the stages, (cf. [UB 55:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p4_4)) is it not reasonable to think that it must have now reached the seventh stage?
