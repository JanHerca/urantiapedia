> I will pray the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that **he may abide with you forever**; even the Spirit of Truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it sees him not, nor knows him: but you know him; for **he dwells with you, and shall be in you**. ([John 14:16-17](/en/Bible/John/14#v16))

> At that day you shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, **and I in you**. ([John 14:20](/en/Bible/John/14#v20))

> If a man loves me, he will keep my words; and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and **make our abode with him**. ([John 14:23](/en/Bible/John/14#v23))

> **Abide in me, and I in you**. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abides in the vine; no more can you, except you abide in me. ([John 15:4](/en/Bible/John/15#v4))

> I am the vine, you are the branches: He that abides in me, **and I in him**, the same brings forth much fruit: for without me you can do nothing. ([John 15:5](/en/Bible/John/15#v5))

> For the **kingdom of God is within you**. ([Luke 17:21](/en/Bible/Luke/17#v21))

> For it is not you that speaks, but the **Spirit of your Father which speaks in you**. ([Matthew 10:20](/en/Bible/Matthew/10#v20))

> And he that keeps his commandments dwells in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that **he abides in us, by the Spirit which he has given us**. ([1 John 3:24](/en/Bible/1_John/3#v24))

> No man has seen God at any time. If we love one another, **God dwells in us, and his love is perfected in us**. ([1 John 4:12](/en/Bible/1_John/4#v12))

> Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and **he in us**, because he has given us of his Spirit. ([1 John 4:13](/en/Bible/1_John/4#v13))

> Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, **God dwells in him**, and he in God. ([1 John 4:15](/en/Bible/1_John/4#v15))

> And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. **God is love; and he that dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him**. ([1 John 4:16](/en/Bible/1_John/4#v16))

> But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that **the Spirit of God dwells in you**. ([Romans 8:9](/en/Bible/Romans/8#v9))

> But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead **dwells in you**, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by **his Spirit that dwells in you**. ([Romans 8:11](/en/Bible/Romans/8#v11))

> Those who are led by God’s spirit are God’s sons. For the **spirit that God has given you** does not make you sinners and cause you to be afraid; instead the spirit makes you God’s children and by the spirit’s power we cry out to God, Abba, Father. **God’s spirit joins himself to our spirits** to declare we are God’s children. ([Romans 8:14-16](/en/Bible/Romans/8#v14))

> Know you not that you are the temple of God, and **that the Spirit of God dwells in you**?([1 Cor. 3:16](/en/Bible/1_Corinthians/3#v16))

> Examine yourselves, whether you be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know you not your own selves, how that **Jesus Christ is in you**. ([2 Cor. 13:5](/en/Bible/2_Corinthians/13#v5))

> To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; **which is Christ in you**, the hope of glory. ([Colossians 1:27](/en/Bible/Colossians/1#v27))

> He therefore that despises, despises not man, but **God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit**. ([1 Thessalonians 1:8](/en/Bible/1_Thessalonians/1#v8))

> That good thing which was committed unto you, keep by **the Holy Ghost which dwells in us**. ([2 Timothy 1:14](/en/Bible/2_Timothy/1#v14))

> And because you are sons, God has sent forth the **Spirit of his Son into your hearts**, crying, Abba, Father. ([Galatians 4:6](/en/Bible/Galatians/4#v6))
