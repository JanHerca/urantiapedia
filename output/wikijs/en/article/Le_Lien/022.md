## A Word from the President

Dear readers, I cannot fail to tell you, in this introduction, about the event that monopolizes the energies of many of our volunteers. A few weeks before the international conference this summer, the Montreuil office is in full swing to manage and plan the arrival of more than 220 readers from around the world in Dourdan from August 3 to 7. A special article will report on this event in a future Link. In the meantime, I would like, in advance, to thank all the volunteers for the help they have already given us, or that they will give us. This is a common adventure in which all French participants are invited to collaborate.

I wish you all, far from the tumult of existence, time to rest and excellent holidays.

Severin Desbuisson
President of the A.F.L.L.U.

## Synthesis of reality

From all eternity exists the “I AM”, the infinite God who created the universe of universes and administers it unceasingly. (<a id="a82_125"></a>[UB 195:7.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p7_18)) ; He reveals himself to us as the Universal Father, a Father-friend. The center of the universe of universes is the central universe, a perfect universe composed of Paradise, surrounded by 10 concentric elliptical circuits, comprising more than a billion spheres inhabited by a myriad of perfect created people. This central universe had no beginning, it has always existed, it is existential. Around this existential universe, on successive elliptical circuits, the Grand universe was built experientially, evolutionarily, starting from the primordial energy that condenses into nebulae from which suns are expelled, which eject planets like ours.

## Life Bearers

You humans have what we, the Life Carriers, call a “short judgment.” Most of you can hardly see beyond the length of your life. On this scale things seem to stand still, evil and misfortune seem to dominate history. We see evolution differently. Perhaps a little historical reminder might be helpful.

I am one of the 1200 Life Carriers who came to Urantia to implant life.

900 million years ago a group of which I was not a part came to this planet to assess the state of affairs.

## Teamwork

The Urantia Book strongly advises us to work in teams, and warns us that in the future we will have little opportunity to work alone. “One of the most important lessons to be learned during your mortal career is that of teamwork. Those who have mastered this art of working with other beings populate the spheres of perfection. There is little work in the universe for the isolated server. The higher you rise, the more isolated you become when temporarily deprived of the society of your fellows.” (<a id="a102_500"></a>[UB 28:5.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p5_14))

When a group for reading and studying The Urantia Book, such as the one in Avignon, to which I belong, meets with more or less the same members for the majority of them for 15 to 25 years, a sort of unconscious habit of work is formed, not only with regard to the other members as individuals, but also with regard to the group as a corporate entity, to give it a name of unity.

## Relaxation Corner

### Seasons

A quick phone call,
It is breaking the silence,
The cry of a birth
A spring morning.
A quick phone call,
It's a little tenderness,
Time for a caress
Given to a child.

## Testimonials

### Goodbye Sylvette

You have left us, our pain is immense, we all loved you and we are sad. This feeling is very human, yet we know that we should consider your departure in a less dramatic way.

We loved your good humor, your big smile and your spiritual enthusiasm. By tirelessly seeking the truth you found the Father, and loved your brothers as yourself, you will remain forever in our hearts.

We will find you one day in those places that you dreamed of so much and that you tried to represent in your paintings. That is why, with all our heart, with all our soul, we say goodbye to you, but also with confidence:

***goodbye Sylvette***
