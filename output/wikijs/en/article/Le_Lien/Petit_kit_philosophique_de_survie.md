Self-love does not encourage selfish withdrawal. It is a love intended to blossom in an embrace of the other. It is the love that I owe myself on a daily basis to enjoy life and love others.

But what does this have to do with my self-defense and this relentless ejection?

If I do not follow Aristotle's advice, if I do not love myself even a little, in this case if I despise myself because I have been thrown away, then every link, every attachment seems hateful to me, both towards myself and towards others. I risk becoming in turn an ejection machine, an inflexible catapult. All this fragility that I despise in myself, I reject it in others; each weakness is a next victim. Each distress an irritating aversion. But if I manage to love myself in the greenness as in the dejection, I reconnect with the miracle of the heart. My tenderness flares out to infinity, it deposits on each one a sparkling dust like the gentle caress of a benevolent wind.

So nothing closes in me anymore, nothing stops or locks itself. I keep a friendship for everything that wavers, everything that bends, even to the incessant vertigo of my fragility. I discover myself as I discover the other, differently. I look at him as he gives himself; it is no longer the other as a useful thing, to be ejected or thrown away, but the other in his singular freshness, in his overflowing uniqueness, in his inestimable singularity. Soon, I see a providential glow on his face, a window full of hope, a promise of infinity: “Every face that faces me is an opening towards infinity, and it is this opening which not only imposes a moral attitude on me but also frees me from the being in which I am mired by guiding me towards this other than being that are love and responsibility towards the other man [^1].”

This parenthesis of infinity spreads within me in a luminous evidence; it stretches me to the other infinitely, connects me to it in a true expansion. Far from the encounters that consumption alone calls for. Far from interchangeable friendships. Far from interested considerations, but close, much closer.

Closer to me, closer to the other.
