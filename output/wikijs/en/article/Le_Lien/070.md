Editor's note:

The LIENS are quarterly and appear on the 15th of March, June, September and December. They are first sent to subscribers in digital form (PDF format) on these same dates and then, as far as possible, in their paper form. As AFLUB prints are grouped with other periodicals, it is possible that the deadline for the paper format is longer. As for the texts intended to be published within the Link concerned, they must imperatively arrive 30 days before the aforementioned publication date and approved by our president, Ivan Stol, director of publication. Thank you for your understanding.

## A word from the president

Dear Urantians,

“Help yourself and heaven will help you!”

I heard this phrase often from my parents and grandparents. So I got into the habit of not expecting anything and doing what I could.

***End of quizzes***

## Thoughts on the art of merging

Merging with the adjuster is a subject rather avoided by readers because it is considered a little too ambitious in the state of advancement of our civilization.

However, too much modesty sometimes prevents us from achieving our goals. Therefore, I will try to present to you a particular point of view on our constitution and our possibilities of getting closer to our Adjuster.

Of course, the goal is to get hooked on the game to make people want to study within the groups. So I will only give ideas and links and keep in mind that my words may be wrong.

## And after the MAXIEN quiz?

I propose to look for trilogies and associate them with truth, beauty and goodness.

I start with the music: it is a trilogy because it is defined by a melody, a harmony and a rhythm.

I'll let you find the associations with Truth, Beauty, Goodness and I await your answers which will appear in the next link (and also on the site in the news).

To your pens.

And if anyone has any other suggestions or ideas to liven up this link, by all means share them.

And send us your personal or group thoughts (by email to Max or Ivan or to the AFLUB or by post) to give substance to this journal.

Best regards to all.

## Quiz #21 — Answers.

**Jesus**

**R.1.** Machiventa continued his activities as provisional planetary administrator up to the time of Michael’s triumph on Urantia. Thereafter he was attached to the service of Urantia on Jerusem as one of the twenty-four administrators and has only recently been elevated to the position of personal ambassador of the Creator Son on Jerusem, with the title of Vicegerent Planetary Prince of Urantia.(<a id="a114_401"></a>[UB 93:10.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p10_5))

**R.2.** It was Joseph of Arimathea, accompanied by Nicodemus, both armed with an order from Pilate authorizing them to take the body, who took possession of the body of Jesus to ensure a decent burial. <a id="a116_203"></a>[UB 188:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p0_3)
