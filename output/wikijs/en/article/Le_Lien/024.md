## A Word from the President

Dear readers,

The time has come for the traditional end-of-year reviews and wishes.

For our association, 2002 was undoubtedly marked by the event of this summer. All participants of the Dourdan conference will receive, in a few weeks, a souvenir CD containing the conference media (texts, photos, and video). The CD will of course also be on sale directly at the association's headquarters or by mail order.

The life of our association does not stop at the organization of conferences, even if they are international. Many other initiatives are underway: preparation of the Link, the I.U.A. journal, management of subscriptions, translation and printing of additional publications, helping readers meet, management of the website, responses to letters, etc. And, it must be admitted: many other actions could not be carried out due to lack of time and resources: participation in book fairs, refreshing of the website, recording of the French audio version, etc.

Our association depends on you to exist: by becoming a member you legitimize the A.F.L.L.U., by paying your annual subscription you provide it with the financial energy on which it depends for its internal functioning and its publications, by participating in its annual general meeting, or by transmitting a voting power, you decide on the actions essential to its evolution and control its functioning. Dear readers, let us not let go of the rope that binds us and let us climb together the step of the year 2003 on the very long road that leads the ascending pilgrims of time to the summits of Paradise.

Severin Desbuisson
President of the A.F.L.L.U.

## The Personality

***Contribution to a cosmic approach to the role of personality***

### Know thyself

God who brings us together today loves us individually. He has prepared for each of us and for all of us a perfect plan of life, full of love, happiness, and respect, and it is buried in the spiritual depths of our Thought Adjuster. As we struggle through the vicissitudes of material life, it is comforting to know that we can discover it if we will! It is the challenge of our lives.

Today's presentation aims to help us in this discovery.

We have a body and a consciousness that allow us to situate ourselves in relation to all that exists, the material, the intellectual and the spiritual and to make contact with these realities. Consciousness is this lamp that illuminates matter, ideas and ideals. Thus equipped, man can navigate in the two extreme domains of matter and spirit.

But he could not do much without another reality of his own: the Personality. This reality is the director of our consciousness. It is she who decides.

## If...

_[Warning: This reflection should not be considered as an attack on the Foundation, but rather as a historical regret along the lines of the remark made in 1942 by the disclosure commission to the contact commission which said: You have not done enough to protect your name...] Jean Royer_

Ah! If only the Revelation Commission and the Foundation that came after had known Zamenhof, or at least had read his 'Fundamento', it might have saved us a lot of trouble. What connection can be established between the basis of an artificial language and _The Urantia Book_? Probably more than it seems at first glance.

## The Providence of God

Many Urantians have misunderstood the Providence of God. There is, in fact, a divine providential plan for our planet. The Providence of God is expressed in the combined actions of celestial beings and divine spirits, who, in harmony with cosmic law, are continually working for the honor of God and the spiritual progress of his universe children.

For long ages the human race has struggled to reach its present status while Providence worked out its plan of progressive evolution.

Divine Providence is always in conformity with the perfect and unchanging nature of the Supreme Lawgiver. An organic unity in the space-time universes seems to underlie the whole web of cosmic events.

### Riddle

At the end of the 21st century, we see that French pilgrims are following a strange path, very different from that of the pilgrims of Santiago de Compostela. The authorities would like to understand this route. Can you help them?

First the pilgrims travel by Peugeot car and go to Périgueux, then they go to Vesoul and from there they go down to Vaucluse where they climb Mount Thabor; their next stop is either Vichy or Montluçon; from these places they go to the Hautes-Alpes and finally they finish their journey in Privas or in the surrounding mountains.

How can we explain this curious route?

Jean Royer


_[This fiction is inspired by the Pamphlets relating to the morontial worlds. But like all fiction, imagination has come to embellish the story. I leave it to everyone, if they wish, to find the elements taken from the Pamphlets of what is only pure invention on my part.]_

### Sudden awakening

**I didn't think my death would happen like this. Well, it would be more accurate to say that I didn't see my new life starting in this way. You might say: it was the first time. So my surprise was completely excused.

**The first glance I took revealed to me in a soft, muffled light what I assumed to be a large white room. It took me a few moments to get used to this unexpected lighting.

“Don’t worry, you’ve arrived.”

### Holy shit!

Once upon a time there was a cat, black. A hell of a cat. His name was Chapoilu, a name that was more of a memory than a description: the little soft, fluffy baby, the silky, shiny teenager, had transformed, through fights and brawls of all kinds, accidents, fleas and other ailments into a kind of pitiful, moth-eaten, shabby, and stitched mop.

But be careful: Chapoilu was someone. A real tough guy. A thug. A character.

You had to see him, square-shouldered and slender-backed, walking along the walls during his inspection tours. At a glance, he knew how to spot the full trash cans, the appetizing leftovers fallen, trampled, and hastily swept along the sidewalks, the unlicked bowls of the dogs in the backyards. He knew, in the sun, when the little gray old lady who fed the pigeons was coming. He was able to guess, at nap time, which roof of which car would be the warmest. Just by their gait, he knew which feet were best avoided, and which calves would be welcoming to a little passing rub rub. He knew how to discern in a furtive shadow the cheeky young white beak who had to be immediately kicked out of the territory, or on the contrary, the shy runaway in search of romance. Besides, it was no miracle that there were so many black cats in these few streets: not a single kitten in the neighborhood had not had a taste of their pointed tenderness. Truly, Chapoilu knew all the things one should know when one respects oneself.

Except one.

He had one green eye and one yellow eye. And Chapoilu didn't know that.

### Press release from Georges Michelson-Dupont

Dear readers,

Dear readers,

Several years ago, and as part of our responsibilities within the URANTIA Foundation, my wife and I went to Dakar to meet a man, a reader of The URANTIA Book, with whom we had corresponded and who had explained to us what he was doing within his Senegalese community.

In this poor country we encountered the richness of the heart, in this arid country we were received with great spiritual generosity, in this parched country we drank from the cup of the fraternity of Jesus.

My wife and I are what are called “long-time readers” accustomed to handling the concepts of the Book. But the way in which Musa approaches spiritual teaching is quite unique. He has developed a method of progressive spiritual elevation based on scientific, rigorous and common-sense observation of facts, expanding the field of consciousness of the mind to hitherto unknown realities on which the Thought Adjuster can rely to spiritualize the mind.

It seemed to us that this week spent with him had brought us as much as 10 years of reading.

The Melchizedeks teach us that in the morontia universities the more advanced students teach the truths recently acquired to the younger students.

Jesus spent a considerable amount of time teaching his apostles.

The Revelators before leaving us also left instructions, one of which clearly states that “thousands and thousands of study groups must be formed from which leaders and teachers will emerge.”

Each creature of God is a unique manifestation of his power as Creator. God has formulated a plan for each of us and as a good father he has provided the means and needs of his creatures only we do not know it. Moussa, as an older brother on the path that leads to God, helps us to understand, use and share these means.

A first 5-day seminar led by Moussa is organized from April 17 to 23, 2003 at Notre Dame de Lumière, the theme of which will be the study of consciousness (the Adjuvats), personality and faith. A second 5-day seminar is organized from August 2 to 5, 2003 at the same location. It will be a continuation of the first and will deal with the “human self”.

Those who are interested can contact us by writing to Georges Michelson Dupont, 48, rue Douy Delcupe, 93100 Montreuil.
