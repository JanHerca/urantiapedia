## A Word from the President

Dear readers, May this new year be filled with aspirations and spiritual achievements, may it bring you balance of the physical, mental and spirit, because without real harmony, how can we progress sustainably?

Our association does not aim for the top spots in the ratings, but rather seeks to be part of the long term and in the services provided to its members. This year, we will have the chance (and you perhaps?) to organize and participate in the next international conference of readers of the _Urantia Book_. This gathering of enthusiasts and friends of the book will take place in France, a few kilometers from Paris. We are expecting visitors from the Americas, but also many Europeans and some Africans.

This will be a unique opportunity in France to learn about the readership and progress of the teachings of the _Urantia Book_ on a global level.

You should have already received an invitation and a description of the program for these summer meeting days. If not, you can refer to our website www.iua2002.com or contact us to have a brochure sent to you.

Please remember that a preferential rate is applied until April 15 and that registrations will close on June 15, 2002.

Pending these events,

Happy reading, happy traveling,

Severin Desbuisson
President of the A.F.L.L.U.

## The life

Like all great texts, The Urantia Book can be interpreted on different levels.

First, there is the level of translation, which indicates what the translator believed he understood at a certain point in his development and which is not necessarily what the reader understands at his own level. But there are also many other levels, such as that of knowledge at the time. Let's take a simple example: death. At the beginning of the 20th century, death was declared when the individual had stopped breathing (mirror test) and no longer met the reaction criteria such as biting the toe (hence the undertakers), later it was cardiac arrest that served as a criterion and more recently it is the repeated flat encephalogram. But how do you define life?

## “The New Symbolism”

After having tried to outline what this new symbolism could be, approached from the “outside” (cf. “Le Lien” n 17, page 14), I concluded by hoping that a good will would take the step towards the “inside”.

I find this approach today in the Journal of the I.U.A. — June — 2001, vol. 8 / nº 2, pages 15 and 16, written by Seppo Kanerva, in his article: “About religion”, Seppo lists the 22 criteria that the revelators present as having to satisfy this new symbolism.

Of course, since the presentation is global, the “external” and “internal” criteria are in the same list. But everyone will only need a very small effort to identify the signifiers of one or the other category.

Since the revealers did things well, they obviously started from the “inside” (criteria 1 to 18) to go to the “outside” (criteria 19 to 22). This is much more logical: it is only after having matured the 5th Revelation inside that one can “signify” it outside, within the framework of a group...

## Anova (part two)

We have seen in Part I the case of Anova, the first inhabited planet of Nebadon, and we have estimated that it must now be in the seventh stage of light and life. Can we extend our estimates?

We are told that Lucifer had become Systemic Sovereign 500,000 years before, but be careful, these are Nebadonian years (approximately 5 of our years) and not Urantian years, otherwise Lucifer would never have been able to send a message when our planet was recognized as an inhabited land (<a id="a121_291"></a>[UB 62:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p7_5)) We know that 37 Planetary Princes were caught up in the Lucifer Rebellion (<a id="a121_409"></a>[UB 53:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p7_1)). Now this rebellion took place approximately 200,000 years ago and the book specifies here that these are indeed our years (<a id="a121_576"></a>[UB 53:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p4_1)).

## Questions — Answers

***Responses to the article “ANOVA” by Jean Royer (Link 19).***

### What if none of the worlds of Satania or even all of Nebadon, were anchored in light and life?....

A doubt gnaws at me! What if none of the worlds of Satania or even all of Nebadon, were anchored in light and life? Let me explain:

Let us return to the 2nd paragraph of <a id="a135_38"></a>[UB 49:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p0_2): “_Basically, all inhabited worlds are grouped into local systems for their celestial administration, and each of the local systems is limited to approximately one thousand evolutionary worlds. This limitation results from a decree of the Ancients of Days and concerns the planets actually evolutionary where mortals of survival status live. <ins>Neither worlds definitely anchored in light and life, nor planets in the prehuman stage of life development are counted in this group.</ins>_” (emphasis added)

The Urantia Book speaks of “_...619 inhabited worlds which are numbered in order according to the date of their registration as inhabited worlds, as worlds inhabited by will creatures...._” (<a id="a137_191"></a>[UB 49:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p0_3)) Further on, the authors tell us of “_36 uninhabited planets of the Satania system which will soon be endowed with life, and then, nearly 200 spheres which are evolving so that they will be ready within a few million years for the implantation of life._” (<a id="a137_489"></a>[UB 49:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p0_3))

These 236 or so spheres are not counted among the 619 planets of Satania, and the author of the booklet, a Melchizedek of the Jerusem school of administration (note his function), cites this number of 236 uninhabited and uncounted planets. But, as for the worlds anchored in light and life, no figure is given. We can only be satisfied with knowing that they are not part of the 619 worlds cited as evolutionary planets in Satania. And since Anova is the first evolutionary sphere forming part of the 619 worlds, we must resolve to classify it as not anchored in light and life. Do you follow me? In other words, if Anova were anchored in light and life, it should not appear among the 619 evolutionary planets of Satania. We know that “_Anova is in an advanced state of progressive civilization_” (<a id="a139_799"></a>[UB 49:0.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p0_5)) The word “progressive” is also quite significant, it means: “which increases, which develops, which expresses a progression, an evolution etc” according to Robert, therefore a civilization still in the process of evolution. Which has not reached the relatively completed and utopian levels of the stages of light and life.

There are approximately 3,840,000 worlds counted in Nebadon (<a id="a141_61"></a>[UB 32:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p2_9)) as evolutionary worlds. In this figure, neither uninhabited worlds nor worlds anchored in light and life are counted, again according to the last sentence of the 2nd paragraph of <a id="a141_283"></a>[UB 49:0.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p0_5). At least that is how I interpret it. So, should we review our way of counting worlds anchored in light and life? That is the question.

## There are Urantian years and all the others

Mr Royer's article on Anova in Link No. 9 is interesting, because it allows us to realize the antiquity of the presence of human beings in our cosmic region.

There are, however, more than two ways of estimating the age of humanity from Anova. I indicate here two others whose results are quite far from what Mr. Royer found.

1. At the time of the rebellion 200,000 years ago (<a id="a151_51"></a>[UB 61:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p7_4)), Lucifer was the administrator of 607 inhabited worlds (<a id="a151_150"></a>[UB 53:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p1_1)). Since Urantia was assigned No. 606 a million years ago, for the next 800,000 years there was only one new inhabited world. Assuming that the rebellion took place shortly before the recognition of world 608, it might be said that there is a new planet every 800,000: 2 = 400,000 years. According to this system of calculation, Anova would be 400,000 years old x 608 = 243,200,000 years old, plus the 200,000 years since the rebellion = 243,400,000 years old, which is 5.5 times more than the highest age found by Mr. Royer.

## Relaxation Corner

### But what is the moon doing?

Never where you look for her: she thwarts all the traps of logic. Right in the middle of the blue sky, when we don't need her, she struts her useless roundness. But she feels like going dancing around other planets, so our dangerously dark nights don't matter to her.

And then, is it really the same one who comes back? What accomplices does she send to take over? How can we be sure?

We would have to tie a string to the tip of the crescent to be at peace, but what if she used it to pull the earth towards other suns?

This cavalier attitude is totally unacceptable.

God, how badly the world is made!

## Art and Testimonies

A few days ago, I wanted to tell you about a concert that Chris and I attended last summer, thanks to a Swiss couple who are friends (he is a violinist in a chamber music group, she is a singing teacher). This couple, therefore, met a rather extraordinary character. He bought a huge estate very close to our home. While walking on his land, mainly made up of scrubland, he discovered a sort of large open-air cellar into which he managed to descend and where he found remains of sculpted stone columns. Highly intrigued and very interested, he did some in-depth research and discovered that, on the site of this cellar, there had been a chapel called “the chapel of Pisa”. His research allowed him to reconstruct the plans of the chapel, and he decided to rebuild it on its original site.
