<p style="text-align:center;">
Lord, I pray to you this morning for everyone<br>
Those who wake up with me...<br>
<br>
Those who find their new strength<br>
And who rise up full of vigor<br>
For the adventure of a new day, Those who don't get up<br>
And who become aware of their great age,<br>
Those who find companions<br>
The trials of their body<br>
And the obsessions of their minds,<br>
Those who courageously take up their cross<br>
And those who reload their burden<br>
By bending a little more today,<br>
Those who go blindly towards their destiny,<br>
And those who walk while staring at a star.<br>
<br>
I entrust them all to you Lord<br>
And the children who don't know where they're going<br>
Those who sing<br>
And those who cry and who need so much<br>
That You give them your hand!<br>
<br>
And those who today<br>
Wake up in prison or in torture chambers<br>
Or on death row.<br>
<br>
Lord, have compassion on them:<br>
<br>
Stop their executioners, these poor creatures<br>
Who don't know what they're doing.<br>
<br>
Lord, the sky is gray, so heavy this morning<br>
On the hearts of so many men...<br>
<br>
Lord, the sky is turning pink towards the East...<br>
<br>
And so many hands reach out to him<br>
<br>
With the hope of this day<br>
That you give them.<br>
<br>
So many hearts are moving<br>
Today for life!<br>
<br>
So many courses that will beat<br>
Today their first beats!<br>
<br>
And so many courses will also stop beating,<br>
Take them in your love<br>
For the time of life<br>
Out of the time of life.<br>
<br>
And give us our loaf of grace<br>
To live under Your gaze, our life today.<br>
</p>

Amen
