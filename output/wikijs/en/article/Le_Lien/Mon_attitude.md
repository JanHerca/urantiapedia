_My attitude: “Impossible to get better”!_
_Everything in life is a question of choices._
_How do I react to each event, each situation?_
_I choose to be in a good mood!_
_I choose to learn!_
_I choose to show the positive side of life!_
_I am able to choose how others influence my moods_
_! I choose how to live my life!_
_I choose to live fully rather than die!_
_In all that I am,_
_How I feel,_
_How others see me,_
_How I live,_
_I alone make the decision!_

Grandpa — the — sinner
