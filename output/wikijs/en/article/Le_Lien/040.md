## A word from the President

On the occasion of the transfer of the head office from Paris to Marseille, I would like to thank Georges and Marlène Michelson-Dupont on behalf of all the members who have made up the AFLUB since its creation in 1996. Indeed, not only are Georges and Marlène founding members of the AFLUB (see list in the appendix of the new statutes) who actively worked on the transition from CERDH to the AFLUB, now under the aegis of the UAI, but they also hosted its head office in their premises at the Urantia Foundation SA France for eleven years.

The proximity of the two structures during this first decade of existence was the occasion for a fruitful interaction between the two entities, one participating in the mission of the other: sale of UB and social activity of studying UB were thus closely linked.

## Book Study

## The Biological Improvement of Humanity

Study of the URANTIA Book \* by Claude Castel

**Preamble**

> “_You will learn that you increase your burdens and decrease the likelihood of success by taking yourself too seriously. Nothing can take precedence over the work of your status sphere—this world or the next. Very important is the work of preparation for the next higher sphere, but nothing equals the importance of the work of the world in which you are actually living. But though the *work* is important, the *self* is not. When you feel important, you lose energy to the wear and tear of ego dignity so that there is little energy left to do the work. Self-importance, not work-importance, exhausts immature creatures; it is the self element that exhausts, not the effort to achieve. You can do important work if you do not become self-important; you can do several things as easily as one if you leave yourself out. Variety is restful; monotony is what wears and exhausts. Day after day is alike—just life or the alternative of death._” ([UB 48:6.37](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p6_37))

Today's knowledge allows us to improve plant and animal species relatively well, through selection, hybridization or other methods.

What does The URANTIA Book say about the biological conditions of the human species and possible possibilities for improvement?

## Some Thoughts and Questions from Me


> “_Self-consciousness consists in intellectual awareness of personality actuality; it includes the ability to recognize the reality of other personalities. It indicates capacity for individualized experience in and with cosmic realities, equivalating to the attainment of identity status in the personality relationships of the universe. Self-consciousness connotes recognition of the actuality of mind ministration and the realization of relative independence of creative and determinative free will._” ([UB 16:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_6))

Cime is not with my flashlight that I will succeed in lighting the sun! May the spiritual Being who would be at the origin of this poetic metaphor forgive me the plagiarism! It is enough to read carefully the pages of the _Urantia Book_ to know that the ideas that I am going to emit here on the subject of certain questions that I have always asked myself, are more explicit in the text of the book, than my human attempt to explain them.

I admit, I struggled (didn't you?) before I learned of the revelations relating to the questions I was asking myself about the mind, identity, the soul and personality.

## After the death of his life partner

- It's a psychological upheaval.
- We see that all his gestures and decisions were conditioned by the presence and points of view of the other.
- There is no available reaction energy... The passage of time is essential to envisage rehabilitation.
- Habits — customary gestures — many objects — are emptied of their meaning.

All these conditionings had dug their furrows in our thought, but, because we are “living beings”, the flow of time, the impulse of our will and our lucidity will slowly fill them to leave room for new ones, adapted to the new life that we will have chosen.

## Thank you my God

<p style="text-align:center;">
Thank you, my God, for putting this fabulous revelation of the time into my hands.<br>
What a joy to be able to have a clear perception of my being and its destiny in your creation.<br>
What joy before your greatness hierarchized to us and for us.<br>
What a joy to be able to live the adventure of eternal progress with our brothers and sisters.<br>

## Brother Dominique's Corner

Today I think about the soul, finally, about **my** soul.

Who is she?

Can I “think” my soul?

Sometimes perhaps a grace, a particular well-being can invade us, and then we will speak of the soul.

But is that really it?

### Michael's Birthday August 21, 2007

On the occasion of Micaël's birthday, Éliane Grivet was kind enough to welcome us, for the second time, to her home in Le Pontet, near Avignon.

She had prepared a succulent beef bourguignon for the seventeen guests present.

This time, the meeting also brought together readers from the Var group as well as a new participant, a former reader, who is currently preparing an illustrated site on the UB texts and has submitted her project for the appreciation of the readers present.

## Slices of Life

### Small morontia bubbles

I was waiting for the bus and suddenly in the middle of all these people who were fidgeting around me, who were jostling, who were laughing, who were walking indifferently, I began to think that all these beings who surrounded me, possessed like me a spark of absolute coming from the divine and that we all had the same Father. Then, a surge of Fraternity and love invaded me like a discharge of adrenaline. I suddenly felt so close to all these people that I did not know, that there was no more anger, no doubt, no disappointment in me. For a moment, I found myself in a higher dimension. The bus arrived, I fell back to earth, but all day long, happiness accompanied me.

**Letter No. 2**

Experience continually shows us that many of us who are gripped by the incomparable dimension to which The Urantia Book introduces find ourselves subject to impulses which are difficult to control.

We have included in Letter No. 1 a particularly enlightening analysis by Meredith Sprunger on this theme.

But it is of such importance to us that we felt it necessary to present in this second Letter an excerpt from “Unity but not Uniformity”, a study presented on June 29, 1973 by Martin Myers at the first conference of the Western United States, which deals more particularly with the spirit in which the creators of the Urantia Foundation and the Urantia Assembly acted. We are making the entire text of this conference available to readers who wish to receive it.
