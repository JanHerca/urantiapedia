## Discussions

**I. Election of the positions of: President, Vice-President, Treasurer, Secretary.**

The entire assembly votes by show of hands and unanimously reappoints all the former members of the office.

**II. Should the B-Association software be changed?**

The B-association software needs to be changed, we should try a new accounting software “DIACAMA”. Before changing, the treasurer suggests keeping the old B-association and doing a test with the new software to see if the treasurer is able to maintain it without difficulty.

**III. Discussion on the establishment of a free Internet line for Guy Stéphane Nyasse.**

Our association had already given its agreement for the purchase of a computer, at the price of 310 euros, for Guy Stéphane Nyasse who lives in Douala in Cameroon. The request for the opening of the Internet line is put to the vote of the assembly and of the 16 members present, 2 do not agree and 14 vote for the establishment of the line, the costs of which will be borne by the AFLUB and will amount to 220 euros for the installation and 200 euros for communications per year.

**IV. Should the contribution form be changed?**

Regarding contributions, the majority decides not to change the form. It fully meets our needs.

**V. Concerning our little newspaper “Le Lien”, perhaps include shorter articles from other countries.**

Regarding sending the Link, out of a total of 14 members 2 do not agree that it should be free. The majority of readers are satisfied but ask to put shorter articles. Readers want information to also come from other countries if an article is longer but interesting, it will then be accepted.

**VI. Accounting.**

An operating account and balance sheet will be presented in the next Link because the accountant is on leave and was unable to prepare it in July.

**VII. What about forum activity?**

Currently we have about 80 members but most are passive spectators, only about ten people post and comment on the texts. Many are members of the AFLUB but we also have other participants. The forum receives about 30 visitors per day and this is about the same as in previous years.

There are two or three new messages per week. The current version of the forum dates from May 2014 — since then, about 2300 messages have been sent. The question is: “how to bring readers to the forum”?

**VIII. Upcoming meetings outside France.**

**THE 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE UAI ASSOCIATION.**

It will be held in Amsterdam — Netherlands; from April 12 to 15, 2018 (See The Link of June 2017) It is organized by the Urantia Association of the Netherlands.

_Theme of the conference_

This conference, whose theme is “Jesus the Teacher,” should attract many readers of The Urantia Book from around the world. The subtitle “Are you ready to live his teachings in the 21st century” is a question that invites us to explore our knowledge of Jesus' teachings, his personal religion and his message in this century that is beginning. How can we be disciples and teachers of the future.
