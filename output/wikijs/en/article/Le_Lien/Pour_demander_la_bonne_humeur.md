Give me good digestion, Lord,
And also something to digest.
Give me health of body,
Help me keep it as good as possible.
Give me a holy soul, Lord,
Who has eyes on beauty and purity,
So that she will not be terrified when she sees sin,
But know how to rectify the situation.
Give me a soul that is ignorant of boredom,
The moan and the sigh.
Don't let me worry too much
For this bulky thing I call me.
Lord, give me a sense of humor.
Give me the grace to know how to discern a joke,
So that I can get something out of this life
And share it with others.

Saint Thomas More
