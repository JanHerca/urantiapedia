## Editor's Note

The Urantia Book is a revelation, and all revelation is the compensatory substitute for morontia mota on the worlds of time. Revelation leads to the awareness of true reality. Revelation is evolutionary man’s only hope for bridging the morontia gulf. Without the aid of mota, faith and reason can neither conceive nor construct a logical universe. Without the insight of mota, mortal man cannot discern goodness, love, and truth in the phenomena of the material world. (<a id="a53_470"></a>[UB 4:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p2_7); <a id="a53_511"></a>[UB 102:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p3_5); <a id="a53_556"></a>[UB 103:6.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p6_13)) Our study of _The Urantia Book_ is our only means of discerning these universe realities; let us do so with all the strength of our faith.

## Missions

We have all been taught that on each of the worlds of Havona we would have a different mission to accomplish. A billion missions! We are sometimes less aware that on this planet each of us has a mission.

Likewise, we know that Jesus said to his apostles: “Go therefore into all the world and preach to all nations and races this gospel of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man,...” <a id="a88_189"></a>[[UB 191:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/191#p4_4)] (<a id="a88_236"></a>[UB 165:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p6_3)). However, on closer inspection, we see that the mission of the apostles differs somewhat from one to another. Chapter 2 on page 2047 deserves some attention. John is asked to renounce intolerance and to devote his life to proving that love is the greatest thing in the world. Peter is asked not to neglect the weak, the poor, and the young. Andrew is asked to trust others. James is asked to cultivate patience. Thomas is asked to cease doubting, to be strong in faith and powerful in the kingdom. Nathaniel is asked to devote himself to the welfare of his earthly brothers, to mix friendship with his counsel, and to add love to his philosophy. To Philip, to proclaim the gospel to the Gentiles. To Matthew, to teach all peoples the gospel of the kingdom. And what does he say to the Alphaeus brothers? Although he recognizes them as apostles, he does not call them to a teaching mission but simply to do the work they had been doing previously as if it were for God: “_Continue to believe when I am gone and to remember your fellowship with me after you have perhaps returned to the work you were accustomed to before you came to live with me._” <a id="a88_1429"></a>[[UB 192:2.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p2_13)]

## Does man need God to live? Is it weakness to believe in God?

**PERSONAL APPROACH**

It is in man's instinct to believe in God.

It is an inner call. For more than a century, since the era of materialism, more and more people have been rebelling against the idea of a universal creator. These people find the idea of an invisible father infantile and reject what has been part of our deepest feeling since the dawn of time.

## Census Directors

We have all read Chapter 2 on pages 266 and 267, but what did we take away from it? Generally, on first reading, not much. However, this chapter is full of interesting information provided that we can correlate them. Let's look at it a little more closely.

The first paragraph tells us:

> _Notwithstanding that the cosmic mind of the Universal Intelligence is cognizant of the presence and whereabouts of all *thinking* creatures, there is operative in the universe of universes an independent method of keeping count of all *will* creatures._ (<a id="a112_258"></a>[UB 24:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/24#p2_1))

## Dalamatia, the city of hundreds by Caligastia Dilmun, the city of nodites

> _Very soon after the rebellion the entire staff of sedition were engaged in energetic defense of the city against the hordes of semisavages who besieged its walls as a result of the doctrines of liberty which had been prematurely taught them. And years before the beautiful headquarters went down beneath the southern waves, the misled and mistaught tribes of the Dalamatia hinterland had already swept down in semisavage assault on the splendid city, driving the secession staff and their associates northward._ (<a id="a120_516"></a>[UB 67:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p5_2))

The Urantia Book tells us that Dalamatia, the splendid city of the Hundreds of Caligastia, was located in the southwest of the Arabian Peninsula. Probably off the western coast of present-day Yemen, that is, in the southern part of the present-day Red Sea. At least, this is what we can deduce from what we read in the Urantia Book when compared with what modern archaeology tells us in parallel. Here is how we can arrive at such a hypothetical conclusion:

## Testimony from elsewhere

### Retirement

The countryside is grey under the white sky. As far as the eye can see, the plowed fields are exposed to the fine, insistent rain of late winter. It's been a long time since hedges and sunken paths lost the battle against land consolidation! At the edge of the village, very discreet behind the high garden wall, the silent ashram seems deserted. But it recognizes me and welcomes me, as usual, with a great surge of joy and love deep in its chest.

On the walls, orange gurus covered in flowers. Arjuna on his chariot. Blue Krishna and his snake. The omnipresent incense. Silence. It's been a long time since I've been here, and I'm so happy to see them again, the ashramites and the few “regular” disciples. The guru is traveling. So much the better, without him there will be fewer people, and the schedule will be more flexible! And then it's not my guru, the one who initiated me: he left this plane three years ago. I know this one less well, I have trouble making contact.

## Questions — Answers

**Question about the article “Synthesis of Reality” by Joseph Servant, in Link 22, page 4, end of the 1st paragraph.**

Joseph Servant tells us: “only the soul loves.” How then does he explain the love, or affection that animals are capable of showing to man since they do not have a soul?

## Relaxation Corner

### Poem for Jesus

The man walked in his suit of light
bearer of the torch of hope,
and his magic words to men devoid of knowledge,
brought like a momentum, like a force crossing borders.
The man spoke as if attached to the stars
and invisible bonds connected him to the heavens
and the man in our frozen solitudes tore the veil
which separated us from the power of God.
Man taught us to love, to love even our sufferings,
to love the one who groans,
to no longer fear the heartbreak of absence,
He gave us the keys to the meaning of life.

### Clarity

The true depth of a mind or soul can only be seen in clarity.
One can lie with sincerity if one deceives oneself. To be clear-sighted in one's thinking, for oneself and for others, is to be just.

### About the Dourdan International Conference...

My wife and I, as well as several readers from Quebec, attended and took the opportunity to make a 3-week trip. For my part, it was a very enriching experience, first impressed by the place where the 2002 conference was held, the good French food, Wow! and the warm welcome from our French friends. We were able to meet many interesting people, from several countries, and put a face to readers of the forum, such as Jeanmarie, Christine, Héléna, Jean Royer, and others.

I found it very pleasant to discuss in the workshop and during the whole “congress” with people who were open-minded and had the same goal in life, namely respect for others and wanting to do the will of God. I was also delighted to see many young people, in their 20s, 30s and even 40s, that's still young!

I liked the spontaneous humor of Jean Royer, who was the “watchdog” of schedule discipline and several other logistical details.

Congratulations once again to all those who contributed to the organisation and running of the 2002 Conference.

It was a refresher, a boost to continue reading and study groups, a Urantian bath, in love and solidarity, supported, enlightened and supervised by many celestial personalities, I am sure.

I particularly enjoyed interacting with readers from other countries, with whom I could communicate during breaks, meals, etc. and see the fraternity that can exist between all peoples and people of good will.

Afterwards, we visited Paris, Wow, Paris is beautiful, the museums, the art and the architecture... but it's expensive in Euros! We then went to Brittany and Normandy with their respective points of interest.

France is very beautiful, and the roads are all very beautiful! What a tumultuous history this country has experienced!!!

Thanks to Jeanmarie for the symbolism of the numbers.

The next international meeting will take place in Chicago in 2004. I am sure that there will be even more of us from Quebec.

My batteries are charged to go further in the path of the Spirit of Truth and the Will of our Universal Father.

Good luck to everyone.

Fraternally,

Yvon Belle-Isle (Quebec)

### August in Dourdan

Some friends recently asked me to tell them about Dourdan 2002. Here is what I sent them as a report.

A few days before Jesus' birthday (the two thousand and ninth, I believe), 14 countries were represented this year by 225 members of the fraternal world association of Readers of the _Urantia Book_ at our French meeting in Dourdan, the first of its kind outside the United States. I specify, 225, but in fact, there were 226, because a certain Damien, a half-philosopher, half-homeless troubadour, who usually haunts the outskirts of the universities of a city in our Brittany, was surreptitiously hosted by a reader who had taken a liking to him. But hush! the information should not be spread. (It seems, for the record, that Damien's Urantia Book is a real relic, so much has he studied it.)
