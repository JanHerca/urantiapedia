Report

## I Opening of the assembly

The general meeting began on June 3, 2023 at 5:00 p.m. There were 13 members present at this meeting (see attendance sheet appendix).

With three powers:

Stol Ivan had the power of Olivetta Lino and Jean-Christophe CHUINE.

MALICOT Sophie had the power of COZETTE CYRIL

That is, 13 people +3 delegations of power which makes this general assembly valid according to our Statutes.

## 2 Choice of office members

As every year, it is possible for volunteers to come forward to take on one of the administrative tasks of the association, namely, president (currently Ivan Stol), vice-president (currently Lucas PERIER), treasurer (currently Jean DUVAU), secretary (currently Georges Michelson-Dupont).

Mr. Gilles-Patrick MAUROY was a candidate and ran for the position of vice president

The vote was taken by show of hands and unanimously, Gilles-Patrick MAUROY was elected as the new vice president.

The other current positions were reappointed by unanimous show of hands.

## 3 Presentation of treasury

Our treasurer Jean Duvau presented the financial documents on the following page. The accounts were unanimously approved.

## 4 Future of the association

There is not much member renewal but we do not have a solution currently.

Conference and exhibition initiatives have not been followed by any support, but it takes some time to read this live.

The economic situation of bookstores and the few people who read a lot in France do not help.

## 5 Upcoming meetings

We have decided to prepare our next national meeting for 2024 and its implementation will begin this June 2023.

We were asked to organize the next European meeting of 2025 in FRANCE and I took it upon myself to accept this challenge despite the small number of participants. But I think that with the help of all the goodwill in Europe we will succeed. During the assembly, we thought that an unusual and humorous theme on the presence of GOD and his distributivity would really be something new and in accordance with The Urantia Book.

We have organized the following working groups: accounting, logistics, IT and themes.

The organization chart will be distributed to all members and interested persons.

## 6 Closing of the meeting

The meeting closed around 7:00 p.m.
