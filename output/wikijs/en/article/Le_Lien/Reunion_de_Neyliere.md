The national meeting of readers of the _Urantia Book_ took place this year 2015 from June 18 to 21 at the Domaine de la Neylière near Lyon.

17 Readers went to this calm and revitalizing place, at an altitude of 650 m, run by Marist Fathers, to study the book on a particular theme, hold the general assembly of the Association and of course meet other readers.

The subject of study focused on the differences between evolution on a “so-called normal” planet and evolution on Urantia, Urantia being a decimal planet and the scene of a betrayal of its Planetary Prince and an Adamic failure. It was also a question of reflecting on the consequences, advantages or disadvantages, of being born on such a world.

## Here is a summary of our study

The subject was introduced by the reminder of the Plan, or rather the plans of divine perfection, of:

- _God the Father_: the plan of progressive achievement or ascension through evolution
- _God the Son_: the plan of bestowal of sons to reveal the Father
- _God the Infinite Spirit_: the ministry of mercy through himself and his personalities to carry out the plan.

In paradise resides Absolute perfection and Havona is its model.

To the seven superuniverses was given a single injunction:

Be perfect like your Father
in Paradise is perfect.

_Be perfect as your Father in Heaven is perfect._

The study was carried out following the plan of booklet 52, Planetary Epochs of Mortals. They trace the 7 periods of evolution of the life of Man in the Era of Light and Life:

- _Age 1_: Man before the Planetary Prince
- _Age 2_: Man after the Planetary Prince
- _Age 3_: Post-Adamic Man
- _Age 4_: The Man after the Magisterial Son
- _Age 5_: The Man after the Son of Bestowal
- _Age 6_: The Man after the Instructor Sons
- _Age 7_: The Era of Light and Life.

From Age 1, which begins when man emerges from the animal level, to Age 7, the Age of Light and Life, an evolution takes place which goes from ages of struggles between tribes to a highly advanced civilization characterized among other things by world peace, true philosophy and universal interest.

In all scientific, economic, political and spiritual areas, men grow, thanks also to the help of the different outpourings of the Sons.

Studying the booklet allowed us to understand the different eras.

The following table sets forth the principal differences between evolution on a normal planet and the evolution of Urantia during Ages 1 through 3.

**Don't hesitate to go back to reading booklet 52 to see the details of these periods!**

Urantia has deviated so much from the divine plan following the failure of the Planetary Prince combined with the fall of Adam and Eve, that it is difficult, at a certain moment, to compare evolutions by Age.

<div class=“urantiapedia-table-wrapper”>

| Age | Normal world | Urantia |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Age 1 | Dark and bloody era <br> Races appear successively | Experimental world: extremely brutal prolonged struggles <br> Races appeared at the same time |
| Age 2 | Prince Government: social progress <br> Educational centers <br> National unity <br> Discrimination against defective types <br> Gender equality | Rebellion: Less progress/more wars <br> No educational centers <br> Diversity of advancement; tribal mode existence <br> No discrimination yet <br> No gender equality yet |
| Age 3 | No mating of Adam and Eve with peoples <br> Physical improvement <br> Progress inventions <br> 1 amalgamated race | Fall of Adam and Eve <br> Delay and lack of physical improvement <br> Delay/spreading of progress <br> Delay of an amalgamated race |

In the face of this, Urantia benefited from emergency plans with “unique” characteristics such as the coming of Jesus (our Creator Son!), the gift of the Adjusters and the Spirit of Truth.

In the same way, it is extremely complicated to know in which period we are currently located because we have elements of different ages on Urantia.

Overall, we are very far behind (Age 3) despite our good progress in the field of science and technology.

Reading this booklet up to age 5 also allowed us to learn about future developments on Urantia such as the unification of governments, the presence of a single race, peace on Urantia, a working time of a few hours per day and good leisure time by practicing music and the arts.

Finally, we discussed the “luck” or “bad luck” of being born on Urantia rather than on a normal planet by reading the booklet $50-7$ “The rewards of isolation” which defines the Agondontary: They are "evolutionary volitional creatures who can believe without seeing, persevere in isolation and triumph over almost insurmountable difficulties, even when they are alone! To conclude this report, we would like to thank all the spiritual helpers present during this weekend, all the readers who were absent but present in thought with us, all the readers present who allowed an interesting study of the book, a fraternal sharing during breaks, meals and evenings, a good communion of souls and the constructive holding of the general assembly of our association.

A pleasant surprise awaited us this weekend: the arrival of Antonio SCHEFER, President of the Congress Committee at the A.U.I., with whom we were able to share at length!
