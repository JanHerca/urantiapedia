## To have and to be

Far from the old grammar books
Listen to how one beautiful evening
My mother taught me the mysteries
From the verb to be and the verb to have...

Among my best helpers
There are two original verbs
To have and to be were two brothers
That I have known since the cradle

Although opposite in character
We could have thought they were twins
Their story is so unique
But these two brothers were rivals

What Having Would Have Wanted to Be
Being always wanted to have it
Wanting neither god nor master
The verb To Be has been had

His brother Avoir was in the bank
And put on a great show
While Being, always lacking
Suffered a lot in his ego

While Being was learning to read
And did his humanities
On his side without telling him anything
Having learned to count

And he amassed fortunes
In assets, in liquidity
While being a little in the clouds
Had allowed himself to be dispossessed

To have was ostentatious
As soon as he showed himself generous
To be on the other hand, and it is notorious
Is often presumptuous

Have traveled in Business class
He puts all his titles away
While Being is more gentle
He won't keep anything for himself

Its wealth is entirely internal.
These are the things of the mind
The verb To Be is all about modesty
And its nobility comes at this price...

One day through fantasies
To reach an agreement
Between verbs it can be done
They combined their efforts

And to save face
In the midst of the gathered words
They divided up the tasks
To finally reconcile

The verb To Have needs to Be
Because to be is to exist
The verb To be needs to have
To enrich its good sides

And endless palaver
In convoluted quibbles
Our two inseparable brothers
Could have been and been
