The day I truly loved myself,
I understood that in all circumstances,
I was in the right place at the right time.
And then I was able to relax.

_Today, I know it's called ***Self-esteem***._

The day I truly loved myself,
I was able to perceive that my anxiety and my emotional suffering,
were nothing more than a signal when I go against my beliefs.

_Today, I know it's called ***Authenticity***._

The day I truly loved myself,
I stopped wanting a different life
and I began to see that everything that happens to me
contributes to my personal growth.

_Today, I know it's called ***Maturity***._

The day I truly loved myself,
I began to perceive the abuse
in forcing a situation, or a person,
for the sole purpose of getting what I want,
knowing full well that neither the person nor myself are ready
and that this is not the time.

_Today, I know it's called ***Respect***._

The day I truly loved myself,
I began to free myself from everything that was not beneficial to me,
people, situations, anything that lowered my energy.
At first, my reason called it selfishness.

_Today, I know that it's called ***Self-Love***._

The day I truly loved myself,
I stopped being afraid of free time
and I stopped making big plans,
I gave up on the megaprojects of the future.
Today I do what is right,
what i like,
when I like it and at my own pace.

_Today, I know it's called **Simplicity**._

The day I truly loved myself,
I stopped trying to always be right and
realized all the times I was wrong.

_Today, I discovered ***Humility***._

The day I truly loved myself,
I stopped reliving the past
and worry about the future.
Today, I live in the present,
where all life happens.

_Today, I live one day at a time, and that's called ***Fullness***._

The day I truly loved myself,
I understood that my head could deceive me and disappoint me,
but if I put it at the service of my heart,
she becomes a very valuable ally.
All this is... Knowing how to live.

We must not be afraid to confront ourselves.
From chaos stars are born.
Charlie Chaplin

_All this is called_ ***Knowing how to be — Knowing how to live — Knowing how to love***

Charlie Chaplin
