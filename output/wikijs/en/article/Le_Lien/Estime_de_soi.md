Poem for those who want to improve their self-esteem

_I am what I am._
_By having faith in the beauty that lives within me, I develop confidence._
_In gentleness, I find strength._
_In silence, I walk with the gods._
_In peace, I understand myself and I understand the world._
_I am moving away from the conflict._
_I find freedom in letting go._
_It is by respecting everything that I respect myself._
_It is in devotion that I honor my courage._
_In eternity, I have compassion for the nature of all things._
_In love, I unconditionally accept the evolution of others._
_In freedom, I have the power._
_In my individuality, I express the divine force that inhabits me._
_In the service of others, I give what I have become._
_I am what I am: eternal, immortal, universal and infinite._

Stuart Wilde
