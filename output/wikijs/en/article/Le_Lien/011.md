## A Word from the President

In this period of return from summer vacations, often materially and intellectually charged, I would like to draw your attention in this issue - as a form of appeasement and spiritual encouragement on the one hand, to the article on The Urantia Book in Africa and the testimonial section on the other. Both are in their own way witnesses to sometimes astonishing encounters with The Urantia Book; they remind us simply but forcefully that the Spirit of Truth and other spiritual influences work tirelessly with all men.

On the other hand, I invite you to read in detail the September circular attached to this issue. In this regard, I renew my call for your mobilization for the great international meeting that awaits us in 2002. Excellent recovery to all.

Francois Le Rohellec
President of the A.F.L.L.U.

## The Urantia Book in Africa

**Story of a trip to Dakar**

We have always wondered how the Muslim world would receive The Urantia Book and its teachings. Part of the answer was given to us during our trip to Dakar, Senegal.

A little over a year ago, we were contacted by a group of readers of the _Urantia Book_ living in Dakar. What a surprise it was to learn that its members had been reading the book for over 25 years for some! The Paris office of the URANTIA Foundation did have some addresses of isolated readers and occasional buyers, but we were not aware of any group. Here, it was a group of over 50 active readers engaged in the study and dissemination of the teachings of the _Urantia Book_.

## Report on the Gulley meeting of June 11-13, 1999, better known as the “MILLENNIUM INITIATIVE”

About 10 years ago, following a difference of opinion between the Urantia Foundation and the Brotherhood, a split occurred. This separation gave birth on one side to the Fellowship and on the other to the IUA (International Urantia Association), an organization set up by the Foundation to replace the Brotherhood. On this side of the Atlantic, the importance of this split and its impact on the Anglo-Saxon readership are poorly perceived. The potentials contained in this split are truly a threat to the Urantia movement as a whole. Hence the real scope of the success of this meeting of the Millennium Initiative.

It was to try to remedy this situation that the Millennium Initiative, composed of individuals acting solely in a private capacity, took the initiative of coming together, taking care to specify that they did not represent any organization.

A first meeting took place in March 1999 in Gulley, Vermont, USA, with 10 members. It quickly became clear that 10 more members would be useful in order to represent even more points of view.

A second meeting was held from June 11 to 13, 1999 at the same location. All 20 members participated.

Late on the night of Saturday, June 12, a unanimous agreement was reached. In its wording, the Millennium Initiative Committee recommends to the two organizations responsible for the IUA and the Urantia Book Fellowship a formal working alliance.

It is now up to the responsible organizations of the IUA and the Fellowship to seize this opportunity. They must either reject or accept this recommendation, the translation of which you will find below. But considering that the members of the Millennium Initiative Committee are for the most part former members or holders of positions of responsibility in the community of readers, it is likely that both the IUA and the Fellowship will accept the recommendation and take appropriate measures.

Statement of the Millennium Initiative Committee which met from June 11 to 13, 1999 at “The Gulley”, Vermont, USA.

The Millennium Initiative Committee unanimously believes that unity of purpose, as manifested in a community of worldwide readership, advances the best interests of the Fifth Epochal Revelation as we enter the next millennium.

To this end, and with the greatest respect for the autonomous integrity of existing organizations in the community, we unanimously recommend a formal working alliance between the International Urantia Association and the Urantia Book Fellowship.

While the shared experience and deep fellowship that was a significant part of the work we did together will forever unite the participants, we have agreed to dissolve the Millennium Initiative Committee and encourage existing organizations to continue the process.

In all friendship.

## Who was Jesus? (end)

When the Michael Sons come forth from Paradise to undertake the creation and organization of a universe, they solemnly vow not to assume full sovereignty of the new creation until seven creature bestowals have been successfully completed and confirmed by the Ancients of Days having jurisdiction over the superuniverse concerned. (<a id="a131_331"></a>[UB 119:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p0_3))

The purpose of these incarnations in creature form is to enable these Creators to become wise, compassionate, just and understanding rulers. They become mercifully benevolent as a result of these successive bestowal experiences. (<a id="a133_230"></a>[UB 119:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p0_4))

## The building

This took place in a large multi-story building, whose owner was a certain Jesus. The tenants generally resided on the first and ground floors. Some seemed completely unaware of the existence of upper floors. Others absolutely refused to believe in upper parts that they could not see. On the other hand, a small group of daring people, more attracted by the light that emanated from the upper spheres, had been tempted to climb the stairs to see through the windows that the brightness was greater. They had enjoyed it there and had decided to stay there, their thoughts being better enlightened and freed.

But in this sacred building, there were also cellars like in all dwellings. And surprisingly, these cellars were inhabited by families. Some could not stand the light, but in general they did not know of its existence. They stayed there out of habit. Apart from a few minorities who had had the intuition of the existence of somewhere else, these had started to dig galleries that sent them even further down into the depths. For lack of light to guide them, they died out.

The moral of this story, if there is one, is that windows are necessary. In order to let light in, it is a matter of survival.

Helena Dessoubret

## No one comes to the Father except through the Son, but no one comes to the Son except through the Spirit

We remember the words of Jesus: “No one comes to the Father except through the Son.”

The Urantia Book explains it to us.

> _In all these widespread activities of the far-flung spiritual administration of the Eternal Son, do not forget that the Son is a person just as truly and actually as the Father is a person. Indeed, to beings of the onetime human order the Eternal Son will be more easy to approach than the Universal Father. In the progress of the pilgrims of time through the circuits of Havona, you will be competent to attain the Son long before you are prepared to discern the Father._ (<a id="a155_477"></a>[UB 7:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/7#p7_5))

We must also understand that no one comes to the Son except by the Spirit. This is also explained to us;

> _The Eternal Son is the only avenue of approach to the Universal Father, and the Infinite Spirit is the only means of attaining the Eternal Son. It is only through the patient ministry of the Spirit that the ascending beings of time are able to discover the Son._
> 
> _At the center of all things, the Infinite Spirit is the first Paradise Deity reached by ascending pilgrims. The Third Person envelops the Second and the First, and therefore must always be the first recognized by candidates desiring to be introduced to the Son and the Father._
> 
> _And there are many other ways in which the Spirit similarly represents and similarly serves the Father and the Son._ <a id="a163_120"></a>[UB 8:3.7-9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/8#p3_7)

So we must work to better understand the Infinite Spirit, and thereby also the Mother Spirit of the Universe who is its daughter. Here again the Urantia Book teaches us:

> _The Infinite Spirit is a complete and perfect personality, the divine equal and coordinate of the Universal Father and the Eternal Son. The Conjoint Creator is just as real and visible to the higher intelligences of the universes as the Father and the Son. Indeed, he is more so, for ***it is the Spirit which all ascenders must attain before they can approach the Father through the Son***._
> 
> _The Infinite Spirit, the Third Person of Deity, possesses all the attributes which you attach to personality. He is endowed with absolute mind: “The Spirit searches all things, yea, the deep things of God.” The Spirit is endowed not only with mind but also with will. Concerning the bestowal of his gifts it has been written: “But the one and the same Spirit worketh all these things, distributing to every man severally as he will.”_ <a id="a169_438"></a>[UB 8:6.2-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/8#p6_2)

So: No one comes to the Father except through the Son, but no one comes to the Son except through the Spirit; a small phrase but a great meaning.

Patrice Dessoubret

## The Very Human Conceptions of The Urantia Book

The Urantia Book has drawn extensively upon the human conceptions of our past and into our present to serve us with all the beautiful spiritual realities of God's creation. It is not, therefore, improper or inappropriate to seek among our elders those traces of the light which, in a certain way, makes us what we are when our search is illumined by the Spirit of Truth.

The legacy of the “great texts” cannot be reduced to simple testimonies of bygone eras. They can concern us much more than the dominant spirit of this end of the millennium seems to believe. Despite the presuppositions of this spirit which tends to discredit what is not clearly useful to it, we are not backward-looking because we seek in other times and other spaces (anachronistic in the light of current societies) more enlightened knowledge to be so, or weapons to positively resist an order which shamelessly mystifies itself under the cover of modernism.

The challenge, which is contained in the virtualities specific to the collective memory constituted by humanity during its history, is essential. This is why we will always have an indescribable pleasure in finding in certain authors realities as striking as those that can be discovered in the course of a reading, always in search of the truth.

This is how a Thought Adjuster aided by the Spirit of Truth in man so wisely inspired one of our most brilliant philosophers of the 17th century French by imposing himself on him in such a real way. Here is what Nicolas Malebranche wrote in the middle of the previous century, that other century that we call the Age of Enlightenment:

"There is only God who makes us see with evidence that we must yield to what he wishes of us; we must therefore be slaves only to him. There is no evidence in the attractions and caresses, in the threats and fears that the passions cause in us; they are only confused and obscure feelings to which we must not yield. We must wait until a purer light enlightens us, until these false days of the passions dissipate, and until God speaks. We must return to ourselves and seek within ourselves the one who never leaves us and who always enlightens us. He speaks quietly, but his voice is distinct; he illuminates little but his light is pure. No, his voice is as strong as it is distinct; his light is as lively and as brilliant as it is pure; but our passions always keep us outside ourselves, and by their noise and their darkness they prevent us from being instructed by his voice and enlightened by his light. He speaks even to those who do not question him; and those whom passions have carried away the furthest nevertheless hear some of his words; but strong, threatening and terrible words, more piercing than a two-edged sword, which penetrates even to the recesses of the soul, and which discerns the thoughts and movements of the heart; for everything is open before his eyes, and he cannot see the disorders of sinners without internally reproaching them with blood. We must therefore return to ourselves and draw near to him. We must question him, listen to him and obey him; for if we always listen to him, we will never be deceived; and if we always obey him, we will never be subject to the inconstancy of the passions and to the miseries due to sin.

The title of Malebranche's work, from which this quote is taken, is “Search for Truth.” What could be more logical?

## Facts, Meanings and Values

> “_God is to science a cause, to philosophy an idea, to religion a person, even the loving heavenly Father. God is to the scientist a primal force, to the philosopher a hypothesis of unity, to the religionist a living spiritual experience. Man’s inadequate concept of the personality of the Universal Father can be improved only by man’s spiritual progress in the universe and will become truly adequate only when the pilgrims of time and space finally attain the divine embrace of the living God on Paradise._” (<a id="a193_514"></a>[UB 1:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p6_2))

**A — human level of cosmic realities or the realm of facts.** We can consider as “fact” everything that exists, everything that happens, everything that is put into action: things, beings, events are facts. Their subjective analysis by the mind is the stuff of meanings.

This is why facts are the building blocks that make possible the building of wisdom (<a id="a197_85"></a>[UB 111:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p6_6)). They are the basic material from which the mind builds its maturity, because, devoid of meanings, they are only a static state of existence in which the notion of evolutionary growth is lacking: the mineral, the plant, man, Jupiter and Mercury are facts. As such, they are part of the domain of science and can be analyzed methodically. Facts are linked according to laws that scientific curiosity forces itself to discover and use through technology: the wind that blows gives birth to mills.

***HOW I KNOW THE URANTIA BOOK*** by Sylvette Perrier

I came across The Urantia Book one beautiful autumn day in 1973, in the back of an esoteric bookstore in Marseille, presented in its marvelous clarity by Pastor Charles Guilhot. Here is the unfolding of this beautiful story.

I met a colleague who was as interested as I was in the search for spiritual values (she had even been a Catholic “sister” during her religious youth); in a primary school (we were both teachers). We were friends and we made a promise that if one of us found the Truth, she would immediately make it known to the other. Long years of spiritual-religious misdirection followed. Finally, I found myself at a standstill, in the gray. I then received a letter from Mrs. Madeleine Claussman-Fabre, my friend, announcing to me that she had finally found the Truth, during a conference at the esoteric bookstore “Le Lotus d'Or”, rue Abbé de l'Epée, in Marseille, given by a Pentecostal pastor, [different from the others, because he had found the “pearl of great price”: “The Cosmogony of Urantia” (title of the book in 1973)].

She advised me to contact Mr. Guilhot, which I did. We made an appointment at the bookstore. A few days later the pastor gave a mini-conference especially for me (only my companion Walter Wûst, my 8-year-old daughter and the bookseller Mr. Griguer were present). I asked Mr. Guilhot questions and he answered them brilliantly. I left with in my hands the most beautiful spiritual treasure I could find.

From that day on, I read the Book regularly (to the extent of my free time, which was very limited at that time). From time to time I visited Mr. and Mrs. Guilhot, explanatory beacons. I no longer felt any mystical, emotional or distressing excitement, as in my past experiences, but little by little my soul effectively quenched its thirst at the Source of living water, and I finally had the sensation — on the spiritual level — of a slave who was given freedom. My friend, Madeleine, abandoned Cosmogony a few years later, to return to the Catholic Church, where she died in peace (she had a beautiful soul). As for me, after so many painful past wanderings, I remain faithful to the Revelation of the 21st century which has freed me.

***TESTIMONIAL*** from Guy Bourhis

My discovery of the _Urantia Book_ was not by chance. It was as if announced, programmed. Judge for yourself: on the opening page of “THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS” by Baird T. Spalding published by R. Laffont, there is a little “notice” that “catches your eye” and arouses your curiosity:

When you close “THE LIFE OF THE MASTERS”, and if you wish to deepen the enigmas offered to your meditations, the translator* allows himself to point out another work that he translated more recently and entitled “The Cosmogony of Urantia” [^1]. It brings to the inhabitants of Urantia (our planet) the knowledge of the cosmos (universe) with its prodigious number of inhabited planets.

You will find a valid answer to the great problem of humanity: Why are we on earth and what is our destiny?

I rushed to rue d'Argenson and took the precious booklets of The Urantia Book from the hands of Jacques Weiss himself, who had an office there, and who also participated, quite fortuitously, in unloading a delivery car with copies of the Book and putting them away in lockers (at the time, all the booklets were photocopied)! ...

After this “helping hand” given very willingly, I had the joy of finding myself sitting in Jacques' office for a long discussion on the 5th Revelation, the Synarchy and many other subjects. From this first exchange was born a long friendship nourished by a fruitful correspondence.

## Poem...

This morning two deer came again
Coming out as always in the middle of silence.
They come every time without us expecting them.
And often when the night is wet with light
Like a mist, a little before day.
The dream then wants to merge with waking.
But it is no longer the dream and it is not awakening.

## Questions and Answers

**Question about an article by Jean Royer in “La lettre” n° 26 p. 5**

1. ***the brain can be compared to the computer (the machine), 2. the circuits of the cortex to the chip,***
2. **mind to software,**
3. **the thought on the way out.**

While points 1, 2 and 4 are understandable, point 3, on the other hand, is more difficult to grasp because, at 1216:6 (latest translation) it says: “The mortal mind is a temporary intellectual system loaned to human beings for the duration of a material life.”

Question 1

If the electricity needed to operate the computer can possibly be compared to the “vital spark” provided by the Creative Daughter of the Infinite Spirit 399:6, what is lent to human beings?

Question 2

How can we define this loan, this “software”. This temporary intellectual system, if it has memory, would it give “reminiscences of past lives” during memory regression sessions and could it be the cause of certain beliefs in reincarnation?

Who can answer me?

Claude Castel

**Another question:**

***Forty or fifty days?***

Among the Jews of Jesus' time, the feast of the wheat harvest took place 50 days, or seven weeks, after Passover, that is, the fiftieth day after this feast commemorating the exodus from Egypt. It was called for this reason the feast of weeks. "You shall celebrate a feast of weeks for the firstfruits of the wheat harvest. (Ex. XXXIV, 21) Because of this number of weeks ( $7 x 7+1$ ) or fifty days, its name became Pentecost from the Greek Pentëkostë = fiftieth.

But this information is in contradiction with what The Urantia Book tells us. Indeed, the Passover which took place on Saturday, April 8 of the year of the crucifixion preceded by only 40 days this other feast of Pentecost which, The Urantia Book tells us, took place on May 18. : (<a id="a269_282"></a>[UB 193:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p5_1)) “_It was almost half past seven in the morning, Thursday, May 18, when Jesus arrived on the western slope of Mount Olivet with his eleven silent and somewhat disoriented apostles._ ”

We do have 22 days of April + 18 days of May for this indicated time span of 40 days, and The Urantia Book is consistent with itself. But it is on the other hand in contradiction with the customs and traditions of the Jewish people. If anyone has an explanation, I would be very happy if he would provide it to me and to the readers of THE URANTIAN LINK. Thank you.

**Response to the article by Jean-Claude Romeuf published in Lien 8**

***Absolutes and Reality***

We can admire in passing the intelligence and benevolence of the Revealers who have been able to spare our efforts of understanding, by not delivering to us in one go all the complexity attached to the concepts of the transcendence of the Deity. They approached it in the first part essentially, then in the second to a lesser degree, and waited until we had a broader knowledge of the whole history of our world to return to it at the end of the third part.

Is not the power of the mind the most wonderful thing there is, which allows us to combine one reality with another and to see that, although so diametrically analogous, they are nevertheless not so far apart as they seem, while one lies at the limits of conceptual reflection, while the other deals with problems affecting life in our farmyards?

## Relaxation Corner

This is the story of a meeting between two long-time readers of The Urantia Book. The first addresses the second in these terms:

“- Hey old man! So, what’s up? How are you doing with your reading?”

“- I have just started my 5th reading. I am on issue 195.”

-«... 195?! Gee! You're reading it faster and faster!»

- “No, that's not it. In fact, to change and have a different approach, I read it backwards.”

-« Upside down?!?!?»

And our first reader left, very impressed by his friend's fervor...and completely decided to test this technique.

But very quickly finding himself alone at home, the book turned over, our reader feels quite disconcerted. Nothing to do, inverted writing remains...inverted and illegible writing.

“No, you don't understand,” our bold 2nd reader later replied, “in fact I adopt a yoga position, a form from which our headstand is derived. Feet against the wall, the head being the only point of contact with the ground. In this posture I can read and meditate intensely.”

Our first reader left again in silence, stunned, his head clouded with contradictory thoughts in a mixture of feelings of admiration and astonishment.

"What is more surprising, starting the book from the end, or having taken this extraordinary position in order to study it, literally, upside down?

**S.O.S. S.O.S. S.O.S.**

Do you know the book “How I found The Urantia Book”? Published in the United States last year, this book presents us with 223 moving and stimulating testimonies. Each of these 223 authors tells how The Urantia Book fell into their hands and how it transformed their life, their person and their vision of things and beings.

For the edification of our brothers and sisters today and tomorrow, it would be of inestimable interest if French-speaking readers also presented their own testimony. Each one has his own exclusive little story, therefore unique, personal and often thrilling with strangeness and surprises. God sometimes makes us take strange paths to lead us to him.

This is why I am launching an S.O.S. to all readers of the Urantian Link. Those who do not receive this publication could be joined by its readers. Is it utopian to hope to collect more than a hundred testimonies?

Do not delay in submitting your testimony to us. Handwritten or typed, send me your text, no more than three pages and it will be published without fail.

Thank you in advance for sharing your experience.
