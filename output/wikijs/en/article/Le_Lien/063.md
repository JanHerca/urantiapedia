***Editor's note*** _(editor's note):_

_The Links are quarterly and appear on the 15th of March, June, September and December! They are first sent to subscribers in digital form (PDF format) on these same dates and then, as far as possible, in their “paper” form. As AFLUB prints are grouped with other periodicals, it is possible that the deadline for the paper format is longer. As for the texts intended to be published within the Link concerned, they must imperatively arrive 30 days before the aforementioned publication date and approved by our president, Ivan Stol, director of publication. Thank you for your understanding._

## Edito: Abundance of articles

Oh surprise for the editor that I am!

Here is an avalanche of readers' texts for this current edition of Le Lien! That's very encouraging! With one caveat, however, the pens let off steam so well that they generated texts that were a bit too long for the small format of our quarterly brochure.

So, for the sake of fairness, we had to resolve to intersperse the longest ones with this good and magical “to be continued”. Frustrating as much for the editorial staff as for the author, I admit. On the one hand, this guarantees a little suspense to our modest publication. With your indulgence!

... Love is stronger than anything. Even if life has disappointed you sometimes, even if people have hurt you, even if you believe hope is lost forever, know that love will repair everything if you let it into your heart. Love forgives everything, erases everything and restores confidence.

If you stop feeling sorry for the mistakes of the past and agree to let go of fears about the future, you take the first step toward finding love, because love cannot coexist with blame, anger, and fear. Love makes you forget suffering and removes hatred.

Love is an emotion that does not seek to be understood, but only felt and shared. If you seek love, start by giving it, spreading it around you, radiating it from the depths of your being and it is then that it will come to you, as if attracted by its fellow man.

## Thesis: On Love II

The first of these rules is that love, in accordance with the general laws of creative union, serves the spiritual differentiation of the two beings it brings together. Neither, therefore, should one absorb the other, — nor, still less, should both lose themselves in the pleasures of a bodily possession which would mean falling into the plural and returning to nothingness. This is common experience. But this is only well understood in the perspective of Spirit-Matter. Love is an adventurous conquest. It holds, and develops, like the Universe itself, only by a perpetual discovery. Those, therefore, only love each other legitimately whom passion leads, both of them, one through the other, to a higher possession of their being. Thus the gravity of the faults against love is not to offend I know not what modesty or what virtue. It consists in squandering, by negligence or by voluptuousness, the reserves of personalization of the Universe. It is this loss which explains the disorders of “impurity”. And it is this again which, at a higher degree in the developments of the union, forms the material for a more subtle alteration of love: I mean selfishness in two.

## Poetry: God Given the Adjuster

<p style="text-align:center;">
Dieudonné constantly stirs my thoughts,<br>
Day at work, night in my sleep,<br>
And track my refusal to open the windows<br>
To approach the boundaries of awakening.<br>
<br>
My laziness annoys him, but above all his kindness,<br>
He absolves me of my very human inclinations<br>
And comes back in secret to deliver his will<br>
To free myself from my unhealthy debates.<br>

## Psychospi: The Seven Fundamental Realities VII

**Critical Tests of Truth**

There are three approaches to the critical evaluation of the validity of facts, meanings, and values: the scientific method of factual validity; the philosophical method of validity consistency; and the religious method of intuitive truth. All three tests use all sources of knowledge, but each emphasizes only one facet of reality.

The main steps of the scientific method are: observation, hypothesis, experimental intention, experimentation, evaluation and verification. It is intersensual and intersubjective, objectivity is of fundamental importance. The observational aspect of the scientific method is rooted in our empirical perception of potentials.

## Caption: Pontius Pilate (2nd part)

_This second article will reinforce some information taken from the “GOLDEN LEGEND”, about Pontius Pilate - and given in LINK No. 62 - with homologous information taken from the Urantia Book on the one hand and from the Larousse encyclopedia (1979) with the words ***PILAT*** and ***PILATE***. For many of its readers, the Urantia Book (UB), gives information at the “top level” of what can currently be revealed to Urantians, in accordance with divine reality. Let us recall that the GOLDEN LEGEND (LD) was written in Italy, in the 13th century, by Jacques de Voragine, born in 1230 in VARAGGIO near GENOA, bishop of GENOA in 1292 and died in 1298._

Let us first compare, with the UB, three of the facts and gestures of Pontius Pilate according to the $L D$, cited above in Link No. 62, on page 24, the penultimate paragraph of our article:
"_PILATE was accused by the Jews, before TIBERIUS:_
- _of having allowed the massacre of the innocents,_
- _of having placed pagan images in the temples,_
- _to have allocated for his personal use the money deposited in the boxes._ »

## Study: Being born of spirit

It may seem difficult for us poor mortals living in this purely physical context to be reborn in spirit when our minds operate on such a material level.

However, this is not really the case because this transition is happening continuously without us noticing (often because we do not understand how it is really done).

First, we must keep in mind all the relationships between man and the various celestial divinities as shown in the attached diagram.

## Study: The Reality of Personality

**Introduction**

We are studying how the human being was created and why he was created. Or as Isaac Newton asked, “What is the use of a newborn baby?” So far we have seen that, like animals, we have a body to which are added five adjutants, five mental minds that constitute consciousness, enabling us to live our lives on this planet. Then we said that human beings have two more adjutants. We have not studied them yet. Why are these two adjutants not present in animals and functioning in their lives? There must be a reason. Yes, it is because a living, conscious being must first have a personality before these other two adjutants can be added and function. The purpose of this first study of personality is therefore to enable us to grasp and feel the reality of personality:

## Reflection: Causes, effects

### FOREWORD

If you like astronomy or astrophysics, if you are curious and a little spiritual, if you want to discover some of the secrets of the universe, read these lines, they will bring you new insight into space.

If you are a materialist and dispute the spiritual universe, or the existence of God, I do not recommend this reading.

My goal is not to make converts, everyone has free will.

## Reflection: Deity - Divinity

Definitions first (personal feeling):

**Prepersonal**: having the ability to receive or merge with a personality, therefore being able to recognize and communicate with a personality.

**Superpersonal**: That which goes beyond the threshold of understanding the realms of personality in a person, such as pure Spirit, high spirituality, absonite levels and I think also, faith. One must use a super consciousness to access this level.

## Meditation: Rules for being human

1. You have been given a body. You may love it or hate it, but it will be yours for the duration of this life.
2. You will learn lessons. You are enrolled in a full-time informal school called “Life.” Every day you will have the opportunity to learn lessons in this school. You may enjoy the lessons, or you may think they are silly or irrelevant.
3. There are no mistakes, only lessons. Growth is a process of trial and error: experimentation. “Failed” experiments are just as much a part of the process as successful ones.
4. A lesson will be repeated until it is learned. A lesson will be presented to you in various forms until you learn it. When you have learned it, you can move on to the next lesson.

## Gay Marriage

There are evenings when one is a little tired, from work, from the weariness of being alone at home and from the feeling that the whole world is marking time, that the ideas sketched out by friends are in no way like the ideals that one would like to see suddenly spring from their lips. Then one prepares oneself a good meal and sits down sadly drinking two or three glasses of good wine.

That evening, a friend came to sit next to me, without eating, without drinking and without speaking. But, without seeing her, I felt her presence. I heard her whisper to me: “You eat too much, you're going to get fat; if you drink too much, you're going to get sick!” Then, there was a little revolt in me and I answered her out loud: “You speak like my Father!” I remembered that my earthly father had been dead for a long time and that he was no longer there to guide me on the path of righteousness. Suddenly, a flood of thoughts materialized in my brain, in my mind or in my soul, I don't know in which place of my personality or my identity for the purists.

1. The beings who compose the sevenfold approach of the Ultimate Trinity, now evolving, will ultimately consist of the Supreme Being, the Supreme Creator Personalities, and the absonite Architects of the Master Universe, those unique universe planners who are neither creators nor creatures. <a id="a215_292"></a>[UB 0:12.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p12_6)

## Brother Dom’s Little Corner: Just One Word!


- José Luis Borges, the famous writer, tells us in his short story entitled UNDR, about a people from the North, the Urnians, whose poetry can be summed up in one word, UNDR.
- In one word?
- Yes, its primary meaning, for the layman, the one who does not understand, is “The Word”.
- Curious, how can a single word express all the nuances of poetry?
- To hear it, the character is invited by the village poet to travel a lot.
