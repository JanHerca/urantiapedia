_Breathing like an ocean wave_
_Comes from the universe and returns to nothingness._
_Inspiration is the flow_
_And the exhalation the reflux._

_At the same time changeable,_
_And always constant,_
_She is, as are all waves,_
_Companion of laughter or lover of sobs._

_She weaves her weft_
_In constant concern_
_And reveals the depths of the soul_
_Like the waves, those of the ocean._

_Then marking the body_
_As the wave digs into the cliff,_
_She creates her decor_
_While healing ailments._

_Superficial or deep,_
_She changes in a second_
_And becomes fertile again,_
_As long as we don't scold her._

_Mysterious, she reveals herself_
_to the bold one who knew how to tame it_
_And opens it to him, like the beauty,_
_The door to all his secrets._

_Daughter of the Wind and the Sun,_
_Bearer of unparalleled Spirit,_
_She breathes the Life that the Ether transmits to her_
_As air marries water by whitening the sea._

_If you put your hand to the plow_
_Don't turn around to see_
_If the furrow is well traced._
_But keep your sight on the edge of the field_
_And your furrow will be well traced._

(Book of Wisdom)
