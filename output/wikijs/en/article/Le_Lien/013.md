## A Word from the President

There are questions that appear very simple but nevertheless carry within them the most fundamental aspects that exist. This is what I think of the call launched by Christine Baussain in the previous link (Link No. 12), a call that I perceive as follows: how can we translate and above all share in our human relationships the most beautiful substance and the fullness of our individual communion with our Father?

Indeed, are we not told on page 2097 that “the great challenge facing modern man is to establish better communications with the divine Monitor who inhabits the human mind”?

And is it not through this certainty of the experience of the divine in oneself that spiritual unity - doubtless the basis of the most effective and generous associations - is born among men?

So many elements that deserve at least that we stop and think about them a little, as some of you have already done in this new issue of Lien.

Happy reading!

Francois Le Rohellec
President of the A.F.L.L.U.

## A Fire

Winter is here, cold, silvery and magical. Nothing moves under the frost. Only the fairies dance in the frost. Not a sound enters the house. We are going to change years, centuries, millennia. What does it matter! It is a number composed of a two with three zeros. We will have to get used to writing it, that's all!.... “_The days go by, I remain_” says the poet.

What could be more pleasant on this cold day than to curl up next to the fireplace, breathing in the haunting but irritated voice of dead wood becoming embers and then ash! The flame slides its ghostly fingers into the meanders of my meditation, mixing it with caramelized sedative scents.

## Melchizedek or the third revelation

The term Melchizedek designates an order of divine sons halfway in the spiritual hierarchy between God and men. They are also called emergency sons. After the rebellion of the planetary prince Caligastia and the failure of the material sons Adam and Eve, twelve Melchizedeks assumed the supra-material jurisdiction of our planet. They can make themselves visible to material creatures and even incarnate as was the case of Machiventa Melchizedek on our earth. It is interesting to consult the Testamentary and New Testament chronicles which deal with this subject:

- in [Genesis 14-18](/en/Bible/Genesis/14) “Melchizedek, king of Salem, brought out bread and wine: he was priest of the Most High. He blessed Abram” (who became Abraham: father of many nations, [Gen: 17-5](/en/Bible/Genesis/17#v5))
- his name is mentioned in the psalms of David ([110-4](/en/Bible/Psalms/110#v4)) “the Lord has sworn and he will not repent: you are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.”

## Does God exist?

Many human beings feel indifference or skepticism towards the problems of the existence of the spirit and eternal survival. Are we tossing around in a hopelessly closed abyss, with no other way out than death, from which no one returns according to the old adage?

After the single thought of past centuries made of ecclesiastical domination, a new totalitarianism has taken hold, driving an unprecedented scientific development, an uncontrolled social metamorphosis and incapable of forging an ideal society, where religion, science and philosophy would work together for the accomplishment of man.

## Questions and Answers

***Bottle caught***

A word of advice to Christine. You have to <ins>read</ins> and <ins>reread</ins> the Book. I know some of us who have read more than twenty “passages” and they are not tired. The more they read, the more their eyes are opened, the more their hearts open, and the more they are able to study, that is to say, to delve deeper into certain subjects, to connect them together, and thus arrive at a harmonious <ins>practice</ins> of the teachings of the _Urantia Book_.

It is this <ins>studious reading</ins> which gradually allows them to “translate” a little of what is written into a little of what is experienced.

This is a slow maturation of our minds that can be accelerated when the Adjuster, our divine Gift, has perceived the state of our progress and our readiness to do the will of the Father. This “movement” is solely within the realm of individual experience: no one can “move” our Adjuster for us, it being well known that in reality, it is rather he who seeks to “move” us by a whole range of means of which we are generally not conscious.

That said, the mere knowledge that at the moment one <ins>practices the studious reading</ins> of The Urantia Book, and that other readers in the world are engaged in an identical activity, must provide an exaltation of the soul which is none other than the feeling of “communing among ourselves in the love of our Father...”

**Another response to “Bottle in the Sea” by Christine Baussain**

## “What Would Jesus Do?” »

“What Would Jesus Do?” is the title of a bestseller written by Charles M. Sheldon, which answers the vital question “What does it really mean to be a Christian?” and which can be found almost everywhere in the United States. Naturally here this small but essential question is to be considered for us in the light of our dear Revelation and not according to the concepts which have become traditional in our current Western cultures.

What would Jesus have done (meaning: in such circumstances?) This is the question I ask myself when I read this message from Christine Baussain, thrown into the sea of our questions. Yes, what would Jesus have done, or what would he have answered if he had been asked: “Is there not a way to commune with each other in the love of our Father?” What would he have answered, in fact, to people who had just become aware of The Urantia Book and who would ask him such a question?

It might interest some of you to know that a group of New Zealanders are making machines that deliver more electrical energy than they consume, since they are able to capture energy from space. If you are interested, you can contact Guy Antequera at his e-mail address: guy.antequera@wanadoo.fr, and/or visit the website: http://depalma.pair.com/ . Guy is a long-time reader of the _Urantia Book_, he was part of the Avignon study group before leaving for Touraine, but there is a good chance that we will see him again in the Avignon region as well as his charming wife, Marie-José, during the year 2000.
