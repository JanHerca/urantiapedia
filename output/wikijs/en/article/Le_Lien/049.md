## Edito: The Living Water of LU

It is impossible to live without water...!

A vital and regenerative element par excellence, both our fuel and our catalyst, it is so familiar to us that it often goes unnoticed!

However, we are rediscovering the inestimable value of this “blue gold” whether on Earth, on the eve of the Copenhagen Summit, or on the moon to fuel our future extraterrestrial expeditions...

Where water flows, life flourishes! ...

## The President's ticket

The readers of The Urantia Book represent a composite and motley collection of characters who rely upon this revelation to elevate, synthesize, and coordinate their own beliefs. Are we to seek inner unity in outer diversity or comfortable conformity?

For me, there is no doubt that we must live in full recognition of our differences and thus progress a little more in understanding each other, ourselves and the world. This is simply called meeting each other.

## Testimony: Jean-François and the seahorse

**...Or how to face epilepsy**

Affected by epilepsy from childhood, some 700,000 people in Switzerland are affected by it. The dynamic journey of Jean-François Pittet is a source of hope.

When he was a child, at school, Jean-François Pittet had absences that were not noticed. He was there, but no longer there. One day in 1978, he dropped the dictation in the middle of a sentence, only to pick it up again much later. It was when he opened the notebook and discovered the dictation, a large part of which was missing, that the schoolteacher reacted. Parents. Doctor. The diagnosis finally came: **epilepsy**...

## Summary: National meeting at Notre Dame de Lumiêres

The majority of participants arrived on Thursday evening, where an excellent meal directly confirmed the serious and warm welcome that we were used to experiencing at previous meetings.

Other readers joined our group the next day. Some came to join us for a day. Several new readers from the south were present, which added to our study, bringing the total number of participants to 28.

Following the evening meal, the President, **Mr. Dominique Ronfet**, opened the session by inviting us to introduce ourselves so that we could get to know each other better. Dominique then began with a mini-conference on the theme that was to occupy us all for the next 3 days: “Post-mortem awakening”.

## Poetry: The Butterfly

<p style="text-align:center;">
Born with spring, die with roses:<br>
On the wing of the zephyr swimming in a pure sky;<br>
Balanced on the breast of barely opened flowers,<br>
Get drunk on perfumes, light and azure;<br>
Shaking, still young, the powder from his wings,<br>
To fly away like a breath to the eternal vaults:<br>
Here is the butterfly, the enchanted destiny.<br>
It resembles desire, which never arises,<br>
And without being satisfied, touching everything,<br>
Finally return to heaven to seek pleasure.<br>

## Remarks VI: Uncertainty and Security

> _Uncertainty with security is the essence of the Paradise adventure—uncertainty in time and in mind, uncertainty as to the events of the unfolding Paradise ascent; security in spirit and in eternity, security in the unqualified trust of the creature son in the divine compassion and infinite love of the Universal Father; uncertainty as an inexperienced citizen of the universe; security as an ascending son in the universe mansions of an all-powerful, all-wise, and all-loving Father._ (<a id="a140_490"></a>[UB 111:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p7_1))

Uncertainty in security is the essence of Paradise adventure. This phrase requires study. Security is the indestructible rock of our status as sons of the Universal Father, upon whom we rely in all circumstances of life, whether pleasant or unpleasant, for our trust is eternal with this mighty, wise, and loving Father. As events unfold during our ascension into the universal mansions of the universes of time, to have certainty about these future events would be a definite handicap to our ability to adapt to the realization of our potentials. As universe citizens, we already have the certainty of being citizens of this splendid and eternal universe, and our uncertainty in our inexperience as young citizens can only sharpen our curiosity to move forward and always seek to discover new horizons.

## Search: God, the Consummator of Universal Destiny

The Consummator of Universe Destiny is one of the unclassified and unrevealed Orders of Grand Universe Personalities. The name given to him in the papers of The Urantia Book seems, however, to suggest the functions which he occupies in the Universe.

The First Source and Center can be given different names, each of which is a mark of one of its attributes. It is the Infinite, the Original Creator, but it is as the Universal Father that it seems to us the most amiable and reassuring.

## Reminder: Our emotions

Emotions are reactions of feelings towards reality that impact all parts of the personality. Some emotions initiate an instinctive psychological reaction in our body. When we experience positive emotions such as love or joy, our body is invigorated, our mind is purified and our soul is fulfilled. On the other hand, negative emotions such as anger or fear degrade our body, poison our mind, diminish our soul and obstruct any spiritual intake. In the mature personality, the will and the spirit direct the march, while the emotions are channeled towards higher goals.

Whenever an emotion arises, it originates in a distinct part of the personality. There are thus three distinct types of emotion; those that originate in the body, those that come from the mind, and those that originate in the higher parts of the personality, the soul and the spirit.

## Meditation

_I live my life in a new way._

When I feel like a situation is testing me, I see it as an opportunity to move beyond old ways of thinking. I dare to try something new.

Before I go, I prepare myself in prayer. Prayer is the foundation of right action. Instead of making a hasty move, I pray until I find a divine solution.

In the quiet, I entrust my concerns to God. Then I release them. I spend time here in silence, receptive to direction on what to do next. Now I am ready to move forward with clarity, confidence, and courage.

With God's help, I welcome the opportunity to live my life in a new way.

> “_Behold, the former things are accomplished, and new things I declare to you._” [Isaiah 42](/en/Bible/Isaiah/42) .

_I am in harmony with God's wonderful world._

A summer bouquet can be made up of an assortment of flowers of all colors.
The variety further embellishes the bouquet.
I realize that I am a flower in the wonderful bouquet of humanity.
Without judging myself or comparing myself to others, I appreciate the unique beauty in each of us.
I am a divine expression of God, just like every person.
By appreciating our commonalities and our differences, I feel harmony.
I am relaxed in the knowledge that I am loved and have a unique contribution to make.
By learning to love myself, I am at peace with myself and with others.
Living in peace, I am in harmony with God's wonderful world.

> “_The flowers appear on the earth, the time for singing has come._” [Song of Songs 2.12](/en/Bible/Song_of_Solomon/2#v12)

_I choose to express the song of my heart._

This day, a gift from God, is filled with opportunities.
But how I experience it is up to me.
My experiences reflect the song I choose to sing.
I can perceive my day as a broken record, that is, it always contains the same activities and the same expectations.
If I don't expect anything different, if I keep singing the same old song, that's what I'll experience.
But, I can choose to create a day that expresses the unique song of my heart.
It's a love song to myself and to others.
It is a song of expectation and an affirmation of the good that I perceive and create in the world and in myself.
Rejoicing in the life of God in me and around me, I let my heart sing!

> “_Sing to the Lord a new song!_” [Psalms 96.1](/en/Bible/Psalms/96#v1)

The Daily Word


## Share: Gift of Love

In the state of illumination we acknowledge the authority of Christ alone; we bow to neither rites nor rules, but only to the impersonal and universal love of God. We worship only the inner flame that burns forever in the sanctuary of the Spirit. From this union is born the freedom that is proper to spiritual brotherhood. We are one in a limitless universe; we serve God apart from ceremonies and creeds. Those who have the light of the Spirit go fearlessly through their lives—by grace.

**Love as the Spirit of Understanding**

The recognition of our true being requires that we become like children again. Let us not hesitate to proclaim, silently, to each person we meet on our path: “You are the Christ, the Saint of God. I know who you are.” As we undertake the practice of seeing Christ in the people who are part of our daily lives, we will see the world take on a different shape. Whoever we meet on our path, we will approach him with a spirit of welcome, allowing God’s grace to flow through us. Wherever we go, it is in a spirit of giving. The object of giving is to recognize the true identity of all as the Saint of God seeking to express himself. For every human being is a Saint of God, an incarnation of God.

## Prayer: of the Skier

On our skis, Lord, we bless you.
When we contemplate the splendor of the mountains
And the glaciers sparkling with snow,
On our skis, Lord, we bless you.

When we ski. Filled with joy,
In the powdery snow with its dazzling whiteness,
On our skis, Lord, we bless you.

When, in the blue coldness of dawn,
We trace the snowy slopes,
On our skis, Lord, we bless you.

Lord, protect your skiing friends and guide them all.
across tracks and snowfields
to the height of your love,
in praise and worship.

Canon Louis-Ernest Fellay, parish priest of Verbier

## Prayer: before the crucifix

Most high and glorious God,
Come and enlighten
The darkness of my heart:
Give me a straight faith,
A solid hope and perfect charity;

Give me
To feel and know,
So that I can accomplish it,
Your holy will
Who cannot lead me astray.

Saint Francis of Assisi


## Wishes: new friend

Lord, a new year opens before me;
I don't ask you to succeed
in all my businesses
but to receive and welcome
in my heart and in my life, day by day and step by step,
Your love, this Love which gives meaning to existence.

I ask you, not to suffer no failure,
but to welcome as a gift
the strength that keeps me standing
despite the difficulties and trials.

I ask you, not for an answer
to all questions
but to know how to receive
the questions of others,
to carry their sorrows within me,
their worries, their unresolved conflicts,
to be, alongside them, a supportive brother,
bearer of sharing and peace,
able to make them grow
that they may be your sons,
men stand up!

## The study group (5)

**9. Stimulate group participation**

Anyone can read The Urantia Book on their own. The task of the study group leader is to encourage all members to offer their thoughts and ideas so that all may grow by expressing their views and by listening to the thoughts of others. The participation of all members in the organization, meetings, and activities of the group is very important. Each feels a greater sense of belonging, loyalty, and importance to the group when he or she participates in its establishment and operation. In some groups, members take turns bringing desserts to the meeting. This is also a form of participation that encourages attendance.

The facilitator should encourage everyone to participate but never force anyone to speak. Be careful not to embarrass a shy brother, but to find a subtle way to bring him into the discussion. The facilitator should encourage all members to be direct in their comments and to speak from the heart as well as the mind. Members should be encouraged to listen carefully and courteously to each other's comments. We are all at different points in this journey and therefore have different levels of understanding of the teachings. Everyone should be respectful of each other's thoughts even if they disagree. No one likes to be proven wrong in public, but they can learn something from the other's point of view if it is expressed in a loving and non-confrontational way. There is no official interpretation of The Urantia Book; the text speaks for itself, and understanding of the teachings can be expanded from many unique perspectives.

Never allow direct criticism of another's point of view. Never allow the discussion to turn into a debate that produces winners and losers. Criticism will silence a member or even cause him to leave the group because he “doesn't fit in.” Certainly, all members should be allowed to offer different opinions, but never to say that someone is wrong. The Spirit of Truth, not the study group mates, will say what is true and what is not. Study is most productive if each person does not feel the need to defend a particular point of view but simply offers it for the group's consideration.

A good way to involve shy or quiet members is for the facilitator to make it obvious that he or she wants to hear what they have to say. Encourage them to talk by asking a simple question or inviting them to give their opinion. Attacking someone's position only encourages them to defend it a little more. Positive praise and assent will serve better to encourage participation in the group. The size of the study group greatly affects the ebb and flow of each participant's engagement. The host naturally wants everyone to feel involved, appreciated, and respected. A larger group makes it harder to maintain the intimacy that a smaller group fosters. But large study groups are not to be avoided; they simply require a different attitude, more attention, and more preparation.

After each section is read aloud, the facilitator can stimulate discussion by asking a specific question that will provoke thought about what has just been read. Specific questions will elicit specific answers rather than vague generalizations. It would be a good idea for the facilitator to prepare a list of one or two questions for each section in advance. Questions enhance our understanding of these truths in our lives. Words or phrases such as “how,” “why,” and “do” are usually the hallmarks of specific questions. Refer to the attached Bloom’s Taxonomy if you have difficulty formulating questions, but even a simple question can sometimes be enough to get the discussion flowing.

The discussion should include the intellectual facts of what has been read, why these facts or concepts are important to us, and how we can live the truth presented in each section. The discussion should help us know the teachings, live the teachings, and share the teachings.

**10. Use study aids**

It is always helpful, but not essential, to have a Urantia Book Concordance and a dictionary. Other “tools” that aid in study include a computer with The Urantia Book on the Internet or the CD version of the text that allows one to search for information about the book, audio versions of the book on CD or cassette, a pronunciation guide, a key word index, and a Bible. Many study aids are offered by Urantia Foundation free of charge or at minimal cost. These materials are even more important when the method of study is by topic, that is, when the discussion is on a particular subject that is found in the various sections of the book. By choosing a topic (for example: faith, prayer, worship, Adam and Eve, family life, etc.) and searching for the given paragraphs or sentences, one can select what one wishes to study in greater depth.

There are many study aids and secondary works that can enhance the group's appreciation of the selected text. Contacting Urantia Foundation or UAI will help you locate these works by individuals. An Internet search will also help you find such material. Study aids can aid in the understanding of the concepts of The Urantia Book, but The Urantia Book should remain the primary source of instruction and secondary works should be secondary.

**11. New members and new readers**

As a group you may wish to establish some standards for introducing new members. Some groups are open to new members and others are not. These are usually family groups that prefer to study as a family. Some groups are open to new readers and others are not. Most groups that welcome new members or new readers require only a demonstrated interest in The Urantia Book and a sincere desire to know and serve God for membership.

Before an unknown potential new member of the group is invited to join the group it would be a good idea for the group to meet with the person and discuss whether they should be invited to join the group. As with all other methods of study group work there are different ways to go about this. The new person can be invited to attend a number of meetings as an observer or someone from the group can be appointed to interview the potential new member and report back to the group. At some point the group will need to decide whether the new member should be invited to become a regular member of the group. Obviously this can be a delicate situation but the integrity and safety of the group is of the utmost importance so if the new member does not seem to fit in then say so politely and courteously. In this situation you can offer to help the new member start their own study group.

When a new reader attends a meeting, the group experience can encourage him or her to learn more about The Urantia Book in a relaxed, friendly atmosphere without fear of criticism.

Sometimes a regular member of the group will bring a friend or someone curious about the book. Friends and family of a regular member who wish to observe a meeting should always be welcomed as long as they are not disruptive. It is a good idea to have a few extra copies of The Urantia Book for visitors to use during the meeting. Try to make newcomers feel comfortable. Most new members do not want to disrupt the group or be the center of attention. Usually the new member simply wants to observe. Warmth and friendliness are the best formulas. Some regular members of the group may unintentionally embarrass visitors by being overly friendly. The facilitator should recognize when a change in program might be beneficial to a new reader. It is also important to know when to stop and explain a new term or concept. New members can bring a breath of fresh air and a burst of enthusiasm that can invigorate an established group intellectually and socially. Sometimes long-time members are uncomfortable around new members because new ideas don't mesh with old ones. Long-time members may follow comfortable, well-trodden paths that new members will often disrupt, forcing older members to start rethinking. Welcoming a visitor or new member by making them and their ideas feel welcome will be an invasion of their comfort zone in the group, but it will cause everyone to grow.

An important element of any group meeting is the love shared among those who attend, the love that is extended to visitors and new members. The growth of the group in membership comes from loving relationships with those around us. Never hesitate to invite someone who seems interested. “The act is yours, the consequences are God’s.” Not everyone who is invited will come, but unless you extend an invitation no one will ever come.

**12. Prayer, Worship and Song**

The Urantia Book tells us that: “Jesus taught the twelve always to pray in secret, to go out alone into the quiet landscapes of nature or to their rooms, and to shut the doors when they were engaged in prayer.” [1620.12]

However, in examining the social repercussions of prayer, the leader of the Midwayers writes: “_But it is not necessary that prayer should always be individual. Prayer in a group or assembly is very effective, in the sense that its repercussions greatly increase sociability. When a community devotes itself to common prayer for moral upliftment and spiritual elevation, these devotions react on the individuals who compose the group; their participation makes them all better._” <a id="a380_480"></a>[[UB 91:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p5_2)]

These two aspects of prayer leave the way open for your group to find its own way in functioning. Depending on the group's decision it will be good to pray or not to pray.

Some groups begin or end with prayer or a moment of silence; others do not. Many groups find that beginning with a moment of silence helps to set the mental framework for spiritual study. Some groups practice group worship; others do not. Each group should work out these issues openly and by group decision. Prayer and worship play an important role in many well-established study groups. These more personal aspects of a religious nature tend to evolve over time as group members become more comfortable with one another. Some groups of readers of The Urantia Book meet only to pray or worship. Most groups have members who participate in the activities of traditional religious institutions. Still other readers introduce the teachings of The Urantia Book into the activities of their religious community or church. This only confirms that there are many ways in which your own group can meet the wants and needs of the group members.

Group prayer, in whatever form suits the group, can greatly contribute to establishing a sense of spiritual unity. But group prayer is not for everyone. It is wise not to impose it on group members who are uncomfortable with it. They may choose not to participate for a variety of reasons. Some groups form a circle and each person prays in turn. In some groups, the facilitator either leads the prayer himself or prays first and then indicates that anyone who wishes to say something may do so. After a period of silence at the beginning of the meeting, the facilitator may conclude with a short prayer aloud or with a reading of a prayer such as the Believer's Prayer on page 1620 of The Urantia Book. There are as many possibilities as there are study groups. The manner in which prayer and worship are used may even change at each meeting, depending on the different facilitators. When all members of a group equally enjoy public prayer, that group prayer can be a shared and powerful spiritual experience.

It seems that “the Spirit blows where it wants and when it wants.” It seems.

Jesus said: “When the wind blows, you hear the rustling of the leaves, but you do not see the wind—neither where it comes from nor where it goes—and so it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.
