> “There are three and not two factors in the evolutionary creation of such an immortal soul. These three antecedents of the morontia human soul are:”
> “1. *The human mind* and all cosmic influences antecedent thereto and impinging thereon.”
> “2. *The divine spirit* indwelling this human mind and all potentials inherent in such a fragment of absolute spirituality together with all associated spiritual influences and factors in human life.”
> “3. *The relationship between material mind and divine spirit,* which connotes a value and carries a meaning not found in either of the contributing factors to such an association. The reality of this unique relationship is neither material nor spiritual but morontial. It is the soul.” ([UB 111:2.4-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p2_4))

To illustrate this idea that our inner development depends on a contribution greater than our mind and our relationship with it, I offer you this popular tale:

Once upon a time there was an old man who did not want his children, his three sons, to be permanent victims of limited thinking.

So when he wrote his will, he deliberately left his three sons a herd of 17 camels with the instructions that the first son should have half of these 17 camels; the second son should have one-third of the total 17 camels; and the third son should have one-ninth of the total.

Of course, when he died and the 17 camels were presented before these young men, they discovered that they could not satisfy their father's will because 17 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 9.

So they wondered if they should sell the camels, but in doing so they would be violating the terms of the will.

They thought that if they cut the camels into pieces, not only would they be violating their father's intentions, but it would also not be kind to the camels.

And so they had only one thing left to do: find a wise man who could advise them.

After much difficulty, they finally found a wise man and he considered the problem, and instead of trying to divide the inheritance, he said:

“I add one of my camels to this herd...making a total of 18 camels. Now, we can proceed with the execution of your father's will.”

The wise man said: "Half of all the camels are for the first son...there are 18, so that makes 9 camels...A third of the herd goes to the second son...18 by 3...that is to say 6 camels. And the third son gets a ninth...that is to say 2 camels...

For a total of 17 camels, leaving one camel, which happens to be that of the wise man.

So he took him back to reinstate him with his flock, having fulfilled the terms of the old man's will, and having taught his sons something the father had wanted all along.
