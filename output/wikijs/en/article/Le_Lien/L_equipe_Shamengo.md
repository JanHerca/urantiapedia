**Shamengo** is a fantastic collective adventure in which new talents participate every day. Some have been there from the beginning. Others join us on one-off missions according to their desires and our means. They all have in common the desire to grow this meaningful work that surpasses us and of which we are proud. This bet on the future was initiated by Catherine Berthillier, a senior reporter for the major news programs on French television: _Envoyé Spécial (France 2) Des Racines et des Ailes (France 3) Zone Interdite (M6) Reportages (TF1) Arte Reportage (Arte)..._ as well as numerous documentaries for France 3 and France 5 in international co-production.

After having denounced for 15 years in her investigative investigations, those who destroy the world and received numerous distinctions (FIGRA Grand Prize, Silver Palm at the NY festival, public prize at the SCOOP festival in Angers...) Catherine Berthillier decided in 2008 to put her skills and her large network of contacts in France and abroad, to the benefit of those who are building the world of tomorrow. Shamengo, produced by the audiovisual production company, Kaïa Prod was born in October 2011.
“_Instead of continuing to denounce those who destroy the world, it is better to highlight those who build it._” For Catherine Berthillier, who had spent her life crisscrossing the planet with her camera, from Turkmenistan to Niger via the Czech Republic, this observation had the force of a revelation. Immediately, she abandoned her reporter's hat, put her savings on the table and founded Shamengo, a platform intended to promote the players in the solidarity, social and environmental economy. The objective is simple: **to produce a thousand video portraits of tomorrow's pioneers**, in a short format of two minutes.

“_The philosophy of Shamengo is that everyone has the means to have a positive impact on the world around them. That those who really make things happen are not supermen, but ordinary people, who simply said to themselves one day ”I'm going for it“._” A “**little inner voice**” that Catherine Berthillier herself ended up listening to.

***Committing to others***. The second edition of the Shamengo 2014 event took place on September 19, 2014. A victory for green and social innovation that we are not ready to forget! Innovations galore, fruitful co-creation workshops, evocative speeches that bring hope, an exceptional support concert... The Shamengo 2014 event is a bit of all that. No fewer than 500 people united around the same cause, ... The discussions were lively and effective, since many solutions were found to implement the innovations of our pioneers in France and around the world... Nine of our pioneers presented their innovations, along with their sponsors. Another major supporter, **Nicolas Hulot** who highlighted the essential role of the Shamengo community in moving the world... www.shamengo.com
