Efficiency is the ability to produce something, to achieve the desired results while maintaining at its highest level what allows this production. To be efficient, two elements are needed: what is produced and what has the capacity to produce. Those who do not focus on the objective and neglect the means will not go very far. Hence the need to adopt good habits.

## Develop spiritual habits

Habits save a considerable amount of time and energy. They contribute vitally to the efficiency and economy of our lives. All human development is based on this ability to translate previous progress into habits, thus making it possible to consciously make further progress.

Through continued effort, all types of spiritual reflexes can eventually become habits, freeing us to tackle higher challenges. Developing positive habits is central to spiritual growth. It becomes a familiar reaction to a problem. However, we must be very careful not to develop negative habits. In that case, we can only get rid of them by replacing them with a positive habit and not resisting them. Let us not forget that it takes time to fully develop our divine personality.

Good habits, once well established, permeate our personalities. They are woven into the loom of our character. They become the permanent possessions of our evolving souls. Healthy habits of spiritual living are the very foundation of a well-developed and accomplished personality.

- The first habit: **become proactive**. The proactive person realizes that between the stimulus and the response there is a great deal of freedom. This freedom is that of being able to become aware of what one feels; of imagining various possible responses; of using one's will to adapt the best possible response to the stimulus. Sometimes all it takes is to breathe deeply, tell oneself that one has a choice and exercise that choice.
- The second habit: **create goals**. It is only to the extent that we know exactly where we are going that it is possible to find the right path. Knowing where we want to go and how we are going to get there, regarding all aspects of life.
- The third habit: **make a list of priorities**. What is the most important goal, what comes next? This allows you to properly manage your time and resources in general.
- The fourth habit: **move towards interdependence**. Our culture has placed a lot of value on independence and it is true that this is an essential quality. Today, however, it is no longer possible to live like Robinson Crusoe, alone on your island. We need others, their skills, their ideas, their contribution on all levels. This is why interdependence, the ability to give and receive, to want to win together is one of the essential aspects of efficiency. It allows the maintenance of fruitful relationships and real cooperation.
- The fifth habit: first seek to **understand others** before seeking to be understood. Listening, observation, empathy, warm respect are skills characteristic of highly effective people. On the basis of understanding others, useful communication can be established.
- The sixth habit: **create synergy**. The effective person is also able to value differences. Because they are open to others, to what is new, they are more likely to say: “Why not?” than “Why?”. They are stimulated by differences, they understand that everything is connected and that each human being is part of a large system. Instead of being threatened by a new idea, a new person or new competition, they have the capacity to create synergies, that is to say, to put resources together to create with others what they could not have created alone.
- The seventh habit: **renew yourself**. The highly effective person has the ability to renew themselves, to sharpen their tools regularly. They know how to find the oil needed to keep their lamp lit so as not to enter the darkness of discouragement and bitterness. Indeed, there is no greater source of exhaustion than a negative view of others and the world. Those who know how to renew themselves are not necessarily those who are aware of the latest trends in IT or the most recent theories, they are those who are able to change their “glasses”, to see what others may not see, that is to say all the small daily miracles. They are those who go beyond the first judgment, who are open enough to welcome what is positive. What is sometimes more problematic is not the problem to be solved but rather the way in which we consider it. To renew oneself is to be able to let oneself be filled with gratitude, to open one's eyes and one's mind to everything that is born, to everything that lives around us, and to be joyful for this possibility which is ours to be co-creators.
-
“Father, grant me this faith which fears neither dangers, nor pain, nor death, which knows how to walk in life with calm, peace and deep joy and which establishes its soul in absolute detachment from all that is not You.”


## To live fully

Living more fully, using one's talents more completely, being in harmony with oneself, with others, with God, this is the program that we would like to achieve. The themes of this program are:
- take power over yourself, find the freedom to see, to hear, to feel what is, — take responsibility for your life,
- practice active compassion,
- let go of what must go; let go — to welcome,
- be on the way, grow.

Each of us was created with the possibility of choice. We have this freedom to choose between light and darkness. At the beginning, we project the image that we have internally programmed. It is up to us to visualize our future as radiant as it should be, in the image of what the Creator wants and to affirm it positively!

Aware of being eternally connected to an inexhaustible source of benevolence, we should take advantage of this to better use our resources, achieve noble goals, create new opportunities for enrichment, to meet interesting people, to improve our health, to take advantage of the time to develop ourselves and love more.

Be attentive and be present. Life is here and now! Consistency and ardor in work. We must practice being present and truly being who we want to be! Let us cultivate the intelligence of the heart!

## Calm

First, let's slow down. The excessive stimulation to which we are subjected poisons the body and disrupts the mind; its bad fruits are weariness and a feeling of frustration that makes us seethe and rage against everything and everything else.

However important we may be, others will be able to do our work. God accomplishes, with imperturbable slowness, his eternal purposes. The only wisdom is to live at his pace. A sports coach tirelessly repeated: “To win a race, row slowly. If you get carried away, the rhythm will be broken, you will have all the trouble in the world to restore it.” In order to row - or work - slowly, and to maintain the regular pace which leads to success, the victim of the hurried tempo will do well to introduce the coordinating peace of God into his mind, his soul and, let us boldly add, into his nervous and muscular system.

Let us slow down. What we really want will be waiting for us, at the determined point. And if, progressing towards the goal at the measured pace of God, we do not find what we are looking for, let us console ourselves. What we were looking for was not intended for us, and we lose nothing by it. Thus, let us work to acquire a normal pace, governed by God. Let us be calm. Let us learn the art of pushing back nervous overexcitement. Let us pause in our work and affirm: “Now, I push back all nervous overexcitement. It leaves me. I am at peace.” Let us no longer seethe inwardly. Let us practice calm.

The confident application of the principles of Christianity provides peace and tranquility, thus bringing new strength to the body, mind and soul. It is the perfect antidote to all agitation, the best way to capture new life-giving sources. Let us therefore cultivate creative faith. Let us first learn to remain calm, physically, by eliminating unnecessary gestures. By cultivating calm demeanor, it is necessary to think calmly, because the body reacts according to the kind of thoughts that cross the mind. Conversely: the mind can be soothed by beginning with physical calm. Physical and moral relaxation, complete relaxation, requires constant maintenance. The human being is constituted to be connected to a continuous current of force that comes from God, nourishes the individual and returns to its source to renew itself there. He who lives in harmony with this recreational system acquires the indispensable quality of relaxation and easy work, on the basis of Chi va piano...

Do not believe yourself to be a new Atlas, carrying the world on our shoulders. We are not condemned to such an effort. So let us not take ourselves too seriously;

Let's decide to love our job. That way, it will become a pleasure. Maybe we don't have to change it. When we are changed, our work will seem different. Let's adopt a working method and stick to it. Disorganized work creates the impression of being overwhelmed.
