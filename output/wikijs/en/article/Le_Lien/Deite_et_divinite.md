> 2. *The personality revelations of the Second Source and Center.* The mind presences of the Conjoint Actor unify the spirit of divinity with the pattern of energy. The bestowal incarnations of the Eternal Son and his Paradise Sons unify, actually fuse, the divine nature of a Creator with the evolving nature of a creature. The Supreme is both creature and creator; the possibility of his being such is revealed in the bestowal actions of the Eternal Son and his co-ordinate and subordinate Sons. The bestowal orders of sonship, the Michaels and the Avonals, actually augment their divine natures with bona fide creature natures which have become theirs by the living of the actual creature life on the evolutionary worlds. When divinity becomes like humanity, inherent in this relationship is the possibility that humanity can become divine. (<a id="a38_846"></a>[UB 116:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p3_3))

At a meeting of our reading group, a heated discussion broke out when one of the members had the nerve to declare that he was divine. He only narrowly avoided lynching by denying his true thoughts.

If he had proclaimed himself to be a Deity, we would have brought the matter before the courts of Uversa. But, as we shall see, although our present divinity is minimal and has real value only in potentiality, declaring oneself divine is not necessarily too excessive a boast. In the case which concerns us, it was perhaps not enough to whip a cat.

<ins>We can say of the Deity:</ins>

- a) That it is always perfect. Although it may be evolutionary or experiential, it is the perfect source and pattern of evolution or experience. To evolve is now to the reader of _The URANTIA Book_ like passing from nothingness to light. As we journey through the stars on our way to Paradise, evolving will be like passing from “lights to lights.”
	For the Supreme, the perfect God in actuality (he only recovers what is good), experimenting is getting to know imperfection.
- b) that it is not always absolute: God the Supreme and God the Ultimate are not absolute.
- c) that it is not always a person. The undivided Trinity of Paradise and the associative Deity of God the Sevenfold are not persons, but groups of personalities.
	Although she is always something more than a personality understandable to humans, she can be revealed and understood as God, that is to say:
	- as a preperson, it fragments
	- as a person, she creates or procreates
	- as a superperson: she externalizes herself (<a id="a53_47"></a>[UB 30:1.99](/en/The_Urantia_Book/30#p1_99))
- d) that it is the origin of the divine. (<a id="a54_43"></a>[UB 0:1.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p1_15)): “The Deity is the source of all that is divine”.


<ins>We can say of the Divinity:</ins>

- a) that it is not always perfect. It is understandable to humans in the perfection of beauty, truth and goodness that it represents (see <a id="a59_139"></a>[UB 0:1.17-18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p1_17)).
	- she is perfect in Paradise
	- relating to Havona
	- imperfect in Supremacy
- b) that it is a quality (<a id="a63_27"></a>[UB 0:1.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p1_16)) “**Divinity is the characteristic, unifying and coordinating quality of Deity.**”
- c) although it is found outside the personality, the personality has a future only in divinity. The divinity of beings provided with an adjuster, can only become eternal, therefore cosmically real, through fusion. It can be a fusion with the Father, the Son or the Spirit.

Personality is immutable, it is “**invariant in the presence of change**” (<a id="a66_75"></a>[UB 112:0.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p0_9)).

After the resurrection, Jesus does not appear to his disciples under the same identity: in fact he has lost his material body and presents himself to them under the aspect of a morontia body. It is thanks to his personality that Jesus' friends recognize him.

Since the personality does not move, the spiritual growth of the human being can be assimilated to a growth in divinity (<a id="a70_121"></a>[UB 12:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p8_5)): “**The action of spiritual gravity qualitatively measures the living energy of divinity**”.

Although the divine particle that inhabits us is the guarantee of our survival through fusion, we can here and now that each time we grow in love, that we choose the directives of our thought adjuster, we become a little more divine and real (<a id="a72_243"></a>[UB 54:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p1_4): “Freedom is non-existent outside of cosmic reality, and all personality reality is proportional to its relations with divinity”. On the other hand, fusion with our adjuster is not equivalent to the completion of our divinity. It is simply its fixation. (<a id="a72_540"></a>[UB 112:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p7_1)) “Fusion with the Thought Adjuster transmits to the personality eternal actualities which were previously only potential. Among these new endowments, we can mention; the fixation of the quality of divinity...**”

We can say that divinity makes the personality shine.

The sentence in the book that sparked our discussion of divinity in the very nature of man was this: (<a id="a76_102"></a>[UB 12:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p6_1)): “**Stability is entirely and always proportional to divinity**”. We concluded that what was unstable in us was non-divine. What applied to our own person could apply to the entire universe. It followed that the universe itself could only, like us with it, be anchored in the light when all the beings who inhabit it possessed a relative divine status. There may be another explanation for this sentence, but this is the one we have retained.

Other passages in the book point in the same direction:

> “When an evolving mind becomes attuned to the circuits of cosmic mind, when an evolving universe becomes stabilized after the pattern of the central universe, when an advancing spirit contacts the united ministry of the Master Spirits, when an ascending mortal personality finally attunes to the divine leading of the indwelling Adjuster, then has the actuality of the Supreme become real by one more degree in the universes; then has the divinity of Supremacy advanced one more step toward cosmic realization.” (<a id="a80_515"></a>[UB 117:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p0_3))

> “An automatic universe reaction is stable and, in some form, continuing in the cosmos. A personality who knows God and desires to do his will, who has spirit insight, is divinely stable and eternally existent. Man’s great universe adventure consists in the transit of his mortal mind from the stability of mechanical statics to the divinity of spiritual dynamics, and he achieves this transformation by the force and constancy of his own personality decisions, in each of life’s situations declaring, “It is my will that your will be done.”” (<a id="a82_545"></a>[UB 118:8.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p8_11))

Thus, seeing in the eyes of those we meet, the bit of beauty, truth and goodness that also lives within us, is perhaps paying homage to the One who molded us in his image and who makes us share his divinity.

To conclude, we can say that for a mortal to “declare himself divine” may seem presumptuous, but to say that he is on the path to _divine status_ is true if he makes the _choice_.

The Avignon group

> _Truth is coherent, beauty attractive, goodness stabilizing. And when these values of that which is real are co-ordinated in personality experience, the result is a high order of love conditioned by wisdom and qualified by loyalty. The real purpose of all universe education is to effect the better co-ordination of the isolated child of the worlds with the larger realities of his expanding experience. Reality is finite on the human level, infinite and eternal on the higher and divine levels._ (<a id="a90_500"></a>[UB 2:7.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p7_12))
