On our skis, Lord, we bless You.
When we contemplate the splendor of the mountains
And the glaciers sparkling with snow,
On our skis, Lord, we bless You.

When we ski,
Filled with joy,
In the powdery snow with dazzling whiteness,
On our skis, Lord, we bless You.

When, in the blue coldness of dawn,
We trace the snowy slopes,
On our skis, Lord, we bless You.

Lord, protect your skiing friends and guide them all
across slopes and snowfields
to the height of your love,
in praise and worship.

Canon Louis-Ernest Fellay, priest of Verbier

**Song of the soul**

May you have inner peace today.
May you have the certainty that God has placed you exactly where you were meant to be.
May you never forget the infinite possibilities that come from faith.
May you use these gifts you have received and pass on the love that has been given to you.
May you be at peace knowing that you are a child of God.
Let this presence sink deep inside you.
Allow your soul to sing.
Dance, glorify, love.

It's there for each of us.

Saint Therese
