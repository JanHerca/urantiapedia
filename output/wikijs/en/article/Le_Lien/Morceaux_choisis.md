_May the sweetness of friendship be made of laughter and shared pleasures._

_If you don't understand your friend in all circumstances, you will never understand him._

_Do not think that you can bend the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course._

_We are like nuts. We must be cracked to be discovered._

_Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of life's call to itself_

_It is in the dew of small things that the heart finds its morning and is refreshed._

_Just as the value of life is not in its surface but in its depths, the things seen are not in their shell but in their core, and men are not in their face but in their heart._

_No one can reach dawn without passing through the path of night._

_In every man reside two beings: one awake in the darkness, the other asleep in the light._

_Friendship is always a sweet responsibility, never an opportunity. Your friend is the answer to your desires._

_Only he is great who transforms the voice of the wind into a song that his own love has made sweeter_

_Between the shores of the oceans and the summit of the highest mountain is traced a secret route that you absolutely must travel before becoming one with the sons of the Earth._

_The deeper sorrow digs into your being, the more joy you will be able to contain_

_Your children: you can try to be like them, but don't try to make them like you_

_Everyone can hear but only sentient beings understand._

_In autumn, I gathered all my sorrows and buried them in my garden._

_Sadness is a wall built between two gardens._

_In friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born without words and are often shared in silent joy_

_The flowers of spring are the dreams of winter told in the morning at the table of angels._

Khalil Gibran
