<p style="text-align:center;">
Let your name be Mary<br>
May your gaze be blue<br>
Your hair is drunk<br>
Your tender satin skin<br>
If I cry<br>
You comfort me<br>
If you laugh, your smile<br>
Is a ray of sunshine<br>
<br>
That your name is Yasmin<br>
Rare pearl of the distant sands<br>
Let us call you Mei Lih<br>
Natalya, Jenny or Sarah<br>
Ghalyela or Kalinda<br>
Your belly is prayer<br>
Your resting breasts<br>
If childhood is your kingdom<br>
Fragile innocence<br>
You are the guardian of the ages<br>
The wise storyteller<br>
Angular mother of the world<br>
<br>
That you speak<br>
Non-stop<br>
Or shy whisper with your body<br>
Sensual secrets known only to you<br>
If you are naked<br>
Your curves are soft<br>
If you are a girl of joy<br>
If you are religious<br>
Married or single<br>
Tyrannized by a horrible, dirty, mean person<br>
(run away quickly)<br>
Or courted every day<br>
By an unexpected prince<br>
<br>
You are the beginning of things<br>
You are the body of the earth<br>
The center of the universe<br>
You<br>
The Woman<br>
Absolute<br>
Who lives<br>
The soul of all women<br>
And yours<br>
My love<br>
Forever.<br>
</p>
