## A Word from the President

Dear readers,

This is probably the last word from the president that you will read from my hand...

It has now been three and a half years that I have had the pleasure of working with you to try to organize and promote the projects of the AFLUB association as best as possible. This disengagement seems necessary to me today because my three young children no longer leave me enough time to properly assume this responsibility. Furthermore, it is also always good to break with the habit and a renewal can only be beneficial for the association by mobilizing different energies and by engaging in activities not yet explored.

Finally, I would like to add that over the past few years I have had the immense satisfaction of seeing how at all levels - locally but also internationally - the movement is developing on bases which seem to me to be profoundly healthy, solid and fruitful.

Francois Le Rohellec
President of the A.F.L.L.U.

## The animal mind

> That afternoon Jesus and Ganid had both enjoyed playing with a very intelligent shepherd dog, and Ganid wanted to know whether the dog had a soul, whether it had a will, and in response to his questions Jesus said: “The dog has a mind which can know material man, his master, but cannot know God, who is spirit; therefore the dog does not possess a spiritual nature and cannot enjoy a spiritual experience. The dog may have a will derived from nature and augmented by training, but such a power of mind is not a spiritual force, neither is it comparable to the human will, inasmuch as it is not *reflective—*it is not the result of discriminating higher and moral meanings or choosing spiritual and eternal values. It is the possession of such powers of spiritual discrimination and truth choosing that makes mortal man a moral being, a creature endowed with the attributes of spiritual responsibility and the potential of eternal survival.” Jesus went on to explain that it is the absence of such mental powers in the animal which makes it forever impossible for the animal world to develop language in time or to experience anything equivalent to personality survival in eternity. As a result of this day’s instruction Ganid never again entertained belief in the transmigration of the souls of men into the bodies of animals.

## Small bottle, very full

Thank you all for your answers about a common practice based on the _Urantia Book_. The reflection was clearly brewing, so it opened up, even if it was a little out of step, a little “off”, since so to speak everything happened by telephone.

So where are we today?

First, it was necessary to clearly define what was at stake, since the concept of “practice” resonates differently for everyone: an expansion of a field of consciousness such as that provided by the Book almost inevitably leads to a change of attitude towards the world, another way of behaving, a new basis for the pragmatism linked to life on earth. Imperceptibly, the teachings of the Book imbue our being in the world and, in a centrifugal movement, through each person and in each person's own way, take on the mantle of action. In the sum of individual solutions, the theory is embodied, becomes “practice”, with, towards, around, with the intention of, etc.

## Supreme lucubrations

In the introduction to The Urantia Book it may be noted that the Supreme Being is a trinitarian component of the first experiential Trinity while it is God the Supreme who participates in the advent of the Trinity Absolute.

What may seem a detail at first glance is perhaps not written there without reason. Indeed, during the Age of Supremacy, which is the present age of time and space, God the Supreme, in acquiring his _All Power_ is emerging as the Supreme Being. This grandiose event, at the limits of space and time, will give way to the accomplishment of the Ultimate Trinity.

## Questions — answers

**Two responses to the article by Jean Royer p. 11 of Link n°14**

***The Mystery of the Maries***

There are three crucial references in the book, 1347:01, 2008:03 and 2013.

Let's start by admitting that the book is logical and that there are no misprints or omissions (otherwise anything is possible).

Based on this assumption let us look again at the three pages mentioned above.

In my opinion, it is possible to interpret what is said on pages 1347 and 2013 in TWO different ways, while it is impossible to interpret page 2008 in more than one way. That is why we must take the interpretations that corroborate those on page 2008.

Let's take a closer look. The phrase “Mary (wife of Clopas and sister of the mother of Jesus)” allows only one interpretation, what is in parentheses is a double apposition to Mary and cannot be separated, they are two different roles for the same person.

Now let us consider 1347:01 and we will see that the phrase “His two brothers, his two sisters as well as his parents were always very skeptical...” can be interpreted in TWO different ways:

1. She had only two sisters (and two brothers)
2. Two of his brothers and two of his sisters were very skeptical...

Consequently the following sentence concerning Salome can also be read in TWO different ways, namely:

1. However, she confided in one of the two skeptical sisters,
2. She confided in a THIRD sister, who may have been the only one who believed in Jesus.

I repeat that this is only a possibility but that the syntax allows us such a reading.

Finally let's look at 2013:06 “Mary the wife of Clopas, Martha (another sister of Jesus' mother)” we have once again TWO ways to understand this sentence:

1. another refers to Salome (mentioned some 600 pages earlier) or
2. another means besides Mary, there was Martha and another sister.

Again, syntax allows us this interpretation, but offers us an additional help. We have “another” and not “the other”. If there were only two sisters there should be “the other”.

I believe this proves that Martha was not one of two sisters but one of (at least) three sisters.

**Another answer:**

One explanation might be this:

Anna, the mother of Mary, mother of Jesus, could have had a daughter from another man than Joachim, or Joachim could have had this daughter with another woman, but this is less likely. The UB is careful not to specify this. It is impossible to know which of the three it could be. So 2 real sisters and 1 half-sister from the same mother as we would say today.

But there may be yet another explanation.

## Relaxation Corner

**Answer to the little puzzle (the heptagon) from the previous Link No. 14 by Jeanmarie Chaise.**

Avalon: 1; Henselon: 6; Samselon: 5; Portalon: 4, Wolvering: 3; Fanovring: 2 and Alvoring: 7.

The sum is: 12

<ins>Answer to the subsidiary question.</ins>

The organization of life is inherent in God (1), the Trinity (3), and spirituality (7). The Urantia Book tells us about it in duly quantified terms on page 397.11:

The number 10, the base of the decimal system, is inherent in the physical universe but not in the spiritual universe. The domain of life is characterized by 3, 7, and 12, or by multiples and combinations of these three basic numbers. There are three primary and essentially different planes of life, according to the order of the three Paradise Sources and Centers, and in the universe of Nebadon these three basic forms of life are separated on three different types of planets. Originally there were twelve distinct and divine concepts of transmissible life. This number 12, with its subdivisions and multiples, is found in all the basic life patterns of the seven superuniverses. There are also seven architectural types of life patterns, seven basic combinations of the reproductive configurations of living matter. The life patterns of Orvonton are organized in the form of twelve carriers of heredity. The various orders of will creatures are organized according to the numbers 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, 384, and 768. On Urantia the sex cells of human reproduction contain forty-eight archetypal control units, the characteristic determiners.

It should be noted, furthermore, that the designation of the seven universes contiguous to ours and cited here is divided according to the -ing ending for three of them and by the -ion ending for the other four.

3 + 4 = 7 and 3 x 4 = 12

### 2002 International Meeting Progress Report No. 3

Dear friends,

A preparatory meeting was held on Saturday, April 1 in St Martin de Crau in Provence. Present were: Christine Baussain, Pascal Coulombe, Séverin Desbuisson, Joseph Le Dain, François Le Rohellec, Jean-Claude Romeuf, Michel Rouannet, Jean Royer.

**The next meeting is scheduled for Saturday, September 16 (see continuation on p. 16).**

This second meeting, which was particularly fruitful, enabled:
- to specify the timetable and in particular the deadlines for a certain number of tasks essential to the preparation of this meeting.
- to select a few sites that meet the criteria we set at the previous meeting (one site in particular stands out clearly).
- to discuss the main points relating to the content and pace that we wish to give to the 2002 international meeting.

### Minutes of the CNP meeting held in New York on August 2, 2000

We were many, this Wednesday, August 2, 2000, to join the WAGNER college of Staten Island, one of the five districts of the city of New York. That evening, after having solved the material problems, inevitable in this world, I went to bed, tired from the physical transport indispensable to participate body and soul in this new international conference of the IUA.

The next morning, we had to do some violence to overcome the jet lag; but this moment was quickly forgotten because pleasant discussions began at breakfast. It was, throughout the conference, American style: omelettes, sausages, potatoes, ice cream, fruit juice, ... and coffee, that is to say particularly copious. Honoring such a meal easily took us 45 minutes. However, one should never abuse good things, and from 10:00 we were invited to the meeting of the CNP which brings together all the presidents of the different associations of the IUA. All the nations were represented by about twenty meetings chaired by Seppo Kanerva, assisted by the secretary of the CNP Katlyn Salding.

### Close your eyes and listen...

The AFLUB plans to work with our Canadian reader friends to produce a French-language and audio version of the Urantia Book. The task is gigantic, but exciting. In a first step, it is a question of selecting two or three voices without regional accents and with pleasant diction. If you are interested in participating in this adventure and lending your voice, you can contact me at 01 44 87 90 44, preferably in the evening. The “auditions” will take place in Montreuil at the AFLUB headquarters or possibly in the Paris region.

### A screensaver on the Urantia Book

For fans of the combination of the _Urantia Book_ and computers, the Urantia Association of Quebec (A.U.Q.) offers you a screen saver called REFLEXION.

The principle of this one is simple: more than 150 images of the wonders of nature illustrate selected extracts from the _Urantia Book_.

Initially developed to finance the Quebec association, all funds raised by the sale of this screen saver now go to the multiple translation projects undertaken by the Urantia Foundation.

As the designer notes, such a gift can be a great, non-intrusive way to introduce The Urantia Book.

<ins>Practical information</ins>

- Project approved by the Urantia Foundation
- Compatibility: Win 95 and Win 98
- 2 possible versions: English or French to be specified when ordering (other versions in other languages can be produced)
- All images, contained in a separate directory, can be viewed and printed at will

<ins>Order</ins>

- Price: $\$ 20+\$5 (shipping).
- The order is made with Gaétan Charland but the payment is to be sent directly to the Urantia Foundation. Be sure to specify that this is partly the payment for one or more copies of the screen saver and that the funds are intended for the translation program on the other hand.

### Call for the A.F.L.L.U. General Assembly, October 15, 2000

Dear members, dear friends.

The 2000 A.F.L.L.U. general meeting, which was initially planned for Goult in the Notre Dame des Lumières abbey at the end of May, ultimately did not take place due to the small number of readers present at that time.

This is why it is postponed to Sunday October 15, 2000 in Armeau at the same time as the readership meeting to which you are invited in parallel with this convocation.

The proposed agenda is as follows:
- Call of members present, counting of proxies.
- Moral report: summary of the association's activity in 2000.
	- Statistical overview
	- Continuation of the organization of the association: management of readership, online registration, teams to be expanded, better forecasts of meetings...
	- Current projects: progress report on the 2002 I.U.A. international meeting in France, the editions...
- Financial report: Approval of 2000 accounts and management discharge.
- Modification of the contribution to take into account the distribution of the IUA Journal to all members.
- Re-election of the various committees (publication of the Urantian Link, organization of meetings, management of readership) or renewal of the confidence of existing committees.
- Election of a new office (president, vice-president, secretary and treasurer) and/or renewal of confidence in the existing office.
- Projects, information and various problems
	- National meetings around the world
	- New reading groups
	- Purchase of a domain name + new hosting for the association's website
	- Project for an audio-digital version of the Urantia Book: new approach based on the evolution of technologies
	- A screen saver

If any of you would like to add other topics to the agenda, please let us know by letter addressed to the association's headquarters.

For those who cannot be present, complete and return the attached proxy (opposite page) to the A.F.L.L.U. office, specifying the first and last name of the person who will represent you at the general meeting.

Looking forward to seeing you all again, please accept my fraternal friendship.
