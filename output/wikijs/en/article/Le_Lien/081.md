## Hello dear readers of The Urantia Book

FROM TIME TO TIME, some leave us and go to other skies. The following tributes are sufficiently eloquent not to add to them, otherwise, Thank you, Jean, for your constant participation.

Have you considered that one or more replacements will be needed to continue the work he was doing?

Otherwise, this year we have an international conference in the Netherlands in Amsterdam from April 12 to 15 with the theme “Jesus the teacher” and a national meeting in Neylière from May 31 to June 3 where the AFLUB awaits you with a theme proposed by Georges on “Personality-Power Synthesis”. More opportunities for exchanges for those who will find the time (and the means) to participate. There will certainly be videos for Amsterdam.

## Jean Royer has left us

By Georges Michelson-Dupont
Reclosed (France)

**Jean Royer** left us for the world of houses on the evening of February 5, 2018 at the hospital in Avignon (South of France) at the age of 78.

_The Urantia Book_ and its teachings came into Jean's life in the early sixties and since then he has been a fervent advocate of the revelation. He corresponded early with Jacques Weiss about the French translation and offered him many corrections. In the late sixties he made contact with my father, Jacques Dupont and the two became very close, visiting each other, sharing teachings, writing articles and organizing study groups in their respective environments.

## Tribute to Jean Royer

<img src="/image/article/Le_Lien/images_02/120.jpg">
</figure>

Jean Royer left us at the age of 78, his soul is currently sailing with his seraph carrier towards the world of houses. Trying to define Jean is quite difficult, because he is a complex personality, he still lives. What was most striking during his life among us, was his sense of reserve and modesty, because despite an obvious erudition he was always full of delicacy and humility. His personality is the only one I have really encountered that deserves this term of erudition.

The breadth of his possibilities was such that his profession allowed him to fully develop his mastery of languages such as English, Greek, Latin, Esperanto. But he was not only a literary man, in the scientific fields he also excelled, during the seventies he wrote a thesis on an astrophysics subject with Jacque Weis, who at the time had the pseudonym “Louis Colombelle”.

## Dear Jean

I could have said to you: “Wait a little, wait until my guitar cries and says goodbye to you.”

But no, I won't cry because I'm not sad. On the contrary, I'm happy for you. You're ready now for another adventure.

This world had to pass away. This world is only an episode to be crossed in the course of eternal life. Do you remember the evenings when we cast our eyes among the stars. You said: “This is our path.” Then, we looked at the horizon, Sagittarius.

## Rentier chey Dieu

Poem dedicated to Jean Royer

Go home dear God...
As we return home dearly

At the end of each day,
At the end of our travels,
And find near Him
The departure of his heart.

Learn from Him
What it means to love...
And rekindle that fire
That he came to spread.

## My Mind Is Pitiful

Thierry Lepage

There is contempt, judgment, criticism, towards those I find unsightly, towards the handicapped, the poor, the foreigner...

There is greed, lack of generosity, selfishness, fear of giving, fear of missing out.

There is self-centeredness, the search for an advantage for myself, for the best for myself.

## To you, Universal Father, To you Supreme Mother

Georges Michelson-Dupont

With God the Father, sonship is the great relationship

To you, my Father, I affirm my ambition to become experientially perfect one day through the technique of association, integration and unification of my will with your will.

To you, my Thought Adjuster, I long for you to take possession of my mind to become my Thought Controller and inspire my will to make the following necessary adjustments:

## Death

Here is a reflection by Fernand de VINCK on death that he wrote down on paper shortly before he left us for the world of houses.

Fernand was Belgian, from a noble family, he had a brilliant military career. In retirement, he lived in Breine l'Alleud, near Brussels.

Fernand was a long-time friend of Jean Royer, Jacques Dupont and myself. He participated in the first correction of Jacques Weiss' translation, from 1978 to 1994.

Fernand contributed letters to LA LETTRE, the quarterly periodical of the CERDH.
