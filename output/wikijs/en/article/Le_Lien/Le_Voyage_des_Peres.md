**The Journey of the Fathers** in 3 volumes from Paquet

Neither easy denigration nor in-depth study, **David Ratte** offers an amusing vision of the wanderings of Christ through the prism of the fathers. The latter, always late for a miracle, mischievously punctuate the story with exchanges (of a philosophical or bar-room nature, it's up to the reader to judge) that are more or less advanced. Sprinkled with references, this story will be more accessible in essence to those who have been immersed in the sacred texts for a while. Not that this album is complex, but rather that it is based on foundations that it is useful to know, at least from afar, to access certain subtleties. Thanks to a few connections with current events, it nevertheless manages to be accessible to everyone (editor's note: especially young people)...

***Overall summary***: 1st century AD. The arrival of a man, named Jesus, in Galilee will turn the lives of three old men upside down. Indeed, their sons will follow the providential man and become his apostles. Thinking that their offspring will return very quickly, it is clear that after several days of waiting this is not the case, the three fathers therefore decide to go looking for them. Their task is not simple, they will have to travel through Galilee and Judea while remaining as discreet as possible, the popularity of Jesus not being to everyone's taste.

***Summary No. 1 Jonah***: Convinced by the words of Jesus, twelve of them leave everything to follow the one that rumor calls the Messiah. In addition to the emotional aspect, at a time when having strong arms in the family is not useless, the fathers of those concerned do not necessarily look favorably on this sudden whim that takes hold of their sons. First and foremost Jonah, father of Peter and Andrew, who, once the stupor of the miraculous catch has passed, is thrown out of the marital home by his Bonemine to bring the descendants back to the fold. On the road traced by the Nazarene, the scene of multiple miracles, Jonah meets the parents of Matthew and Judas. The latter join him in this quest, but the certainties of each diverge as the journey progresses.

***Summary Alpheus***: The three Jewish fathers travel through Judea and Galilee in search of their sons who have become apostles of Christ. But since Alpheus abandoned them, Jonas and Simon find themselves alone in their quest... Well, alone, not quite, since they are accompanied by two former prostitutes who have become Christians. The cohabitation of this improbable quartet risks being [...]

***Summary No. 3 Simon***: Once we arrive in Jerusalem, nothing is going well. Jesus has been arrested, the apostles have been dispersed... and Alpheus has been seriously injured. Needless to say, the next few days are looking pretty bad [...]
