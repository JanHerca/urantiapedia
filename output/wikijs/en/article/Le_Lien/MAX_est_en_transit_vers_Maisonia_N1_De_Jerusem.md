Max my friend.

It's been a little over a quarter of a century since I had the opportunity to know you, the same spiritual quest has animated you throughout our relationship. I had the time to appreciate your generosity and your humor, first of all when you participated in our study meetings of the _Urantia Book_ within the Avignon group, and even later when you created your own study group in Marseille.

We did not always agree on all positions, but I always felt in you this spirit of brotherhood which animated you. Now you have undertaken our first great post-mortem journey, on the shores of the worlds of houses you will find our friends Chris, Nicole, Jean, Lulu, Jacques, I am convinced that they are aware of your next visit and they are waiting for you with great interest.

See you again Max my friend.

**Brotherly Patrick Morelli.**

I knew Max as AFLUB secretary, attending the AFLUB annual meetings, and participating in the weekly online Urantia Book study meetings.

I greatly appreciated his dedication to the tasks supporting the AFLUB, tasks for which so few volunteer and in the service of all French readers. His frank speaking, not always “politically correct”, amused me a lot, I saw in it a great human integrity that touched me. In our weekly study group, I have very fond memories of Max who so often gave us quotes referring to our current reading.

Max, I wish you a pleasant stay on the morontia worlds.

Looking forward to seeing you there with your humor intact.

**Gilles Mauroy**

Max left Urantia for Maisonia N¹ of Jerusem on Saturday, October 30, 2021. He was secretary of our AFLUB association for many years and, as such, a member of the executive board.

Marlène and I met Max at the international conference in Dourdan in 2002. He was immediately very friendly to us, with his Marseille accent and his “southern” humor. We met again with his partner Johanna when we lived in Blennes in August 2003, just after the death of my father Jacques. At that time, we had organized two weeks of intensive studies in which they participated with other readers including Moussa from Senegal. That year, it had been scorching hot which we all complained about except him because he liked the heat.

Then in 2015 he and Johanna came to Recloses to do another study week in August. His knowledge of the book was incredible, always ready to point us to the page of the quote. I remember buying a bottle of pastis because he liked to sip one in the evening after the study. His jokes always livened up our happy evenings.

Max, you will remain in our memory as a bon vivant, a being who exuded the joy of living, and we wish you good spiritual winds. Goodbye in the true sense of the word.

**Marlene \& Georges Michelson Dupont**

Like many members of our community, I had the privilege of seeing Max again at each of the national meetings and these meetings were always moments of warm reunions.

What always fascinated me about him was this strange mixture of demanding work and joyful relaxation with his inimitable accent that smelled of the South.

In short, it was like a permanent incentive to find yourself in a game of boules with pastis as the key, but only after having learned your booklet well.

It was and still is a perfectly identifiable Personality who will delight his seraphic companions; and I can already imagine the warm welcome that this future resident of the worlds of houses will reserve for us.

**Robert Gallo.**

How better to talk about Max than with photos!!!

I don't know his family so I won't talk about it, he has a daughter and a grandchild.

Max, with the help of Johanna, who will miss him, loved to welcome people with his personal style, smiling, sometimes mocking but always attentive.

He cultivated humor and kindness, always found something to move us. He enjoyed life, but a lot to thank God for being able to do it. He knew how to give but also receive, it was precious for many.

As a secretary, he maintained an impressive reader database and had warm contacts with everyone in the world. (images from Max's data). I have nothing more to add for our mutual friend. Bon voyage Max.

## SOME THOUGHTS ON DEATH

**DEATH.**

> Love of adventure, curiosity, and dread of monotony—these traits inherent in evolving human nature—were not put there just to aggravate and annoy you during your short sojourn on earth, but rather to suggest to you that death is only the beginning of an endless career of adventure, an everlasting life of anticipation, an eternal voyage of discovery. ([UB 14:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p5_10))

**WHERE IS MAX GOING?**

> 2. *Sleeping Survivors.* All mortals of survival status, in the custody of personal guardians of destiny, pass through the portals of natural death and, on the third period, personalize on the mansion worlds. Those accredited beings who have, for any reason, been unable to attain that level of intelligence mastery and endowment of spirituality which would entitle them to personal guardians, cannot thus immediately and directly go to the mansion worlds. Such surviving souls must rest in unconscious sleep until the judgment day of a new epoch, a new dispensation, the coming of a Son of God to call the rolls of the age and adjudicate the realm, and this is the general practice throughout all Nebadon. It was said of Christ Michael that, when he ascended on high at the conclusion of his work on earth, “He led a great multitude of captives.” And these captives were the sleeping survivors from the days of Adam to the day of the Master’s resurrection on Urantia. ([UB 30:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/30#p4_11))

**WHO WILL HE MEET?**

> 1. *Planetary Mortals.* Mortals are all animal-origin evolutionary beings of ascendant potential. In origin, nature, and destiny these various groups and types of human beings are not wholly unlike the Urantia peoples. The human races of each world receive the same ministry of the Sons of God and enjoy the presence of the ministering spirits of time. After natural death all types of ascenders fraternize as one morontia family on the mansion worlds. ([UB 30:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/30#p4_10))

**WHAT WILL MAX REMEMBER OF HIS EARTH EXPERIENCE?**

> There is, however, one particular in which Spirit-fused mortals differ from their ascendant brethren: Mortal memory of human experience on the material worlds of origin survives death in the flesh because the indwelling Adjuster has acquired a spirit counterpart, or transcript, of those events of human life which were of spiritual significance. But with Spirit-fused mortals there exists no such mechanism whereby human memory may persist. The Adjuster transcripts of memory are full and intact, but these acquisitions are experiential possessions of the departed Adjusters and are not available to the creatures of their former indwelling, who therefore awaken in the resurrection halls of the morontia spheres of Nebadon as if they were newly created beings, creatures without consciousness of former existence. ([UB 40:9.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p9_4))

**WILL THE EXPERIENCE OF DEATH HAVE CHANGED MAX?**

> “23. Death added nothing to the intellectual possession or to the spiritual endowment, but it did add to the experiential status the consciousness of *survival.*” ([UB 48:7.25](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_25))
