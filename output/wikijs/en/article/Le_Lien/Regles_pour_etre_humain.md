1. You have been given a body. You can love it or hate it, but it will be yours for the duration of this life.
2. You will learn lessons. You are enrolled in a full-time informal school called “Life.” Every day you will have the opportunity to learn lessons in this school. You may like the lessons, or think they are silly or irrelevant.
3. There are no mistakes, only lessons. Growth is a process of trial and error: experimentation. “Failed” experiments are just as much a part of the process as successful ones.
4. A lesson will be repeated until it is learned. A lesson will be presented to you in various forms until you learn it. When you have learned it, you can move on to the next lesson.
5. Learning lessons never ends. There is no part of “Life” that does not contain lessons. If you are alive, there are lessons to be learned.
6. “Elsewhere” is not better than “here”. When your “elsewhere” has become “here”, you obtain again another “elsewhere” which in turn will seem better to you than “here”.
7. Others are essentially mirrors of yourself. You can only like or dislike something in someone else if that something reflects something you like or dislike in yourself.
8. What you do with your “Life” is up to you. You have all the tools, all the resources you need. What you do with them is up to you. The choice is yours.
9. Your answers are within you. The answers to the questions of “Life” are within you. All you need to do is look, listen and trust.
10. As you open yourself to this trust, you will remember more and more of all this.
