It took the Creator six long days of uninterrupted work to create woman. During his labor, an Angel appeared to him and said, “Why are you spending so much time on this, my God?”

And the Creator replied: “Have you seen the worksheet for this project? It's completely washable, has 200 replaceable moving parts, runs on black coffee, has a thigh that can support 3 children at a time, has a kiss that can heal everything from a scraped knee to a broken heart, and has six pairs of hands.”

Stunned, the Angel said, “Six pairs of hands? Come on! And that’s just the standard model?”

He tried to stop the Creator: “That's way too much work for one day, my God. Wouldn't it be better if you waited until tomorrow to finish?”

“But I can't,” the Creator replied, “I'm in such a hurry to finish what I cherish so much. Imagine, it heals itself when it's sick AND it can still do 18-hour days! Approaching, the Angel touched the creation: ”But, my God, You made it so sweet..."

And the Creator agreed. “She is gentle, indeed, but she is strong. You have no idea of all she can endure and accomplish.”

“Will she be able to think?” asked the Angel.

“Not only will she be able to think, but she will also be able to reason and negotiate.”

Noticing something, the Angel approached the model and touched her cheek: “Oops, it seems your model has a leak, my goodness. I also told you that you were overdoing it... ”

“_It is not a leak, beloved Angel, it is a tear!_” objected the Creator. “_A tear? And what is it for?_”

And the Creator, patiently, explained to her: “_For women, tears are the way to express their joy, their sorrow, their pain, their disappointments, their solitude, their compassion and their pride._”

Deeply impressed, the Angel retorted to the Creator: “But You are a genius, my God, a true genius. You have thought of everything so that woman is a truly exceptional being!”

“Yes,” said the Creator with humility, "my model is perfect. Woman will have enough strength to astonish man. She will be able to support enterprises and conflicts, but she will hold joy, love and happiness. She will smile when she wants to scream, sing when she wants to cry. Moreover, she will cry when she is happy and laugh when she is nervous. She will fight for the causes she believes in and fight with all her strength against injustice. She will know instinctively that a hug and a kiss can heal a heartache. She will walk, run, send you letters to remind you that she loves you. The woman's heart will be the engine of the world, what makes the planet turn. She brings joy and hope, compassion and ideals._

_And then, beloved Angel, by offering tenderness, the woman will offer the light of her soul..._ »

And then the Creator saw that it was good.
