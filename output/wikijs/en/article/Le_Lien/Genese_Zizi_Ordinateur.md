***1. Genesis***

Adam asked God:

- God, why did you make EVE so beautiful, so sweet, so gentle?
- So you can love him, Adam!
-And why did you make it so stupid?
- So she can love you, Adam!


***2. The divine story of the penis***

God had almost finished creating the universe when he realized that he had two items left in his bag. So he decided to share them between Adam and Eve. He told them that one of the remaining items would allow its owner to pee standing up.

—_It's a very handy thing,_ God explained,_ and I was wondering if either of you would enjoy having it._

_Adam started jumping with excitement :_
— Oh, give it to me! I would love to be able to do that.

Eve, smiling, told God that if Adam wanted it so badly, she would be happy to let him have it, and God gave Adam the item that would allow him to pee standing up. Adam began by aiming at the trunk of a tree and then writing his name in the sand, laughing with happiness at having so much fun with his new toy.

God and Eve looked at him for a moment, then God said to Eve:

- Okay, you just have to take the remaining item
“What is it called?” asked Eve.
“A brain,” God replied.


***3. The sex of computers***

According to women, it is masculine because:

1. To capture his attention, you have to turn him on.
2. He has lots of information but no imagination.
3. He's supposed to help us, but half the time he's a problem.
4. As soon as you commit, you realize that if you had waited, you would have had a better performing model.

According to men, it is feminine because:
1. No one except its creator understands its internal logic.
2. The basic language he uses with another computer is incomprehensible to everyone.
3. The smallest error is stored in memory to be brought out at the most opportune moment.
4. As soon as you sign up, you find out you have to spend half your salary on accessories.
