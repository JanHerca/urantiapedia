Hello dear seekers of the right way to be,

People in the world throw themselves at sales, the latest inventions, promotions without much discernment. Among them, a small number of people try to warn them that it is their way of being that is causing the planetary damage that some, but not so many, complain about constantly. Jesus told his apostles and disciples not to worry about the misfortunes of the planet but rather about their spirituality individually.

It is obvious that there is no point in fighting against people's material aspirations if they do not see a higher reason to channel them and have the deep conviction that their right choices will put an end to all this chaos from which only a minority benefits.

## The Pilot World of the Seventh Circuit of Havona

**Paradise**

_This imaginative text attempts to describe the impressions of a Urantian arriving on the world, receiving from the seventh circuit of the central universe of Havona, and subsequently going to Paradise as a visitor._

_This composition was part of a visualization exercise within a training given on UBIS._

Brotherly greetings, my friend of old, a friendship that has continued since our remote origins on Urantia! As I promised, I am sending you this communication relating my first impressions of my arrival in Havona. Since we had planned to make this account public to our brothers and sisters on Urantia, with the permission of the higher superuniverse authorities, I will use our ancient alphabetical form rather than the system or superuniverse language.

Upon my arrival on this world, my first act was to thank with great solicitude my transporting seconaphim. Subsequently, I was introduced to the beings who were to preside over my initial activities on this world.

## Growth in the Kingdom of Heaven

Georges Michelson-Dupont

Reclosed, France

> On the occasion of the European Urantia Conference held in Tallinn, Estonia, last July, I was invited to give a presentation on the theme of growth in the kingdom of heaven. Here, slightly modified to fit the LINK format, is the text of this presentation.
{.is-info}

The theme of this presentation is “Growth in the Kingdom of Heaven,” based on papers from The Urantia Book. We will not have time to cover all aspects of spiritual growth. Nevertheless, I will touch on certain aspects of the subject that I find appropriate. Furthermore, rather than giving my own interpretation, I will excerpt from the book the appropriate paragraphs that relate to the subject, as I consider the authors to be the best possible teachers. Each excerpt will be followed by questions for consideration.

## Guardian Angels Study

Guardian angels or guardians of destiny are probably the most misunderstood and misunderstood celestial helpers for most human beings. The vast majority of people living on our planet believe in angels and their personal guardian angel, but many of these beliefs are often far-fetched and not in accordance with the real functions of angels. Much is said or has been said and much is written about angels; one only has to go to stores specializing in esotericism or go to a bookstore in the “spirituality” section to realize this. This means that we can have a very personal interpretation according to the image we have of angels and their functions. The purpose of this study is to better understand the function of the Seraphic Guardians in relation to the function of the Thought Adjusters. Their task is less recognized and yet so essential to the survival of the personality of its human associate.

For the second time, Guy Antéquera welcomed us to his home in Mouries.

There were 17 of us readers, 10 readers from the Alpilles, 6 from Marseille and one from Paris. (Participants were asked about readers from the Var).

The study began with a thought for our friend Jean Royer who has already begun his journey to Paradise.

## The Urantia Book is a large book.

Correspondence of Samuel Heine

New Caledonia

If we put aside the part of the life and teachings of Jesus, the other parts of the book are quite technical and require time, interest and a certain good will to be read and understood as a whole allowing the reader/researcher to make a summary and a coherent synthesis for himself and his life.

Often I have met people who have told me that they have purchased The Urantia Book and have been discouraged from reading it from the introduction.
