## The President's Ticket: 2012

So here comes this much-speculated year, which in a strange _maiutics_ an ancient people would have announced to us as “special.”

It is true that if 2012 resembles its predecessor, the adrenaline of our news bulletins has not finished rising, conservatism has not finished cracking.

And what about UB in all this, you might ask?

If UB was the coming revolution? (Not specifically in the next 12 months but in a “future moment”)

## Edito: Paul and the Eternal Feminine (3)

Here is an edition as a conclusion for my two favorite themes: the Eternal Feminine and the friend Paul! Not that these subjects are exhausted or that we have gone around them, only that the reflection leans towards other spiritual insights...

Thanks to the portrait of Mary developed by our friend Yves Guillot-Goguet from the fascicles of The Urantia Book, I cannot resist transcribing this grandiose page of Urantian femininity that is the life of the mother of Jesus of Nazareth.

As an accompaniment, here is the more contemporary testimony of a personal friend, who agreed to relate her daily spiritual experience, that is to say in her life as a couple. (She does not yet read the UB).

***Editor's note*** _(editor's note):_

_The Links are quarterly and appear on the 15th of March, June, September and December! They are first sent to subscribers in digital form (PDF format) on these same dates and then, as far as possible, in their “paper” form. As AFLUB prints are grouped with other periodicals, it is possible that the deadline for the paper format is longer. As for the texts intended to be published within the Link concerned, they must imperatively arrive 30 days before the aforementioned publication date and approved by our president, Dominique Ronfet, director of publication. Thank you for your understanding._

## Portrait: Marie

_What a wonderful testimony she leaves us as a wife and as a mother! What courage to have been able to face and overcome many difficulties! In this, Mary deserves our admiration. Mary was not a being apart, endowed from birth with faculties beyond the ordinary mortals; she was part of humans with all their weaknesses, but also all their strengths._

The appearance of the angel Gabriel and especially his promises had a profound impact on Mary, who showed remarkable fidelity and constancy in her predictions concerning her eldest son. This strong and sustained conviction was also reinforced by the meeting with her cousin Elizabeth. What Mary especially remembered from Gabriel's words was the word “liberator”, forgetting a little too quickly that the liberator in question would be situated on a “spiritual” plane.

## Maxien Quiz No. 8: The questions

**Superuniverse**

1. What are the Teaching Sons of the Trinity called and to what order do they belong?
2. To compensate for the finiteness of creature status and to overcome their limitations of concept, the Universal Father has established for evolutionary creatures a sevenfold approach to Deity. What are the personalities who compose this approach? 3. I hope everyone knows the name of the first mortal who discovered Havona, but do you know the name of the Graduate Guide who welcomed him?

## Scoop: Exoplanets


Genevans discover **50 new exoplanets!** The harvest includes sixteen super-Earths! That's not a handful, but a shovelful!

In front of the cream of extrasolar planet hunters gathered in Wyoming (United States), the **HARPS** spectrograph team, led by the famous Geneva astrophysicist **Michel Mayor**, announces the discovery of around fifty new specimens. The harvest — unprecedented in the history of exoplanets begun in 1995 by the aforementioned and his colleague Didier Queloz, from the University of Geneva — is all the richer because it contains 16 super-Earths. In other words, planets of small mass, most probably telluric. The 50 new exoplanets are added to the $**6 0 5**$ already identified to date.

## Psychospi: The Seven Fundamental Realities (what is given)

**1. The Essence of Reality: The Universal Father and the Paradise Trinity**

Human consciousness is oriented by the frame of reference of the reality in which it lives. We think and act in accordance with the reality and value of the parameters of the world as we perceive and conceive it. Psychology always operates within a metaphysical context. Our conscious and unconscious understanding of Ultimate Reality conditions all our thinking and all our action. This ontological or intuitive frame of reference is a conviction of faith. It is the universal philosophical terrain of the human mind.

The theological or religious term that our culture uses to symbolize this first source, the center of all things and all creatures, is “God.” The principles of spiritual psychology are determined by the nature of God and by the nature and quality of our minds. Each person has more or less different religious convictions concerning the nature of God and different mental experiences and qualities. With regard to the nature of God and the dynamics of the universe, the author does not seek to impose on the reader the conviction of his faith, but he presents it as a possible means of explaining truths that are empirically operative in spiritual psychology and common in human experience.

## Humor: Genesis- Zizi - Computer

***1. Genesis***

Adam asked God:

- God, why did you make EVE so beautiful, so sweet, so gentle?
- So you can love him, Adam!
-And why did you make it so stupid?
- So she can love you, Adam!

## Paul: The hymn to love (2)

“Love believes all things.” We must cultivate trust rather than distrust, as God is more attentive to our future than to our past.

“Love hopes all things.” Paul is convinced that there are few fundamentally perverse men, but that there are many unhappy, wounded men who need to be loved in order to believe in themselves again, to progress and reveal unsuspected possibilities of themselves.

“Love endures all things.” It refuses to be overcome by the forces of evil and desires to “conquer evil with good” ([Rom 12:21](/en/Bible/Romans/12#v21)).

## Pub: The Journey of the Fathers

**The Journey of the Fathers** in 3 volumes at Paquet

Neither easy denigration nor in-depth study, **David Ratte** offers here an amusing vision of the wanderings of Christ through the prism of the fathers. The latter, always late for a miracle, mischievously punctuate the story with exchanges (of a philosophical or bar-room nature, the reader can judge) more or less in-depth. Sprinkled with references, this story will be more accessible in essence to those who have been immersed in sacred texts for a while. Not that this album is complex, but rather that it is based on foundations that it is useful to know, at least from afar, to access certain subtleties. Thanks to a few connections with current events, it nevertheless manages to be accessible to all (editor's note: especially young people)...

## Poetry: Emergence - Pro Machiventa

**EMERGENCE**

The three seas languished in the warmth of their waves
The inert salts still united their cleavage
In bristling shapes breaking on the shore
When the life bearers came to give them a soul.
Microcosm snatched from the carbon cycle
The vital DNA double helix is stirring
Multiplying mono- or trilobite forms
From proto to meta, it's a sea of boiling water.
Then the earth turned green and the first reptiles
Swell into dinosaurs. In the shadow of their tails
The first lemurs were both fierce and fragile.
From brain to brain and until the last leap,
Primates are breaking away from their ancestral lines
Finally Ecce Andon stands on its two legs.

## Inter-regional meeting: Domaine de Châles

Organized by readers from the Paris region in conjunction with those from Touraine, this meeting took place on November 14 and 15 at the Châles estate in Sologne, south of Orléans. It brought together 11 regional participants, to whom Isabelle and Jean Annet from Belgium were added, to form a group of 13 seminarians who exchanged their approaches in perfect harmony, in the sumptuous setting of the castle reserved for us and under the light of a gentle autumn sun.

Among the lucky “chosen ones” of this meeting, we could recognize Anne-Marie and Dominique Ronfet, Elisabeth and Jean-François TROUVE, Marlène and Georges Dupont, Isabelle and Jean ANNET, Thierry Lepage and his partner, Christine Baussain, Jean DUVEAU and your servant Robert Gallo.

## Testimony: The Etern-Feminine Wing

_Editor's note: There are remarkable beings that we rub shoulders with without being fully aware of it until the day when their presence bursts into the full light of friendship (of the editorial staff). This is the case with Anne, a young woman as elegant as she is brilliant and whose vivacity radiates simplicity. Her strength: enthusiasm in the noblest sense of the term! Fully a woman and so close to the Eternal that her testimony wonderfully closes the theme of the Eternal Feminine, a subject that she revisits in her own way._

_With self-denial and modesty, Anne decided to realize the professional dream of her husband whom she met in their youth! “What a woman wants, God wants!” Anne's living faith made it possible to manifest this ambitious project in reality, this taking priority over other matrimonial projects. Thank you Anne for sharing this intimate experience as a couple with us!_

## Science: The Higgs Boson

The Higgs boson is named after the British physicist Peter Higgs. Many elementary particles are bosons, such as the photon, the particle of light postulated by Einstein. The Higgs boson is a key part of the theory that describes the universe, known as the Standard Model (SM). In the SM, the Higgs boson—abbreviated Higgs—explains why fundamental particles have masses. In the summer of 1964, Peter Higgs and other physicists postulated that there was a field that filled all of space. Each particle acquired its own mass by interacting with this “Higgs field.” Those that interacted strongly with the field had greater masses than those that interacted weakly, in the same way that a streamlined racing car can penetrate air more easily than a bus. A virtual particle, the Higgs boson, is associated with this mechanism. But all this remains conditional, because for the moment, the Higgs boson only exists on paper.

## Meditation: The Life of the Masters (extracts)

**Union with God — Our Goal**

If we sell our birthright, if we neglect or treat with contempt the beneficent laws of God, we turn our backs on the Father's home and wander into a distant land. What then do we profit by the warmth and cheerfulness that abound in our native home? When we are weary of the troubles of life, when we are weary, when we feel homesick, we can return with faltering steps to the Father's house. But this return can be made either by the path of bitter experiences or by the joyful abandonment of material goods.

Let us make our subjective an objective, a wise and willing collaborator of the principle. Let us direct ourselves straight to our objective. Let us make it the divine inner life. No one has ever accomplished anything great without having totally concentrated his will and maintained his objective (God) before the pure mirror of his thought-force. The thought-force is man acting as God, man demanding of himself such concentration on his objective (God) that it manifests itself instantly. As soon as God has become objective, let us present the mold of our desire, and this mold is immediately filled. If this statement does not prove to be rigorously exact, it is because we could not have had it.

## Brother Dom’s Little Corner

- Memory is a strange phenomenon.
- What do you mean?
- It seems that our existence is constructed in this “space”.

It's like living in an apartment but not controlling the clutter.

- ...and that we should die suffocated under our own rubbish?

Interesting image. But can we talk about space without addressing time?
