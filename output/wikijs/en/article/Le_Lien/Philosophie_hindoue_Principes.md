1. _The first principle:_ “**Whoever you meet is the right person**”. _This means that no one comes into our life by chance. Everyone who is around us, everyone with whom we interact, represents something, whether it is to teach us something or to help us improve a current situation._
2. _The Second Principle:_ “**Whatever happens is the only thing that could have happened**”. _Nothing, absolutely nothing that we have ever experienced could have been any other way. Not even in the most minor details. There is no “If only I had done this differently..., then it would have been different...”. No, what happened is the only thing that could have happened and must have happened for us to learn our lesson in order to move forward. Every single situation in life that we encounter is absolutely perfect, even when it defies our understanding and our ego._
3. _The Third Principle_: “**Every moment something begins is the right moment**.” _Everything begins at exactly the right moment, neither earlier nor later. When we are ready for it, for something new in our life, it is there, ready to begin._
4. _The fourth principle_: “**What is no more, is no more**”. _It's as simple as that. When something in our life ends, it contributes to our evolution. That is why, enriched by recent experience, it is better to let go and move on. I think it is not by chance that you are reading this. If these words strike a chord, it is because you meet the requirements and understand that not a single snowflake accidentally falls in the wrong place._

_Be good to yourself._

_May love be in your whole being._

_Always be happy._
