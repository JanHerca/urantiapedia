## Edito: “Perpetual Journey!”

One of the greatest pleasures we get from reading UB is that indescribable feeling of being perpetually on a journey!

Pilgrims of time and space, our vision alternates between history and the future of our own humanity.

Framed by temporal and spatial constraints, our spiritual growth is balanced by constantly pushing back these same very salutary limits.

Whether we go in one direction or the other, it is always a wonder to see the endless progress of the plans of divine manifestation unfold.

It is this foretaste of eternity that is offered to us by this marvelous book!

Also, what a joy to share this happy spirit of travel! With his better half, with other readers, with Chile who does us the honor of being one of us as well as with our Belgian friends!

Happy reading to all!

Yours faithfully.

Guy

## The President's ticket

**Watteau**, in his magnificent painting “The Pilgrimage to the Island of Cythera”, invites us on a lovers' journey heading towards a mythological island.

Similarly, on the return from Chalès, where our biannual meeting took place, will we have found the path, the meaning of the word Love so often used but which ultimately remains so mysterious?

But as soon as one journey ends, another is prepared. It is on the symbolic island of Notre-Dame des Lumières that we should meet this fall to address the theme of our destiny.

## The guest: Chile

Dear friends and fellow readers of _The Urantia Book_:

After 5 years of solitary study of this monumental work, I joined the Urantia Association International (UAI) in 2001. Where I was first secretary, then vice-president of the Urantia Association of the South (AUCS) and currently president of the Urantia Association of Chile (AUCH), founded on April 3, 2006 after the dissolution of the AUCS.

Our association is composed of 34 members, half of whom have already completed a first reading of The Urantia Book, signed the application for incorporation, accepted the UIA regulations and who now support the noble principles and objectives of Urantia Foundation.

## Remarks IV: Human philosophy and mota

> Your difficulty in arriving at a more harmonious co-ordination between science and religion is due to your utter ignorance of the intervening domain of the morontia world of things and beings. The local universe consists of three degrees, or stages, of reality manifestation: matter, morontia, and spirit. The morontia angle of approach erases all divergence between the findings of the physical sciences and the functioning of the spirit of religion. Reason is the understanding technique of the sciences; faith is the insight technique of religion; mota is the technique of the morontia level. Mota is a supermaterial reality sensitivity which is beginning to compensate incomplete growth, having for its substance knowledge-reason and for its essence faith-insight. Mota is a superphilosophical reconciliation of divergent reality perception which is nonattainable by material personalities; it is predicated, in part, on the experience of having survived the material life of the flesh. But many mortals have recognized the desirability of having some method of reconciling the interplay between the widely separated domains of science and religion; and metaphysics is the result of man’s unavailing attempt to span this well-recognized chasm. But human metaphysics has proved more confusing than illuminating. Metaphysics stands for man’s well-meant but futile effort to compensate for the absence of the mota of morontia. (<a id="a108_1431"></a>[UB 103:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p6_7))

We may infer from this that the morontia mota expresses itself on the morontia and spiritual levels, as we can understand them, and which translates itself on the morontia levels into a sensitivity to supermaterial reality, into a knowledge-reason nature and a faith-clairvoyance essence.

## News: from Belgium

THIS SOME NEWS FROM BELGIUM:

In French-speaking Belgium, study groups continue to meet regularly. There are currently 5 regular groups and we meet twice a year for a 'national' inter-group day.

Here is the report of one of these days, as well as a thank you text from a participant, which goes much further than the simple thanks of this day. The next meeting will be on August 23 to celebrate the birth of Jesus.

Jean Annet

## Report: Meeting of 21.02.09

On Saturday, February 21, 2009, 21 people from different reading groups of the _Urantia Book_ met in **Liège** at the bookstore “Les Arcanes de la Connaissance”. The theme of the meeting was “The Thought Adjusters”.

After a presentation by Jean Annet, each person was able to express themselves and share their feelings about how each person experiences their daily relationship with their Adjuster.

Each testimony was very rich, very sincere and very profound. We were touched by the authenticity and spontaneity of 3 young women from Tournai, mothers who raise their children in the spirit of Urantia and specifically by connecting daily to their Adjuster.

## Reflection: Tolerance

***Tolerance***: From the Latin tolerare, to support. Disposition to admit in others ways of thinking, acting, feelings different from our own. In social life, the most useful virtue is tolerance.

***Intolerance***: Hateful, aggressive attitude towards those with whom one differs in opinion or belief.

Tolerance is one of the fruits of the spirit, a very grand word, which, taken literally, can make us people devoid of judgment. But, a question arises: should we push tolerance to the point of tolerating intolerance? What would become of a world with limitless tolerance?

## Testimony: Hélène Guisan

At 91, Hélène Guisan-Démétriadès continues to deepen her faith through morning meditation.

“***To be is to find God within oneself.***” These are the kinds of direct and profound statements found in her books. Arriving in Switzerland in 1922, for three months, at the time of the exodus of the Greeks from Turkey, Hélène Guisan-Démétriadès stayed there for life. A life of which she speaks with warmth and whose adventures she relates with talent: the translations of ancient Greek texts, notably Aeschylus...

“At the age of 25, after a long search, I had found a true faith, but it did not help me to live,” says Hélène over a coffee... Greek. “In Caux (CH), I found the method of silence to listen to the inner voice, that something that comes from ourselves and beyond ourselves. It transformed my life. I discovered that we can only change the world by changing ourselves. Which is within our reach. God can transform our hearts day after day, put love and forgiveness in place of hatred, trust in place of anguish, peace in the insecurity of life.”

This active woman kept a journal of her morning meditations for forty years.

“***Les carnets du silence***” brings together excerpts that show the tension between his desire to create a literary work and that of completely surrendering to God's plan.

“***La tierce présence***”, a work which won a prize from the Académie française in 1995, recounts “the privileged moments when I heard the inner voice, and when I obeyed it”.

“***Variations on the Verb to Be***”, the most recent book, brings together reflections on various subjects. In the titles, the publisher has highlighted the words presence, silence, being. “This unexpectedly shows the continuity of my research: the quest, in silence, for a presence that founds being.”

**Faith** is for Hélène Guisan “the most beautiful gift we can receive”.

Even though life is far from easy: “There will always be misery, madness, suicide, illness, death. But God always draws good from evil. He eternally recycles misfortune to draw new life from it. I write to say this, to give the best I have received, to say thank you for my life.”

Orthodox so ardent in her quest for God, has she never considered entering religious orders? “I love the world too much,” she replies, laughing. “I love writing, art, literature, nature...!”

## Song: Of the Word

“Oh irrepressible joy that wants to burst forth and spread like a blessed laughter, burst of sap, exultation of a river, clamor of alleluia:
“I am my joy, great ocean, too full eternity, which pours and flows inexhaustibly from the bosom of my infinity.
“I am the flowing cup, the infusion of light, which bursts forth into eternal asphodels of clarity.
“I am the immense and calm swell of love, moving in itself, from which life will flow like sovereign water.
"Like a spread-eagled swan rising into the dawn in a long burst of foaming whiteness, from the overflow of love, from the influx of light, rises the hymn of joy, blossoming, in eternal space, and I say:

## Song: Of the Flame


_In the heart of life, in the heart of the rose, I dance,_
_Joy assails me, joy attracts me,_
_Joy wraps me in its laughter, I am the woman, I am the flame,_
_The God-Breath makes me dance._

_In me the dance, to whom the joy,_
_I pick it up like sand_
_Which slips, flows between my fingers,_
_I disappear in my golden rain,_
_The world revolves around me._

_Small palm tree, compass rose_
_Who opens, offers himself through the heart,_
_Thus I open myself through love_
_To receive the gift of God._

_That everything is clear, love is joy,_
_That everything is laughter, joy stirs me up,_
_Joy sets me ablaze, joy lifts me up,_
_Crazy Flame Eternalized,_
_Star, dance, To God rocket._

## Travel: Love

_An invitation to travel on the theme of love_

Imagine the earth, our beautiful planet Urantia, its continents, its oceans. Come closer, Europe, again, France then Nouan-le-Fuzelier between Orléans and Bourges. National Meeting of May 2009 in the heart of a large preserved property of 430 ha, the Domaine de Chalès: a park, a castle, a natural pond of 38 ha... Marvel!

In this “magical” place we spoke again and again about divine love, about the ideal human love of perfection, truth, beauty and goodness. But what is love? Love is also found in all the little gestures, the little things in life like being welcomed by our kind organizer Jean with a bouquet of lily of the valley, a sprig for each one. Like a smile on a friendly face, these gestures, these states of being brighten our daily lives and make us happy here and now.

## The pen: Having wheat

If there is one word that disgusts me, it is the word “Faith”. It is not for its meaning or for the spiritual values that it can express and to which I am deeply attached, no, it is simply for the sound of this word that irritates my ears. Hearing it, it gives me as much pleasure as a piece of red meat thrown and flattened on a butcher's stall.

My friend Him, an alien who speaks French perfectly, admitted to me the other day that he shared the same disgust for this word as I do. Every time I am forced to put it in my mouth, to express a thought, he told me, it seems to me that I want to spit it out rather than say it. It is a word that would make me cough!

## Meeting: Many thanks

Today I intend to express simply through the word “thank you”, all my gratitude. It is spontaneous and can have repercussions on the mental and spiritual levels beyond what one could perhaps imagine.

This “thank you” or rather these “thousand thanks” go to the Universal Father who gave his benevolent blessing to the Revelation Commission of the leaders of the Superuniverses, to them, and to the various authors of the papers, mandated by the same leaders, for having revealed to us through The Urantia Book the divine truth on the spiritual values and the cosmic meanings of the universe.

One evening, the idea came to me spontaneously to express my gratitude to them by thanking them. The intention was quite strong in the intention to say it. I thank them for having made divine and cosmic truths known to us with such precision.

## Prayer: Our Father

The small village of Maalula,
in the desert in southern Syria,
keeps alive, against all odds,
Aramaic, the language of Jesus.

Here is the Our Father in Aramaic

“Obuakh tibishmo itchtekesh eshmakh

## Practice: Living in the here and now

### Past — present — future

Living in the here and now is the key to an active life and a fulfilled existence: it is only in the present moment that we can act. We may also be able to act tomorrow, but there is no guarantee. And if we limit ourselves to affirming that we will take action tomorrow, we will never do so. The only truly creative moment is the present moment.

By managing to live in the here and now we can experience real fulfillment. We then inhabit our being entirely, are truly ourselves, immersed in the present moment. Time is an illusion, only the present is real!

Time is a strange thing. It is much easier for us to live in the past and the future than in the present. In our minds, we are everywhere but within ourselves, and we are not aware of the moment. The crazy thing is that we cannot even be sure that we will be here to live the next moment, the next day, or the next month.

The only real thing is the precise moment we are living. Living today does not mean forgetting tomorrow or completely ignoring the future. One might object that we must plan our lives a little, earn enough to live on the next day, and that we are always told to set goals. And this is absolutely true. The essential thing is awareness. It is actually about being aware of the here and now, wherever we are and whatever we are doing. If we are eating, let us eat. If we are running, let us run. If we are suffering, let us suffer. And if we are happy, let us be happy. This principle allows us to accept everything that happens to us. By saying yes, we are present with our whole being and we can make decisions, recognize our opportunity and seize it.

“Give me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.” This is the Serenity Prayer of Alcoholics Anonymous, according to Reinhold Niebuhr. If we are to achieve this ideal, we must live consciously in the present moment. Only in this way can we know what we are capable of doing and what we are not capable of doing. Living in the here and now has practical application in our everyday lives. Examples include:

- rejoice wholeheartedly when we have a reason to do so,
- love with all our heart when we have found the “right person”,
- laugh without restraint in the presence of something comical,
- live through grief, feel it, when we are faced with separation,
- focus on the task at hand,
- helping when we can, knowing how to recognize luck or opportunities when they arise...


### “Three steps to living here and now”

***1. Let's not live in the past***

We've all done it: we think about past events that we haven't yet accepted. Our thoughts regularly drift into the past and we sigh “Oh, if only I had...” We also have the unfortunate tendency to feel guilty about a situation that we can no longer change. But that's life: we can't relive our past, nor can we change anything about it.

As far as the past is concerned, our possibilities in the here and now are limited to:

- learn from it,
- forgive ourselves, forgive others,
- cut ties with the ghosts of the past,
- feel rich and fulfilled for all that we have experienced, learned and done.

Let us no longer regret events or non-events that we can no longer change. We would waste our energy. Let us finish with the past, take all the positive from it to live our present. We can from time to time take a grateful and joyful look at this bygone era, but without lingering. It is not the past, but the present, that needs Us!

***2. Let's not live in the future***

If we focus too much on the future, we also fail to live in the present. Those who tend to focus too much on their future life either worry constantly or project their life and happiness into the future (“I will be happy when ...”, “I will do this or that when ...”). Both variants, worry and projection, prevent us from enjoying the moment. No one knows what tomorrow will bring and those who sacrifice everything for the future can just as easily disappear from one moment to the next, themselves and their plans. Of course, it is important, from time to time, to project ourselves into the future to trace our path there, to reflect on our journey. Setting goals and pursuing them is essential to living consciously and fulfillingly. But as soon as we know what we want, return to the present and live in the moment, because only then can we act to achieve our goals.

***3. Let's live in the present***

So let us not live in the past or in the future. Let us live in the present. Let us live now. Let us soak up life. Let us awaken all our senses to feel ourselves living in the present moment. Let us live in such a way that we would not regret anything if we were to disappear tomorrow. Let us realize our dreams and settle everything that needs to be settled. Let us live in such a way that we are reconciled with all the ghosts of the past. Let us value all our experiences. Let us enjoy what we are given to live. Let us take advantage of all the opportunities that life offers us. Let us become experts in the art of enjoying life. Let us try to discover positive sides in everything. Let us savor life. Every minute. Every second. Let us not waste a drop of it: everything can end tomorrow.

### Thoughts for living here and now

We can repeat to ourselves as often as we like the following thoughts, which will motivate us:

- “My life is happening at this precise moment, at this precise second, and so it is with every moment;
- I live with all my attention in the here and now;
- I live consciously — I perceive the present moment with all my senses;
- I use the time I have available to live my life. This time is always the present moment;
- Now is when I live, now I am active, now I take care of myself. Now is the moment that matters."

## Reminder: The study group (3)

7\. BEING AN EFFECTIVE GROUP FACILITATOR (continued)

It is important to keep the group on topic. If the discussion goes off in a direction that is not related to the topic at hand, the essence of the meeting may be lost sight of. Digressions are the biggest causes of disagreement...

Learn the art of asking carefully formulated questions that will help participants grasp particular meanings, achieve understanding, and perhaps stimulate them to make decisions for action in their daily lives based on the higher values found in the teachings.... Propose questions to the group, avoiding asking questions directly to a particular member. People do not like to be put on the spot. If the discussion is difficult to get going, you should find out who in the group always has an opinion on any subject and address the question to them, but only if you think it will not make them uncomfortable. People often do not like to “go first.” Avoid expressing your own point of view. To stimulate discussion, ask questions rather than express opinions. As a host and leader, you will have more influence than you think on the opinions of others and this will prevent them from seeking answers and personal growth. However, the facilitator should not limit himself to asking questions, he can also summarize the discussion and acknowledge the contribution of the participants.

Members should be encouraged to share their personal experiences that are relevant to the topic being discussed. As a facilitator, make sure that these experiences are relevant and do not let one person dominate the meeting with their life story, nor do you let the meeting turn into a therapy session. Ask others if they have had similar experiences or simply say, “Let's move on.” Generally, if someone becomes inconclusive, the other members of the group will pray that the facilitator will move the meeting forward. If a question is raised that is not relevant to the topic being discussed, the facilitator should ask that the question be discussed at the end of the meeting. Try to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate in the discussion... It is important that everyone stays involved in the discussion and feels part of the group. Group members should always be encouraged to share their personal experiences that are relevant to what is being discussed. Not only does this connect the group members, it also teaches each person how to apply the teachings in their daily lives. The facilitator must prevent any member from dominating the meeting or diverting it from the chosen topic. Long stories quickly bore most people.

The facilitator should read and review the materials in advance and prepare questions that will prompt reflective thinking and discussion. Be prepared to lead discussions with questions. Preparing study and discussion materials in advance can be productive and allows the study time to run smoothly. The group or selected group members may also want to help prepare for the meetings and this is encouraged... The facilitator should combine a friendly demeanor with a concentration technique. The meeting should be enjoyable to generate new and stimulating ideas and to strengthen bonds between people.

Highlight important points in the material and provide a summary at the end of each study session so that the essential points are firmly anchored in the minds of those studying. Always start and finish on time...

Effective learning requires that everyone feel physically and mentally comfortable. The group needs to know that the facilitator is taking charge quietly and that they are protected from distractions. It is important not to try to study more than the group can absorb. It is often better to end a meeting early if members are overwhelmed by a difficult topic. Study time and materials need to be organized and focused. Moving from booklet to booklet during a meeting can often disorient some members who are trying to follow or stay focused on the topic.

The Urantia Book tells us much about teaching. Jesus was the model teacher. Study his methods and use them. Here are some quotes that will help you: “_The true teacher maintains his intellectual integrity by always remaining a student._” <a id="a378_238"></a>[[UB 130:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p3_7)]

> _Jesus learned much about men while in Rome, but the most valuable of all the manifold experiences of his six months’ sojourn in that city was his contact with, and influence upon, the religious leaders of the empire’s capital. Before the end of the first week in Rome Jesus had sought out, and had made the acquaintance of, the worth-while leaders of the Cynics, the Stoics, and the mystery cults, in particular the Mithraic group. Whether or not it was apparent to Jesus that the Jews were going to reject his mission, he most certainly foresaw that his messengers were presently coming to Rome to proclaim the kingdom of heaven; and he therefore set about, in the most amazing manner, to prepare the way for the better and more certain reception of their message. He selected five of the leading Stoics, eleven of the Cynics, and sixteen of the mystery-cult leaders and spent much of his spare time for almost six months in intimate association with these religious teachers. And this was his method of instruction: Never once did he attack their errors or even mention the flaws in their teachings. In each case he would select the truth in what they taught and then proceed so to embellish and illuminate this truth in their minds that in a very short time this enhancement of the truth effectively crowded out the associated error; and thus were these Jesus-taught men and women prepared for the subsequent recognition of additional and similar truths in the teachings of the early Christian missionaries. It was this early acceptance of the teachings of the gospel preachers which gave that powerful impetus to the rapid spread of Christianity in Rome and from there throughout the empire._ (<a id="a380_1701"></a>[[UB 132:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p0_4))

> _Always the burden of his message was: the fact of the heavenly Father’s love and the truth of his mercy, coupled with the good news that man is a faith-son of this same God of love. Jesus’ usual technique of social contact was to draw people out and into talking with him by asking them questions. The interview would usually begin by his asking them questions and end by their asking him questions. He was equally adept in teaching by either asking or answering questions. As a rule, to those he taught the most, he said the least. Those who derived most benefit from his personal ministry were overburdened, anxious, and dejected mortals who gained much relief because of the opportunity to unburden their souls to a sympathetic and understanding listener, and he was all that and more. And when these maladjusted human beings had told Jesus about their troubles, always was he able to offer practical and immediately helpful suggestions looking toward the correction of their real difficulties, albeit he did not neglect to speak words of present comfort and immediate consolation. And invariably would he tell these distressed mortals about the love of God and impart the information, by various and sundry methods, that they were the children of this loving Father in heaven._ (<a id="a382_1286"></a>[[UB 132:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p4_2))

> _Though Jesus’ public teaching mainly consisted in parables and short discourses, he invariably taught his apostles by questions and answers. He would always pause to answer sincere questions during his later public discourses._ (<a id="a384_232"></a>[ [UB 138:8.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p8_10))

> _Jesus had little to say about the social vices of his day; seldom did he make reference to moral delinquency. He was a positive teacher of true virtue. He studiously avoided the negative method of imparting instruction; he refused to advertise evil. He was not even a moral reformer. He well knew, and so taught his apostles, that the sensual urges of mankind are not suppressed by either religious rebuke or legal prohibitions. His few denunciations were largely directed against pride, cruelty, oppression, and hypocrisy._ (<a id="a386_529"></a>[[UB 140:8.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_21))

> _Each of the apostolic teachers taught his own view of the gospel of the kingdom. They made no effort to teach just alike; there was no standardized or dogmatic formulation of theologic doctrines. Though they all taught the *same truth,* each apostle presented his own personal interpretation of the Master’s teaching. And Jesus upheld this presentation of the diversity of personal experience in the things of the kingdom, unfailingly harmonizing and co-ordinating these many and divergent views of the gospel at his weekly question hours. Notwithstanding this great degree of personal liberty in matters of teaching, Simon Peter tended to dominate the theology of the school of evangelists. Next to Peter, James Zebedee exerted the greatest personal influence._ (<a id="a388_767"></a>[[UB 148:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/148#p1_2))

> _2. The second great blunder of the Master’s early followers, and one which all subsequent generations have persisted in perpetuating, was to organize the Christian teaching so completely about the *person* of Jesus. This overemphasis of the personality of Jesus in the theology of Christianity has worked to obscure his teachings, and all of this has made it increasingly difficult for Jews, Mohammedans, Hindus, and other Eastern religionists to accept the teachings of Jesus. We would not belittle the place of the person of Jesus in a religion which might bear his name, but we would not permit such consideration to eclipse his inspired life or to supplant his saving message: the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man._ (<a id="a390_736"></a>[[UB 149:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p2_4))

> _Jesus taught the appeal to the emotions as the technique of arresting and focusing the intellectual attention.
