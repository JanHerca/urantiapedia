In Paris at the C.I.S Ravel hotel from June 6 to 9, 2025

Organized by the A.F.L.L.U.

Our association, the A.F.L.L.U is pleased to announce that it will organize, as part of the IUA triennial conferences, a conference in Paris at the CIS Paris-Ravel hotel located at 6 Avenue Maurice Ravel 75012 PARIS. (https:// www.hotel-cis-paris-ravel. com/fr)

### Conference theme: Divine distributivity — Man, heir of God.

During the conference, 4 presentations of approximately 45 minutes will be offered followed by workshops in small groups distributed in breakout rooms.

A significant effort will be made in terms of translations.

> “Ganid was, by this time, beginning to learn how his tutor spent his leisure in this unusual personal ministry to his fellow men, and the young Indian set about to find out the motive for these incessant activities. He asked, “Why do you occupy yourself so continuously with these visits with strangers?” And Jesus answered: “Ganid, no man is a stranger to one who knows God. In the experience of finding the Father in heaven you discover that all men are your brothers, and does it seem strange that one should enjoy the exhilaration of meeting a newly discovered brother? To become acquainted with one’s brothers and sisters, to know their problems and to learn to love them, is the supreme experience of living.”” (<a id="a53_720"></a>[[UB 130:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p2_6))

The presentations will be made by PowerPoint projected on a large screen in French or English. Depending on linguistic requirements, they will be translated, printed and distributed to participants before the screening so that they can follow the content in their language and, if necessary, ask questions. We plan to call on the goodwill of multilingual readers to lead the workshops.

All presentations will be recorded and broadcast live on YouTube; we will call on professionals to ensure maximum quality for the broadcasts.

A large place will be left for the exchanges and social fraternity of the participants. Meals will be taken in a room reserved at a small table of 8 to [^2] people and the dishes will be served at the table.

**Hotel service**: The hotel has around a hundred rooms, single, double and with several beds. Each room is equipped with a bathroom and toilet. There is no air conditioning but the temperature in June is mild.

**Accessibility**: The Ravel hotel is located near the eastern ring road of Paris, in a green and relatively quiet environment, close to public transport, bus, metro, R.E.R and tram. In front of the hotel there are paid parking spaces for the day but there is another public car park a little further away at more affordable prices.

**Prices**. Prices will be definitively established at the end of September 2024. They will include full board for the duration of the stay as well as all services with the exception of personal supplements such as drinks at the bar, etc. Reservations will open in October or November 2024 and will be made via the I.U.A. reservation site, the contact details of which we will provide at the end of September 2024.

We are already appealing to volunteers for the organization in the following areas: welcoming participants, translations, entertainment. Contact Georges: georges.michelsondupont777@gmail.com or Ivan: ivan.stol.is@gmail.com
