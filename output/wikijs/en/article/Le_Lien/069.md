## The President's note: All my best wishes

Hello everyone, wishing you a happy end of the year and a happy new year to come!

The European is wary of spirituality because he confuses it with religion.

Now the very principle of spirituality is the elevation of each person in tolerance through the recognition of the reality of each person and openness by considering that God is infinite in possibilities of manifestations.

***Editor's note*** _(editor's note):_

_The Links are quarterly and appear on the 15th of March, June, September and December! They are first sent to subscribers in digital form (PDF format) on these same dates and then, as far as possible, in their “paper” form. As AFLUB prints are grouped with other periodicals, it is possible that the deadline for the paper format is longer. As for the texts intended to be published within the Link concerned, they must imperatively arrive 30 days before the aforementioned publication date and approved by our president, Ivan Stol, director of publication. Thank you for your understanding._

## Edito: To God!

Here is Link No. 69, by which I take leave of its edition.

With a nice surprise for the optimists, it is entirely devoted to the method that our friend Georges proposes to us to study the UB within our study groups. I think it was worth informing you about it and sharing with you a work that he has matured for years. Bravo and Thank you Georges (Marlène)!

His idea of transmuting a group of readers into a group of UB students is very commendable. Everyone can find an invitation to become more active in their quest for truth and to focus more on the content of the UB. By trusting the methodology of the Revelators and all the spiritual influences that are dedicated to helping us raise our consciousness! Of course, this remains an example that can be refined, developed according to the specific needs of a sharing group!

## We received the news from Guy de Viron...

We have received news from Guy de Viron (aka Viro), Editor-in-Chief for 7 years, that from the end of 2014 he intends to “pass the baton”.

And Max and I, on behalf of all the members of AFLUB, would like to thank GUY for the enormous amount of work he has done, as well as his superb drawings.

We know how much time and effort these sketches took to make.

And we will all miss this humorous “Link” very much.

May another UB reader have the desire, the drive and the courage to continue to keep alive this Link that binds us all.

Johanna and Max

## In the Marseille group...

In the Marseille group, we have been working for 4 months with the “cross-reference” method that Georges and Marlène gave us, and our readers love this way of working because they find that the study is much more complete when working like this and that it also makes us revise the whole book and recall forgotten or misunderstood passages.

The debates are quite intense and the questions numerous. Many thanks to Georges and Marlène for giving us these 16 reference sheets which allow us to make good progress in our study and in understanding the texts.

## Study: The Urantia Book in Study Groups

STRATEGY AND PRACTICE

Georges Michelson-Dupont

**Introduction**

The purpose of this presentation is to share with you the experience accumulated over the years to animate and make attractive study groups and seminars. It is largely based on the in-depth study and observation of the pedagogy of the revelators.

1. First of all I will recall the mandate to reveal, entrusted to the revealers by the authorities of our universe.
2. Then I will analyze their strategy and the key points of their teaching.

## Intermission 01: The Hummingbird Movement

The **Hummingbird Movement** takes its name from a Native American legend: One day, the legend says, there was a huge forest fire. All the animals, terrified and dismayed, watched the disaster helplessly. Only the little hummingbird was busy, fetching a few drops with its beak to throw on the fire. After a while, the armadillo, annoyed by this ridiculous agitation, said to him: “Hummingbird! Aren't you crazy? You're not going to put out the fire with these drops of water!”

And the hummingbird replied: “I know, but I'm doing my part.” Founder of the **Colibris Movement**, recognized as an international expert in the fight against desertification, **Pierre Rabhi** is one of the pioneers of ecological agriculture in France. Since 1981, he has been sharing his know-how in Africa, seeking to restore food autonomy to the most deprived and to safeguard their nutritional heritage.

## Intermission 02: The Shamengo Team

**Shamengo** is a fantastic collective adventure in which new talents participate every day. Some have been there since the beginning. Others join us on one-off missions according to their desires and our means. They all have in common the desire to grow this meaningful work that surpasses us and of which we are proud. This bet on the future was initiated by Catherine Berthillier, a senior reporter for the major news programs on French television: _Envoyé Spécial (France 2) Des Racines et des Ailes (France 3) Zone Interdite (M6) Reportages (TF1) Arte Reportage (Arte)..._ as well as numerous documentaries for France 3 and France 5 in international co-production.

After having denounced for 15 years in her investigative investigations, those who destroy the world and received numerous distinctions (Grand Prix du FIGRA, Palme d'Argent at the NY festival, Audience Award at the SCOOP festival in Angers...) Catherine Berthillier decided in 2008 to put her skills and her large network of contacts in France and abroad, to the benefit of those who build the world of tomorrow. Shamengo, produced by the audiovisual production company, Kaïa Prod was born in October 2011.

## Maxien Quiz No. 19: The answers

**Jesus**

1. Machiventa soon became known throughout Palestine as the priest of El Elyon, the Most High, and as the wise man of Salem. Among some of the surrounding tribes he was often called the sheikh or king of Salem. [UB 93:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p2_4)
2. When the Master gave up his life, less than thirty people were present. There were only the thirteen Roman soldiers and a group of about fifteen believers. These believers were all women except two, Jude, the brother of Jesus, and John Zebedee, who had returned to the scene just before the Master breathed his last. [UB 187:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p5_1)
3. Shortly after one o'clock in the afternoon, in the growing darkness of the violent sandstorm, Jesus began to lose his human consciousness. He had spoken his last words of mercy, forgiveness, and exhortation. His last wish—concerning the care of his mother. [UB 187:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p5_2)

## Brother Dom’s Little Corner: The latest one!

- Do you know that our cafe has to close?
- What?! But where are we going to exchange?
- They are redoing the whole building.

I hope at least that one of those cold and anonymous buildings will not be built, in which each tenant seems to strive to think and live like his neighbor.

- Well, the wind is changing. Maybe it's progress. But yes, it's really hard to think for yourself in this world that always seeks uniformity.
