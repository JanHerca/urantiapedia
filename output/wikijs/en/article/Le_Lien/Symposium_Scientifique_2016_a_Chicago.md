_Chicago — June 2 to 6, 2016_

The community of readers and students of the _Urantia Book_ has among its members a good number of scientists, academics and researchers who, as part of their activities, present the results of their studies in light of the data offered by the Urantia Book during annual colloquia organized by different Urantian organizations. These works inspired by the revelation allow us to discern more deeply the facts of God, the law of God and the love of God by reconciling science, philosophy and religion. The reading committee of the Link has decided to translate and publish at the rate of one or two presentations per issue those which were given during the Scientific Symposium 2016 organized by the Urantia Foundation in its premises in Chicago last May. These presentations in English were entirely filmed and can be viewed on U-Tube at the following address:

We hope you enjoy reading it.

N.B. A special mention should be given to our friend Jean Royer who was responsible for translating them.
