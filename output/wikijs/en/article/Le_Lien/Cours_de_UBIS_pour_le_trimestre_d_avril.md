### 1. Course Title: Evolutionary Humanoid Life.

**Course level**: Intermediate.

**Readings**: Sections of ascicles 34, 36, 42, 49, 52 and 65.

**Course description:**

In this course, we will see together how humanoid life appears on evolutionary planets, the types of life possible, who creates it and who is responsible for implanting it and how does it take place? We will also study the different planetary eras traveled by all evolutionary mortals and we will complete this course with an overview of the control of evolution that celestial beings exercise on these worlds. The particular case of Urantia will eventually be the subject of another study.

**Teacher-facilitator**: ***Claude Flibotte***

Claude Flibotte lives in the southern suburbs of Montreal in the province of Quebec in Canada. He has been studying The Urantia Book since 1970. The teachings revealed there are, for him, his daily nourishment. His whole life has taken on meaning and full value since that day. He is aware of being at the beginning of a fabulous adventure that will only end by extending to Paradise, face to face with his Heavenly Father and beyond into eternity.

### 2. Course Title: The Mission of Joshua the Educator.

**Course level**: Intermediate.

**Readings**: Booklets 130, 131, 132 and 133.

**Course description:**

Over the next two months, we will study together in more depth the period when Jesus was Ganid's teacher and appreciate the great work the Master did to prepare the way for his apostles and for Paul.

**Teacher-facilitator**: ***Guy Stéphane.***

Originally from Douala in Cameroon, Guy Stéphane is a chartered accountant in training. He discovered The Urantia Book in 2012. For him, these booklets are the reward for his deep search for the Universal Father. Since then, his desire has been to increase his understanding and disseminate it to those close to him.

### 3. Course title: The inner life.

**Course level**: Intermediate.

**Readings**: Sections of fascicles 111 100, 143, 160, 3, 30, 48, 4, 110, 34 \& 180.

**Course description:**

This course is a thematic study on the inner life. Together we will deepen our understanding of the inner life. How can we develop it? What is the purpose of an inner life? Why is it so essential to our spiritual growth? Why is only the inner life creative? What is the purpose of worshipful meditation and prayer?

**Teacher-facilitator**: ***Guy Perron***

Guy Perron is from Montreal, Canada. When he fully immersed himself in the incomparable teachings of The Urantia Book in 2000, he immediately felt that he had been blessed and had in his hands an incredible gift, a great and powerful work of art about our Father's love...true morontia food for our souls, for his soul.
