Dear readers and friends,

The AFLUB (Francophone Association of Urantia Book Readers) invites you to participate in its national meeting which will take place in June 2019 from Thursday 13 at 6 p.m. to Sunday 16 at 2 p.m. at Notre Dame de Lumières -84220 — Goult.

This weekend will be an opportunity to study the following theme:

How does the soul work in you?

This is a question, and the purpose of this meeting is to let people who wish to do so make a short presentation of their feelings. Each presentation will be followed by a debate. The references to the soul in the UB will be sent to everyone for preparations and debates, but the presentations do not necessarily have to refer to the UB, which could lead to more exchanges.
