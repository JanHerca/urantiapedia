## A Word from the President

Dear readers,

Here is a very substantial Link, enough to lead to rich reflections and real questions. I hope that you will find what you are looking for and that your soul will have something to satisfy itself with!

As far as the association is concerned, the most important news is the launch of a new website for the AFLUB www.urantia.fr. The means for us to communicate more simply and easily with readers. A tool, also to make the Book known to truth seekers from all walks of life and to the simply curious eager for new vocations.

You will note that this site contains all the archives of the “Letters \*” of the C.E.R.D.H and the Lien. A way to share information as best as possible while relieving our structure of the tedious and costly tasks of editing and sending journals. With this in mind, we will offer the possibility of receiving the Lien and the IUA journal by electronic mail from the beginning of 2006.

Finally, in this period of splendor and gifts I must remind you that the association only survives through your memberships and donations. Thank you for not forgetting us in 2006 so that the AFLUB can continue.

Happy reading to all,

\* _« La Lettre » was the journal of the association C.E.R.D.H. (Center for Study and Reflection on Human Destiny) from 1978 to 1996. An ancestor of the AFLUB._

Severin Desbuisson
President of the A.F.L.L.U.

## Understanding your neighbor

> _God is inherently kind, naturally compassionate, and everlastingly merciful. And never is it necessary that any influence be brought to bear upon the Father to call forth his loving-kindness. The creature’s need is wholly sufficient to insure the full flow of the Father’s tender mercies and his saving grace. Since God knows all about his children, it is easy for him to forgive. The better man understands his neighbor, the easier it will be to forgive him, even to love him._ (<a id="a87_483"></a>[UB 2:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p4_2))

To understand our neighbor, let us follow God's example. First, let us learn to know him, let us know how to discern his qualities and his faults, he necessarily has some, how can we know these qualities? Quite simply by observing the life of our neighbor, we quickly become aware of his qualities and his faults. Curiously, it is by forgiving that we learn to love our neighbor better. The verb to love takes on a completely different meaning here than that which we can give it in the case of falling in love with our future partner. To forgive, there must be something to forgive, that is to say, a defect, an imperfection, a weakness, a shortcoming, a fault, even a vice appears. Forgiving a wrong that has been done to us is the solution to better understand and then try to love our neighbor. Even if no wrong has been done to us, it may happen that the “head” of our neighbor does not “please” us, and this is when our ability to take the first step of a friendship that can turn into love comes into play.

## Science, Philosophy, Religion and Revelation

**Introduction :**

For any understanding and mutual understanding it is good to define what is meant by the basic terms, this is what we will do before examining:
- the foundations,
- the method,
- the object,
- the scope of action,

and we will end with a comparison of how each can approach the problem of God.

## From matter to spirit, passing through the mind.

Life is not a matter of chance. It is intentional, never accidental. Mind linked to Spirit is creative and produces life.

When a planet becomes favorable for the implantation of life, the Life Carriers are mandated to perform this service. With the agreement of the Paradise Sons, they will choose the life models, elaborate the vital plasma and organize the form and physiology of living beings. In no case are they capable of giving life, they transmit it: the spark of life and the reproductive powers are the gift of the Mother Spirit of the local universe. They are also not capable of attributing a mind to the material bodies that they fashion; however, the adjutant spirits, source of the material mind, accompany them. Long after their arrival in a chosen world, millions of years later, the circuits that are the adjutants will come into function as and when they prove useful. It is not impossible, for example, that the first animal experiencing fear triggers the mechanism by which the adjutant of courage is activated.

## Tales, Poems and Humor

### For a friend

Why am I assailed by doubts and uncertainties?
It seems to me that others don't have any, or at least not as many.
How can I strengthen my faith and make it a habit?

I tried meditation, yoga and whatnot,
but all of them left me hanging, with a bitter taste.

Why finally this incessant quest?
Do I have to search endlessly?
Who will show me the way?

### Senerity

What is serenity?
In our human condition?
What is truth?
On the way, and who is holding us back?
What is Life?
And its supreme meaning?

We all aspire to have our needs met;
We all seek to satisfy our desires:
The lack, the contrasts of near and far
Our questions are tension towards pleasure...

### Urantia News Briefs

* Rick Lyon of the Dissemination Committee has just produced a Starter Kit for Study Groups. It is available in both French and English.
* Several groups gathered in various countries to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the publication of The Urantia Book. This was notably the case in Chicago, of course, but also in Tallinn, Estonia.
* The $40,000 needed to publish the book in Italian was raised thanks to donations from many readers and also from associations. The Italian version of _The Urantia Book_ should therefore be available before the Christmas holidays.
* The Spanish have launched a “un lector un libro” program, which would require a reader to offer a book to someone else.

### Regarding the A.F.L.UB.:

* We are pleased to inform you of the publication of our new website, a real communication tool open to the French-speaking world and an external showcase for our association. This new site complies as closely as possible with our association charter, which consists above all in bringing together isolated French-speaking readers from around the world. We invite you of course to take a look at the following address http://www.urantia.fr
	All your comments are welcome at the usual email address: afllu@urantia.fr.
* Good news to associate with the probable publication of the translation of the work “Reaching High” entitled “Chemin des Cîmes” by the good care of our emeritus in-house translators. Attention, no date to date for this new release. It is possible that finances will allow the work to be printed during 2006 depending on possibilities.
	Moreover, to do this we call upon you now to think about your resubscription in order to be able to produce this printing of the work as soon as possible. But above all in order to best meet the deadlines for the editions and distributions of the Urantian Link and the Journal of the UAI (Urantia Association International). All this to let you know that the amount of your 2006 membership shows your attachment to the activities of the association. It will of course be welcome in return for this Link!
* And finally, we are pleased to announce the date of the next national meeting of the association which will take place in Nancy on June 23, 24 and 26, 2006. Reserve these dates now in your brand new AFLUB calendar.

And yes:

We are pleased to offer you a 2006 calendar in A4 format with around thirty illustrated pages.

This calendar traces the events of Jesus' life on a daily basis. Each month opens on two pages, the annotated month and a photo on which is affixed a quote from the Urantia Book. There are less than 20 copies available at only €23, postage included.

It's up to you to act!

Best regards,
