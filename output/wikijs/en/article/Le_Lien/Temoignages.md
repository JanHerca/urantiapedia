“God in our life” was indeed there! As proof if any were needed: his subtle perfumes were distilled among us: anachronistic time within a strict timing, fraternal unity within a plurality as large as the number of personalities present, approach to his infinite richness in straightforward sincerity. He even made a brief appearance disguised....as a puppet.

We quickly recognized him by his white beard!

A handful of women and men, as derisory as they are sincere in sharing our living faith, the one that sometimes raises waves because it is so close to our hearts; then calms down in the light of the fraternity that prevails. We have “come together”, assembling our divergences into convergences towards the One. We have known how to speak, exposing as equals our plural diversities to live the Kingdom. Complex concepts have not left room for the indolent mind.

We knew how to remain silent, out of respect for others when the withdrawal of silence marks the deep acceptance of enriching difference.

We laughed—and sometimes tears glistened; invisible sincerity sat at the center of hearts and assembly.

The supper of remembrance opened the Spirit of truth to express itself in the mouth of each person.

Last round table (we particularly liked them) at the end of the journey: thank you, thank you, thank you... to the visible and invisible worlds.

Insufficiency of words. Beyond that, recharged hearts and souls say God in our life. The adventure continues: to distil the Kingdom, each by his means, wherever he is, whatever he does, by his radiance of being above all. As a base, the fraternity made real speaks of the power of the divine promise kept and gives the assurance to continue the path.

The call has been made: prepare for the 2025 European meeting!

## How I (Re)Became “Addicted” to the Urantian Brotherhood in La Neylière.

After an 8-year absence and driven by a compelling need to return to the Urantia Book reading sessions, I re-registered for AFFUB at the beginning of the year. A few days later, I received the invitation for the 2023 national meeting in La Neylière. I was so enthusiastic that I made arrangements for May 1st instead of June 1st! Three days before leaving, I had to reorganize myself for an additional month of waiting in impatience and... reading!

Arriving at La Neylière, I was intimidated but the first evening reassured me. After dinner, we found ourselves in the garden and the magic of the Book worked: sitting in a circle, we introduced ourselves each in turn and chatted until late under a starry sky despite voracious mosquitoes. We chatted until the cool air chased us away with so much sincerity, humor and fraternity that I fell asleep after midnight smiling... at the angels.

The next day, June 2, our real work truly began at 9 a.m. in a studious atmosphere focused on this subject that was both abstract and difficult:

Our exchanges offered a wide range of both our mutual understandings and our questions. I took notes so as not to miss anything. The restaurant staff had to remind us of meal time!

The three days passed very quickly, in a sort of luminous and fraternal cocoon, away from the chaos of time, with the high point being the interventions of Georges and Sophie and the meeting of the national office.

When, to close the stay, we shared bread and wine like the apostles almost two millennia ago, I already felt a little disappointed to be leaving this wonderful atmosphere of fraternal sharing. I had a unique and exciting experience of mental amplification accompanied by a new thirst to learn and understand this book which is “neither quite the same nor quite another” (Apollinaire) with each reading.

Living this practical experience of benevolence and discovery of the other in their complementary differences is truly a concrete application of the _Urantia Book_ which exhorts us to consider ourselves all brothers and sisters in humanity of the same Father in divinity.

Thank you all!

Firstly, this testimony is motivated by the request of our secretary of the A.F.L.L.U., our friend Georges Michelson Dupont.

So as far as I am concerned, if I take stock of these three days of study, what comes to mind first is a surprise, because I really never completely expect, when faced with this kind of meeting, the obvious pleasure that I had in finding myself in the midst of these fifteen personalities who were all animated by this sincerity and this need to speak of God, of Jesus and of our respective Adjusters.

In short, I sincerely think that this kind of experience, also for those who have never tried or dared to participate in these exchanges, can be a beautiful unexpected adventure.

The theme of this session was “God in our life” and this contact with other sincere readers seeking truth allowed me to see that each one has placed with authenticity and still sincerity, a different stone in the building of the search for our Universal Father.

Best regards Patrick Morelli.
