## Rimini

Rimini predates Rome by several centuries and its origins are lost in an ancient past. For this reason it is considered a prehistoric city.

Moreover, the city is known not only as one of the largest seaside resorts in Europe, thanks to its approximately 15 km of sandy beach, but also as an ancient port, founded by the Romans in 268 BC.

It was immediately a strategic port for relations with Gaul, where the Roman emperors erected magnificent monuments such as the triumphal arch of Augustus or the bridge of Tiberius.
During the Renaissance, the city became the domain of the princes of Malatesta - protectors of illustrious artists including Leonardo da Vinci - who built the famous Malatesta temple, the name given to Rimini Cathedral.

This small town offers plenty of opportunities for both tourism and relaxation.
