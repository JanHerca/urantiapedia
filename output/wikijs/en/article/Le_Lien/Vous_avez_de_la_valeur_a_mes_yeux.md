If you feel like God doesn't love you, and can't use your potential, just remember this:

Abraham was too old,
Isaac was a great dreamer,
Jacob was a liar,
Philippe's daughter, Léa, was ugly and had a dull look,
Joseph was mistreated by his brothers,
Moses had a stuttering problem,
Gideon, also known as Yeroubbaal, was afraid,
Samson had long hair and was a womanizer,
David had several wives and was a murderer,
Elie was suicidal,
Isaiah preached naked,
Jonah fled from God,
Job went bankrupt,
Peter denied Christ,
The disciples fell asleep while Jesus was praying,
Marthe worried about everything,
Nalda, the Samaritan woman, divorced more than once,
Zacchaeus was small in stature,
Paul was too religious,
Paul's friend Timothy had an ulcer,
And Lazarus was dead!
And don't forget that Jesus helped them all

Now, no more excuses, God loves you and expects you to use your full potential because you are not the message but the messenger.

There are 10 things we need to understand:

1. God wants spiritual fruit, not religious fanatics.
2. There is no key to happiness, the door always remains open.
3. Silence is often misinterpreted but never misquoted.
4. Learn to count your blessings.
5. Faith is the ability not to panic.
6. If you worry, you don't pray; if you pray, don't worry.
7. As a child of God, your prayer will always be received by the Father.
8. Family is the most important thing in your home and the central planetary family is called Havona.
9. A grudge is heavy to carry and difficult to get rid of.
10. When we become entangled in our problems, remain calm, God will help us untie the knots.

Live simply, love generously, take a deep interest, speak kindly, and leave the rest to God.
