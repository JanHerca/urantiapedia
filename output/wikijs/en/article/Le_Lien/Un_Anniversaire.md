Dear readers and students of the Fifth Epochal Revelation, The next LINK published by our association will be number 100. At a rate of 4 issues per year this will be its twenty-fifth year of publication; &frac14; of a century!

To celebrate this anniversary I will ask you to send me personal testimonies, how did you discover The Urantia Book, how the revelation transformed your life, what are the “inevitabilities” that you have gone through and what repercussions on your perspective of life, has the expansion of your cosmic consciousness had?

Since Covid we have drifted apart a little; our association has fallen asleep a little and it's a shame. In order to reconnect a little with everyone, I ask you to send me a short text of 5 to 6 paragraphs on the functioning of your study group, indicating the number of members, the topics covered, the frequency of meetings, whether it is face-to-face or remote, supported by a few photos in jpg, in short any information that you deem useful to share.

[To send before November 15 to: georges.michelson-dupont@wanadoo.fr]

In the meantime, I wish you a fourth quarter

Your brother in spirit

G. Michelson Dupont
