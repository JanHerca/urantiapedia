## A word from the President

Dear AFLUB members,

As I leave my position as president of our national association, I am aware of the extent of the task accomplished with you. During these two years, I have focused on structuring our social organization as best as possible, and on reviving a dynamic that was flagging. I also wanted to introduce more transparency into our activity, which also has the effect of displaying the truth of the prices and the efforts that must be made for an association of this type to function well over the long term. And nothing can be done without everyone's participation. Finally, I have tried to give you a vision of what the AFLUB could be in its fraternal European environment.

## Presentation of the Book: PRESENTATION (2nd part)

It is only during his years of innocence or if he has managed, by personal decision, to purify himself and to spiritualize himself somewhat, sometimes at the cost of some harsh ordeal, that the human being can grant, partially and most often without his knowledge, the passage to the divine exhortation that the fragment of the universal Father delivers in his spirit. However limited and imperfect they may be, these contacts between the creature and the creator nevertheless immensely enrich human thought by allowing it to forge, day after day, what will remain of it after death, its soul, this pre-spiritual entity, altruistic and fraternal, freed from animal burdens and vivified by the spirit of trust and that of truth. Put to sleep at the moment of physical death and transported by spiritual personalities to worlds constructed for this purpose, the soul may prove capable of animating there a supermaterial body and then undertaking, with the loving and sure help of patient and devoted guides, the long and fascinating journey that will lead it towards eternity. And when it has finally conquered time and space, pierced the mysteries and mastered the mechanisms of cosmic thought and known God in the three infinite persons of his trinity, other accomplishments, still more prodigious, will be proposed to it.

## Reflection: A little reflection on the power of loving (2nd part)

***What is love for?***

Love itself cannot be defined. By the mixture of all qualities, men can produce virtue: they cannot produce Love. All efforts cannot make Love penetrate into our nature. For Love is the effect of a precise cause and the effect is obtained only when the condition is fulfilled. “We love because He loved us first.” The word “because” is important: it introduces the cause we seek. Thus, little by little our heart changes.

Let us fix our gaze on the love of Christ and we shall love in our turn. Let us contemplate this mirror, let us bear upon ourselves the reflection of the personality of Christ and we shall be transformed into his image, from tenderness to tenderness. We cannot love on command. The only way is to have our gaze fixed on the model of all love, to let ourselves be taken by love for him and to become like him. Inevitably, we shall resemble him. Love engenders love. It is a phenomenon of induction which will have the effect of creating a real force of attraction. Men will be attracted to us as we are attracted to them. This is the invariable effect of love.

## The Book and its sources

_Here is an excerpt of text on the sources of the UB consulted and analyzed by Matthew Block. The text is originally in two columns, here in four to have at the same time the original and the translation. The translation of Bundy's text is mine. I tried to respect the bolding and the underlining without succeeding completely._

The following represents the parallels between [part of] page 208 of Bundy's The Religion of Jesus and page 2089 of The Urantia Book. I have bolded some shared words and underlined significant differences.

**Translation by Jean Royer**

## Relaxation Corner: The winter wind

The winter wind is cold
This evening,
But you,
my love, you're leaving.

As the winter wind blows through the clouds,
Carrying away birds of passage in spite of himself,
Life also moves on to other horizons
Far beyond the screams, to the happiness of songs

Which the fairies cast like spells
For words of love to turn into snow.
Maybe one day you will have to remember
That I put your hand nice and warm in mine.

## Reflection: The essential

May every reader of The Urantia Book not stray from the essential.

The main thing is to know that we are all creatures of the one and only creator.

The essential thing is the consecration of choice in wanting and having to do what we sense to be the will of God.

This individual consecration is the lasting foundation of our eternal progression.

The individual fulfillment that results from this consecration will position us in the living fraternity among all our brothers and sisters.

## Brother Dominique's Corner

To teach or not to teach? ... such could be the question that a reader would ask himself after much reading and regular attendance at study groups. Imbued with knowledge, he has the right to say that he is a bearer and then wants to give what he thinks he has received.

But first, what does learning in the Fascicles mean?
