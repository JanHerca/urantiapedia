## A Word from the President

Do you doubt it?

Not me at all. I am certain of it, totally, absolutely, forever.

— Oh yeah, really?

Most certainly. Well, except maybe sometimes, on certain days, when the inner light fades or when the storm rages inside me.

Amazing? No, nothing surprising in this word that so well characterizes the evolutionary souls of time and space. Beneficial? Perhaps, in any case, it is up to you to judge through this Link “***Special Doubt***” which inaugurates a new, exceptional mode of publication for our newspaper. If you like the concept, do not hesitate to feed us with articles, we may then have a new special link soon. Your suggestions are always welcome.

Happy reading to all,

Severin Desbuisson
President of the A.F.L.L.U.

## Material Time — Morontia Time — Spiritual Time “The Importance of Time According to The Urantia Book” Part Two

### SPIRITUAL TIME

We should therefore arrive at the end of our sevenfold Havonian journey around the central Paradise Isle with a strong conceptualization of time and space, so strong that we will finally be able to “***the final slumber of time, in the sleep of the transit of eternity toward the Paradise goal.***” On these wonderful planets of Havona, we will achieve complete freedom from time and space, for “***in Paradise, time is not counted; the sequence of successive events is inherent in the concept of the natives of the central Isle.***” <a id="a95_534"></a>[[UB 22:9.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/22#p9_8)] In contact with the natives of Havona we will become almost perfect for a space without time and a time without space, for "***The Paradise mind is beyond human comprehension; it is existential, non-spatial and non-temporal.*** » <a id="a95_808"></a>[[UB 42:10.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p10_7)] Our judgments on all acts will become immediate, for « ***From the standpoint of Paradise, judgment is concomitant with the act.*** » <a id="a95_988"></a>[[UB 54:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p5_13)] We will become more and more like God, without ever becoming God; we will not be God but we will be divine. We will have had all the temporal and spatial experience of climbing the steps of transcendence in immanence, and we will be ready to begin our mission in the extraordinary spaces of the outer galaxies. We will then participate in the career of service intended to make understood how God the Father « ***proclaims the end from the beginning*** » <a id="a95_1489"></a>[[UB 2:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p2_1)], the goal of the absolute. And all this can only be done by the guidance of the Infinite Spirit.

## The Hidden Version of Part Four of The Urantia Book

Is there a version of The Urantia Book that we don't know about? A number of points lead us to believe that there is.

1. Jesus spoke Aramaic with his apostles.
2. During his trip to Rome with Ganid and Gonod he had to express himself partly in the vehicular language of the time, namely, Greek.
3. In Rome itself, and with the common people, it is probable that he had to speak Latin.
4. We do not know in what language the Urmia talks took place.
5. We also do not know in what language Rodan spoke, was it Hebrew or Greek?

## Reincarnation, truth or superstition?

Of all the corrupting beliefs that could have been attached to what might have been an emerging monotheism, none was more debilitating than the belief in transmigration, the doctrine of the reincarnation of the soul, which came from the DRAVIDIAN DECCAN <a id="a123_254"></a>[[UB 94:2.3-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p2_3)].

The orange race was very religious in the doctrine of reincarnation. Some more recent races believed and still believe that men died 3 to 7 times. This belief (a remnant of Adam's teachings concerning the 7 mansion worlds) as well as the vestiges of revealed religion can be found among the otherwise absurd doctrines of the barbarians of the 20th century. <a id="a125_357"></a>[[UB 86:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p4_6)]

At the time of Jesus people believed in this doctrine as well as the concept of KARMA.

## Doubt and doubts

We have all been confronted with doubt. How much room does doubt have in The Urantia Book? The word is found 110 times in the singular and 43 times in the plural, and there are about thirty occurrences of derived words.

\* It should be noted, however, that English uses the formula “no doubt” as French does the expression “sans doute”, that is to say in the sense of probability, by “sans doute” we must most often understand that it is (highly?) probable that...

Is doubt specifically human? No. It persists even after the fusion and only seems to disappear after the passage to the third circuit of Havona;

## Doubt

We all think differently. I always knew that God existed, that he was good and that for that reason he wanted our happiness. It took me a long time to accept the idea that anyone who said otherwise was not a liar!

I do not doubt God. Nor do I doubt the angels who accompany me in everyday life. I know that all spiritual influences contribute to my happiness. I know that this happiness is not free, that it is difficult to earn, but that it is already there, inside me. True happiness is born with the acquisition of freedom and freedom is born from spiritual acquisitions (also called eternal values).

## August 21, 2003

On this August 21, 2003, we celebrate the 2010th anniversary of the birth of Jesus of Nazareth. Let us associate with this celebration the Personal Adjuster of Jesus. Here:

The incarnation of Michael of Nebadon on Urantia was to fulfill several purposes, and among them is one that concerns us more especially. Through the bestowal of the Spirit of Truth, the Comforting Spirit of Michael of Nebadon, the Thought Adjusters, also known as Mystery Monitors, now inhabit every normal human mind. This portion of the Universal Father, although not personal, is nonetheless individual. Let us not forget that each Mystery Monitor chooses “his mortal” according to the potentials that each of us possesses at birth, thus demonstrating a quasi-personal choice (whether these potentials are represented by the personality of each one or by other criteria, that is not the subject of this text.) What is interesting is to understand well the new relationship established between **all** mortals of Urantia and the Universal Father. It is a strengthened paternal relationship that further fosters the brotherly relationship among all mortals, for it is indeed a relationship that did not exist before the incarnation of Michael of Nebadon except among certain mortals. Now, whether we are conscious of it or not, this relationship allows the spiritual evolution of each one to grow in **quality** and **frequency**. And this spiritual relationship is nourished precisely by the quality and frequency of this evolution. (Spiritual evolution does not depend entirely on the relationship with the Mystery Monitor, but it is primordial. See the seven psychic circles.) One cannot exist without the other.

## Questions — Answers

**A question to ask the followers of the Link:**

It can be healthy to sometimes ask questions about certain revelations that appear contradictory. For example, how can we reconcile these two quotes?

First: “In the distant future when the Moon will approach to within about eighteen thousand kilometers of the Earth, the gravitational action of the latter will cause the Moon to break apart, and this burst of gravity due to tidal effects will reduce the Moon to small particles. These may collect around the world in the form of rings of matter similar to those of Saturn or may be drawn gradually to Urantia in the form of meteors.” <a id="a173_435"></a>[[UB 57:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p6_3)]

It can be assumed that after such an explosion, life on earth will be seriously compromised. Indeed, when they announce the proximity of a meteor no bigger than a football field 80,000 kilometers from home, our fans of so-called fiction cry apocalypse (now!)

Second: "Only those planets which attain existence in the main circuits of the superuniverse are assured of perpetual survival, but, so far as we know, these worlds settled in light and life are destined to continue their course in all the eternal ages of future time.) <a id="a177_270"></a>[[UB 55:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p0_3)]

So, questions: Will our planet ever be fixed and stabilized in the circuits of Orvonton? Will it ever be anchored in light and life? Who has an answer?

Jeanmarie Chair

**Answer:**

It raises quite a few questions. Urantia, being a decimal planet and also being the one that welcomed the seventh bestowal of Michael of Nebadon, one could think that it would be in the distant future, fixed and stabilized in the circuits of Orvonton. But is this enough for such a destiny to be reserved for it? Does its current physical situation being very far from the center of Orvonton allow it to be able to seek such an honor? But perhaps in this distant future the physical situation of Urantia will have changed completely, (as well as doubtless its intellectual, moral and spiritual situation.) And if such were the case, could the Urantians divert, reroute or deflect the moon by means of techniques that are totally unknown to us at the present time, but which in this at least distant future would doubtless be well developed. Unless this maneuver is entrusted to Master Physical Controllers of our Universe? etc, etc.

Thank you for raising this topic.

## Relaxation Corner

### Ge Doubt is my friend

> _Truth is inconcussible—forever exempt from all transient vicissitudes, albeit never dead and formal, always vibrant and adaptable—radiantly alive. But when truth becomes linked with fact, then both time and space condition its meanings and correlate its values. Such realities of truth wedded to fact become concepts and are accordingly relegated to the domain of relative cosmic realities._ (<a id="a195_396"></a>[[UB 118:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p3_3))

Doubt is my friend
It allows me to stay up late.
Like a warrior on the prowl
It keeps me awake.
Lookout, I know nothing.
I think like others capture
Butterflies or images...
My concepts are my evening totems.
But doubt is my friend
It allows me to rekindle the flame
From the researcher who, for the time of an image,
Was sleeping.

### Some news from the libraries..

The library project we told you about in the previous Link has generated several donations. We sincerely thank these benefactors. From now on, we therefore benefit from a sum available for investments in libraries, universities, prisons, etc.

Also, if you would like to participate in this project by helping to place books, this fund and our help are at your disposal.

Do not hesitate to contact us,
The AFLUB.

### Announcement

Do numbers speak to us? Judge for yourself:

The translation of The Urantia Book into Esperanto, the future international language of Urantia, was begun in August 1996 and was completed yesterday, August 21, 2003. This work will have lasted 7 full years. And, word of honor, it was Nicole, my companion, who pointed out to me that it was therefore ending on the anniversary of the birth of Jesus.
Happy Birthday Jesus! :-)
