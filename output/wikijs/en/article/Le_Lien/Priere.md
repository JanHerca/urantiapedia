**EXTEND YOUR HAND THROUGH THE NIGHT**

When the weariness of the road is upon me,
and the thirst of the arid day;
when the spectral hours of twilight
extend their shadows over my life,
so it's not just about your voice
that I cry, oh my friend!
but a pressure from your hand.
There is anguish in my heart;
he carries the burden of riches
that he did not give you.
Stretch out your hand through the night,
that I hold it, and fill it, and keep it.
Make me feel his embrace in solitude
of the path that gets longer.

Rabindranath Tagore

**I SUMMON YOU AT DAWN**

God, I call upon you at dawn.
Help me to pray and gather my thoughts;
Alone, I can't do it.
In me is darkness, near you is light.
I am alone, but You do not abandon me;
I am discouraged, but You help me;
I am worried, but with you there is peace;
In me is bitterness, but with you is patience;
I do not understand your ways, but you know the right path for me.
Father in heaven, praise and thanks to
You for the rest of the night, praise and thanks to You for the day that dawns, praise and thanks
to You for your goodness, your faithfulness.
Lord Jesus Christ, You were poor and miserable, a prisoner and abandoned like mm
Help me!
Holy Spirit, give me faith, which saves me from despair, from letting go.

Dietrich Bonhoeffer

## Prayer and gratitude

**GIVE ME THE GIFT OF KNOWING HOW TO LAUGH**

Lord, give me good digestion and, naturally, something to digest...

Give me a soul that does not know boredom, murmurs, sighs, lamentations.

Don't let me worry too much about this intrusive thing called “me.”

Give me the gift of knowing how to laugh at a joke, so that I can draw a little joy from life and share it with others too.

Lord, give me a sense of humor.

Saint Thomas More

**MOTHERS BLESSING**

I bless and honor all mothers.
Mothers love is strong.
He protects and comforts, nourishes and forgives.
He is encouraging, supportive and unconditional.
A mother's love begins before birth and continues endlessly.
It is an expression of the Divine.
Today in particular, I honor and appreciate my mother
or anyone who may have played that role in my life.
I remember the wisdom she passed on to me, her stories
as well as mannerisms and traits that are unique to him.
I am grateful to her for everything she has given to our family.
The best thank you I can give him is to share with the world
the best teachings received from my mother.
With gratitude, I bless and celebrate all mothers and the love they share.
