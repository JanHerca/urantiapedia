## The President's note: Summary of the Jura meeting

Hello dear Urantian Brothers,

Drawn together by the influences of the Adjuster of God, the Spirit of Truth of Jesus representing the Eternal Son, and the adjutant mind spirits of the Divine Minister representing the Infinite Spirit, and aided by the Angels, three types of mind function within our personality.

The **first**, as it comes from God, should speak to us of Love.

***Editor's note*** _(editor's note):_

_The Links are quarterly and appear on the 15th of March, June, September and December! They are first sent to subscribers in digital form (PDF format) on these same dates and then, as far as possible, in their “paper” form. As AFLUB prints are grouped with other periodicals, it is possible that the deadline for the paper format is longer. As for the texts intended to be published within the Link concerned, they must imperatively arrive 30 days before the aforementioned publication date and approved by our president, Ivan Stol, director of publication. Thank you for your understanding._

## Editorial

Here is Link #68, probably the penultimate one formatted by your servant! Indeed, some consider it necessary to make a change in substance and form to this Link, which is too personalized.

I would like to thank all the supporters who appreciated the look and tone of this current version that began almost 7 years ago! So let's move on to the renewal and the project that should replace it.

## Note: Resurrections of mortals after physical death

For mortals, there are several kinds of resurrections and techniques of earthly escape, here is what the Urantia Book says about them:

1) **Dispensational Resurrections.**

Most matters decided by the Ancients of Days, concerning collective judgments and dispensational resurrections, are also delegated for execution to Gabriel and his staff. (<a id="a74_172"></a>[UB 33:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p4_6))

2) **Special and millennial resurrections.**

## Psychospi: The Seven Fundamental Realities XI

**C. THE THREE REFERENCE CHARACTERISTICS OF SPIRITUAL LIFE (The results)**

***1. Inner Peace***

Inner peace is the deep expression of those who have found their identity as sons and daughters of God. We are committed to the will of the Father and strive to fulfill His plan in our lives; therefore, we are confident and sure in the ultimates of our destiny. A sense of spiritual security that nothing can displace strengthens our lives.

Material things are seen only as temporal advantages that do not direct our lives and the loss of which does not threaten our inner stability. Attachment to spiritual realities has freed us from the heavy demands of the ego and the need for social approval. Even though our outer lives are surrounded by chaos and danger, our inner self remains calm and assured. It is in fact a peace that passes all understanding. Such spiritual stability is immune to all disappointment.

***2. Integration, balance and completeness***

## Worship: The New Jerusalem

“The former things have passed away,” and “all things have become new.” “While I was blind, now I see,” not “dimly as through a mirror,” but “face to face.” Yes, even in my flesh I have seen God. The hills have retreated and there is no horizon, but the light of heaven illuminates all things.

I have long sought you, O Jerusalem, but only now do my pilgrim feet touch the ground of heaven. There are no more uncultivated spaces. The fertile lands are before me, such as I have never dreamed of. Oh, truly “there shall be no more night.” Her glory shines like the noonday sun, and there is no need of light, for God is her light.

## Note: From the revised translation

Some women are indignant that the revised version kept the term “excited” in <a id="a126_77"></a>[UB 190:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p2_5) “_It has not been seen only by <ins>excited women</ins>; even brave men have begun to see it. I expect to see it myself._”

They find that it would have been better to translate “***<ins>excited</ins>***” as enthusiastic. However, one must always remember that the text must take into account the period. Those who speak are rough Galileans from the first century. If they were people from the 19th century, the word 'hysterical' would have been found there. The term is known from the _Urantia Book_, it is found in <a id="a128_393"></a>[UB 90:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/90#p1_2). But there is also the linguistic aspect that must be taken into account. If “_exciting_” used as an adjective means exciting, excited does indeed mean excited. Here is what the Larousse dictionary says about this term: _excited [Ik'saıtıd] adjective_

## Prayer

**EXTEND YOUR HAND THROUGH THE NIGHT**

When the weariness of the road is upon me,
and the thirst of the arid day;
when the spectral hours of twilight
spread their shadows over my life,
so it's not just about your voice
that I cry, oh my friend!
but a pressure from your hand.
There is anguish in my heart;
he bears the burden of riches
that he did not give you.

## Study: On freedom and the mode of evolution of civilization

**Introduction**

First of all, it should be noted that the French word liberté translates two English words: liberty (163 times) and freedom (88 times). The difference between these two terms is not obvious. We will let the exegetes of the future discuss it. However, the word freedom is not always translated as liberté.

Here is what one commentator says: Freedom is a state in which one can make decisions without external control. Liberty on the other hand is that which has been granted to someone by external control. It can also be noted that neither Spanish (libertad) nor Italian (libertà), nor Esperanto (libereco) nor even German (freiheit) have two words to translate freedom. Without wanting to Chineseize, the Chinese of the UB uses the same term 'ziyou' which means absence of constraint, a term also used in law. This is why we will most often note the English word used.

What kind of freedom is this? The Urantia Book refers to: personal freedom (liberty) 393:8, spiritual freedom, (liberty and freedom) religious freedom, mental freedom (freedom), social freedom (liberty), political freedom (freedom, liberty), freedom of speech (freedom), universal freedom (freedom) and distinguishes true freedom from false freedom. Jesus deals mainly with spiritual freedom which he often associates with joy and says little about social freedom.

## Mandela, Gandhi, M.L. King... And Jesus?

The global outcry over Nelson Mandela's death shows how much we need prophets - how cruelly we lack them. How small they seem next to them, these political leaders to whom we entrust power - so what should they do with it?

Three prophets — Mandela, Gandhi, Martin Luther King — to whom we should add the Dalai Lama and Aung San Suu Kyi — were visionary apostles of non-violence and forgiveness. All converted to these values in isolation, in a dungeon or in exile. As if the solitude of being sidelined was a necessary condition for the deepening that was theirs. As if one had to be condemned to the silence of the shadows in order to allow the end of hatred and the necessary unity of the human race to be born within oneself, and then proclaimed to the world, around a few very simple values. But which go against the current of the irrepressible movement of societies.

## Maxien Quiz No. 19: The answers

**Jesus**

1. The Pharisees desired Jesus' death for the following reasons:
	1. He had stood in effective opposition to their traditional hold over the people. The Pharisees were ultraconservative, and they resented these supposedly fundamental attacks on their long-established prestige as religious educators.
	2. They argued that Jesus was a violator of the Law, that he had shown complete disregard for the Sabbath and many other ceremonial and legal requirements.
	3. They accused him of blasphemy because he referred to God as his Father.
	4. And now they were thoroughly incensed with him because of the latter part of the farewell sermon which he had delivered that morning in the temple, in which he had violently accused them. (<a id="a184_193"></a>[UB 175:4.8-12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/175#p4_8))

## Brother Dom’s Little Corner: Enjoyment!

> “_Next to the supreme satisfaction of worship is the exhilaration of philosophy. Never do you climb so high or advance so far that there do not remain a thousand mysteries which demand the employment of philosophy in an attempted solution._” (<a id="a192_245"></a>[UB 27:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p6_1))

- Your book contains strange passages.
- Yes, the search for Truth seems to be an eternal quest.
- But I thought that the acquisition of the Truth was a definitive experience?
- Here is another belief to overcome.
