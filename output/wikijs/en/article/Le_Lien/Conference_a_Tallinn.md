## Theme

This lecture entitled “***Sowing the Seeds—Internal Qualitative and External Quantitative Growth***” will attract readers of _The Urantia Book_ from around the world. We will focus on the topic of “***Sowing the Seeds***”—how we can grow internally and numerically.

On Friday and Sunday the program will focus on possibilities for spiritual growth. On Saturday the focus will be on increasing the number of readers. During these two days, experiences carried out in different countries in Europe and also other continents to find new readers and form new study groups will be presented and discussed.

Following these presentations, the different European national groups will be invited to develop their own plans for finding new readers. The workshops will be organised in smaller language groups.

## The Conference

The Estonian Urantia Association (Eesti Urantia Assotsiatsioon — EUA) invites you to the Second European Urantia Conference, which will be held at the Tallink Spa & Conference Hotel in Tallinn, Estonia. The main language spoken at the conference will be English, but if your native language is not English and you find it difficult to understand, please be aware that we plan to translate all presentations into several different languages (depending on the number of volunteer translators available on site). They will also be available at the beginning of the conference in printed text form.

## Website

The website www.urantia.ee/conference2019/ is online and will provide you with more information about the programme, registering for the event and booking your hotel room. Over the coming months, more information will be available on the website. For example, about the theme “Sowing Seeds”, speakers, an evening programme, etc.
