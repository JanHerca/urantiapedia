Dear readers, Here we are in 2023 in an unstable world in turmoil. Apart from the fact that this year seems to be number 7, a year of truth, it is no less true that lawless Beings, through their exaggerations and also their fears, reveal themselves in spite of themselves. And people like us are able to bring to the world our superior points of view capable of guiding populations in the right choice of future leaders in charge of the management of our Country. No, nothing very complicated, just throwing seeds into the fertile pots.

## Relationships Between Material, Mental And Spirit

**Material and Mental**

As the following excerpt tells us:

> “It is the presence of the seven adjutant mind-spirits on the primitive worlds that conditions the course of organic evolution; that explains why evolution is purposeful and not accidental. These adjutants represent that function of the mind ministry of the Infinite Spirit which is extended to the lower orders of intelligent life through the operations of a local universe Mother Spirit. The adjutants are the children of the Universe Mother Spirit and constitute her personal ministry to the material minds of the realms. Wherever and whenever such mind is manifest, these spirits are variously functioning.” ([UB 36:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5_1))

This clearly determines that the circuits of the adjutant mental spirits have a direct action on organisms and their evolutions. And the Divine Minister is directly associated with these influences because in the same paragraph it is said:

## AT THE TOMB

Sophie Malicot

Looking through the texts of the death of Jesus, one may wonder why it was necessary to roll away the stone and open the tomb to dematerialize the body of the Master. Certainly the angels of the resurrection can pass through walls and do not need to push a door to enter, even if it is made of stone.

If the Jews and the Roman guards stationed there had not fled, what would they have seen?

Let's get back to the story.

In a heavy sandstorm on April 7, 30, after about 5:30 hours of agony, “it was just before three o'clock that Jesus cried out in a loud voice, 'It is finished! Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.'” Having said this, he bowed his head and gave up the struggle for life.

## First step on the path to the Revelation of the Middle Ages

Georges Donnadieu

In the third paragraph of a document from the _Urantia Book_ we can read these few notes:

> “During the Middle Ages, about the thirteenth century, the United Midwayers of Urantia petitioned for permission to convey to mankind a new revelation in the form of The Urantia Book. The request was approved, but the human context of that time was not yet fit to receive such a revelation.”

At the age of about 14, I was confronted with an echo of this Revelation of the Middle Ages, in “a bistory of French literature”.

## OUR UBIS EXPERIENCE

Agnes Lazare - Guy Perron

Most of us know that UBIS has existed since 1999. What technological changes have taken place since then! It is up to us to use them wisely. At first, all exchanges were made by email. Now, since 2014, UBIS has been using the Moodle platform, which has been updated since then. This new means of communication has opened up many additional possibilities for us, including more lively contact between students; and although we come to class according to our availability and everything is done virtually, for those who are well engaged in this sharing process, we increasingly have the impression of being in class with others in a space somewhat outside of time, which gives us real foretastes of benefiting from the personality circuit of our Universal Father.

## Fantasy on a major theme

Dominique Ronfet

<p style=“text-align: center;”>
Who can say?<br>
<br>
if movement is life,<br>
<br>
Peace can only come from adapting to its current.<br>
<br>
Do you think your hand can hold back the wind?<br>
<br>
You know how to analyze his movement,<br>
but do you learn to live with his breath?<br>
<br>
You would like to believe,<br>
<br>
Thinking of the world as an object,<br>
<br>
To be able to identify it, hold it, define it<br>

## SUMMARY OF THE ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT OF THE DAKAR PROGRESSIVE DIVINE WISDOM GROUP

Moustapha K. NDIAYE (for GSDP)

**YESTERDAY**

The Progressive Divine Wisdom Group of Dakar is made up of seekers of truth, who seek to perpetuate and share the teachings received from their educator, Moussa Ndiaye since 1973.

The latter had received a copy of “The Urantia Cosmogony” from Jacques Vesses in the sixties. After studying it for two years, he undertook to create a group of young people, mostly students, with a majority of women at the beginning. He led this question-and-answer group, until the students asked for structured teaching, to better know and live the Divine Wisdom that they sensed through these exchanges.

Thus was born the Progressive Divine Wisdom Group of Dakar. The oldest members, who received training from Moussa, and welcomed more than thirty individual readers from Europe, the Americas and Africa, between 2000 and 2020, have undertaken since 2019 to share and perpetuate this educational approach.

## Report On Our Ministry 2022 In The Philippines

by Eugene Asidao 11/14/22

It was a very active ministry, with a busy schedule during the three months we met with readers and potential readers.

**BOOK DISTRIBUTION.**

Urantia Foundation has allocated us a number of Books which we have been able to give to individuals, public and private libraries in schools, colleges and universities with success.

**OUR FIRST TRIP AFTER COVID**

On August 11, the first thing we did after nearly three years of absence was to meet with the most active and reliable readers with whom we had dealings in order to study the situation of the Urantia community in the Philippines.

Our next visit was to northern Negros Occidental, where our contact helped us donate books to colleges, universities and other higher education institutions for two days straight.

## News from the _Urantia Book_ International School (U.B.I.S)

**Reminder of the school's pedagogy**

It is based on the study of the book through reading, questioning and sharing. Teachers do not give answers because it is up to the student, depending on his understanding and reading level, to search for himself and by himself and then to share with other students. This dynamic teaching method is very appreciated because it also allows students to confront other religious cultures, to enrich themselves through exchanges and to build friendships.

**Linguistic development of the school.**

We are pleased to inform you that the school now offers courses in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, Polish and Hungarian, 7 in total.

Each quarter sees the number of students increase significantly with new participants.
