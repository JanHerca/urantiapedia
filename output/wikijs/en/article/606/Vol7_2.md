## News From 6-0-6

We are naturally pleased with your favourable comments about our February issue. One of our young readers has pointed out one correction to be made to our crossword. No. 2 across should read No. 5 . So to all of you still puzzling, take heart. We'll be publishing the results next month: Heanwhile, keep at it and remember, that was the children's crossword. The real tough one comes later in the year.

In this month's bumper issue we have, Paul's winning entry in last year's Art Competition, reduced in size and without colour. We trust you will endorse the judge ' decision.

Also, we present further comment on the need (or otherwise) for an association. It's not too late to send your ideas.

Plans for the June Conference are under way too. A Registration Form

is enclosed separately, giving all the details on venue and cost. Your early notice of attendance would be appreciated, so we can organize accordingly.

A splendid time is guaranteed for all.

1986 is becoming that big year we all expected?

## A Question Of Nuances 

In response to our article on “The importance of Language” in the September 1985 issue of the 6-0-6, we received the following letter from a reader in Canada.

> I am writing to you to indicate that the French language is not necessarily richer than the English language. The re are more than a million words in the English language, but there are no more than 350,000 in French. I have read that an university Francophone has a vocabulary of 20,000 words, while the English speaking person with an university training, uses some 30,000 words.
> 
> On the other hand I believe that the Francophone makes better use of nuances than the English speaking person. Thus in general, the truth of the matter alludes to the linguistic nationality, and not to the language. The English language is an implement of rare precision and allows all nuances. It is undoubtedly regrettable that the English speaking person uses — generally speaking — such a beautiful tongue so inadequately, while others with a language which is less rich, make better use of it.
> 
> Paul Michaud, St-Lambert, Que, Canada.

> “Having started out on the way of life everlasting, having accepted the assignment and received your orders to advance, do not fear the dangers of human forgetfulness and mortal inconstancy, do not be troubled with doubts of failure or by perplexing confusion, do not falter and question your status and standing, for in every dark hour, at every crossroad in the forward struggle, the Spirit of Truth will always speak, saying, ‘This is the way.’” (<a id="a67_452"></a>[UB 34:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p7_8))

## We Are “Quivering On The Brink” !

On <a id="a71_3"></a>[UB 195:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_2) we find some of the most exciting sentences in the whole book: “A new and fuller revelation of the religion of Jesus is destined to conquer an empire of materialistic secularism and to overthrow a world sway of mechanistic naturalism. Urantia is now quivering on the very brink of one of its most amazing and enthralling epochs of social readjustment, moral quickening, and spiritual enlightenment.”

It doesn't say the fuller revelation might conquer a materialistic empire — it says it IS DESTINED to do it. There are no' if s' and 'maybe's' about it: It says Urantia IS NOT on the very brink.

And it calls it a new epoch. An epoch seems to be the time from one Son to another — a dispensation.

Does that mean that we're soon to have another Son? Maybe a Magisterial Son? Many things seem to point that way.

On <a id="a79_3"></a>[UB 99:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p1_3) the Book states: “Urantia society can never hope to settle down as in ages past. The social ship has steamed out of the sheltered bays of established tradition and has begun its cruise upon the high seas of evolutionary destiny.” And up above that it says: “Mankind is on the march toward a new and unrevealed planetary destiny.” <a id="a79_375"></a>[UB 99:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p1_1)

On <a id="a81_3"></a>[UB 114:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p4_4) we read: “A Most High observer is empowered, at his discretion, to seize the planetary government in times of grave planetary crises, and it is of record that this has happened thirty-three times in the history of Urantia.” (Pages <a id="a81_278"></a>[UB 43:5.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p5_17) and <a id="a81_326"></a>[UB 175:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/175#p1_8) seem to tell us two of those times.)

And then on <a id="a83_12"></a>[UB 134:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p5_1) it tells us that the evolution of our political sovereignty is NOW in a CRITICAL stage. And on <a id="a83_151"></a>[UB 134:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p5_3) it reminds us that “Some day civil rulers will learn that the Most Highs rule in the kingdoms of men” — not the kingdom of GOD — but of MEN.

So it seems that exciting times are even now at our doorstep. We haven't yet had a Magisterial Son. On page 594 it tells us that when a Paradise Avonal comes on a first magisterial mission he ALWAYS is incarnated. He's not born as a babe like a Bestowal Son, but maybe just appears like Machiventa Melchizedek did.

It's fun to speculate how and where such a Son would appear. MAYBE IN THE UNITED NATIONS BUILDING ?

In this chapter he is mentioned as one of the four and twenty counselors of the Urantia advisory council, which has its headquarters on Jerusem, the capital of our local system Satania.

## Dear readers of 6-0-6

At our last conference in Sydney we were discussing and agreed upon the setting up of some form of association. Following discussions among Urantia Book readers about the need for some kind of organization in Australia there have been several ideas canvassed. Some point out that there is no real need for any such organization and that forming one would expose the Australian readership to the danger of cultism and organizational politics. On the other hand others point to the advantages of having a single Australian body of some kind to deal with the Urantian Foundation, to co-ordinate book distribution and to take charge of finances. If we form some sort of association, we should bear in mind that membership of this association should not be confused with the spiritual Brotherhood of which _the Urantia Book_ speaks. The spiritual brotherhood as we know is made up of all believers wherever they may be and transcends all human institutions. Our association should only be a human organization established to foster the spread of _the Urantia Book_ teachings.

We here in Australia who believe in _the Urantia Book_ should see ourselves as a part of the planetary movement and in doing so we should identify ourselves with the goals and aims that the Urantia Brotherhood and Foundation espouse:

1. We want to keep _the Urantia Book_ in print perpetually.
2. We want to protect the integrity of the book and trade mark and service symbols.
3. We want to encourage and publish acceptable translations of the book.
4. We want to disseminate the book throughout the world.
5. We want to bring believers together, help them start study groups.
6. We want the mission to succeed.

These are the fundamental goals of the Foundation and Brotherhood. Therefore we propose that in forming our association, we should have a direct link with the Urantia Brotherhood. Our view is that whatever form of organization we set up, it should have rules clearly linking its function with _the Urantia Book_ and safeguards against the organization being captured by zealots. One way to achieve these aims is to require that members of our association must all be credited members at large of the Urantia Brotherhood. For serious students of the book it is not difficult to achieve this status. To become a member at large of the Urantia Brotherhood is to take a pledge to identify with the aims and purposes. One must have read _the Urantia Book_ in its entirety at least once and must be recommended by a general councillor or field representative as well as one other Brotherhood member. There are already a number of members at large in Australia and this procedure can be accomplished by correspondence. This would help to insure that the association remained responsible and devoted to its primary aim while at the same time being able to accommodate anyone sufficiently interested in _the Urantia Book_ to become a member. In this way it may be possible to reap the benefits of organization while safeguarding ourselves, to some extent, from the worst of the pitfalls. We feel that this is a concrete proposal and would ask all Urantia Book readers to think about it carefully and we encourage them to form other proposals. Possibly at the next annual conference of Urantia Book readers we could put forth our proposals and come to some form of democratic agreement on the one to adopt. Some of the benefits of forming an association, when in these early stages, is to have a centralised body that could keep us in touch with the outworkings and progress of the Urantia movement which would be beneficial to readers — a body which can implement our common goals.

We look forward to hearing your replies.

## The Cult Of Cultural Cultivation

The recent emergence of Melbourne as a culturally conscious universe growth-centre, sporting three regular Urantia study groups, free of the American spirit culture as well as from the rest of Urantia's tradition-bound theology, has, for me, cast a new light of understanding on the fifth epochal dispensation — the Urantia Papers.

By being able to compare _all_ Urantian cultures independently, I am more assured than ever of a loving universe culture; a culture that is evolving and wrestling to establish the brotherhood of man instead of the competitive philosophy of 'survival of the fittest'.

For new readers from Melbourne who are free of the cultural conditioning of national chauvinism and political indecisiveness, and who have no prior experience of _the Urantia Book_, I am sure the spiritually healthy condition to achieve is an uninhibited and progressive confrontation between their own mind and universe reality, as well as a sincere questioning of all cultural meanings and values.

I mean, putting it all on the line to receive God.

To achieve and maintain this uniquely fearless attitude towards Urantian cultural isolation people must be both nationally and culturally 'de-bunched' from a philosophy of survival of the fittest, and from baseness which is promoted in every culture by animal emotion and immoral motivation.

Competition must surely become co-operation with personal religious experience. This would enable those whom the Master described as “poor in spirit” to respect their own rich capacity for experiencing the truth.

Conscious personal religious experience is a condition of the normal mind; this insures that the Urantia revelation achieves a healthy growing start in new reader's minds.

<p style="text-align:center;">
INTERNATIONAL MEETING FOR<br>
THE URANTIA BOOK READERS<br>
In France<br>
<br>
from the 3rd to the 11th of August 1986<br>
</p>

> «In the experience of finding the Father in heaven you discover that all men are your brothers, and does it seem strange that one should enjoy the exhilaration of meeting a newly discovered brother ? To become acquainted with one's brothers and sisters, to know their problems and to learn to love them, is the supreme experience of living.» (<a id="a209_345"></a>[UB 130:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p2_6))

This answer of Jesus to Ganid sums up in itself the motive in his contacts with truth seekers. It definitely proves the importance Jesus attached to personal relationship qualities between men.

In that state of mind, the C.E.R.D.H. organizes a meeting-from the 3rd to the 11th of August 1986for readers coming from the U.S.A., Canada, Mexico, Oceania, and Europe.

The aim of that meeting is to allow to any reader willing to enter into relationship with readers coming from other cultures and speaking other languages, to share ideas and meanings, to build a friendship network outside his country frontiers and to live for a week “the supreme experience of living.”

We point out that this event is a“ meeting” in the true meaning of that word, during which every one brings in, the best he has and receives the best the others have. We propose to share ideas, but above all to share the spiritual food outcoming from the love of every one.

This meeting will take place in the castle of Montvillargenne, close by Chantilly, in a natural setting,about 40 Kms north of Paris.
