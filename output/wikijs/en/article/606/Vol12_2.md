## “Thought For The Month” 

> “_Reason is the proof of science, faith the proof of religion, logic the proof of philosophy, but revelation is validated only by human experience._” ([UB 101:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p2_8))

## Six-O-Six Review

_As readers of Six-O-Six may have noticed, over the past few issues the range of articles has covered a broader scope than previously. Some agree with this, and some don't. My co-editor, Neil Francey, disagrees and wrote his thoughts down as follows:_

“A publication representing readers of _The URANTIA Book_ is offered enormous scope for content. The explicit nature of that book's pronouncements however, further implies that constraints may also be imposed. A well-balanced mix of opposing points of view on a wide variety of issues with an even-handed editorial approach has come to be the expectation of readers of this journal.”

“It appears that Six-0-Six has in recent issues weighted its articles and editorial comments to a particular interest group and away from a strict URANTIA Book discipline. Readers are now having to address a new direction. Is this publication continuing to assist readers evaluate new ideas providing greater insights and understanding? Is it meeting changing needs? As a result, is Six-0-Six enjoying and increasing appreciation by readers or is it becoming too general?”

### Congratulations Six-0-Six

I congratulate you on having the courage to print Six-0-Six's recent editions containing some challenging articles. The second last paragraph of Madeline's article “We're Talking About Attitudes”:

“... But I would like to thank everyone for their responses. I admire you all for speaking up for your beliefs and your great loyalty towards the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_. As long as we keep discussing our viewpoints without anyone getting upset, we've got a healthy situation ...” allows someone to share ideas without another feeling attacked.

Other articles from Sananda have been around for some time. In the early 1970's I regularly received newsletters from the Planetary Center of Light and various other groups on other continents.

Benjamin Creme (United Kingdom) was in Melbourne during January 1991 . For the past 15 years he has been talking about the return of the Christ energy, “the Age of Maitreya”.

There are numerous groups with channelled messages from various celestial beings and also from many not so celestial beings.

The coming years are likely to spawn many more messages through different mediums, requiring each person to test their own truth and be open in their attitude, sharing life with others' opinions and cultural differences.

Stimulating also was the article “A Reincarnation Explanation” by Carol Davidson, reprinted from THE CIRCLES, Winter 1991.

“... mind intellect systems are used over and over, but have no vitality outside of human beings. ... I am using a mind intellect system which was used by individuals who lived prior to me.”

I too found many discrepancies with the theory of reincarnation. Twenty years ago however I read many books on Buddhism, Theosophy, Alice Bailey etc. and the reincarnation aspect explained the discrepancies that existed in my Christian upbringing. Over the past few years I've been faced with putting aside belief structures and theories and admitting there is just so much that my intellect does not comprehend and it's OK not to have a pigeon hole or a handle to hang on to. Ten or twenty years ago my intellect could not embrace the message by Carol's angel. Now however after many years working with computers and recently programming with UNIX and computer language, my consciousness can embrace her angel's description and it opens up many insights.

Thank you, Six-0-Six.

**Ian Esmore, Melbourne**

### “The Light Body”

I thank you for offering me the opportunity to listen to and assess the content of the various tapes mentioned in the last issue of Six-0-Six (I do not refer to the Elijah the Third tapes, which I have not heard).

I was particularly impressed with “The Light Body” tape and found myself playing it over and over again and the more I listened, the more convinced I became of the truth of its message. Maybe I am being misguided or gullible, but I can see no great harm arising from the acceptance of these beliefs as truth other than perhaps one of disappointment if they fail to be true.

If, as _The URANTIA Book_ states, that our planet Earth at some time in the future is to be restored to the spiritual circuits and broadcasts of the realm and has already a circuit and divisional headquarters of Archangels ([UB 114:7.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_16)) on the planet, then surely it's not too improbable or far-fetched to believe in the messages (recorded on tape) that earth's vibratory frequencies are at present being upstepped to higher vibratory frequencies in order to take us into the higher fourth dimension. We have definitely been told that this will take place at some stage in our evolutionary development. So why not now?

If these messages do prove to be revelatory, then we must now be approaching the “Promise of the Ages” — the time of the “Golden Age” — or as _The URANTIA Book_ refers to it, the era of “Light and Life”.

My very special thanks to you, Madeline, for giving me the chance to listen to these tapes.

**Nancy Dempster, Melbourne**

_I would like to correct an error I made in the last issue of Six-0-Six. “The Light Body” tape is Sananda's personal experience and is NOT as previously mentioned material from “The Keys Of Enoch”._

### In Defence Of UB Fundamentalism

Fair go, Madeline! You've left the rails. Kathleen Swadling and Robert Crickett don't have closed minds. It's just that those of us who have experienced “the end of the world” a few times know that we don't really need to listen to the E-3 tapes to have a fair idea of what's in them. I haven't actually taken a count of the number of groups currently prophesying the imminent end of the world, but if it's any less than fifty I'd be surprised. It's quite impossible to give detailed attention to them all. I've examined enough of them to be able to assert with confidence that although they're all different, they're all the same too!

Robert's reasoned analysis and Kathleen's cry of indignation were both right on target. Many of us who believe _The URANTIA Book_ to be what it claims to be have lived through episodes of breathless expectancy where we look to direct superhuman involvement in the world's affairs to solve a 'crisis', or extract us from a mess of our own making. It's heady stuff. It makes us feel so **significant**. But disappointment has taught us to be wary of such excitement, and to heed the warnings which the book itself contains, about human proclivity for self-deception. The whole point about _The URANTIA Book_ is that it pointedly eschews such dramatic predictions and repeatedly warns us about the mistakes we make by allowing ourselves to be excited by the expectation of paranormal events.

_The URANTIA Book_ steels us for the long haul, the slow evolution of mankind to the point where we can co-operate intelligently with the celestial administrators. And this is to be achieved by uplifting ordinary everyday life through increasing consciousness of God.

Millenarianism always increases as a century draws to an end, and the end of the 20th Century is, after all, also the end of the second millennium. There are bound to be many weird and dramatic notions and fancies put about over the next nine years.

Let's not be distracted by them.

**William Wentworth, Towamba, N.S.W.**

_I would first like to reply to the comment made in your personal note to me in relation to this article: 'You won't like it". You should know me better than that, William! I enjoy having a discussion between loyal friends, which I know we are. And I intend to continue with it if you allow me to 'hit a few more nails on the head' as one reader called it._

_I think any discerning reader would by now have recognized that this controversy is not about “the end of the world”, or about E-3 or about the Graceland Tapes, they were just catalysts. This is about PREJUDICE and INTOLERANCE. As one reader wrote to me recently “too many readers are turning _The URANTIA Book_ into a new religion”._

_Don't you think that the Master is not only looking for people who can study and interpret _The URANTIA Book_, but when it comes to the crunch bring it into practice by having love and respect for their fellow men and his/her religious experiences? If someone wanted to sow the seeds of dissension among us it would not be our belief systems that would pull us through, but those much talked about fruits of the spirit. Are we to become hollow vessels or living branches on the vine?_

_I have tried to avoid becoming personal, but since you've brought it up, yes, I've left the rails. It happened when as a 17 year old girl. I left my Catholic parental home. My 88 year old mother is still concerned about it and wonders if I will ever make it to her heaven. But I know that in the many Mansions of our Father's House there is room for ALL. And I am not afraid to stand by my previous statement that I do not want to become a URANTIA Book fundamentalist. (I feel I have explained myself well enough in the last issue what I mean by that.) My understanding of the section in _The URANTIA Book_ on the Spirit of Truth is that the book itself teaches against the very idea of fundamentalism! Not only do I see myself as an Urantian, but as a member of a vast cosmic family._

### Concerned

We in the Auckland study group have become increasingly concerned about the recent articles in Six-OSix on channelling, and the editorial responses to letters and articles on this subject.

We wish to make it publicly known that we do not support this trend. We have enjoyed receiving the Six-OSix in the past because we found it informative and inspirational. However, recent issues seem to indicate that the aims of the publication are no longer to “promote international goodwill and understanding between readers of _The URANTIA Book_”, as stated.

We hope that future issues of the magazine will return to these objectives.

For Auckland Urantia Book Study Group...

**Marion Steward, Auckland, New Zealand**

_Dear friends across the Tasman,_

_I do understand your concern. We are living in times of great changes all over the planet which can cause confusion. However, the important thing to remember in all this is that we are growing TOGETHER and that we respect the God in each and every one of us._

_You may find it helpful to read on [UB 159:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p2_1) under the section “The Strange Preacher” what Jesus said to John about these things and what his attitude was._

_Can you also not see that had it not been for a 'channel' we would not be sitting here talking to each other for there would be no URANTIA Book and no Six-O-Six?_

_That the Six-O-Six is dedicated to promoting international goodwill and understanding between readers of _The URANTIA Book_ is undoubtedly true, but that doesn't exclude anyone._

_These things are happening to URANTIA Book readers and non-URANTIA Book readers alike and they want to share their experiences with us. Who am I to deny them that right?_

_Doesn't _The URANTIA Book_ tell us:_

> “_While your religion is a matter of personal experience, it is most important that you should be exposed to the knowledge of a vast number of other religious experiences (the diverse interpretations of other and diverse mortals) to the end that you may prevent your religious life from becoming egocentric — circumscribed, selfish, and unsocial._” ([UB 103:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p1_3))

_Do I accept everything they are saying? Nol But God gave me three wonderful gifts to check it out with. The gift from the Father — the Thought Adjuster, the gift from the Son — the Spirit of Truth, and the gift from the Spirit — the Adjutant Mind Spirits._

_One of the urgent ‘messages’ that seems to be coming through nearly every ‘channel’ is the need for us to meditate daily and with a group weekly. I think ‘channel’ or no ‘channel’ that is darn good advice!_

_How many of us URANTIA Book readers can honestly say that we spend at least 15 to 20 minutes a day, every day, just doing that?_

_That you publicly not want to be seen associated with the other New Zealand group in Hamilton has been noted._

_From the reactions I have received to the articles and editorial responses you are referring to I know that some people love them some people hate them and others are sitting on the fence, watching which way the chips are going to fall._

_But when I read through the stack of letters I find that the positive reactions far outweigh the negative ones._

_As they say — “You can't please ALL the people ALL the time.”_

_We all have a right to express our opinion and that includes the editor I hope._

_In this issue we have tried to come up with a solution that should keep everyone happy._

_Editor_

### The Number Of Our Planet

I highly commend the editor for her courage to publish her article in the last Six-0-Six — “We're Talking About Attitudes” — and also for publishing some of the messages we are now receiving from various sources. She has obviously recognized that the number 6-0-6 is the number of our planet and not a code number for _The URANTIA Book_. That is the reason there should be no restrictions on the publishing of messages relating to this planet. What could be more important in this point of time than the survival of Urantia?

**Willi Summers, Perth**

### The Six Commandments

We all know the Ten Commandments. But here are the six for the future of this planet. I found them in a book called “Cosmic Revelation”, by Ann Valentin and Virginia Essene.

Planetary Commandments

It is time for you to relate to all that is and to be in harmony with all.

1. Revere the God force in all things.
2. Honour the Universe and all created matter in it.
3. Honour and respect all lifeforms — not just human, here and beyond Earth.
4. Honour your physical planet.
5. Honour the space around your planet and beyond.
6. Put no destructive devices in space.

**Loui de Keizer, Melbourne**

### Christ In You

“Christ in you, the Hope of Glory” has been picking and pecking, trying to pick His way out of materialism, out of the shell of mortal limitation, that you might hatch out, a Child of the Living God. It is indeed wonderful! The Seed-Idea of Life has been implanted in the Soil of your Souls. If you will bring your bodies into subjection, you will be going through that process which typifies the incubating process, and after a while the CHRIST will develop in you.

**Contributed by Leith Luckett, Melbourne**

### No More Books!

Dear Fellow URANTIA Book Reader,

Thank you for ordering URANTIA Books from the Good Cheer Press. I sadly inform you that Good Cheer Press, along with every other URANTIA Book distributor, secular and non-secular, can no longer buy URANTIA Books. URANTIA Foundation has shut off the supply of URANTIA Books to bookstore distributors and mail-order houses across the land. The major distributors have been told _The URANTIA Book_ is 'out of stock', which means there must be another printing before books will be available, when in reality there are more than 20,000 URANTIA Books in storage at the printer's warehouse. URANTIA Foundation continues to claim they are shipping books to book distributors. We call every distributor twice a week and can assure you URANTIA Foundation has shut off sales.

We do have a few books on hand and will continue to sell them, one to a customer, until they are all gone.

What does the shutdown of _The URANTIA Book_s to book distributors mean to you? Virtually all URANTIA Books sell through distributors. Unless URANTIA Foundation re-opens the book distributor channel, most retail bookstores, all secondary organizations, and Fellowship Societies will no longer have access to URANTIA Books. Availability of _The URANTIA Book_ will evaporate.

What can you do about the situation. I suggest the following actions:

1. Go to your local bookstore and ask for _The URANTIA Book_. The bookstore will attempt to order books from their distributor. Even though the distributor's computer will read, 'out of stock', 'out of print' or 'discontinued', keep piling up the orders from the stores to the distributors. Hopefully this will compel URANTIA Foundation to re-open the book distributor channel.
2. Please keep ordering from The Good Cheer Press. We are here to serve you and will persist until URANTIA. Books flow freely again.
3. If this situation makes you as angry and frustrated as it has me, write one or more of the Trustees and voice your opposition to their heart-breaking actions.
4. Re-commit your efforts to furthering the noble and life gracing teachings of _The URANTIA Book_!

We pray the angels will continue to fortify URANTIA Book believers. In this time when _The URANTIA Book_ is being withheld from new readers and long-time believers, more than ever we need to practice its teachings. We are sorry if we have caused you alarm, but as active readers we believe it to be our duty to inform you of this horrible situation. Jesus told us our work would not be easy but he promised to walk through the waters of adversity with us. If you are feeling discouraged by these latest developments, do not be downcast. This shall pass. As Jesus taught, be of good cheer and have faith that good always wins in the end. The heavenly Father is counting on you to help this Revelation bring love and goodwill to spiritually hungry people worldwide.

In the Spirit,

(Signed by the Director, Good Cheer Press)

**Peggy Anne Douglass, Boulder, Colorado, USA**

_This letter was passed on to me in the past month. It is dated November 1, 1990. I do not know whether this situation still exists. Maybe some of our readers in the USA can enlighten us a bit more on what is happening._

## News And Notes

### Australian Association Formed

After considerable discussion over the years amongst readers of _The URANTIA Book_, we would like to announce that an association of students of _The URANTIA Book_ within Australia has finally been formed. The initial steps of organization have now been completed, the constitution approved and adopted, a small treasury of funds gathered and a committee elected. At present there are members from the Sydney, Canberra, Brisbane and Perth areas. It is our hope that many readers of _The URANTIA Book_ in Australia will seek to support this association.

We have called the association “The Australian Association of Students of _The URANTIA Book_”

(AASUB). It functions under a constitution which ensures democratic procedures and participation on a broad level. It is a non-profit organization. One of the main objectives of our association is to support the steady spread of the revelation through undramatic, everyday means by encouraging local, informal URANTIA Book study groups. Another objective is to encourage the social interaction of readers by supporting an annual conference, a national newsletter and to facilitate contact between readers.

AASUB is purely an Australian entity, founded by Australian readers for Australia and therefore functions autonomously, independent of any other organization. Naturally, however, individuals within the association are free to associate with any other organization if they wish.

It is the intention of AASUB to assist the dissemination of _The URANTIA Book_ into Australia without encumbering it with church, temple or other spiritual institutions. Although AASUB will be made up of individual religionists, it is not our intention to create in any form or manner a religious institution of any kind.

We therefore have pleasure in inviting readers of _The URANTIA Book_ to enquire about membership in AASUB. A copy of the constitution and an application for membership are available upon request. Prerequisites for membership are that the applicant has read _The URANTIA Book_ in its entirety and is sponsored by two existing members of AASUB.

For further information please contact:

Kathleen Swadling, Secretary AASUB
7 Walsh St., North Narrabeen, NSW. 2101
Phone (02) 913-7893

William Wentworth — President
Kathleen Swadling — Secretary
Alex King — Treasurer

Founding Members: Michael Nielsen, Neil Francey, Trevor Swadling, Vern Verass, Sue Webb, Peter Webb, Nigel Nunn.

## Some Personal Thoughts

I discovered _The URANTIA Book_ in 1977 while visiting a friend in Phoenix, Arizona. The Book changed my life. Until then God could not contact me through any channel that I knew. _The URANTIA Book_ became the channel for me to comprehend my relationship (sonship) with Him.

I have read the blue Book in its entirety once and parts of it many, many times. Over the years I have formed simple explanations of Urantia concepts that I only partly understand. I shall offer them to you — not as an interpretation of the truth within the Book — but as the image within my mind that I receive as I try to understand the Urantia message.

I accept that God always existed. Being a creature of time and space, the statement to my mind is illogical and cannot be true. However, it is my will to do the will of God and I believe it is His will that I accept that statement.

I believe that the physical things I can see and comprehend and the things I reason to exist and cannot comprehend can be called 'existence'. I divide 'existence' into God provoked (occupied) and emptiness. In one sentence: in emptiness nothing works — there are no senses, no will. God's occupied space is like the space inside a balloon which is in a room. Everything outside the balloon is emptiness. God is blowing up the balloon but the boundaries of the room are infinity.

If you will permit me to give God a human attribute, let me say GOD IS LONELY. God can make perfect human beings — as men can make robots. We can program a robot to say it loves us like God can create people to make them love him. For the statement to be true the robot, or created human, must have a free will in order to give truth to the statement. The ability to say “No, I don't love you” must also be programmed into a subject with the free will to say it. Without free will any statement is a tape being played.

I believe that God is in the process of surrounding himself with creatures (or whatever descriptive word you use) that keep him company of their own free will.

On Urantia the pre-creature is a human being who possesses a free will and a Thought Adjuster. The human free will and the Thought Adjuster create a soul. The merging of a Thought Adjuster and a soul can be likened to 'human conception'.

Michael, a creator son, was allowed to create precreatures such as humans. Lucifer, another order of sons, rebelled by saying that Michael's creatures were flawed and his plan, as designed and activated by Michael, needed to be changed. He actively resisted Michael's plan.

Michael's bestowal on earth was Michael's proof that a human being could achieve perfection. He came to Urantia as Jesus, allowed Lucifer to attempt to corrupt the human Jesus and Lucifer failed, thus proving to the Ancient of Days that Michael's plan works. Michael was granted full authority to proceed with his mission in Nebadon.

God invited man to join him in eternity. A part of God, the Mystery Monitor, is within most of our minds. It is our free will to accept or decline immortality. The bridge from doubt to belief in God is not built on fact or proof, it is built on faith. Once you cross the bridge of faith to the solid ground of belief one finds the 'proof' one desires.

We bring to God the gift of our uniqueness — for nowhere else in creation does the individual 'us' exist, or ever existed or ever will exist again. The reincarnation that we 'feel' has happened to us, actually means we 'feel' the past experience of our Thought Adjuster.

Some day, for many of us, shall come the time when we stand on the shores of Paradise — me, the unique individual who has emerged and mixed with the piece of God and thus are an eternal part of God, made so by our free will.

**Dealing with others**

When you are committed to freely doing the will of God you must remember, as you deal with people, that they too are the children of God and resting within each of them is a personal piece of God.

Therefore it is prudent to deal fairly with his children, for he will certainly remember any action to the contrary. 

**Prayer**

I prayed more during the part of my life when I was searching for how God could find me. Now that he has revealed himself to me through _The URANTIA Book_ I have less need for prayer. My prayers are divided. I feel the need to express my gratitude for being accepted as a son of God. I'm thankful for the Spirit of Truth which made my faith strong enough to truly believe in God. The teaching of _The URANTIA Book_ permits me to find my place in God's infinite scheme — and I am contented. I accept that Urantia is peopled by creatures of free will who, of their own free will, may choose to do me harm. I must suffer that injustice. At times I am a child who asks for favours from a Father. I believe that my Father in heaven will grant me the answer to my prayer if the granting is in my best interest.

**Who is God?**

God is everything. He is everything that is within the ‘balloon’. God gives direction to his reality and that 'brain' is located in Paradise. He has created an “Eternal Son” as his face. When it is our destiny to 'see' God in Paradise, we shall gaze upon the form of the Eternal Son and see the face of God.

These are some of my thoughts on _The URANTIA Book_ which may be of interest to you and your readers.

**Edward Kendrex, Perth**

## Discussion On The Progress Of The Revelation

As a devotee to the teachings contained in _The URANTIA Book_, I am concerned about the degree of success this revelation will have in bringing about the spiritual regeneration of mankind. I am also very much aware that the degree of success is largely dependent on what the readership does with the revelation. We see the patterns of how the past epochal revelations fitted in with the evolutionary progress of mankind as we study the URANTIA Papers. Those patterns show that a portion of the existing population received a concentrated dose of the truth, then went into the world to live it, preach it or do whatever they felt inclined to do and these actions determined the flavour or the course for the new epochal era. Evolution eventually took over and truth fragmented into cultural interpretations and societies progressed accordingly. Once given, it was up to man to determine the course. When mankind was ready, another revelation was given to serve as an upstep, then evolution continued on. It is slow, subtle and gradual. We are the recipients of the fifth concentrated dose of truth. What are we to do with it?

As individuals, our lives may have been transformed to varying degrees, we attempt to live up to the teaching as best as we can, we interact with our fellow man in family, social or working circles. Each individual unconsciously bears his own fruit according to his or her level of understanding, development, maturity and sincerity. It happens slowly and naturally.

## Living With Our Cosmic Father

How often in reflection I advise
Myself: “Your Father God did make the skies”
His velvet black he flung across the heavens
And organized the universe by sevens.

The many types of being blessed with life 
Throughout extensions seeming without end 
Are cosmic citizens, reducing strife, 
Discovering each person is a friend.

Throughout the asst dark kingdoms of the skies 
The never ceasing pulse of perfect power 
Sustains the universe, though no one spies 
The Maker in creation who, each hour,

## Is God A He Or A She?

I had not realized that there was some discussion on God's sex until a few months ago, when I stumbled into a situation which I try very hard to avoid — getting into theological discussions on Our Father. From past experience I have discovered that the majority of folks who want to 'sort me out' on who God is, hold their views both strongly, blindly, irrationally and determinedly, so I switch the subject to a safer topic such as the weather.

I missed my cue, when a rather inebriated man censured me on my concept of God as a person — having explained HE was a force, to which I asked why he had just given a gender identity to a force, a puzzling use of the English language, acceptable in French, but inappropriate in our nominated communication medium when he rejoined, “And what about your sexuality?”

Now I must admit I was temporarily taken aback. I had just been in the throes of interjecting with a request for a weather report in his geographic area, and he had taken the initiative, or so I thought, to switch the subject from religion to sex, a rather surprising change, but a subject which I am partial to discussing. I was not quite sure whether he meant me to recount the last time I went to bed with someone; if I was feeling insecure as a woman; inadequate or whatever, and so answered his question with one of my own for further elaboration, to which he rejoined:

## Walk In Harmony

I lead My Loved Ones by many paths. Do not subscribe to a confusion; neither confuse the mind of another by trying to see all things alike. Much strength and time are lost thereby. You, and other of My children, have found a pathway to my presence. What matter if it is a different path or if opinions vary as to the exact way to reach the goal? The thing of importance is that you each, in your own way, keep constant contact with Me. Why murmur among yourselves about the outer symbols along the roadside? Yea, you are like the disciples of old who while walking by the side of the Lord often stopped to argue as to the meaning of it all Be done with such foolishness! I have much work for My children to do together. Shall it be disturbed because as foolish children, you do not al ways think alike? 

If your hearts are filled with a pure, high love for Me, that is all I require. Cannot you trust Me to lead you to the high point of attainment and service? All these minor things of the outer semblance of worship natter so little. I dwell in the heart of each, and have no fear that I shall not be able to care for Mine Own! And so, go on, helping each other, loving each other; and know that a day shall dawn when I come to you and ask, “Who say ye that AM” And you shall all go on in My Service, of one mind and one accord.

**From the writings of Eva Bell Werber**

## An Open Letter To The Community Of Urantia Book Readers

August 1990

Brothers and Sisters in Christ:

My name is Paul Michael Waterman and I am writing this open letter to you all to recount a series of extraordinary events which I shared with a circle of associates in the period between 1981 and 1983.

Since 1983, I have stewarded certain aspects of the story that I shall unfold upon these pages. More recent events in your respective organizations, as well as the counsel of friends close to me, have led me to the decision to dispatch this document for your collective consideration.

As prologue, I should tell you that I have been a student of _The URANTIA Book_ since 1975.
