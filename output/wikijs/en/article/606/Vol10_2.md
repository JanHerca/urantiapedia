## A Note From 6-0-6 

While some of us are still reminiscing about the Robertson ' 88 South Pacific meeting, the Sunshine Coast Study Group in Queensland is already busy planning for the next annual meeting for URANTIA Book readers.

This time they have called it just simply “Noosa ' 89 ”, for in fact that's where it will be held, in the historic Halse Lodge Guest House in Noosa, from Thursday Oct.5th to Sunday Oct. 8th 1989.

The theme of this meeting is based on a paragraph on page 1726 in _The URANTIA Book_: “Let me emphatically state this eternal truth: If you, by truth co-ordination, learn to exemplify in your lives this beautiful wholeness of righteousness, your fellow men will then seek after you that they may gain what you have so acquired. The measure wherewith truth seekers are drawn to you represents the measure of your truth endowment, your righteousness. The extent to which you have to go with your message to the people is, in a way, the measure of your failure to live the whole or righteous life, the truth co-ordinated life.”

Invitations will be sent shortly to all our Australian 6-0-6 readers, but of course if any of our overseas readers are planning a trip to the Land Down Under, they will be most welcome.

Registrations should be in by the 31st May 1989 and should be sent to:

## From Our Mailbag

Re: How Many Mortals Survive

Perhaps I will be called the emotional, irrational optimist but we live today with anticipation for tomorrow and consequently statistics of the past are of no relevance to man's survival now or in the future. Statistical results, even if soundly based, are of pure historic relevance and are not necessarily a reflection of today's actual situation.

I accept the effort Trevor Swadling put into arriving at the figure of survival based on certain facts as exemplified in _The URANTIA Book_, but wish to point out that God's Plan is what is of relevance, and His Plan is for the survival of every unique, never to be duplicated — either in identity or in contribution to the experience of God the Supreme — personality. And there is one great, big university, created by God, for the growth of us mortals. I would further suspect, if the universities of the spiritual world were only turning out 28 graduates, there would be a massive revamping of mansion world techniques.

Facts and realities which make the taking of any statistics on past survival rates impossible are:

1. We do not know how many sleeping survivors there are.
2. We do not know the average rate of progress through to mansion worlds — if there is such an average calculable.
3. We do not know how many ascenders there are out on student excursions from Jerusem at any point of time.

But there is one thing we have not a shred of doubt about: Our Father would have been fully and completely aware of what was happening in Nebadon right from the time of the first evil and sinful thought taking substance inside lucifer, and our Father, who has the power to act independently of any other being, could therefore have organised the stage where upon Lucifer would play his hand, ensuring , only those personalities having lessons to learn were there.

We are told that things can happen in the local and superuniverse which show the direct hand of God, and the Lucifer rebellion, I verily believe, our Father in true and perfect love, would have overviewed in an all wise and intelligent manner.

Remember Emanuel's promise to Michael prior to his incarnation on Urantia? “Rebellion, such as has three times occurred in Nebadon, cannot occur during your absence from Salvington on this bestowal. For the period of the Urantia bestowal, the Ancients of Days have decreed that rebellion in Nebadon shall be invested with the automatic seed of its on annihilation.” ([UB 120:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p1_6))

The danger with statistics is that we can tend to regard than as truly reflecting a situation, in my own professional capacity, I have been required at times to arrive at a statistical result — and depending upon what variable I want to include or ignore, could happily come up with any answer my client sought, or I subjectively (while fooling myself it was objective) thought. For the Brotherhood of Man to get moving on Urantia we must look at every single person as a survivor. We must pray for Urantia statistics to be 1008. We must recognise that evil is only a time-space phenomenon. It is not a spiritual reality.

Every single person of normal mind has a Thought Adjuster; is a unique personality — a child of God— of ten torn very badly between serving two masters — with a master of materialism appearing to have the upper hand.

As a final comment, if any statistic has to be embraced by us, let it be Dr. Sadler Jr.'s — less than 1 don't opt for survival.

## Dear Six-0-Six,

I'm writing in the hope that you will print an announcement in your newsletter about a project I've been working on.

I'm trying to put together a pen pal project, connecting readers from all over the world, for the purpose of sharing ideas, projects, questions, concerns, etc. with general support for the work we're all trying to accomplish.

I feel that newsletters have their place but that more can be done on a one-to-one basis to foster understanding and good will among readers from different countries and to help those unable to attend a study group.

Anyone interested can write to for more information. I'll respond to anyone who writes. It would be wonderful to hear what you're doing in Australia.

## Brotherhood Of Man Library In Australia

Ken Glasziou and Joe Hausler in Queensland have been attempting to start an Australian Branch of the Brotherhood of Man Library for URANTIA Book readers. The purpose of the library is simply to collect material that has been written about _The URANTIA Book_, and to make that material more available to all readers. Ken is expecting a new set of computer disks from George Sammis in the U.S. Which are for a new computer system. We hope to bring you more information about this very worthwhile program in our next 6-0-6.

## Prospects For A World Religion

I am unqualified to pass judgment on the prospects for the development of evolutionary religion in individual countries, and I am reluctant to generalize on the subject. I would prefer to draw my conclusions from the Book itself. But we need only look around us to see that a world religion is a long way off. In fact The URANIIA Book says [UB 71:8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p8) in ‘The Character of Statehood’ in the Paper on 'Development of the State" that the evolution of a world religion is the 12th and last stage in the evolution of statehood:

> “The evolution of a world religion, which will presage the entrance of the planet upon the earlier phases of settlement in light and life.” [UB 71:8.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/71#p8_14)

But elsewhere the Book hints at something more imminent, the seeds of which are at least being sown in our own 1ifetimes. In fact [UB 195:9.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_5) ‘Christianity’s Problem’, in the Paper “After Pentecost” it says:

> “The modern age will refuse to accept a religion which is inconsistent with facts and out of harmony with its highest conceptions of truth, beauty, and goodness. The hour is striking for a rediscovery of the true and original foundations of present-day distorted and compromised Christianity — the real life and teachings of Jesus.”

## Brotherhood Of Man

We are advised in _The URANTIA Book_ that there are sources of energy still undiscovered by us and one of these, I believe, is the energy force of love. The power of potent prayer, generated in true altruistic desire for the progress of our planet toward “light and Life” has the capacity to generate a power field far beyond our material mind-thought influential sphere.

Love is the force to which the universe responds. Science is starting to recognise the potency of the “collective consciousness” and the Brotherhood of Man will come into being based on the same principles.

_The URANTIA Book_ says: “You cannot truly love your fellows be a mere act of the will. Love is only born of thoroughgoing understanding of your neighbour's motives and sentiments. It is not so important to love all men today as it is that each day you learn to love one more human being. If each day or each week you achieve an understanding of one more of your fellows, and if this is the limit of your ability, then you are certainly socializing and truly spiritualizing your personality. Love is infectious, and when human devotion is intelligent and wise, love is more catching than hate. But only genuine and unselfish love is truly contagious. If each mortal could only become a focus of dynamic affection, this benign virus of love would soon pervade the sentimental emotion-stream of humanity to such an extent that all civilization would be encompassed by love, and that would be the realization of the brotherhood of man.” ([UB 100:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p4_6))

## _The Urantia Book_ Possible Signpost For Scientific Research ?

In the paper he presented to the South Pacific meeting in October, Ken Glasziou argued that scientific theory is steadily converging on information revealed in _The URANTIA Book_. Over the last 50 years or so, opinion in many scientific fields has moved much closer to _The URANTIA Book_'s position. Ken's argument is very convincing.

However, a student of _the URANTIA Book_ needs only a very cursory knowledge of science to realize that there are still some major discrepancies.

In geology, for instance, currently accepted views differ widely from _The URANTIA Book_. The regular inundations of the land by the sea are scarcely recognised by contemporary experts, who recognize only irregular and fewer ones.

Similarly, they would query some of the information about ice ages, the movement and break up of continents, and the time scale of various significant events, including the date of the appearance of living organisms.

## Roundtable Discussion

On Saturday February 11th, 1989 the General Council of the URANTIA brotherhood held a roundtable discussion between members of the Council and representatives of various groups established to perform some service or work on behalf of and/or related to _The URANTIA Book_.

Six-0-Six Newsletter also received an invitation, but was unable to attend.

The purpose of the meeting was to improve communication and coordination among all individuals and groups associated with this endeavour to which we are all committed; to begin to develop a plan to insure that we all work to prevent confusion among both non-readers and readers with regard to the existence and purpose of multiple groups, to avoid unnecessary duplication of activities, now and in the future, which may arise from policy and/or timetable differences adopted by URANIIA Brotherhood.

In a letter received after the event, Dave Elders, president of URANTIA Brotherhood expressed:

... “I was left personally with the certainty that the efforts of separate groups such is yours, fully independent of and yet cooperative with URAVIIA Brotherhood, are a vital and important part of the overall mission of those of us in this growing community surrounding the teachings of _the URANTIA Book_.”

“I hope further that your participation in this program clarified for you, as it did for me and I believe for many of my peers on the Council, that whatever strains existed between us in the past were at least honest ones, arising from our collective inexperience with the work associated with revelation on the planet. If we seemed over-protective and control-oriented, I hope you can understand that it was only because we take our responsibilities seriously and have not yet learned how to clearly communicate our concerns; and, if you appeared to us as sometimes resistant to the style and pace of the Brotherhood organization, we can now appreciate your deep and honest motivation to do in your own way what you can for this work.”"

Lack of space prevents 6-0-6 to publish Dave's letter in its entirety.

The General Council passed this resolution:

“URANTIA Brotherhood, as part of its mission to achieve its organizational goals as outlined in its stated purpose, shall establish and institutionalize a mechanism of communication and facilitation between URANTIA Brotherhood and all associated groups working on behalf of the Fifth Epochal Revelation to the end that mutual support, understanding, education, experience, cooperation, and respectful interaction may take place so that the broader, planetary purposes of our unseen supervisors may be achieved. The Executive Committee is charged with the responsibility of implementing this resolution in an expeditious manner.”
