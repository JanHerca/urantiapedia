## Going International

Given the current rate of growth in book sales in Australia, it is reasonable to expect this increase world wide in English and French speaking countries. It is difficult to forecast a likely alternative. Numbers will demand significant measures to maintain the personal nature of URANTIA Book work.

With numbers comes public attention, and our international status will depend upon our commitment to Jesus' teachings.

## Zeal And Wisdom

I wish to reply to the proposers of the URANTIA Association in Australia, as a zealot interested in spreading the good news of The Revelation.

I feel that zeal in combination with wisdom is the necessary ingredient for the Revelation to progress. I cannot understand that the proposed organization of readers would want to bar this quality. Did Jesus lack zeal, and did he refuse even the overzealous from working with him?

We all must agree that _The URANTIA Book_ Revelation is beginning its public phase of ministry, and I do agree that “good” institutions must evolve from this. The one point that I would emphasize is that we do not become overburdened by centralized structures.

As our local numbers increase, we should become less dependent on The URANTIA Brotherhood. I think it could be better for us to experience all possible pitfalls and gain a collective experiential wisdom, rather than expect an American made Brotherhood to keep us invulnerable. What I am suggesting as a proposal for Australian URANIIA Book Reader-Unity is: localized groups dedicated to Outreach Activities. At the present time I can identify local Study Groups and also the SIX-0-SIX Newsletter as being most successful at this. If one studies trends in the U.S., great progress is being made at these grass roots levels.

The Australian URANTIA Book communities should allow for making mistakes and pitfalls, from which they can grow their om experiential wisdom.

I strongly suggest that The Association let go of timidness and experiment. As The Book says: “The act is ours, the consequences God's”. ([UB 117:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p5_5))

## Introduction To _The Urantia Book_

A 600 word introduction to _The URANTIA BOOK_ Revelation is available for people who want an explanation of what _The URANTIA BOOK_ is and what it means to humankind.

This introduction is printed by The Academy of Artistry \& Thought; a newly formed service which prints literature, produces audio-visual art and encourages dialogue on _The URANTIA BOOK_ Revelation.

For the above introduction, send a self-addressed envelope to:

Academy of Artistry \& Thought, 178 Marine Pde, Cottesloe, W.A. 6011.

## Thought for the Month

“Progress demands development of individuality; mediocrity seeks perpetuation in standardization.” [UB 48:7.29](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_29)

## Commentary On Scientific Statements In _The Urantia Book_

One of our readers in Clifton, Queensland has been collecting odds and ends concerning the scientific content of _the Urantia Book_.for many years. Ken Glasziou has done this more or less in isolation, with no access to libraries, scientific journals, and without the benefit of discussion.

He would like to invite other Urantia Book readers with some kind of science background to join him in an effort to produce a better commentary and also to update continuously. Ken would appreciate criticism and any additions to his first effort and also would like the benefit of discussion. His expertise is in biochemistry and biology and it is a tall order for him to try and make a universal commentary.

Six-0-Six Newsletter will publish a series of Ken's articles over the next few months.

This month's subject:

**Sub-Atomic Physics**

NEXT MONTH: Ken will discuss Planetary Atmospheres, The Earth's Moon and Novas.

## Another Study Group

The formation of study groups is one of the true indicators of the acceptance of _the Urantia Book_ teachings.

So it is pleasing to announce a new study group in Atherton, Queensland. Geoff Harpur has reported three people attend his regular meetings and others are interested and are likely to join during the year. All our good wishes to the far north.

## An Ounce Of Experience

There probably is an English proverb that means the equivalent of: ‘An ounce of experience is better than a pound of theory’, or shall we stay metric and say a gram is better than a kilo?

The whole idea for this article came to me the day a very well-meaning friend rang me and suggested that I might like to listen to a radio program about : ‘How to answer children's questions’.

But it was when she added: ‘They probably mean questions about the facts of life’, that I became rather surprised and a little annoyed. For here was a person who never had any children, suggesting that I, a mother of three sons, the eldest one 25 , was in need of listening to such a program, or that's the way I took it. I finished up thinking what an invaluable thing experience is.

## Spirit Unity, Not Uniformity

An amazing observation I've found since reading _the Urantia Book_ is that it attracts 30 many different types. Many groups attract a certain type of person as it appeals to the way they think, but _the Urantia Book_ appeals to many whose outlook on life and ways of thinking can be entirely different.

I had a minute glimpse of what the Brotherhood of Man could be like at a study group a few months ago. One member held extremely leftist political views and another, rightist views. Both neld firmly to their viewpoints. In the environment of the study group, it became inevitable that political and social discussion arose and each found that on a number of points the other made, they strongly disagreed. Discussion became quite heated. However, both members could recognise one another as brothers in the spirit and agreed to disagree on these matters and returned to the business of stuaying _the Urantia Book_.

If we could only be open to one another in a spiritual sense, knowing that God is Father to us all and not get bogged down in differences of opinion or personality clashes, what a wonderful world it would be.

On [UB 99:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p5_7), we read: “Just as certainly as men share their religious beliefs, they create a religious group of some sort which eventually creates common goals. Someday religionists will get together and actually effect co-operation on the basis of unity of ideals and purposes rather than attempting to do so on the basis of psychological opinions and theological beliefs. Goals rather than creeds should unify religionists”.

It's not what you are, but what you strive to be, that's important and it's not what you think, but what you are, that determines your degree of spiritual unity with your fellows.

## Map of Aussie Readers

The February Newsletter was beaut. Seeing that map and the location of the other Urantia Book readers in relation to my home tom ras very warming. A sense of brotherhood radiated from that map. I found myself wondering how the map affected everybody else, and I concluded that most of us would have felt the same way. 

Please pass on my appreciation to its originator.
