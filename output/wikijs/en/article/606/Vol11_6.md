## A Note From Six-O-Six

With this issue, the last one of 1990, I would like, on behalf of Neil Francey, Tony Rudd and myself, to thank all our readers for their continued support for our newsletter. As I have said before, without you there would not be a Six-O-Six. So please, keep writing to us!

We send our heartfelt feelings of love, peace, joy and goodwill to everyone and look forward to hearing from you again in 1991.

## “Thought For The Month”

> “Simply go forth proclaiming: This is the Kingdom of Heaven — God is your Father and you are his sons, and this good news, if you wholeheartedly believe it, is your eternal salvation.” ([UB 141:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p6_4))

## Warburton Conference 1990

An Australian meeting of URANTIA Book readers was held on Melbourne Cup weekend, Saturday November 3 to Tuesday November 6 . We journeyed to Warburton East, about 80 ~km east of Melbourne, at the foot of the Great Dividing Range.

Springtime weather — three warm sunny days and one fine cloudy day — let us enjoy the charm and amenities of the 12 acre property and the beauty of the whole area. The favoured local attractions seemed to be the fauna sanctuary at Healesville, the Upper Yarra Dam, and the magical short walk through the beautiful rain forest alongside Cement Creek (located about halfway to the summit of Mount Donna Buang).

Forty-seven people participated in the conference, plus three visitors who met old friends and then joined us for the Happy Hour on Monday evening.

## The Right And Left Brain

_Talk given by Les Sheridan at the 1990 Australian Annual Conference for Readers of The URANTIA Book_.

We do not express our true potential. We use but a fraction of our brain. The brain is in two sections, the right and left hemispheres.

THE RIGHT BRAIN is the realm of genius, intuition, visionaries and seers and it is here that contact with a higher degree of universal knowledge is made. It is receptive, and subjective, recording diligently all communications without analysis or discrimination. It is innocent of guile. This is the realm of intuition, inner tuition. The female aspect.

THE LEFT BRAIN is the realm of logic, reason, intellect and choice, and it is here that contact is made through the senses with the outer material world. It is in the left brain that we plan, formulate and adjust continually to survive in this transient material world of changing values, laws and circumstances. It is objective, aggressive and insistent. The male aspect.

## Conference Reflections

I thoroughly enjoyed the happy atmosphere and one ness of Spirit. Reflecting on Christ Jesus, on Urantia, becoming the at-one-ment between God and men.

Restoring relationships.

May we all be one in the brotherhood of men under the one Fatherhood of God.

I love you all.

Loui de Keizer, Melbourne

Jesus said, the Kingdom of Heaven is not of this world. When I remember this I feel I can overcome my own weaknesses.

When my very quiet friend is able to introduce this spiritual value into my mind I know why he is only measured by the sounds of silence.

My nerves were so jangled before this meeting I began to lose faith in finding answers to questions only Jesus could answer.

Jesus looked down and saw this life as only a bridge.

The Supreme Being knows what you need but you must strengthen the things that remain by cooperating instead of competing with your quiet friend.

**Keith Bacon, Melbourne**

## How I Feel

_This beautiful poem was written by Leith during the 1990 Australian Conference._

I'm composed, and full of feeling.
I'm enwrapped in silent healing.
The air flows cool in the Father's mountains.
There isn't much to say
how we spend each pleasant day,
but know, deep down within,
that God's Spark is close to Him.
Our walks of life take different tolls 
of moods, of thoughts, we're all different moulds.
Sometimes we cry for inner peace.
We're glad to have a part, a piece
of Life's adjusting inwardly and outwards.

## A “Truth Junkie”

As usual, since I began expanding my quest for truth with the aid of _The URANTIA Book_ and just attended my second conference, the time together has passed so fulfillingly quickly, with such a delight in events and people sharing a similar basic experience of truth, which we are embracing from all angles of our spiritual intuitive presence and states of America and Australia, that I am no longer surprised by the speed of reply to my questions, especially to questions that I have forgotten to ask whilst at the conference.

All I have to do is to open my eyes and my awareness and my communicating skills with sincere loving trust, and the answer appears there and then, as simple as in the next paragraph of the book, which most of us have so often found while reading. I don't believe that I am such an unique individual who has any special talents or gifts or who might be different to anyone else that is existing on this planet. Apart from certain physical and customary individual characteristics, we are all the same. I only want to share my personal discoveries of truth, not only with you but with as many other people as I can, and to be able to discover ways to communicate these and other messages and to be flexible in the use of the limited medium of language, that it becomes extremely frustrating and especially when you the reader have the choice.

## From Our Mailbox

Dear Six-O-Six,

I enjoyed reading all of the articles and letters about E-3 in the September/October 1990 issue although two of the letters were somewhat illogical, not to mention unfair.

After writing a column and a half making her case, Ann Bendall blows it all by saying, “I have not listened to the tapes but can only assume ...” If I were a computer I would say, “ERROR, ERROR, DOES NOT COMPUTE!” It is tantamount to saying, “I don't know what I'm talking about, but I'm going to write an article about it anyway”. I wonder if it is really too much to expect that one hear the message before one picks up pen and paper to write about it? It would be so much better if one could say, “I've listened to the tapes and evaluated them thoughtfully and I find them at fault because ...” A person could respect that approach.

The letter from Kathleen Swadling, while it contained some wonderful connections from _The URANTIA Book_, also took a beating when she said, “... had no intention of listening to them”.

Great! What is there to fear? (And that seems like it could be the only real problem, doesn't it?) Maybe one will get “brainwashed” by listening to them. Agondonters are those who believe without seeing. This must be something like that. People who don't believe without listening. Oh well, to each his/her own, I guess.

Regarding the article about, “The Answer Book”, a friend of mine called the book store and ordered a copy of _The URANTIA Book_. Several weeks later she got a call that her book was in. She went down to the book store and they handed her “The Tarantula Book”. Special order!

## Coming To A “Final Decision”

_The URANTIA Book_ states:

> “_In the early days of the struggle Lucifer held forth continuously in the planetary amphitheatre. Gabriel conducted an unceasing exposure of the rebel sophistries from his headquarters taken up near at hand. The various personalities present on the sphere who were in doubt as to their attitude would journey back and forth between these discussions until they arrived at a final decision._” ([UB 53:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p5_6))

It is apparent that URANTIA Book readers and prospective URANTIA Book readers are being divided into two camps: those who believe in the gospel of Mr. Pope and those who through some understanding or contrary evidence of their own refute it outright.

My position is that of the latter. I do not believe that Mr. Pope's gospel nor his actions in distributing it world wide compare in the least with Lucifer's rebellion, however, the fact that readers are being provoked into coming to a 'final decision' about his mission and ministry one way or the other deserves the exposure of sincere argument from the opposing perspective. Both perspectives, that of Mr. Pope and that of any opponent to his ideas, are just opinions, nothing more than that. Yet it is from the highest spiritual wisdom contained within each of these opinions that readers and prospective readers in need of reaching their 'final decision' on the matter shall draw. Ultimately, inevitably, and thankfully, it is the domain of each individual to draw their own conclusions and make their own solemn 'final decision'.

## Back-Packing From Melbourne To Sydney

_Supplement to Six-0-Six, VBH 3740, vol 11 No 6, Nov/Dec 1990_

(FEBRUARY — APRIL 1990)

Eight years ago, my life was saved by triple bypass heart surgery.

In February this year I retired — and decided in gratitude to raise money for the National Heart Foundation. I also wanted to encourage people to be physically active after a heart operation — because I believe that a little bit of attention to the food we eat, combined with suitable physical activity is the best assurance for a healthy life.

So my idea was born; to walk back packing, from Melbourne to Sydney, a distance of approximately 1200 ~km.

I took the train from Sydney to Melbourne, with my pack, all keen to start the walk. I was lucky to have a son in Melbourne, who gave me lodging for a couple of days and help with the final preparations.

The weather and the pack were going to be my greatest problems. Many people asked "What do you carry in your pack? So, before proceeding — let's take a look.
