## A note from the 6-0-6 Team

We like to welcome all our readers back after our holiday season. With our Pacific meeting for URANTIA Book readers less than nine months away the planning and organizing are well on their way.

Everyone is invited to send in suggestions for the programme and we are also interested in hearing from any people with musical talents for possible contributions in that field.

For all the procrastinators among us, who have not yet returned their reply slip requesting a registration form, we'll include one with this issue. If you are a member of that tribe, maybe you can forsake your principles this time and return it straight away. That way you can't forget.

We like to stress that registrations must be returned by the 18th March. Why so early, you might ask.

It is necessary to book our accommodation at Ranelagh House, Robertson by April. If we can book for 80 people or more, we will have the place to ourselves. Otherwise we will share it with other guests.

We are expecting quite a few visitors from other countries. Anyone who has attended the last conference in Sydney will agree that it was indeed a wonderful experience and the next one we hope will be even better. Don't miss this opportunity to meet some of our overseas family, exchange new ideas and make new friends.

This year, 1988, is our ninth year of publication. We want to encourage everyone to keep on writing to us, for without your letters and articles there wouldn't be a Six-0-Six Newsletter.

## “Thought For The Month” 

> “Spiritual development depends, first, on the maintenance of a living spiritual connection with true spiritual forces and, second, on the continuous bearing of spiritual fruit: yielding the ministry to one's fellows of that which has been received from one's spiritual benefactors. Spiritual progress is predicated on intellectual recognition of spiritual poverty coupled with the self-consciousness of perfection-hunger, the desire to know God and be like him, the wholehearted purpose to do the will of the Father in heaven”. _The URANTIA Book_ [UB 100:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p2_1)

## From Our Mailbag

Dear friends in Australia,

I wanted to send the following letter to you too, because it has some information. It is interesting to see how the network starts working. Perhaps it would be a useful idea to keep in touch, for example by sending a page of the latest news once a year — while waiting for our informal network to evolve?

The information concerning your South Pacific Meeting has been in our newsletter. By the way, Berkeley sent it to me too.

Give my greetings to Steven Shanahan. Hope your meeting will be as nice as the one we had in France!

On the basis of received letters or personal friendship the following circular letter was mailed to:

- A.M. Bailey, ACFUA, California, U.S.A.
- John Blogg, URANTIA Book Readers of Amsterdam, Holland Oliver ‘Asana’ Duex, The Synergist, California, U.S.A. Francois Dupont, Belgium
- Berkeley Elliott, Oklahoma, U.S.A.
- Cece Forrester, Chicago, U.S.A.
- David Glass, Inspiration, Texas, U.S.A.
- David Jaquith, The Pennyprickle Press, Oregon, U.S.A.

Dear friends,

During the past few months I have received a couple of letters from different countries as a result of the article in _The URANTIA Book_ Synergist. These letters have been addressed to URANTIA Book readers of Finland and I do not know how many letters have been sent back before the local post office connected me with this mysterious title. The article in The Synergist was partly based on my correspondence with Oliver ‘Asana’ Duex and there is some obvious misunderstanding — not harmful at all, but confusing to me. So I feel like writing a couple of words about Finnish readers.

The Finnish translation has been going on for about twenty years. The third version was started in 1984 and should be finished in two years. This translation is done by Seppo Kanerva and there is a group of about a hundred readers supporting the work financially. This group arranges also national meetings (open to visitors from other countries, too) and it has a newsletter of its own. There are several independent study groups in the country and usually at least some of the members belong to the support group (beginners are not accepted).

This unorganized network has worked rather well. However, because of several reasons we have faced the need to get registered as a non-profit association and the constitution is being drafted. It is not an easy task because this future association is planned to become a society of the Brotherhood as well. Perhaps our efforts will make it easier to establish later societies outside of the United States.

There is also a small unregistered group of outreach-minded readers and a few of them belong to the support group too. They plan to have an international conference in Finland in 1989. It seems to me that neither the support group nor the future association/society will take part in the arrangements.

I met Berkeley Elliott ( the chairman of the Internationa1 Fellowship Committee) in Israel in 1985. Because of her activities I have come to know quite a few readers in different countries. It has meant also that I started receiving letters where I was asked about readers in Finland. One of them was Oliver. When I answered his letter I wondered if there would be some sense in having an information network between newsletters. It is not a problem today, but when there are more newsletters in different languages it is not so easy to read and understand given information.

I was surprised to read from _The URANTIA Book_ Synergist that for participation in the evolving international network people should contact URANTIA Book readers of Finland. As you all know by now Cece Forrester, a member of the Special Projects Comittee, is coordinating an informal network. It has no sense to waste our energy by creating several networks. Cece has already done some preliminary work and with our help and ideas a good and working informal network can be build. There are problems to be faced but with gootwill they can surely be worked out.

As mentioned in The Synergist our newsletter, Heijaste, (Reflection in English) has a list of those readers in Finland who are willing to be contacted by brothers and sisters from other countries. “The experience of many shows that one of the best ways to meet new truth seekers, to learn about other cultures and to share experiences, is to go out and meet one another on a personal basis or in small groups.”

Wish you all a new year with blessings of joy and peace and love ...

Satu Sihvo, Espoo, Finland

## French — Speaking Encounter 1988

On the initiative of Samuel BIZE a Swiss reading group is organising an encounter on July 16-23, 1988 at ABBAYE OF BONNECOMBE, CASSAGNES — BEGONHES, AVEYRON, FRANCE. Contact: Samuel and Pascaline BIZE, 1661 Estavannens, SWITZERLAND.

## Black Boxes, Red Shifts And Big Bangs

Most of us will have been confronted with television documentaries, popular science articles and even serious papers by professional scientists that tell us, without qualification, that our universe started with the Big Bang about 15 to 20 billion years ago. This information is usually presented as if it is proven fact.

URANTIA Book readers will be aware that the Book assigns an enormously greater age to the universe and makes no mention of any big bang. Undoubtedly some readers will be troubled by the contradiction, and this article is an effort to help readers to be objectively and sensibly critical about science.

The rules of the scientific method are quite simple. Few scientists heed them properly. Firstly, data used to construct a theory should be verifiable, secondly, unnecessary hypothesis should be eliminated, and thirdly, the simplest theory that explains the facts should receive priority.

## The Urantia Book In 200 Years Time

Do we ever stop to ponder as to just where _The URANTIA Book_ will be in the relatively not too distant future? Will there still be a URANTIA Brotherhood and will there still be study groups? Perhaps _The URANTIA Book_ will hold a place of honour in the average households of our society or perhaps it will be used as a text book in the public and state schools. Will it become an integrated part of society or will it be confined to a religious sect or cultish type of organization? I see that that there could be two alternative paths this revelation can take and our actions today could play a major role in determining which path it is to take.

For anyone who has totally embraced _The URANTIA Book_ I'm sure you will understand what I mean when I say that there is a natural urge to share _The URANTIA Book_ with the rest of the world. The book moves us to such a degree that there is of ten a surge of emotion which prompts us to say: “What can I do to get this book across to my fellow man?” This urge is very noble indeed. The results of this noble urge manifest in many different ways as we're all such diverse individuals. Inevitably this very noble urge within the human soul coupled with the diversity and uniqueness leads us to the “business” of sorting out which methods are wise for the Revelation, which methods should be supported by the larger organization and which ones should be rejected. As the movement evolves, so the potential for division, personality clashes, conflicts of ideas etc., etc., will eventuate.

## Australia Welcomed First Urantia Book Reader From Finland

Early December 187 an energetic young Laplander from Finland arrived in Melbourne. Torsti Äärelä, who is a theology student at the university in Helsinki, was travelling around Australia trying to learn as much about us Aussies as he could. After six weeks he found the number of a URANTIA Book study group listed in the Melbourne telephone directory. After a week of seeing the sights down here and meeting some readers in between he set off again, keen to experience some new adventures.

Did you know that with a population of about 5 million, Finland has about 1000 readers of _The URANTIA Book_? This coming autumn the U-Book will be presented in the teaching programme of the OPEN University of Helsinki. In July 1989 Hameenlinna in Finland will host an international conference.

## Dear friends,

Is it just a happy coincidence that you happened to send me a copy of 'Six-0-Six Newsletter' now, or did you know that I have just started editing a newsletter for readers in Britain? I think your newsletter (which I had seen once or twice before) is very inspiring, and just the sort of thing that I hope our own newsletter will grow into, if we get enough contributions from readers. For the moment we are just calling ours '_The URANTIA Book_ Study Group Newsletter"; one issue has come out so far. I plan to make it quarterly and I will certainly send you the next one.

I presume that Kathleen and Trevor Swadling suggested my name to you. In that case you will know that I'm originally from Sydney and I've known them for many years, and we still keep regular contact. We (my wife and I) were in the study group in Sydney until we last left in 1982, and we hope to meet them and you when we come to the South Pacific conference next October, which we're looking forward to very much.

You must wonder as much as I do why the circle of URANTIA Book readers in Britain is getting off the ground so slowly. There is no clear answer to this, but as in Australia, I am sure there are many more readers than there appear to be. We have one regular study group meeting in London, and in the past year another has sprung up, in Bolton near Manchester, for readers in the North.

This newsletter project of mine is aimed at keeping the readers in Britain better informed about each other, and hopefully exchanging ideas and inspirations about _The URANTIA Book_. We've also done a little library placement, on a modest scale so far. So although Britain still appears sleepy and apathetic about our Book, I'm still optimistic and I've seen some improvement in the situation since I've been here.

Congratulations again on your fine newsletter. Our warmest wishes.

Thank you Curt Avery for your TV Ad. I spoke to a client of mine about The URAVTIA Book. He seemed a prime candidate. But my words were no help. So I read out your ad and he bought a copy on the spot! Nh Father ... you've always 'got an ace up your sleeve. And thanks Curt, love your style.

Emmanuel Lou your writings are wonderful and amazing. As you present each article tying up _The URANTIA Book_ with Chinese traditions I can't help but reflect on the religious who travelled to India in order to bring the Buddhist scriptures back to the nation of China, as portrayed in the tales of 'Monkey'. Surely it'll be a great time on the planet when the spirit of _The URANTIA Book_ captures the hearts and minds of China.

## Reincarnation Or Repersonalization

“Personalization” means in my opinion: making or being made personal or a person. This happens for the first time when the Father bestows personality on a living organism with mind. Personality is one of the fundamental mysteries of the universe, but having its origin in the First Source and Centre, and being able to function on the absolute level while always remaining unchanged, we may infer that this majestic personality does not know itself, at least not fully. Its universe career serves to realize itself.

From this process we may infer that personality needs personalization, or identification, for self-realization. The whole universe, except the existential, needs experience and is based on that. Personality, not knowing itself, identifies itself with the organism and mind on which it is bestowed. Though this “self”-knowledge is (on our level) for the greater part erroneous, it is unavoidable and necessary. Nevertheless there is a complementary process going on, identifying with the soul. This shows that personalization is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end.

Identification with the mind-organism is automatic, identification with the soul is a struggle. Decisions, more decisions, and still more decisions... The lessons of a level must be learned before the next level can be attained. The universe is not in haste, it works slowly but thoroughly.

## A Better World

With joyous hearts we live within your presence 
You who are everywhere around us now.
We bring you gifts of love and thanks, our presents, 
In our appreciation for your vow
To show us all of truth, although the time 
Involved may be of vast near-endless scope. 
From seeming chaos unto worlds sublime 
We'll climb while you expand our every hope. 
And yet we sense right now and all around us 
Your ordering presence making manifest 
A greater age of glory to astound us 
With your all-wondrous love. And we are blessed 
To know that even while our world is quaking 
It is a better world that you are making.

David Glass, Fort Worth, TX. USA.

Dear Friends,

Thank you for sending me the Six-0-Six. It really is a wonderful newsletter! I am particularly impressed with the fact that you publish bi-monthly. I pray that reader participation will be as active here in Canada before long. It occurred to me that publishing more often just might be the key. If you give someone four months to write an article maybe they have more t ime to forget about doing it! I wish you continued success with your newsletter and in your work for the Kingdom

Editors Note: Cynthia, you've hit the nail right on the head!

## News From The. Jesusonian Foundation

The Christian Fellowship and Jesusonian Foundation have recently merged. The Christian Fellowship will now be the Division of Ministry of the Jesusonian Foundation. It will continue to be headed by its founder and executive director, Dr. Meredith Sprunger. Meredith is a minister in the United Church of Christ and a former college professor.

The Christian Fellowship will expand its efforts to bridge the gap between _The URANTIA Book_ and the Christian church. This fellowship is composed of a Clergy Network interested in _The URANTIA Book_ as a resource in preaching, teaching, and living. It is also an Academic Network engaged in research and scholarly evaluation of _The URANTIA Book_.

A new introduction to _The URANTIA Book_ has been written. It was produced by the collaborative efforts of Meredith Sprunger, Duane Faw and Mo Siegel. It has been sent to study groups for editing and improvements and once completed it will be reprinted in color.
