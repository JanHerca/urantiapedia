The great adventure is in life itself. This adventure of understanding and discovering that we have before us a world of possibilities, a world of opportunities that open wide at every moment if we know how to appreciate them.

Logically, not everything in life will be easy for us... And that is precisely the challenge, that is indeed the challenge, that is the great opportunity! We have at our disposal two options: wait with arms crossed, waiting for something “extraordinary” to happen, or we can be the difference... bragging with LOVE! The key, in reality, is not to act for the sake of acting: it is to act with LOVE. But with that LOVE that has no borders, that has no limits or impediments.

_The Urantia Book_ tells us so splendidly an event in the life of the Master, in which they meet a young man who was afraid, afraid of LIVING, afraid of moving on, afraid of how they treated him, afraid of challenges and challenges ( <a id="a42_234"></a>[UB 130:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p6_1)) How many times has something similar to this young man not happened to us? How many times have we not felt disappointed, confused, overwhelmed? Many times we understand it when things get difficult... Life is not easy, and it doesn't pretend to be. But we have in our advantage the really important things, the essential and vital things.

Life is not trying to live easily, to spend life as calmly as possible. Thinking like this is missing the beautiful opportunity to LIVE. Challenges and challenges are what shape us to overcome the obstacles that come our way in life. Obstacles will always exist, the key is how we overcome them... That's the difference!

We can see an extraordinary example in nature itself. The eagles, to name an example; These extraordinary animals are amazing. They instinctively know when a storm is coming; if before they have not found a place to take refuge, the eagles take flight... above the storm! While the storm destroys and lashes everything around it below, above the eagle soars freely while looking for a safer place.

The storms of life will always be, no one has said otherwise. No one has said that life is easy; the key is how to cope. Many have had extraordinary success. But that success is achieved only with determination and perseverance. Many take examples, others wait and lament doing little or nothing about it.

Moreover,_The Urantia Book_ tells us about the mysterious monitors in our being: “_They are not interested in making the mortal career easy; rather are they concerned in making your life reasonably difficult and rugged, so that decisions will be stimulated and multiplied. The presence of a great Thought Adjuster does not bestow ease of living and freedom from strenuous thinking, but such a divine gift should confer a sublime peace of mind and a superb tranquillity of spirit._” (<a id="a50_483"></a>[UB 108:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p5_5))

Even about the beautiful and extraordinary guidance of the seraphim we are also told: «_To accept the guidance of a seraphim rarely means attaining a life of ease. In following this leading you are sure to encounter, and if you have the courage, to traverse, the rugged hills of moral choosing and spiritual progress._" (<a id="a52_321"></a>[UB 113:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p4_3))

Many times wise parents know not only how to educate their children but also have made an effort to provide them with a better future. So the challenge becomes less heavy... By the wisdom of the parents themselves! But many times this does not happen and the consequences are for the children, just as it happened with Adam and Eve: “_The consequences of the follies of misguided parents are so often shared by their innocent children._” (<a id="a54_439"></a>[UB 75:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p5_6) )

But when the parents are wise and consistent, like that beautiful episode of Jesus when he was in the hills with Juan Marcos, it often marks the behavior of that little one. So that when he grows up he doesn't “escape” from life... but simply that he knows how to value it!

Let's look at it like this... we are like diamonds. When a real prospector goes looking for a diamond, he first has to dig up a mountain, make a cave, and work hard, really hard work. When he finally finds a diamond, he finds it dirty, full of rubble, stone. You hardly notice that the diamond is there. But the work does not end there, the diamond is transferred to a special laboratory, where it is cleaned with great care, it is treated with special dedication and care. In the end you get a beautiful gem, a priceless work of art of nature. And the more appreciation you have, the more value it contains... Life is like that!

Many unfortunately lose their lives, the opportunity to progress, to fight, to move forward in the face of any obstacle that comes their way. It is “believed” that with the “retirement” it will be possible to reach the goal. But they lose their lives. By opting for a “mystical” path and “only” living in constant meditation, they miss out on the opportunity to progress, to live together, to have an experience for oneself. It is not only meditating, it is that meditation is an aid, a key, to courageously face obstacles. Make it a complement... Not an “exclusivity”.

> “_When certain vacillating and timid mortals attempt to escape from the incessant pressure of evolutionary life, religion, as they conceive it, seems to present the nearest refuge, the best avenue of escape. But it is the mission of religion to prepare man for bravely, even heroically, facing the vicissitudes of life._” (<a id="a62_325"></a>[UB 102:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p2_8))

We have a world of opportunities waiting, it depends on us, first how prepared we are, and then knowing how to face them... Like eagles!
