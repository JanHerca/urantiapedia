> “Mind knows quantity, reality, meanings. But quality — values — is felt. That which feels is the mutual creation of mind, which knows, and the associated spirit, which reality-izes.” ([UB 111:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p3_6))

This quotation from _the URANTIA Book_ came to my mind the morning after the Remembrance Supper, which the Melbourne Study Groups held on Sunday 6 th April. Jesus established the Remembrance Supper on the 6th April, 30 A.D.

Neil Francey was talking about the same thing, I think, when he said: “I felt, I could almost touch the morontia level.”

That special atmosphere of brotherhood which exists, when people come together to partake of a meal and they feel the presence of the Spirit of Truth there, is very hard to describe. It is something you don't pick up by reading a book, you have to be there to experience it. “As my Father has given me of His spirit, so will I give you of my spirit. And this Spirit of Truth which I will bestow upon you shall guide and comfort you and shall eventually lead you into all truth.” ([UB 180:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p4_2))

Out of the 22 adults and 10 children who were there that day, “no one knew quite what to expect”, as Ian Esmore put it. But I think most people went home a richer person for having experienced it.

Pamela Reynolds sang more beautiful than ever. Several people read something from _the URANTIA Book_ or Bible, or spoke their own thoughts about this special occasion. Some people contributed by bringing a tape with beautiful music and everybody brought food to share.

Joe Thackeray baked his special loaf of ryebread and his lovely wife Leslie made a delicious rice salad. We were fortunate to have these two URANTIA Book ambassadors from the Boulder School in Colorado still with us. A week later they set off on their bikes again on the way to Adelaide. Te have heard from them since, that they have made it safely to Ayers Rock and are on their way back to Brisbane again. 

Cairns, if you see two bright eyed, energetic young people with an URANTIA Book under their arm, that's our Joe and Leslie! You are their next destination.

There was nothing ceremonial or traditional about the Remembrance Supper. If Jesus would have established it there and then, he would have done it in our Australian setting, I'm sure. The symbols are not important, but what those symbols represent is. So whether you are breaking bread and sipping wine, or have a rice salad and drink apple juice, it makes no difference. The important thing is that we come together in his name, and that his spirit is truly present.

I like to thank all the people who were there on that occasion for helping to make it such a special day.
