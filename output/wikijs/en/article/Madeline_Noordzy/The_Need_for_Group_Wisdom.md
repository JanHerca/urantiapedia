Since the publication of my article 'From E.T. to E-3' in the last 6-0-6, two months have elapsed and we all have had time to cool down from either indignation or excitement, depending on whether you are a believer or a disbeliever.

From some of the feedback I have received via telephone conversations and letters, it appears that some people have regarded my case of 'keeping an open mind on the matter' more or less as blackmail, some felt it was inappropriate for the editor to write in the manner the article was written, some didn't want to know about it and some felt it had nothing to do with _The URANTIA Book_.

Other people who initially did not want to listen to the GRACELAND Tapes, changed their mind as a result of the article and can now see why I felt it was important enough to include in the newsletter.

I thank you all for your reactions whatever they were and I do not feel offended in any way because I do understand them.

Although the attitude of some people is to try and ignore the whole situation so that it may go away by itself, I'm questioning the wisdom of this attitude.

As I feel that we probably all agree that our first responsibility as readers of _The URANTIA Book_ is to protect the book's integrity, this 'Message from God' by Elijah the Third could be either the biggest challenge or the biggest threat the URANTIA 'movement' has ever faced. And I would like to repeat my invitation for people to evaluate and comment on it. I feel we need the wisdom of the group to deal with this situation. Even if this message was true, and we may not know for certain, publicly we cannot connect it to _The URANTIA Book_. There is always the risk that it isn't true. E-3 may know for sure, but we don't. We cannot expect the URANTIA Foundation to endorse it.

E-3 does not claim any paranormal happenings in the way he has received this message, but it is still his personal experience. I respect anybody's personal religious experience, but when this experience becomes public property and can affect the lives of many people, it requires the wisdom of the group to know how best to deal with it.

E-3's message uses the concepts of _The URANTIA Book_ without referring to the book, but it is still his personal interpretation which will be presented to the public for which it is primarily meant. Will not sooner or later this message be publicly connected to _The URANTIA Book_?

These are just some of the aspects which I would like to see more openly discussed among us.
I personally feel and I know from the feedback so far there is a lot of spiritual content in his message and if we take it through the test _The URANTIA Book_ suggests on page 1000:6 it would pass. But I still feel we have to tread carefully.

If indeed this mass evacuation is to take place (and it is not an impossibility, otherwise the revelators would not have mentioned it) then we have a responsibility towards out fellowmen to pass the message on.

If it isn't true, then irreparable damage could be done to the movement.

May I suggest that we look at it in an objective and unemotional way without prejudice and pre-conceived ideas. Let the Spirit of Truth do its own work and give it a bit of time. We need some group wisdom here.

I also like to sound a warning to the people who do believe in this message not to start an Elijah cult. According to him his ministry and prophesy was only meant to reveal the Graceland evacuation and what happens after it, any comments he makes on the current geopolitical situation are not to be taken as gospel since they are only speculation on his part. He has made an extensive study of existing prophesies, e.g. The Bible and Nostradamus, but it still remains speculation. I would not like to see a situation where people hang on every word he says and then pass it on as gospel.

Some people have suggested that this could bring dissension within the URANTIA movement. It will split us up in believers and non-believers, they say. Is it also possible for us to work through this situation with people having patience, tolerance and respect for other people's beliefs? And if the believers want to organize themselves to be of service to their fellowmen in the event of a possible emergency, that we allow them to do that with the understanding that this ministry should publicly not be connected to _The URANTIA Book_?

It is not the purpose of this article to evaluate the spiritual content of this message. I'll leave it up to readers to either do that for themselves or not do it at all if that is what they wish.

I would like to say a few words about my co-editor Neil Francey, who, although he personally did not feel inclined to listen to this 'message' has been very patient and loyal in his support of my editorship. In his last letter to me Neil wrote: "This entire issue is very healthy for all and I welcome and encourage lots more comment and discussion. Emphasises the one reality and the many 'issues'.

I do think UB readers have set new parameters in these matters. Opinions may differ, but love and respect for the person and their sonship is always undiminished."

What more can I say?
