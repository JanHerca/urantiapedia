On Christine's advice (Cf. “Le lien” n¹5 Autumn 2000), I reread chapter 7 of booklet 87. In doing so, nothing happened to me as Christine had predicted! - but I was struck by the content of the paragraph devoted to “new” symbolism.

“Even the reaffirmation of the religion of Jesus must develop a new and adequate symbolism. Modern men must find symbols appropriate to their new ideals, to their new and expanding ideas and obediences. This higher symbolism of a higher civilization must arise from religious life, from spiritual experience. It must be based on the concept of the Fatherhood of God and contain the powerful ideal of the brotherhood of man.”

So I started looking, starting with the “outside” and I retained some ideas which could lead to the adoption of a simple symbolism (non-aggressive towards non-readers) and which would reinforce our feeling of belonging to the same Urantian ideal.

We are fortunate to have at our disposal a very strong symbol of belonging: the “logo” made of three blue concentric circles that Machiventa Melchizedek wore on his chest when he arrived on earth. Why not use it in such a way as to make it an instrument of our “practice” in the sense that Christine understands it?
1. Why not borrow from our Canadian friends their “Pin” system — a word which in itself says it all — and which we could hang up during our meetings?
2. It would be possible to go further than the “pin” by creating our own “t-shirts” or polo shirts in bright white, with just in place of the heart, this same Urantia emblem.
3. Even less visible, the stickers for the rear windows of our cars would be both a fraternal “hello” if chance would have it that they meet, but also a real group reference in the event of convergence towards a given place for meetings, conferences, etc.
4. In terms of stationery, it would also be easy for us to “personalize” our letters (pads and envelopes) with the famous “logo” and this, for our correspondence with the A.F.L.L.U, the foundation; or quite simply between us.
5. To match that of the postman, but unrelated to it, a calendar showing the significant dates of the life of Jesus during his bestowal on Urantia (the 7th and last. It could be published every year and sent to each reader or member with the second half of December of year N 1). This would have the advantage of operating a transfer "from the Urantia book

Some time ago, in Brittany, during a vacation, I passed in front of a villa called “Urantia” my heart vibrated and I felt that in this friendly country, nothing could happen to me... I am also in frequent contact with a member of the A.F.L.L.U whose family lives in “Edentia”, “Edentia” being a "designator of the postal address.

Could another member or reader take over from me now to try to look for new symbols by going inward? Thank you
