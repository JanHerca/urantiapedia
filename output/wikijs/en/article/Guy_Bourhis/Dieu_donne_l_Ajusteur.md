<p style="text-align:center;">
Dieudonné constantly stirs my thoughts,<br>
Day at work, night in my sleep,<br>
And track down my refusal to open the windows<br>
To approach the boundaries of awakening.<br>
<br>
My laziness annoys him, but above all his kindness,<br>
He absolves me of my very human inclinations<br>
And comes back secretly to deliver his will<br>
To free myself from my unhealthy debates.<br>
<br>
His goal is clear: he has grasped the potential<br>
A long time ago, just before coming<br>
Lodge in me, a thousand leagues from the sky,<br>
To help me think and grow.<br>
<br>
In his approach, there is no doubt<br>
And his love for his subject is limitless.<br>
He will never tolerate going off the road,<br>
And will prevent its mission from falling apart.<br>
<br>
He doesn't want to return to his sphere<br>
From where he left with a single aim:<br>
Convince this unique soul to survive,<br>
And bring him to join without ambiguity,<br>
<br>
The body of Paradise finaliters.<br>
</p>
