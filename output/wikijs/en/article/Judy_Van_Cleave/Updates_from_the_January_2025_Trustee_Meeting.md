## Five-Year Planning

Mo Siegel began the meeting by reviewing the five-year goals that were established during the planning session last October. He shared his list of primary areas of concern that will need attention. He identified board members to assign each of the eight goals to, instructing them to prepare a road map for accomplishing their goal in a half-page report. He gave special thanks to Joanne Strobel for her work in organizing the planning. Lastly, he observed how blessed we all are to be working on the beginning stages of this revelation, and quipped: “We won the lottery.”

## Books

Despite a slow fourth quarter, 2024 concluded with increases across most categories of book sales. The year-to-date figures show encouraging growth, with an 8% increase in sales from 2023. This growth was particularly evident in Spanish, Portuguese, and French Urantia Books. The new paperback version of _The Untold Story of Jesus_ was well received and sales of this book were robust as well.

Sales of the English hardcovers were strong in Q4. Paperback sales were down for the quarter but were up 4% YTD. The Cambridge LeatherSoft books will be ready for sale in early April. These books are very popular and will help boost English sales in the coming quarters.

## Education

The Urantia Book International School began enrolling students for the new trimester on January 6. A total of 215 unique individuals were enrolled in 18 courses, which are being facilitated by 27 volunteers from six language branches. A “beta course” in Simplified Chinese characters was also launched with 14 participants. The monthly Spotlight Series continued in English and Spanish.

Tamara Strumfeld reported on the activities of the online Urantia Book Study Group Directory. During the final quarter of 2024, significant improvements were made to streamline the management of the directory. Scott Brooks and his tech partner developed and implemented a system to track nonresponsive study group hosts worldwide. What previously required extensive volunteer hours is now more automated.

The support of Urantia Association International, the Urantia Book Fellowship, and Urantia Foundation in this joint project demonstrates a unified commitment to foster study groups and exemplifies our desire to support the expanding worldwide Urantia community.

The Education Committee reported on their plans to sponsor Science Symposium IV, November 6–8, 2025. Marjorie Ray, biochemist and longtime symposium contributor, will once again serve as emcee. This series has been held every three years, and past presenters will be extended an advance invitation. This event will take place in a hybrid format, with presenters having a choice of travelling to Chicago to stay at the Foundation or participating remotely by Zoom. More information will be forthcoming.

The Cultural Advisory Council was established to enhance the cultural wisdom and awareness of the Foundation’s dissemination efforts while acquainting council members with the work of Urantia Foundation, so that both may better serve the readership within their cultures.In 2025, the CAC members will begin organizing meetings between the Foundation and their communities. Jisoo Han of South Korea has volunteered to go first and will organize a meeting for spring. The cohort will continue to meet quarterly throughout the year and attend all of the community meetings. In the second half of 2025, a new cohort will be organized for 2026.
