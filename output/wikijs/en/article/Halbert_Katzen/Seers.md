_Seer_ and _seers_ are each used five times. Unlike the plural usages, the singular usages have an associated Bible quote or other material that can be researched and referenced. These references are identified and included with select passages from the surrounding text:

## Seer

> Said the **seer of old**: “Lo, he goes by me, and I see him not; he passes on also, but I perceive him not.” We may constantly observe the works of God, we may be highly conscious of the material evidences of his majestic conduct, but rarely may we gaze upon the visible manifestation of his divinity, not even to behold the presence of his delegated spirit of human indwelling. (<a id="a33_382"></a>[UB 1:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p3_2))

> [**Job 9**](/en/Bible/Job/9) Then Job answered and said,
> <sup><small>2</small></sup> I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?
> <sup><small>3</small></sup> If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.
> <sup><small>4</small></sup> He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?
> <sup><small>5</small></sup> Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.
> <sup><small>6</small></sup> Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.
> <sup><small>7</small></sup> Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.
> <sup><small>8</small></sup> Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.
> <sup><small>9</small></sup> Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.
> <sup><small>10</small></sup> Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.
> <sup><small>11</small></sup> Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.

> You do well to love them, but you should not adore them; angels are not objects of worship. The great seraphim, Loyalatia, when your seer “fell down to worship before the feet of the angel,” said: “See that you do it not; I am a fellow servant with you and with your races, who are all enjoined to worship God.” (<a id="a47_315"></a>[UB 38:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/38#p2_5))

> [**Revelation 19:**](/en/Bible/Revelation/19)
> _The Marriage of the Lamb_
> <sup><small>6</small></sup> And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.
> <sup><small>7</small></sup> Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. <sup><small>8</small></sup> And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.
> <sup><small>9</small></sup> And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed _are_ they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God. <sup><small>10</small></sup> And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See _thou do it_ not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.

> [**Revelation 22:**](/en/Bible/Revelation/22)
> _The Time Is Near_<sup><small>6</small></sup> Then he said to me, “These words _are_ faithful and true.” And the Lord God of the holy prophets sent His angel to show His servants the things which must shortly take place.
> <sup><small>7</small></sup> “Behold, I am coming quickly! Blessed _is_ he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.”
> <sup><small>8</small></sup> Now I, John, saw and heard these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things.
> <sup><small>9</small></sup> Then he said to me, “See _that you do_ not _do that._ For I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book. Worship God.” <sup><small>10</small></sup> And he said to me, “Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand. <sup><small>11</small></sup> He who is unjust, let him be unjust still; he who is filthy, let him be filthy still; he who is righteous, let him be righteous still; he who is holy, let him be holy still.”

> This is the same renovated earth, the advanced planetary stage, that the olden seer envisioned when he wrote: “‘For, as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, so shall you and your children survive; and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another all flesh shall come to worship before me,’ says the Lord.” (<a id="a61_393"></a>[UB 52:7.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p7_12))

> [**Isaiah 66:**](/en/Bible/Isaiah/66)
> <sup><small>7</small></sup> “Before she was in labor, she gave birth;
> Before her pain came,
> She delivered a male child.
> <sup><small>8</small></sup> Who has heard such a thing?
> Who has seen such things?
> Shall the earth be made to give birth in one day?
> _Or_ shall a nation be born at once?
> For as soon as Zion was in labor,
> She gave birth to her children.
> <sup><small>9</small></sup> Shall I bring to the time of birth, and not cause delivery?” says the Lord.
> “Shall I who cause delivery shut up the womb?” says your God.
> <sup><small>10</small></sup> “Rejoice with Jerusalem,
> And be glad with her, all you who love her;
> Rejoice for joy with her, all you who mourn for her;
> <sup><small>11</small></sup> That you may feed and be satisfied
> With the consolation of her bosom,
> That you may drink deeply and be delighted
> With the abundance of her glory.”
> 
> <sup><small>12</small></sup> For thus says the Lord: “Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river,
> And the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream.
> Then you shall feed;
> On her sides shall you be carried,
> And be dandled on her knees.
> <sup><small>13</small></sup> As one whom his mother comforts,
> So I will comfort you;
> And you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.”
> 
> <sup><small>22</small></sup> “For as the new heavens and the new earth
> Which I will make shall remain before Me,” says the Lord,
> “So shall your descendants and your name remain.
> <sup><small>22</small></sup> it shall come to pass
> That from one New Moon to another,
> And from one Sabbath to another,
> All flesh shall come to worship before Me,” says the Lord.

> In due time there grew up in Egypt a teacher called by many the “son of man” and by others Amenemope. This seer exalted conscience to its highest pinnacle of arbitrament between right and wrong, taught punishment for sin, and proclaimed salvation through calling upon the solar deity. (<a id="a100_288"></a>[UB 95:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p4_1))

From [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_of_Amenemope):

> _**Instruction of Amenemope**_ (also called _Instructions of Amenemopet_, _Wisdom of Amenemopet_) is a literary work composed in Ancient Egypt, most likely during the Ramesside Period (ca. 1300–1075 BCE); it contains thirty chapters of advice for successful living, ostensibly written by the scribe [Amenemope son of Kanakht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenemope_(author) "Amenemope (author)") as a legacy for his son. A characteristic product of the New Kingdom “Age of Personal Piety”, the work reflects on the inner qualities, attitudes, and behaviors required for a happy life in the face of increasingly difficult social and economic circumstances. It is widely regarded as one of the masterpieces of ancient near-eastern wisdom literature and has been of particular interest to modern scholars because of its relationship to the biblical [Book of Proverbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Proverbs "Book of Proverbs").  …
> 
> It was \[Adolph\] Erman who used _Amenemope_ to emend a difficult reading in the text of Proverbs 22:20, where the Hebrew word _shilshom_ (“three days ago”) appeared to be a copyist’s error that could be meaningfully translated only with difficulty. Erman pointed out that substituting the similar word _sheloshim_ (“thirty”) not only made good sense in context, but yielded the following close parallel between the two texts, with the now-restored “thirty sayings” in Proverbs 22:20 corresponding exactly to the thirty numbered chapters in _Amenemope_:
> 
> - **Proverbs 22:20:** “Have I not written for you thirty sayings of counsel and knowledge?” (ESV)
> - **Amenemope, ch. 30, line 539:** “Look to these thirty chapters; they inform, they educate.”
> 
> Erman also argued that this correspondence demonstrated that the Hebrew text had been influenced by the Egyptian instead of the other way around, since the Egyptian text of _Amenemope_ explicitly enumerates thirty chapters whereas the Hebrew text of Proverbs does not have such clear-cut divisions, and would therefore be more likely to lose the original meaning during copying. Since Erman’s time there has been a near consensus among scholars that there exists a literary connection between the two works, although the direction of influence remains contentious even today. The majority has concluded that Proverbs 22:17–23:10 was dependent on _Amenemope_; a minority is split between viewing the Hebrew text as the original inspiration for _Amenemope_ and viewing both works as dependent on a now lost Semitic source.

Of note is a 1933 publication by James Henry Breasted titled _The Dawn of Conscience._ In it he states:

> “This new attitude is revealed to us in a remarkable treatise which we may call the ‘Wisdom of Amenemope.’ Written by a sage named Amenemope, it is now preserved to us in a papyrus in the British Museum. \[Published by Sir E.A. Wallis Budge. Facimiles of Egyptian Hieratic Papyri in the British Museum, etc., Pls. I-XIV, Columns I-XXVII, “The Admonition of Amenemapt, the Son of Kanekht.” Second Series, London, 1923.\] As so often in such counsel of the Egyptian wise men, these utterances of Amenemope are said to have been delivered by the sage to his son …
> 
> “To his son, therefore, Amenemope constantly holds up this attitude towards life, that it is to be lived both in personal and official relations, in full ecognizen of momentary responsibility to God. This ultimate intensity of conscience and God-consciousness in the teachings of an Egyptian thinker in the Tenth Century B.C., before any of the Old Testament was written, is the more remarkable, because we now know that the ‘Wisdom of Amenemope’ was translated into Hebrew, it was read by Hebrews, and an important part of it found its way into the Old
> Testament …
> 
> “In the wise conclusion that riches ‘make themselves wings’ and fly away, Amenemope’s graphic picture of the uncertainty and perishability of earthly good, we ecognize a figure which has come down to us through the editor of the Hebrew Book of Porverbs …
> 
> “The contrast is obviously between ‘the words of men’ and ‘the acts of God,’ and when it is stated that they both ‘diverge’ the meaning evidently is ‘from each other.’ We thus have here in its oldest form the world-wide proverb, ‘Man proposes, God disposes.’” (pps. 320-330)

> But five hundred years of the overlordship of alien rulers was too much for even the patient and long-suffering Jews. The prophets and priests began to cry: “How long, O Lord, how long?” As the honest Jew searched the Scriptures, his confusion became worse confounded. An olden seer promised that God would protect and deliver his “chosen people.” Amos had threatened that God would abandon Israel unless they re-established their standards of national righteousness. The scribe of Deuteronomy had portrayed the Great Choice—as between the good and the evil, the blessing and the curse. Isaiah the first had preached a beneficent king-deliverer. Jeremiah had proclaimed an era of inner righteousness—the covenant written on the tablets of the heart. The second Isaiah talked about salvation by sacrifice and redemption. Ezekiel proclaimed deliverance through the service of devotion, and Ezra promised prosperity by adherence to the law. But in spite of all this they lingered on in bondage, and deliverance was deferred. Then Daniel presented the drama of the impending “crisis”—the smiting of the great image and the immediate establishment of the everlasting reign of righteousness, the Messianic kingdom. (<a id="a124_1212"></a>[UB 97:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p8_3))

> **Daniel’s Vision of the Ancient of Days**
> <sup><small>9</small></sup> I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment _was_ white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne _was like_ the fiery flame, _and_ his wheels _as_ burning fire. <sup><small>10</small></sup> A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.
> 
> <sup><small>11</small></sup> I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld _even_ till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame. <sup><small>12</small></sup> As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.
> 
> <sup><small>13</small></sup> I saw in the night visions, and, behold, _one_ like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.
> <sup><small>14</small></sup> And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion _is_ an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom _that_ which shall not be destroyed.
> 
> **Daniel’s Visions Interpreted**
> <sup><small>15</small></sup> I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of _my_ body, and the visions of my head troubled me. <sup><small>16</small></sup> I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things. <sup><small>17</small></sup> These great beasts, which are four, _are_ four kings, _which_ shall arise out of the earth. <sup><small>18</small></sup> But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.
> 
> <sup><small>19</small></sup> Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth _were of_ iron, and his nails _of_ brass; _which_ devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet; <sup><small>20</small></sup> And of the ten horns that _were_ in his head, and _of_ the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even _of_ that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look _was_ more stout than his fellows. <sup><small>21</small></sup> I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; <sup><small>22</small></sup> Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.
> 
> <sup><small>23</small></sup> Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces. <sup><small>24</small></sup> And the ten horns out of this kingdom _are_ ten kings _that_ shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings. <sup><small>25</small></sup> And he shall speak _great_ words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time. <sup><small>26</small></sup> But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy _it_ unto the end. <sup><small>27</small></sup> And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom _is_ an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.
> 
> <sup><small>28</small></sup> Hitherto _is_ the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.

## Seers

### From the top down

> The higher intellectual teachers and the transition ministers freely and effectively utilize these various groups of reproducers in their morontia educational activities. But not all of their efforts are devoted to transient illustration; much, very much, of their work is of a permanent nature and will forever remain as a legacy to all future time. So versatile are these artisans that, when they function en masse, they are able to re-enact an age, and in collaboration with the seraphic ministers they can actually portray the eternal values of the spirit world to the mortal seers of time. (<a id="a147_598"></a>[UB 44:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/44#p2_11))

### Evolutionary history–medicine men vs. priests vs. black arts

> The shaman was the ranking medicine man, the ceremonial fetishman, and the focus personality for all the practices of evolutionary religion. In many groups the shaman outranked the war chief, marking the beginning of the church domination of the state. The shaman sometimes functioned as a priest and even as a priest-king. Some of the later tribes had both the earlier shaman-medicine men (seers) and the later appearing shaman-priests. And in many cases the office of shaman became hereditary. (<a id="a151_499"></a>[UB 90:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/90#p1_1))

> Ancient black art, both religious and secular, was called white art when practiced by either priests, seers, shamans, or medicine men. The practitioners of the black art were called sorcerers, magicians, wizards, witches, enchanters, necromancers, conjurers, and soothsayers. As time passed, all such purported contact with the supernatural was classified either as witchcraft or shamancraft. (<a id="a153_396"></a>[UB 90:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/90#p2_2))

### Seers in relationship to the last three epochal revelations

> This same Melchizedek continued to collaborate throughout the nineteen succeeding centuries with the many prophets and seers, thus endeavoring to keep alive the truths of Salem until the fullness of the time for Michael’s appearance on earth. (<a id="a157_246"></a>[UB 93:10.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p10_4))

> That night Jesus did not sleep. Donning his evening wraps, he sat out on the lake shore thinking, thinking until the dawn of the next day. In the long hours of that night of meditation Jesus came clearly to comprehend that he never would be able to make his followers see him in any other light than as the long-expected Messiah. At last he recognized that there was no way to launch his message of the kingdom except as the fulfillment of John’s prediction and as the one for whom the Jews were looking. After all, though he was not the Davidic type of Messiah, he was truly the fulfillment of the prophetic utterances of the more spiritually minded of the olden seers. Never again did he wholly deny that he was the Messiah. He decided to leave the final untangling of this complicated situation to the outworking of the Father’s will. (<a id="a159_841"></a>[UB 137:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p5_3))
