## Antonio

I am attaching some reflections on why the Planetary Prince did not arrive when Andón and Fonta were alive.

James Woodward's presentation on study groups at the international conference in Benalmádena left me 'traumatized'. How had he not realized it before? Our primitive ancestors were wandering the world, without anyone to guide or civilize them, for HALF A MILLION years. One last.

Half a million years is the cloth of time.

What did they intend with this pass? Observe what the human will is capable of doing without a guide and without a north?

The extracts that I have found to elucidate this matter are the following:

> _The signal for a System Sovereign to act in the matter of assigning a ruler to a given planet is the reception of a request from the Life Carriers for the dispatch of an administrative head to function on this planet whereon they have established life and developed intelligent evolutionary beings._ (<a id="a50_304"></a>[UB 50:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p0_2))

> _The principal reason for bringing mortal ascenders from the system capital as a part of the staff of the Planetary Prince is to facilitate communication with the inhabitants of the realm._ (<a id="a52_193"></a>[UB 50:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p2_7))

> _On an average evolutionary planet the six evolutionary races of color appear one by one; the red man is the first to evolve, and for ages he roams the world before the succeeding colored races make their appearance. The simultaneous emergence of all six races on Urantia, *and in one family,* was most unusual._ (<a id="a54_316"></a>[UB 64:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p6_1))

<figure id="Figure_1" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV24/12.jpg">

> _The appearance of the earlier Andonites on Urantia was also something new in Satania. On no other world in the local system has such a race of will creatures evolved in advance of the evolutionary races of color._ (<a id="a60_218"></a>[UB 64:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p6_2))

> _There were many unique features of the Urantia life experiment, but the two outstanding episodes were the appearance of the Andonic race prior to the evolution of the six colored peoples and the later simultaneous appearance of the Sangik mutants in a single family. Urantia is the first world in Satania where the six colored races sprang from the same human family. They ordinarily arise in diversified strains from independent mutations within the prehuman animal stock and usually appear on earth one at a time and successively over long periods of time, beginning with the red man and passing on down through the colors to indigo._ (<a id="a62_641"></a>[UB 65:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p4_7))

> _Another outstanding variation of procedure was the late arrival of the Planetary Prince. As a rule, the prince appears on a planet about the time of will development; and if such a plan had been followed, Caligastia might have come to Urantia even during the lifetimes of Andon and Fonta instead of almost five hundred thousand years later, simultaneously with the appearance of the six Sangik races._ (<a id="a64_406"></a>[UB 65:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p4_8))

> _On an ordinary inhabited world a Planetary Prince would have been granted on the request of the Life Carriers at, or sometime after, the appearance of Andon and Fonta. But Urantia having been designated a life-modification planet, it was by preagreement that the Melchizedek observers, twelve in number, were sent as advisers to the Life Carriers and as overseers of the planet until the subsequent arrival of the Planetary Prince. These Melchizedeks came at the time Andon and Fonta made the decisions which enabled Thought Adjusters to indwell their mortal minds._ (<a id="a66_571"></a>[UB 65:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p4_9))

> _It was our intention to produce an early manifestation of will in the evolutionary life of Urantia, and we succeeded. Ordinarily, will does not emerge until the colored races have long been in existence, usually first appearing among the superior types of the red man. Your world is the only planet in Satania where the human type of will has appeared in a precolored race._ (<a id="a68_379"></a>[UB 65:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p4_11))

But the Planetary Prince arrived on Urantia almost half a million years after the appearance of the human will.

> _About five hundred thousand years ago and concurrent with the appearance of the six colored or Sangik races, Caligastia, the Planetary Prince, arrived on Urantia. There were almost one-half billion primitive human beings on earth at the time of the Prince’s arrival, and they were well scattered over Europe, Asia, and Africa. The Prince’s headquarters, established in Mesopotamia, was at about the center of world population._ (<a id="a72_432"></a>[UB 66:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p0_2))

<ins>Process in a normal world:</ins>

1. The 6 colored races start to appear one by one, over long periods of time. First the red race arises. A long period of time passes. Then another colored race arises. Spend more time. Then another arises, and so on until the indigo race is reached.
2. The will arises long after the colored races are already in the world, and usually appears for the first time among the red men.
3. The Planetary Prince arrives as soon as the will appears, normally during the lifetime of those first truly human beings.

<ins>Process happened on Urantia:</ins>

1. The will appeared in Andon and Fonta, beings “without” color.
2. Twelve Melchizedek observers arrived during the life of Andon and Fonta (instead of coming the Planetary Prince).
3. The Planetary Prince arrived 500,000 years later, simultaneously with the birth of the colored races. There were already 500 million Andonites on Earth.

<ins>Conclusions that can be drawn from all this:</ins>

1. As this is an experimental world of life, the will appeared in Andon and Fonta 500,000 years BEFORE the colored races arose. It is a unique case in Satania.
2. Instead of sending the Planetary Prince during the life of Andon and Fonta, they sent 12 Melchizedek observers as advisors to the Life Carriers.
3. Since the Melchizedeks did not bring a corporeal staff that could put themselves in direct contact with the Andonites, these first humans wandered for 500,000 years through this world, blindfolded, aimlessly and without anyone to direct or civilize them, left totally to their own devices. themselves, their instincts and their free will.
4. The Planetary Prince arrived at the time of the emergence of the colored races. (The appearance of the 6 colored races in the same family is also a unique case in Satania.)

Why didn't the Planetary Prince arrive while Andon and Fonta were still alive?

Of two reasons, only one:

1. The Planetary Prince can ONLY come when the colored races are ALREADY in the world (as usually happens on normal planets). If this is so, we do not know the reasons behind it.
2. The Planetary Prince did not come simply because they intentionally planned it that way, to observe how a human race develops on its own, without any kind of teachers.

One thing is certain: As soon as the will arose, they immediately sent, NOT the Planetary Prince, but 12 Melchizedeks. And they did it on purpose. They knew they had to send the Prince, but they sent substitutes. With the result that they left human beings wandering the world, without guidance or direction, for HALF A MILLION years.

If they wanted to observe what a human mind is capable of without guidance or teachers, they fulfilled their objective. What no one expected is that this observation was going to last for many more millennia, because of the Caligastia rebellion and the lack of Adam.

The missions of the Planetary Prince and of Adam is to cover the WHOLE range of human needs: material, intellectual and spiritual.

Can you imagine what it must be like, on a normal planet, as soon as the human will appears, the Planetary Prince appears with his 100 materialized assistants, who immediately begin to help, educate and guide the primitive humans, and continue with them thousands and thousands of years guiding their civilization?

Is anyone able to draw more illuminating conclusions?

## Carmelo

Since Antonio sent these reflections I have been thinking about the matter at times. What I have noticed is the experiment, and I wonder if they did not go too far. The Book tells us that on experimental worlds life carriers are allowed certain deviations from the standards of living. But this is where they went.

I summarize what I have noticed from what Antonio says:

1. An early appearance of man was designed. They wanted humans earlier than usual in the unfolding of evolution.
2. This first race was “without color” (Antonio, I like that expression you have invented), and not colored as usual. I understand that this “colorless” race does not exist on the other worlds of Satania, only here on Urantia.
3. A planetary prince did not arrive with his team of material and visible beings to slowly civilize humanity: material progress (domestication of plants and animals, for example), cultural (writing and numbers, for example), moral (the commandments) , spiritual (principle of knowledge of the Deity) radiated from a material and visible center, visitable and visited, “heavenly” built (use of brick, layout of buildings, etc..) and “heavenly” organized (division of labor, organization of teams, training schools, etc.) as a model to disseminate. In other words, an experiment in the evolution of a humanity alone was designed and planned, without “celestial” influence, without any of this. Let's see what happened!
4. The colored races had to appear, as it seems mandatory on all inhabited planets to establish a diversity of characters at the beginning that becomes unified with evolution, and they appeared, but suddenly and not over the millennia, but rather a single family and not as a result of the evolution of the species. I wonder why and for what.

I remind you that life on a planet is fully planned in the worlds (and laboratories) of the life carriers that surround Jerusem. And everything is designed, from the first living being to the human being, the entire design of genes of all possible species (those that finally appear and those that never appear but are anticipated subject to possible contingencies in evolution, let's see if the frog dies and we are left without alternatives). The intellectual and spiritual capacities of the human races and their evolution over time are designed, especially after the injection of Adamic blood. The interactions between species are planned (who serves whom as food and as a predator, etc.). Possible alternative paths of the evolution of the species are planned. And who knows how many more things.

And everything is done according to Miguel's creative plan for the local universe, and approved by Miguel who is really and in fact the only creator in his local universe. In other words, Miguel, our Miguel, approved our experiment.

It seems that the experiment did not go very well. Or if? As I have said once, in the celestial order it happens as with the pig, everything is used. Surely from everything they learned with us, from our blunders, they have obtained benefits for other, newer planets. Was this alternative “piphiatic” line of evolution also planned, foreseen? I'd like to know the details when I go there.
