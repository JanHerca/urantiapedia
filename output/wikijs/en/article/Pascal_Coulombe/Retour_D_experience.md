<p style="text-align: center;">
Hello everyone,<br>
<br>
Following the call (Articles for LE LIEN) I react. As a sort of 'reflex', a feedback.<br>
<br>
What do we try with all our heart every day? To do His will, willingly or unwillingly.<br>
<br>
Like the bee that makes honey which then attracts the bear, like a pot of honey at our level.<br>
<br>
We are children of life, stimulated, taken by the hand, from the material to the spiritual.<br>
<br>
We imitate as a parent or lover of our neighbor, the image of our Father.<br>
<br>
In any case, if we move away from its Source, we wither away. Evil contains its own end.<br>
<br>
So let us be happy to participate slowly and surely in His magnificent plan, which, deceived by our ego, is His and not ours.<br>
<br>
Like a child sometimes we try to twist His injunctions, impatient we want everything right away and now.<br>
<br>
In His infinite wisdom He knows that we must wait and that each day is enough of our trouble. One step after the other we go towards Him.<br>
<br>
When, how, why, with whom, by backing down, by balking, by laughing, by crying, by begging, by screaming, by resigning, what does it matter!<br>
<br>
Together, helping each other, trying as He could do, timidly, kindly, like a human of good will.<br>
<br>
I realized for my part, that a Being being outside of time and space, capable of seeing all the alternatives at once; knows by His omnipotence, omniscience, how to achieve His ends. Take heart my dear traveling companions, whoever you are.<br>
<br>
Its light is before us, inevitably.<br>
<br>
It has already enlightened us, guided us since we were very young. Since the first impulse of life, placed at our feet by our supervisors and bearers of it.<br>
<br>
And what does one of us do when he gets ahead? He waits for his companions, patiently or not and most certainly by his own will tinged with love supported by that of Our Father.<br>
<br>
What does that really mean? That if one of us wants very badly what His Heavenly Father finds in the nails that is it.<br>
<br>
Doing this one, two, three, several of us pull towards the 'up'/'center'; it all depends on the frame of reference;<br>
<br>
The rest, collectively all the groups of humans, move forward. In teams of a few or all in the same boat; it works, we move forward!<br>
<br>
And then if several boats are needed, what does it matter since we are directed towards Him.<br>
<br>
Brick by brick, little by little, the river of humanity tends towards the sea of truth, goodness, beauty. And what we are led to want Him with us, is realized $=>$ Paradise within reach, the kingdom of God among us.<br>
<br>
Eternity to appreciate its depth, its value, and concretely the age of light and life taking hold now.<br>
<br>
So my dear brothers where do we place this temple? Which place on the planet is most likely to be suitable...<br>
<br>
Let us rejoice.<br>
<br>
Dear brothers, let us be strong and constant whatever the trials, because we are on the way, within ourselves first and around us like dominoes.<br>
<br>
Fraternally,<br>
</p>
