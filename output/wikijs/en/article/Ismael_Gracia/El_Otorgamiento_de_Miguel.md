As you already know, this year the main theme of the XIII Encounter deals with Jesus, his speeches and parables, how through their use he tried to convey the message that he brought with him to this planet. The truth is that we believe it will be an exciting encounter, because WHO IS NOT PASSIONATE FOR JESUS?

Now we'll talk a bit about Michael, the other side of Jesus, because we all know that Michael and Jesus are actually one. We will talk a little about Miguel's reason for incarnating as a mortal and the importance of that fact. We will also talk about the so-called “prohibitions” or limitations that Miguel had to respect during his stay on Urantia, the reason for them. We will delve into the advice of the representative of Paradise resident on Salvington, Emanuel, wise advice that Miguel always kept in mind.

I have always been drawn to Jesus. And who doesn't? But years ago I didn't quite understand the story that had been explained to me, I couldn't achieve its real purpose. The direct son of God turned into a kind of man of sorrows who had to die in such a brutal way and by divine mandate to SAVE US? NO, it was a cruel story, which made us very mean beings. A story that limited us, chained us, judged us and subjected us... because it flooded us with guilt forever.

Deep down I always knew it couldn't be like this, it had to be something more glorious, something more liberating and uplifting. Something that eluded me because I lacked the proper perspective. Until one day, _The Urantia Book_ came to my rescue, explaining to me very clearly who this man-god from Nazareth was. Because it didn't just explain the life and teachings of Jesus, it perfectly detailed WHO he really was. He went beyond his human experience and perfectly explained in great detail his divine origin, his real function, his struggles, his desires and goals in all this great cosmic loom. I would almost say that no information available on this planet has ever gone this far on the figure of Jesus... and if it exists, I don't know it.

_The Urantia Book_ told me a story that is replete with great teachings that transcend history itself, teachings that we call spiritual teachings. EUB explained to me that Jesus was REALLY Michael of Nebadon, a Creator Son, one more of the hundreds of thousands of children of that order... I mean, GOD DOESN'T HAVE JUST ONE SON. This information alone breaks many schemes for you, it is a “wedge” or “door” to another line of thought and understanding.

He explained to me the function of all these thousands of beings in the universes as initiators, architects and controllers of certain cosmic units called local universes. He explained to me that for practical purposes, these children are God himself in his field of work, because they are the way in which the Father gets as close “physically” as possible to his most humble creatures in general, since the relationship through the adjuster is personal and not material. The Migueles are the way in which we become more “visible” in a more comprehensive way for our condition. In other words, this Miguel, IN PRACTICE, was and is the god of our cosmic parcel.

But what really caught my attention was that, thanks to this account of the incarnation of our Michael, I perfectly understood that every being in the cosmos, whether God or not, MUST earn their position or the position where they should go, or where they should work. wherever you want to go In other words, personal effort is indispensable in the “great Game” of universal reality. Everything must be earned because nothing is given for free, even if EVERYTHING is really a great gift in the form of a great opportunity. I LIKED THIS A LOT.

From here arises the first teaching that I want to comment on:

## First teaching

**PERSONAL EFFORT IS ESSENTIAL**

You can spend your whole life wanting to catch the Moon, but nobody is going to put it in your hands. However, you can get it if you take a ladder and lower it yourself. And be calm because, if that desire is good for your progress and for the progress of EVERYTHING (if it is in line with the Will of the Father), while you make an effort to climb the steps, remaining firm in your decision to do so, the universe will take care of it. To hold the ladder so you don't fall. But you have to be the one who climbs the ladder and establish yourself strongly but little by little with each step you climb.

And if that desire is not good for your progress and is not in line with the will of the Father, you will be notified to give up. Surely at the first step, or at the second at the most, the ladder will start to shake for you to notice.

A Creator Son assumes full responsibility, as if he were the director of a great movie, for starting, composing, directing, controlling, and finishing the local universe assigned to him (it should be remembered that they volunteer for this and that each universe is imbued with the personal character of that son). In other words, all of us carry embedded in our spiritual DNA certain traits of our Michael. He is the acting sovereign, but he does not assume full sovereignty until he has SUCCESSFULLY completed the seven required donations or bestowals in the form of the different types of creatures under his charge. And ALL the Miguels loyally follow that mandate of Creation, exclusive to them.

Why is that so? If you are almost like the Universal Father in almost all your attributes and nature, why waste time like this with such inferior beings? Well, because, even being divine as they are, these personal experiences of donation enable them to be even wiser, more compassionate and more merciful sovereigns. According to EUB, these donations are NOT MANDATORY for the Creator Sons, but they are ABSOUBTELY NECESSARY for them, because it is through that EFFECTIVE experience in the form and in the environment where the creatures of their own universe live that said ruler gets to know them. in deep. Nothing teaches more in the universe than one's own personal experience seasoned by relationships with many of the different personalities that make it up.

## Second education

**WE MUST LIVE AND EXPERIENCE, AND ABOVE ALL WE MUST RELATE TO BE ABLE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW; GET OUT OF OUR “BUBBLE”**

Most people live in a kind of bubble that they create around themselves made up of both material and immaterial elements. The comfort they find in it makes them focus solely on keeping it... and getting out of it as little as possible. This inadvertently causes them to isolate themselves, it deprives them of key knowledge for understanding among all men, and of course for their own progression. We must “risk” getting out of our own bubble, we must look out at our neighbor to understand him.

Michael came out of a surely beautiful, divine and perfect bubble there on Salvington and came here to get dirty with mud of his own free will and to see first hand a human life. This example in time is priceless and we must always keep it in mind. As you well know, ALL Nebadon has had it in mind ever since. Miguel TAKEN A RISK; success was not assured beforehand. He had to earn it... and to win you must always take risks.

Our lord Michael's main motive for incarnating on Urantia as our brother Jesus was purely personal and was part of his development as ruler of Nebadon. That was the reason and NOT ANOTHER. Although he ended up saving us, showing us the path of survival with his example of a mortal life in tune with the will of the Father, and endlessly proclaiming our real spiritual condition and the consequences derived from it, he revealed to us that we are children of a wise God-Father and loving, an active GOD who always accompanies us. He unfolded a new Revelation of the character of his Father, of the Father of all, and not only for Urantia, but for all of Nebadon...a revelation very different from that hitherto existing on Urantia. It served us and in what way... that is called taking advantage of time.

Such was his love for men, such was his desire that men know more and better of the Father, that his original purely personal primary goal became almost exclusively a total dedication to that revelation through the example of a life of service. and some inspiring teachings. In short, he dedicated himself exclusively to SERVE, since teaching and instructing is also serving. I believe that precisely through that COMBINED and TOTAL service to men, their personal experience of understanding was further honed. In this way, he demonstrated that personal progress is indisputably linked to service, a service that originates from neither more nor less than love for fellow men, love derived from the recognition of the paternity of God the Father and belonging to his great universal family.

## Third teaching

**PERSONAL WORK IS NEVER INCOMPATIBLE WITH SERVICE TO OTHERS. INSTEAD, IT IS NECESSARY**

Time is never wasted when we help or serve others, even though it may seem so at times. We always get more profit back than we actually give. What happens is that these gains almost always need the passage of time to be able to detect them.

We have to understand that when we serve, help or do good to others, we are really doing it to ourselves, and we have to understand that to love, to serve and to help we need to risk something of ourselves. There is no other way.

Perhaps at first we take some “slaps”, but at the end of the road we always benefit. If there were no part of risk in life, it would be very easy. And when everything is very easy something does not go well. Normally we only progress after facing certain levels of difficulty and uncertainty, even if they are minimal.

It should be remembered that Michael chose Urantia to incarnate almost immediately after Adam and Eve's fault occurred. Urantia is a peculiar planet in many ways, and it is precisely for this reason that the enormous difficulties that you might encounter here are what weighed on your choice. Because if he was capable of doing what he had to do on a planet as darkened as this, he was the best possible example for any other planet in all of Nebadon and for all time.

## Fourth teaching

**ALWAYS DO THE RIGHT THING, CHOOSE WISELY THE PATH TO FOLLOW... THE MOST NEEDED PATH AT ALL TIMES EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BE FULL OF STONES AND THORNS**

It takes courage and courage to choose the most correct option even if you know that it will cause you problems... and much more, if, like Miguel you already know, you intuit or perceive everything that is going to happen to you before coming... because he surely will. I knew... but it was the right thing to do. We should always opt for the right thing wherever it takes us... no matter what.

Let us not forget the Lucifer rebellion in effect at that time in Satania and on Urantia. Miguel, with this spectacular episode of incarnation, left the rebels completely without arguments and put an end to said insurrection. Could it have been done in any way better or differently? I think not, because it showed that even a humble mortal is capable of resisting any evil. The one who trusts by faith in the Father, the one who tries to maintain an uninterrupted communion with him, should not fear anything. He is protected from all sophistry or misunderstanding, because he walks the right path.

## Fifth teaching

**GOOD ALWAYS TRIUMPHS OVER EVIL. TRUTH, BEAUTY AND GOODNESS END UP IMPOSING THEMSELVES IN CREATION. THE WILL OF GOD “IS” AND NOBODY AND NOTHING CAN SUPPRESS OR SUFFOCATE IT FOR A LONG TIME**

That is why it is truly stupid to be carried away by fear. In what truly matters, fear has no reason to exist... only trust and faith fit. Evil, mistake, is the natural condition of man, and we should not be overwhelmed by that fact. If we make a mistake we must rectify and that's it, it is one lesson after another. What we must always take into account is whether our real intention is honest and sincere. That is what the Father really takes into account: the intention.

## Sixth Teaching

**WE HAVE TO LEARN TO TRUST GOD, TRUST LIFE, KEEP AND MAINTAIN LOYALTY. ABOVE ALL IN THIS DEADLY EXPERIENCE, WE HAVE TO LEARN TO TRUST OTHERS AND TO DELEGATE**

And that costs us a lot, right?

What other spiritual teachings does this great story convey to us?

A Creator Son possesses the authority to do as he pleases in his local universe, but is self-limiting and even willingly subservient to others when the occasion calls for it. Above all, he listens to and leans on personalities supposedly inferior to him. What an example for any ruler, right?

When Miguel passed on his powers to his older brother and paradise adviser Emanuel, the latter gave him a series of advice and warnings that would serve as a general guide for conduct, due to the universal significance of his donation on Urantia, and from which Miguel took good note. Let's see what they were:

## Tips of a general/universal nature

**1\. LIVE AT ALL TIMES LIKE A MORTAL**

He asks him to submit at all times to the will of the Father, to live submitted to the normal conditions of life as any other human.

**2\. ONCE YOU ARE AWARE OF YOUR DIVINE IDENTITY, TECHNICALLY END THE UBCIFER REBELLION**

He asks him to do as a simple man what he decided not to do as a divine being, even though he had all the power, authority and reason. In the face of all of Nebadon, it would be the fairest and most equitable way, so that his authority could never again be questioned or another rebellion could originate.

**3\. THEN ACCEPT THE TITLE OF PLANETARY PRINCE OF URANTIA AS ETERNAL RECOGNITION OF YOUR GIFT, AND TRY TO REPAIR AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE CONFUSION AND SUFFERING PREVAILING ON URANTIA DUE TO THE FAILURES OF CALIGASTIA, ADAM AND EVE**

Miguel's acceptance of this title means something very important to us: that we will always be linked to him. The planet of the cross, or of the 7th incarnation of Michael, is constantly observed by billions and billions of universal eyes. Let's always remember that because that means A LOT is expected of us. If Miguel chose us, it is because we have tremendous potential, even if it takes eons to make it emerge.

He also asks him to give us a hand since we need it, and because much of our disorientation is due not to ourselves, but to those superior beings who failed in their work long ago. And that is a great relief for the collective psyche; That means that we are not as “bad” as it seems.

**4\. WE WILL COOPERATE IN DECLARING A DISPENSATIONAL JUDGMENT, END OF THE AGE AND GENERAL RESURRECTION ON URANTIA WHEN YOU FINISH YOUR DONATION ON IT**

So it was. From him a new time began.

**5\. I ADVISE YOU TO PLAY MAINLY THE ROLE OF INSTRUCTOR/TEACHER TO FIRST, RELEASE AND INSPIRE THE SPIRITUAL NATURE OF MAN.**

Then enlighten their intellect, heal their souls, and free their fear-filled minds. Finally, as a wise man, contribute to the physical well-being and material comforts of your brothers. LIVE AN IDEAL RELIGIOUS LIFE TO INSPIRE THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE.

Using an simile, we would say that Michael came to a planet that was like a closed room with little outside light coming in (due to the quarantine) and also little inside light, and then he raised a huge “blind” to let it in. light in abundance and so that we could also see something of that exterior better. And above all, he gave us a beautiful mirror in which we could calmly contemplate ourselves to really discover what we are and how we are, which until then we were not very clear about.

**6\. WHEN YOU FINISH THE DONATION, POUR OUT YOUR SPIRIT OF TRUTH SO THAT ALL NORMAL MORTALS HAVE IMMEDIATE AND FULL ACCESS TO THE MINISTRY OF THE THOUGHT ADJUSTER, TO THE SEPARATE PRESENCE OF THE FATHER**

Do you realize the importance of something like that? That made Urantia gain a lot of time within its own evolutionary rhythm. Since then, ALL normal-minded mortals have had the inner presence of the Father from the first moral decision (more or less from the age of five) and, in addition to that, the spirit of Michael poured out to all humanity in Pentecost. That is a turning point in our development, which has a lot to do with how fast human progress has been in the last 2,000 years compared to the rest of our history.

**7\. REMEMBER THAT YOUR LIFE ON URANTIA IS A LIFE FOR THE INSTRUCTION AND EDIFICATION OF THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE, FOR ALL THE LIVES OF ALL THE PLANETS OF ALL TIME**

We must not imitate Jesus, we must be inspired by him. When sometimes we have to make important decisions, we try to find answers through our prayer and communion with the spark of the Father. If that way does not just provide us with the necessary inspiration, _The Urantia Book_ explains another formula that consists of changing our mind for that of Jesus. This practice consists of seriously asking ourselves before a circumstance in which we have to decide: what would Jesus do in the face of this?

**8\. THROUGH YOUR LIFE TOTALLY DEDICATED TO DOING THE WILL OF THE FATHER, YOU WILL REVEAL IT THUS IN THE FLESH TO YOUR BROTHERS FOR ALL TYPES OF HUMAN MIND**

His message was transversal and addressed to EVERYONE, there was and is not “chosen”. His teachings are understandable to a greater or lesser extent by all types of minds depending on their capacity, of course. Miguel demonstrated that it is possible to find God in a brief human life... ours is the choice as to whether we also want to at least try.

**9\. REMEMBER THAT ALL YOUR POWER IS INHERENT IN YOUR PERSONALITY. WHEN YOU ARE AWARE OF YOUR DIVINE NATURE YOU WILL BE FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM, SO “HOLD IT ON” BECAUSE YOU HAVE DECIDED TO LIVE AS A SIMPLE MAN SUBJECT TO THE WILL OF THE FATHER**

All his life, especially when he was fully aware of who he really was, Michael held back, except for two concrete displays of power: the multiplication of the loaves and fishes, and the raising of Lazarus. Both were deliberate because they served a purpose. The rest of the miracles were motivated by his tremendous compassion towards his mortal brothers, or by the very faith of the believers. Miguel was the greatest demonstration of the responsibility that must be assumed by those who have great power: the greater the power, the greater the responsibility.

## Additional tips related to Urantia:

**1\. BE PRACTICAL IN YOUR LIFE, WORK LIKE A MORTAL AT SOMETHING THAT IS USEFUL AND PROVE THAT WORK IS PRAISEABLE AND NECESSARY TO PROGRESS AS AN INDIVIDUAL**

Work is not an imposed penalty or a divine punishment; It is an indispensable tool for our personal capacities to emerge. All jobs are laudable, as long as they are not in conflict with our highest ethical and moral ideals.

**2\. RESPECT ALL FAMILY AND COMMUNITY CUSTOMS OF THE TIME**

Adapt to the situation and the environment, and be one more within it. Deeply respect the history of your people.

**3\. YOUR MISSION IS MAINLY OF SPIRITUAL REGENERATION AND INTELLECTUAL EMANCIPATION. THEREFORE DO NOT GET ENTANGLED WITH THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC POWERS OF THE TIME.**

Jesus had to have his hands completely free to carry out his work. Even as you know, he burned all the bridges behind him, including the family ones. Furthermore, if all beings on Urantia are his children (dumb and smart, rich and poor, progressive and conservative), how can he show preference for some children over others? NO. A truly wise and lovingly motivated father would never do that.

It should also be remembered that all political, social and religious ideologies on Urantia are purely human and not divine creations. Therefore, neither is totally accurate; they are only results and adaptations of the progressive rhythm of human civilization. That is why a being superior to our level, whatever it may be, cannot in any way opt for any of them, because it is above all of them... it can exalt the truths and call attention to the mistakes of all, but not opt for them. for no one in particular.

**4\. YOU SHOULD NOT INTERFERE IN THE LEAST IN THE NORMAL PROGRESSIVE RHYTHM OF URANTIA. BUT YOU CAN LEAVE BEHIND AN ENHANCED AND ENHANCED SYSTEM OF POSITIVE RELIGIOUS ETHICS, SINCE YOU ARE ALLOWED TO HELP THE SPIRITUAL AND RELIGIOUS ADVANCEMENT OF THE PLANET.**

Until then religious ethics was merely negative: DON'T DO. Jesus taught the positive method: DO AND DO THE BEST YOU CAN.

Do you think that Jesus did not interfere in our progress? We are sure? Because since he came, nothing was the same.

**5\. IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO ISOLATE YOURSELF, YOU CAN IDENTIFY YOURSELF WITH EXISTING SPIRITUAL MOVEMENTS ON URANTIA. BUT DO NOT FORMALLY CREATE A NEW ORGANIZED CULT. YOUR MESSAGE AND TEACHINGS SHOULD BE TRANSVERSAL TO THE ENTIRE WORLD AND FOR ALL TIMES.**

It would be important that all men, especially Christians, take something into account: the true teachings of Jesus ARE NOT PROPERTY of the Christian churches, they are not alien to other cults or religions. The teachings of Jesus ARE NOT A RELIGION IN ITSELF. They are an INSPIRATIONAL GIFT to ALL world religions of all time. They are TRANSVERSAL, they are the property of all the inhabitants of Urantia and always will be... they are the property of the entire universe.

Jesus did not create any organized religion, but from him Christianity was founded... Was it inevitable? Possibly yes...

**6\. SO THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN, DO NOT LEAVE ANYTHING POTENTIALLY IDOLATRIC BEHIND YOU: NO DRAWINGS, WRITINGS, IMAGES OF YOURSELF OF ANY KIND... NOT EVEN PERSONAL ITEMS.**

How potentially idolatrous we are, right? How soon we forget about the truly transcendental and start worshiping material things. We really like “fireworks.” Worshiping objects, numbers, images is stupid. They can serve as “crutches” for us, but we should not worship them. Only God is worthy of worship. We shouldn't even adore Jesus or Michael even though we have great respect and affection for them, because loving is not the same as adore, even if the former is needed for the latter.

One of the worst practices of all is the worship of saints... I consider it truly lamentable in a supposedly advanced society like ours. They have been torches in the darkness of civilization, but they are only great men and not gods. They are NOT “chosen” nor do they have any favored treatment with the Father; they have only done their part of the job well, what has been “asked” of them.

The cult of saints is a symptom of arrogance and spiritual pride, because... how is it possible that there are still people who think that by praying to any saint God is going to go above others to help him? Also, if they need “something” from God, they should ask Him directly. That would make their personal relationship with him a little closer.

The harsh reality is that we have little faith. It's like Thomas with Jesus' nail marks. He lived next to Jesus and Jesus told him that he would rise again and that he would see him again... and even despite having the great luck of being chosen he said: “IF I DON'T SEE IT I DON'T BELIEVE IT”. You have to have more faith. If you have true faith the truth comes to you, do not doubt it.

According to this, the Shroud of Turin is not really what it is thought to be. I have been able to see it in real size and I can say that it impresses and does not leave you indifferent. But it must not really be Jesus the humiliated man that he shows us. What do you think?

**7\. YOU CAN MARRY IF YOU WISH, BUT THE LAWS OF PARADISE STRICTLY PROHIBIT A DONOR CHILD FROM LEAVING HUMAN OFFspring.**

This is linked to the above and I think it is clear why he should not leave offspring. But I often wonder if, as a man, Jesus must have had sexual instincts, or desires to start a family and a home... and I have no doubt that he did.

I think that he didn't get married was more a response to the fact that, being an infinitely loving man, he knew perfectly well that he couldn't make a wife happy. He could not give anyone a normal and deserved life, in addition to the fact that for his main work he could not socialize in any way. Nor could he put a wife through the drink and the pain that would entail witnessing the humiliation and cruel execution to which he would be subjected. And no woman of that time could understand the universal significance of her life. It was too much of a burden to put on his shoulders. Not even her own mother could understand what she was doing... until she died. That's why, paradoxically, I don't love any woman precisely out of love for all of them.

The origin of the celibacy of Catholic priests stems from this fact, because they wanted to imitate him instead of being INSPIRED. Didn't Jesus talk about the excellence and value of building a home, and the importance of experiencing parenthood? Also, certain Christians, in their wish that Jesus had a wife, developed the belief in a supposed relationship with Mary Magdalene (which EUB flatly denies) and thus have something else to worship other than normal worship.

**8\. FOR ALL OTHER ISSUES THAT YOU WILL HAVE TO FACE DURING YOUR MORTAL LIFE, WE BELIEVE IN THE GOOD DIRECTION OF YOUR ADJUSTER AND IN THE GOOD JUDGMENT OF YOUR HUMAN MIND. WHEN YOU RETURN TO SONARINGTON AFTER THIS EXPERIENCE, WE WILL WELCOME YOU AS THE SUPREME AND UNCONDITIONAL SOVEREIGN OF THIS UNIVERSE WHICH YOU YOURSELF HAVE CREATED, SERVED AND FULLY UNDERSTANDED.**

I want to highlight the last sentence, because I think it is something that must be reflected on in depth: create, serve and fully UNDERSTAND your own creation.

Before finishing, I wanted to comment on the matter of incarnation, although I can say little about it, since it is one of the great unrevealed secrets of creation, which not even high-ranking angels know or will know. What is the process? Well, I don't know and I don't really care, because I think there are moments in life when you can only TRUST, like when we were children and we blindly trusted our parents without caring how they did things... we just saw that they were always there and that they did what had to be done.

Sometimes things don't need to be explained... it's enough that they are true. Jesus always said that you have to be like a child to be able to enter the kingdom of heaven: you have to trust, you have to have faith... you have to “take risks”.

We must also remember and always keep in mind that Michael and Jesus were not two united beings or sharing a physical body... Jesus and Michael were one and always have been since he was born in Bethlehem... I must admit that in order to try to understand this my intellect is not enough... I must rely on my faith, I must trust, I must “take a chance.”

Jesus was man, but at the same time he was divine. In fact it is the visible revelation of God on Urantia, the face of God that we can best see in our present condition. Jesus was GOD walking among us and, despite the fact that he had a mandate to teach and spiritually elevate men, this God spent more than two thirds of his life busy with the well-being of his earthly family member and helping everyone who came to him. crossed his path. Only when he had the family sufficiently channeled and installed did he dedicate himself to doing his real work. God serving and caring for men... is majestic.

He demonstrated to the entire universe and to ourselves, the transcendental possibilities that a simple human being who KNOWS God can achieve in a brief life like ours; that the road to eternity has been, is and will be open to those who want to travel it. It showed that, after death, a new place is waiting for us to follow that direction that we have voluntarily chosen. In short, his whole life is extraordinarily inspiring to me. I suppose the same thing happens to you.

One day, thanks to _The Urantia Book_, I began to meet a very different Jesus from the one I knew before. There was a moment when I believed that what the book told me was true. I finally took a chance and my faith appeared. And now I BELIEVE, I FEEL, I KNOW perfectly that God is much more than Jesus, than Michael, I have no doubt. But what I am VERY clear about is that, AT LEAST, my Father who is in heaven is like Jesus. Thanks to Jesus I SEE the Father better, I SEE a better part of his personality and his “ways” of doing things. And I like them, go how I like them!

## And if that is God's minimum... how will the maximum be?

To end this presentation, I think it is convenient to remember that the entire incarnation of Miguel is majestic, inspiring, tremendous. For us and for Nebadon it is something exceptional, but it turns out that in the Creation all this is something USUAL. So then I only have to take off my hat to the Father, admiring and grateful for the way in which he has “EVERYTHING” organized.

Going deeper into the incarnation of Michael thanks to _The Urantia Book_ has been one of the biggest and best experiences that have happened to me, and without a doubt it has left a great internal mark on me. I sincerely believe that everyone should go through it at some point. For this reason, I give heartfelt thanks for these stupendous documents to all the personalities involved in these revelations, especially to our intermediate brothers, because thanks to their prayers the revelation of this magnificent and inspiring quarter of the life and teachings of Jesus was possible.

## Questions raised by attendees after listening to the presentation

- Could we consider ourselves Christians?
- Did Jesus change his mind about his initial decision not to perform miracles?
- Taking into account Emanuel's advice to Miguel, could the Shroud of Turin be authentic?
- Is spirituality present in Europe today?
- Could Miguel's bestowal be considered a failure?
- As readers, what do we do and what should we do here?
- What will have become of Judas? Has survived?
