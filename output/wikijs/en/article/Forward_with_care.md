You should learn that the expression of even a good thought must be modulated in accordance with the intellectual status and spiritual development of the hearer.

Melchizedek had warned his followers to teach about the one God, the Father and Maker of all, and to preach only the gospel of divine favor through faith alone. But it has often been the error of the teachers of new truth to attempt too much, to attempt to supplant slow evolution by sudden revolution.

The weakness of the great Ikhnaton's doctrine lay in the fact that he proposed such an advanced religion that only the educated Egyptians could fully comprehend his teachings.

The Jewish religion persisted also because of its institutions. It is difficult for religion to survive as the private practice of isolated individuals. This has ever been the error of the religious leaders: Seeing the evils of institutionalized religion, they seek to destroy the technique of group functioning. In place of destroying all ritual, they would do better to reform it.

Overemphasis of the personality of Jesus in the theology of Christianity has worked to obscure his teachings, and all of this has made it increasingly difficult for Jews, Mohammedans, Hindus, and other Eastern religionists to accept the teachings of Jesus.

The teachers of the religion of Jesus should approach other religions with the recognition of the truths which are held in common (many of which come directly or indirectly from Jesus' message) while they refrain from placing so much emphasis on the differences.

Christianity is threatened by slow death from formalism, over-organization, intellectualism, and other non-spiritual trends.

However, in the long run we can rely upon two quintessential universe realities: “All things work together for good in those who love God,” and from the Urantia revelation,“…the revelation of God to the world, in and through Jesus, shall not fail.” _What is now needed is a volunteer army of truth-seekers who will go “all the way” in living as Jesus lived—***first, at home, then abroad***—whilst remaining secure in the knowledge that “all things work together for good,” and, “the revelation of God to the world, in and through Jesus, shall not fail.”_
