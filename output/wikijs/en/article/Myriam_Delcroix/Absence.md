<p style=“text-align:center”>
A star passes and goes out in the cold silence,</p>
Near the old oak, I watch for your absence,</p>
and your words and your laughter are already slowly fading away.</p>
I lower my head and think of you, tenderly...very tenderly.</p>
The sun falls asleep in its blanket of night.</p>
The tear that flows is not of sadness but of melancholy,</p>
because I know that you already shine in this other universe...</p>
Oh may your soul wait for mine in this light.</p>
It's not a complaint, it's like a distant song</p>
that the wind hums in the arms of the old oak.</p>
It is not a tear that brushes the warmth of my hand,</p>
it's all the space that invades the mist of my eyes.</p>
It's all the space that speaks to me about you.</p>
These are all the galaxies in the heart of a rose.</p>
It is that true love beyond all things.</p>
It’s this whole universe that vibrates with you...</p>
A star passes and goes out in the cold silence,</p>
near the old oak I watch for your absence.</p>
I miss you, it's like a long journey,</p>
but it's not the end, it's not a shipwreck.</p>
It's like a whisper from eternity...</p>
I go back in, I'm no longer cold, the silence spoke to me.</p>
</p>
