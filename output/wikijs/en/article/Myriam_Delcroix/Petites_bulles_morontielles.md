I was waiting for the bus and suddenly in the middle of all these people who were fidgeting around me, who were jostling, who were laughing, who were walking indifferently, I began to think that all these beings who surrounded me, possessed like me a spark of absolute coming from the divine and that we all had the same Father. Then, a surge of Fraternity and love invaded me like a discharge of adrenaline. I suddenly felt so close to all these people that I did not know, that there was no longer any anger, no doubt, no disappointment in me. For a moment, I found myself in a higher dimension. The bus arrived, I fell back to earth, but all day long, happiness accompanied me.

A day of problems lay before me, bills to pay, chores to do, etc. Spasmophilia threatened me! Suddenly a phone call: “Hello, I miss you... a friend was thinking of me. What if we spent a day in the countryside?” she asked me. After a moment's hesitation, I put away the bills, chores, etc. A wonderful day out for a walk, a sumptuous meal of a cone of fries, mayonnaise and a hamburger. In short, everything you need for your figure... No big metaphysical discussions, just the complicity of a friendship also made of lightness. In the evening, back home, morale high, ready to face the grayness of the days. Ah, friendship, what a beautiful gift the gods have given us!

It's been five years since I met you... There were a lot of people in the subway. I sat down in front of you, you were reading a book by Dr. Moody “Life after Life”, I asked you if this kind of book really fascinated you because I knew one that answered all the questions that this kind of reading raised. I was coming out of a Urantia meeting and my blue book was in my bag. When I got off at the station, although you had to go further, you followed me and suggested that we have a drink with you. On the terrace of this café, all afternoon, I talked to you about my dear book, you asked questions and questions, and neither you nor I saw the time go by. At the end of the afternoon, you had fallen in love... with the L.U.! You lived in Spain and were visiting your family in Brussels. Before we left, I gave you my phone number. The months passed and I often thought of you. One day, almost two years later, I received a phone call: “Hello Mrs. Myriam, I don't know if you remember me, almost two years ago, we met in the metro, etc, etc...” You thanked me for giving you the most beautiful gift in the world, a gift that had changed your life, you told me that you had gathered a small group of 5 people with whom you were studying at the L.U. and that your life had taken on a new meaning. I don't know anything about you, not even your first name, but I know that you will always remain in my thoughts.
