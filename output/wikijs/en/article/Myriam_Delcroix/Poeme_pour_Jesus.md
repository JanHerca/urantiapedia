The man walked in his suit of light
bearer of the torch of hope,
and his magic words to men devoid of knowledge,
brought like a momentum, like a force crossing borders.
The man spoke as if attached to the stars
and invisible links connected him to the heavens
and the man in our frozen solitudes tore the veil
which separated us from the power of God.
Man taught us to love, to love even our sufferings,
to love the one who moans,
to no longer fear the heartbreak of absence,
he gave us the keys to the meaning of life.
And in our society where trees are dying
where the noisy bursts of our lives constantly vibrate,
like a light cloud takes hold of a flower
a crazy peace took hold of our hearts.
And in faraway countries where the sun burns even the roots,
his words were sweet to us like a source of hope.
And in the snowy countries where the cold makes us bend our backs
the warmth of his love intoxicated us with its power.
What matters if along the roads of time there are few souls,
few souls really know him...
This strength that he gives us will make us beat the mountains
none of his words will fly away like leaves in the wind,
and everywhere across the arid desert oceans and green countrysides,
one day we will all proclaim our joy,
to be the united children of Urantia.
