I am no longer afraid of these distant roads,
Where the arms of death constantly taunted me.
I am no longer afraid of these uncertain joys,
When my loud laughter wasn't real.

I'm no longer afraid to live without chains,
I rediscover, I sing and I love,
Without any pain, without any hatred...

My God, how good is the sweetness of your listening,
My God, how good he is after so much defeat,
My God, your love is so good.

I sing, I laugh, I dance and I love you,
I talk nonsense and I write poems...
My God, it's good to love you,
To let go, to forget everything.
My God, where does this love come from?
I explode, I exist, I live,
My God, where does this love come from?

I fly, I am a butterfly,
I am a bird, I drink life and am satisfied with it.
Tell me where this whirlwind comes from?
Tell me where this love comes from?

I love you so much that I'm suffocating for life,
And you, secret hidden deep within my being,
Who was only waiting for a flame of love to finally be born,
You who were in me, whom I did not know,
Little spark of God greater than my life,
You great mystery hidden in my infinity,
You were everything but I didn't know it...

So forget my mistakes, forget my fears...

I felt your presence without knowing your voice.

I'm not afraid anymore...
I love you so much that you can only love me.
I'm not afraid anymore,
But I have nothing else to give you, just a simple little kiss,
Of my soul which is no longer afraid to hope.

Myriam Delcroix
