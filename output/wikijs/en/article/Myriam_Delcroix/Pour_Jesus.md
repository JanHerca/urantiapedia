Myriam Delcroix

The man walked in his garment of light carrying the torch of hope,
and his magic words to men devoid of knowledge,
brought like a momentum, like a force crossing borders.

The man spoke as if attached to the stars
and invisible links connected him to the heavens
and the man in our frozen solitudes tore the veil
which separated us from the power of God.

Man taught us to love, to love even our sufferings,
to love the one who moans,
to no longer fear the heartbreak of absence,
he gave us the keys to the meaning of life.

And in our societies where trees are dying
where the noisy bursts of our lives constantly vibrate,
like a light cloud takes hold of a flower
a crazy peace took hold of our hearts.

And in faraway countries where the sun burns even the roots,
his words were sweet to us like a source of hope.
And in the snowy countries where the cold makes us bend our backs
the warmth of his love intoxicated us with its power.

What does it matter if through the roads of time,
few souls, few souls really know him...
This strength that he gives us will make us beat the mountains
none of his words will fly away like leaves in the wind,
and everywhere across the arid desert oceans and green countrysides,

one day we will all proclaim our joy,
to be the united children of Urantia..

> ““But I also am the true shepherd who is willing even to lay down his life for the sheep. The thief breaks into the fold only to steal, and to kill, and to destroy; but I have come that you all may have life and have it more abundantly. He who is a hireling, when danger arises, will flee and allow the sheep to be scattered and destroyed; but the true shepherd will not flee when the wolf comes; he will protect his flock and, if necessary, lay down his life for his sheep. Verily, verily, I say to you, friends and enemies, I am the true shepherd; I know my own and my own know me. I will not flee in the face of danger. I will finish this service of the completion of my Father’s will, and I will not forsake the flock which the Father has intrusted to my keeping.” (<a id="a73_772"></a>[UB 165:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/165#p2_8))
