There is a state of mind that will certainly help us receive the answer to our prayers. Whatever the problem that presents itself to us, however great our need, however urgent, pressing, or desperate the situation appears, serenity will be an immediate help to us. Serenity is the quiet and calm listening to the voice of God, to the exclusion of all others. Serenity is not a static, inactive state of mind. It is a state of peace of mind based on absolute faith in God, in the God who is within us.

Right action inevitably follows serenity, for serenity lifts us above fear, uncertainty, and human limitations. Serenity is that state of mind in which we hear the “still small voice,” the state in which unwavering faith draws the good of God to us, gives us its manifestation.

What happens when we are serene, calm, quiet, with an open mind? The moment we affirm: “I am serene, calm, relaxed and I let God work in me and through me”, we enter into a wonderful peace. This is how we become aware of what we are, each of us, an individualization of God, a radiant center through which His Being shines; we feel His Peace and it is then that God can work through us to bring us all that we need.

Let us be assured that God gives us health, happiness, prosperity, harmony, love, wisdom, success. It is our serenity that allows HIM to do so. It is enough that we are entirely receptive to His Action in us. This receptivity is found in serenity; in a calm, confident state of mind, in which we let go of the apparent difficulty to let God act.

Instead of giving in to thoughts of anxiety, fear, tension, and apprehension, let us calmly affirm: "I am calm, serene; I let God act in me and through me $\%$. We will see that this affirmation, well-felt, will quickly deliver us from our anxieties.

Whatever our problem, let us remember that the pure life of God is constantly flowing and that we are a focal point of the expression of this life. Let it therefore pass freely by refusing to give in to tension, to doubt, to fear. By cultivating serenity, we open ourselves to the current of Life, and we are healed. Ah! Let us not allow our doubts, our fears to cut us off from the incessant flow of divine providence. In serene Faith, in calm confidence, let us open our hearts to accept God's perfect answer to our need.

Let us let go of human means; let God act directly through us, guide us, give us exactly what we need in the way that is for our greatest good. Let us hold firm in scientific, affirmative prayer, to acquire a calm, serene, relaxed state of mind, and remember that God knows what we need and wants to give it to us.

A serene mind knows that it is not necessary to dictate to God the answer to one's prayer, but only to let go of the problem and let God act. Serenity allows us to be in good balance, filled with the Spirit of God's Love, this Spirit which attracts to us the happiness to which we aspire.

It is not through the tension or worry of a possessive spirit that we attract our good, but through a serene desire to let God act in us. Let our prayer therefore be: “I am calm, serene, tranquil; I let God act in me and through me.”

Let us remember that God is our LIFE. In serenity. Let us listen to His Voice in order to follow the path that HE shows us; Let us move forward in absolute Faith, awaiting the best!
