> _This is a statement of a long time _Urantia Book_ reader who was challenged by this pastor to write his view of the purpose of the church._

I believe the church has a high and noble purpose. To actualize this purpose each of us has to find a perspective that simultaneously focuses on the details of the task before us, and the great, creative cosmic framework within which we live, move, and have our being. We must understand the purpose and philosophy of the church and how it applies to the work at hand.

Our statement of purpose must reflect our singular understanding of one fact that is central to the reality of our existence: God's ways are higher than our ways, and always — always — we must seek to discover God's higher ways. Our understanding of these higher ways and ultimate spiritual truths must shape the essence of our statement of purpose; and, if it is to be effective, this objective must focus and mobilize the energies of the church.

The church exists to function in many aspects of ministry, but the greatest of these is to fulfill its mission to spiritually transform human lives. This purpose encompasses and subsumes all other purposes. Through truth, beauty, and goodness communicated in love and exemplified in the life and teachings of Jesus, the kingdom of God is established on earth.

The moment we say that our purpose is to promote the spiritual transformation of humankind by living the teachings of Jesus, we are in the same breath implying at least three things that are immediate, inherent, and of utmost importance.

First, we are saying that the focus of our activity is outward. The church does not exist in and for itself, but rather it functions to foster a loving, dynamic, and transforming interaction among members and nonmembers.

Second, we are saying that we place the emphasis of our strategy on living the teachings of Jesus, not on preaching about his teaching. Our priorities are not Bible-oriented but are focused on what the Bible was given us to facilitate: spiritual growth through the loving service of humanity.

Third, we are saying that the way we will grow as a church is by means of attraction, not proselytizing. We have the resources to become the yeast to expand the lives of all people. In choosing to proceed primarily by the method of attraction, there is nothing in our approach that should be regarded as intrinsically threatening to any individual or group. Always we will be moving forward from a position of deep faith and internal strength.

Members of the church come from all walks of life and represent a great diversity of experience, interests, points of view, and spiritual condition. But against the backdrop of these great differences, I think there are some general beliefs that unite us in a profound common commitment.

First, I think we are united in believing that at the very center of our existence is the knowledge that God is the loving, heavenly Father of each human being. All that has value in human living originates in this filial relationship with God. The spirit of God — the light that enlightens every man and woman who comes into the world — continuously educates and uplifts each person who accepts this leading to progressively higher stages of being. As sons and daughters of God, we therefore recognize all men and women as our brothers and sisters in a worldwide family of God.

Second, we are united in believing that the love of God has never been demonstrated with greater power and beauty than in the life of Jesus of Nazareth, whom we call Master. The religion of Jesus, the foundation of our religious reality, is to seek the Father's will in every act and decision, to become God directed and service oriented.

Third, we are united in believing that this mortal existence is only the brief and intense beginning of eternal life, an adventure of unimaginable growth to higher states of being. By the technique of becoming more and more like the Father, we will someday come to stand in His presence.

Fourth, we are united in believing that the daily work of every person is conducted not in isolation but in relationship with other human beings. The sweat and grind of our daily work, the frustrations and distractions of living, are the most effective conditions for testing the reality and power of our spiritual resources and stature. Nowhere else can the sweet currents of love and mercy be more fully demonstrated.

Fifth, we are united in believing that in its deepest sense, religion is a purely personal experience between the individual and God. And we believe this experience can be full and complete both within and without the framework of organized religion. We seek spiritual unity with all, while encouraging lives of individual freedom, dignity, and originality before God.

No matter how high we lift our spiritual sights, the ultimate translation of our potentials into actual achievements will not come to fruition in the abstract. We must act; we must convert our aspirations into actions, our ideals into qualities of being.
