Any individual who is aware of being conscious and has a balanced mechanism asks himself at some point in his existence the following fundamental questions:
1. Who am I?
2. Where do we come from?
3. Where are we going?
4. What is the purpose of life?

Now let us consider that the answer to these questions (or the knowledge) is separated into two parts by a dividing line.

Anything above this line is poorly understood and not primarily necessary for solving human failings and various global problems.

In this domain come things such as various philosophical and religious visions, metaphysics and mysticism, as well as individual and personal faith linked to these various domains.

Below this dividing line is what is called the finite universe. All things in the finite universe, whether known or not, can be perceived by the senses or measured.

We could place the things known about the finite universe (those we have perceived or measured) in the category of “Scientifically logical and reasonable truths”.

Therefore the factors necessary for the construction of a world where humanity, freed from its failures, could establish itself experientially and evolutionarily in the era of light and life <ins>are found mainly in the finite universe.</ins>

We can discover them, perceive them, measure them and test them. They (the factors) can become scientifically logical and reasonable truths.

Perhaps, dear brother and sister, you are wondering where I am going with this?

Readers of _The Urantia Book_ are likely to be of more than average broad-mindedness, accepting the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man, and submitting to the personal and individual religion of Willing and Doing the will of God.

Readers of The Urantia Book, like all humans on our planet, are subject to the teaching and guidance of a triple endowment: the Spirit of the Father (the Thought Adjuster); the Spirit of the Son (the Spirit of Truth); and the Spirit of the Spirit (the Holy Spirit) (UB 20612062).

We can therefore, with the help of this formidable contact link that is the Internet and in the light of the teachings of the _Urantia Book_, develop theses, antitheses, syntheses <ins>of the various subjects relating to our finite world.</ins>

“For every problem there is a scientifically logical and reasonable solution. When man applies the solution for the greatest good of the greatest number, he contributes to the building of a better world.”

The world is on the verge of major political, sociological, economic, ecological, philosophical and religious readjustments.

Let us think today with ever more sincerity and honesty about our responsibility in the face of planetary and cosmic evolution.

Let’s think today about what we will leave to our children tomorrow!

The world will soon need concrete solutions to these problems and no one should expect their opinion to be taken seriously if they do not have a thorough knowledge of the subject they are speaking about.

Doesn't _The Urantia Book_ tell us that the best way for a tadpole to become a frog is to live its life as a tadpole?

> “Primitive man lived a life of superstitious bondage to religious fear. Modern, civilized men dread the thought of falling under the dominance of strong religious convictions. Thinking man has always feared to be *held* by a religion. When a strong and moving religion threatens to dominate him, he invariably tries to rationalize, traditionalize, and institutionalize it, thereby hoping to gain control of it. By such procedure, even a revealed religion becomes man-made and man-dominated. Modern men and women of intelligence evade the religion of Jesus because of their fears of what it will do *to* them—and *with* them. And all such fears are well founded. The religion of Jesus does, indeed, dominate and transform its believers, demanding that men dedicate their lives to seeking for a knowledge of the will of the Father in heaven and requiring that the energies of living be consecrated to the unselfish service of the brotherhood of man.” (<a id="a75_952"></a>[UB 195:9.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_6))

In the meantime, dear brother and sister, may this idea germinate in you and come to fruition in a creatively evolving way.

Your servants in partnership with the Supreme.
