Choosing a favorite quote to discuss with you is really very difficult, since there are many “favorites” that have emerged over the years as I read and reread this wonderful Revelation, but today I choose the following:

> Do not try to satisfy the curiosity or gratify all the latent adventure surging within the soul in one short life in the flesh. Be patient! be not tempted to indulge in a lawless plunge into cheap and sordid adventure. Harness your energies and bridle your passions; be calm while you await the majestic unfolding of an endless career of progressive adventure and thrilling discovery. (<a id="a41_388"></a>[UB 195:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p5_10))

This is one of the quotes I call “advice.” We have in the book a lot of information; a new cosmology, new paradigms, new ways of thinking about Deity and how to get closer and closer to the Universal Father and his extensive heavenly family; also information on science, history, philosophy, and other aspects of Revelation. And we have thoughts that give us advice to apply today in the here and now. Like the quote I just copied.

I'm going to analyze it in parts:

> “Do not try to satisfy the curiosity or gratify all the latent adventure surging within the soul in one short life in the flesh...”

They are warning us that a number of possible adventures that we would like to live will surely arise in our soul and that they are always and will be latent throughout our short life as material human beings, but that we should not try to satisfy the curiosity of living them all!

> “Be patient!”

This is the advice that the Revelators give us, and they put it with exclamation points for emphasis! This is the call they send us: Patience!

And follow the definition of what we should avoid:

> “Don't be tempted to indulge in a lawless plunge into cheap and sordid adventure.”

Each of us may have a different set of values when trying to interpret what is meant by “cheap and seedy fling”, and each of us will know where to apply that definition and what we should avoid.

And here come a couple of poetic ideas that are for me the advice and the key to remember this quote:

> “Harness your energies and bridle your passions...”

It seems that energy is something to take care of, that it is not unlimited and that we must use it intelligently while we control our human passions without giving ourselves uncontrollably to what does not benefit us.

To reaffirm the idea they tell us:

> “...be calm while you await the majestic unfolding of an endless career of progressive adventure and thrilling discovery.”

This is the prize that is anticipated for us if we achieve the conquest of eternal life. The majestic development of our life in the “Kingdom of Heaven” will come. True adventures worth living along with exciting discoveries will come soon; For this we must remain calm and patient, taking care of our energies and controlling our temporary passions.

We know that we have all the necessary help to achieve the goal. The Father, the Son and the Spirit give us everything we need for the achievement of the Divine Plan that lies ahead. I hope success crowns our efforts!!

Fraternal greetings, fellow readers of _The Urantia Book_.
