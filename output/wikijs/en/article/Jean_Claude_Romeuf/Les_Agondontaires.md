How lucky you are, you agondontaries because you will find yourselves “_entrusted very early with many special assignments in cosmic enterprises where unquestioned faith and sublime confidence are essential for success._”

Of this faith and this trust, there is no doubt, you are the torch because not only is your belief in God incontestable, but you know deep down inside that God is good and that he loves you like a father.

Being an agondontarian means being able to “believe without seeing, persevere in isolation and triumph over almost insurmountable difficulties”

Now, when I look back on my memories, I see the house where I grew up. My friends asked me why do you believe in God? This belief was so obvious to me that I classified as liars anyone who said they did not believe in him.

We cannot show a photograph of God to our friends, we must accept it. It is a shame because I know that many people ask to see in order to believe! I ask myself the question: is it not better to believe in order to see?

In other words, does God reveal himself to those who do not believe in him? Spiritual growth is maintained through dialogue between Him and us. Courage, sincerity, effort and decisions are essential factors in the acquisition of survival values. However, to become an agondontarian, one must first survive.

I don't know if I am an agondontarius, experience will perhaps tell me, because if I fulfill the first condition which is to believe without seeing, I am not sure of satisfying the following two which are: “to persevere in isolation and triumph over insurmountable difficulties”.

Tell me, friends, I have some advice to ask you. I have some hesitation in choosing my career and I would like to have your opinion. I may have to be satisfied with the simple status of Finaliter, but I would still like to be able to continue my studies and become a Trinitized Son of God.

At present I am only a Son of God by faith, but in a short time, when I come near Jerusem, I hope to fuse with my Adjuster. From that time on, I will be classed as an ascending Son of God. Thus, nothing will be able to prevent me from reaching Paradise and becoming a Finaliter. It is only a matter of days!

My dearest wish would be to reach the rank of Powerful Messenger. I don't know if it's possible, because for that I would have to have “undergone an insurrectional experience and acted loyally in the face of the rebellion”. I would have to have behaved like the true agondontaries who remain loyal in isolation and believe without seeing. But alas, Lucifer's rebellion did not last long enough! Indeed, only two years after the beginning of the rebellion, Lanaforge came to hold the reins of the Satania System. And so, Lucifer and his acolytes, although free to move around as they pleased, had their hands tied, in a way. What luck presented itself to the Jerusemic ascenders of that time! Indeed, they “placed themselves in a position to become future Powerful Messengers”.

I hope that the word “agondontary” applies to all those who, deprived of the circuits of the Constellation, remain faithful to their unlimited faith in God. This is my case, but I cannot say that I have much merit, for Jesus came to announce the good news to me two thousand years ago and I am now enjoying the benefits of the revelation of the _Urantia Book_.

Too bad perhaps for the career of Mighty Messenger! But in any case, it's sure! I will do what I can to be embraced by the Trinity of Paradise. What would you choose in my place? Raised in Authority or Devoid of Name and Number?

> “_You mortals who read this message may yourselves ascend to Paradise, attain the Trinity embrace, and in remote future ages be attached to the service of the Ancients of Days in one of the seven superuniverses, and sometime be assigned to enlarge the revelation of truth to some evolving inhabited planet, even as I am now functioning on Urantia._” ([UB 22:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/22#p4_7))
