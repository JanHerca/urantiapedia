There are evenings when one is a little tired, from work, from the weariness of finding oneself alone at home and from the feeling that the whole world is marking time, that the ideas sketched out by friends bear no resemblance to the ideals that one would like to see suddenly emerge from their lips. So, one prepares a good meal and sits down sadly drinking two or three glasses of good wine.

That evening, a friend came to sit next to me, without eating, without drinking and without speaking. But, without seeing her, I felt her presence. I heard her whisper to me: “You eat too much, you're going to get fat; you drink too much, you're going to be sick!” Then, there was a little revolt in me and I answered her out loud: “You speak like my Father!” I reminded myself that my earthly father had been dead for a long time and that he was no longer there to guide me on the path of righteousness. Suddenly, a flood of thoughts materialized in my brain, in my mind or in my soul, I don't know in which place of my personality or my identity for the purists.

I understood at that moment that many thoughts I had had in the past had been transformed into ideals and that even if the whole world could not share them, these ideals were part of a personal endowment that no human being could steal from me.

That evening, I started writing the following few sentences on the internet:

"I, who without a shadow of a doubt have no inclination toward homosexuality, I who am not sexually attracted to any creature of my kind, wish to speak before you on behalf of those who do not express the same affection that I do for the opposite sex. God created man and woman to perpetuate themselves on earth, to cradle their offspring and to raise them up to God, the Father of us all, by enabling them to develop a potentially eternal soul. But this does not concern the mechanism of personal ascension. I consider all men who aspire to a purpose beyond human limitations and who have not refused spiritual growth, that is, those who are not now deprived of an Adjuster because they have not fallen to the rank of animals, to be my brothers! The important thing for us is to journey toward Him and what does it matter if it is not by the lighted path in the way of heterosexuality! The ascension towards God is never done alone, there must always be an accompanying presence. I am ready to go and find the one who will accompany me to heaven, to the ends of the earth! It will not be a man, that's for sure! But I keep the hope that it will be a woman.

If this were not the case, God would not leave me alone to accomplish this task towards Him because it is not good to live in solitude. An angel perhaps or another celestial creature with whom for the moment, I have no affinity and who does not have the slightest earthly resemblance to me, will perhaps share my path to Paradise. Also, far from judging those who do not express here below the same sexual attractions as me, I want to be their spokesperson and encourage them in their choice. What matters is the love that a being can feel for another, because by loving the other he also loves his Eternal Father and so much the worse for the uses of civilization and ancestral customs! Only love matters! When love is present, there is no need to consider personal morality or social ethics. God does not care much about the way of approaching Him, provided that love is present! I embrace you all, you who do not necessarily share what I have just said, because each one, on their way.
