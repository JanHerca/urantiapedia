Words of love
Are murmurs and sighs,
Lips wet with desire.
Words of love,
It's dust and wind
Flying away by enchantment
To infinity.

Words of love
Are lights and voices
That we surprise deep inside ourselves.
Words of love,
It’s a smile, a tender look,
A call that we don't know how to hear
And who drowns.

Words of love
Are the fountains of youth,
The deep waters of silence.
Words of love,
When the face is scarlet,
These are shells that explode
And which kill us.

Words of love
Are the color palette
Which a painter spreads gently.
Words of love,
It's a bouquet of flowers received
By the one we no longer expected
And who comes back.

Words of love
Like flickering lamps
Make girls' eyes sparkle.

Jean-Claude Romeuf
