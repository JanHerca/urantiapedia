Any monotheistic religion referring to an infinite God admits the omnipotence of God.

For the reader of _The URANTIA Book_ as for the one who, refusing the static creeds of religious majorities, seeks to penetrate the mystery of God, believing in this is not contrary to his approach.

If, like Jung, we do not accept speaking of God by hearsay, but we try to meet him through personal religious experience, we can, in an intimate conviction, thanks to a curious observation, affirm that the Heavenly God is not omnificient (<a id="a38_239"></a>[UB 112:2.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p2_17)), that is to say that by voluntarily limiting his action, he does not do everything that is.

In the realms of SpaceTime, creation has been under the control of the Supreme Creators since the advent of the current Age of Supremacy following the Age of Havona.

The study which follows aims to be a reflection on the Supreme which will perhaps give the illusion of a relative understanding.

As illogical as it may seem, it is easier to understand the personalities that populate the Grand Universe from the top of the pyramid, that is to say from the Original, than to try to understand the Creator from the creature. To do this, it is necessary to take into account what is revealed and from the most mysterious to the best known: the reasoning may therefore seem absurd (<a id="a44_382"></a>[UB 19:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/19#p1_5)).

God the Supreme originates in the Paradise Trinity (<a id="a46_52"></a>[UB 16:3.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p3_15)) and since Havona exists, God the Supreme has existed. He therefore possesses the characteristic qualities of the three primary Deities:

- from the Eternal Father he receives personality,
- from the Eternal Son he receives the mind-spirit,
- from the Conjoint Actor he receives the material mind as well as the potentiality of power-energy.

It is possible to imagine a relationship between the Trinity and the Supreme Mind comparable to that of the Adjuster and the human mind (<a id="a52_137"></a>[UB 115:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p5_1)).

Before the appearance of the Seven Superuniverses, the action of the Supreme was purely spiritual within Havona itself (<a id="a54_120"></a>[UB 56:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p6_2)).

When we speak of God the Supreme, we are speaking both of a Deity present in Havona and of a Divine Personality devoid of actuality (<a id="a56_133"></a>[UB 14:6.23](/en/The_Urantia_Book/14#p6_23)) energy-power.

God the Supreme acquires his Power, within the seven Superuniverses under the effect of a double movement.

- centripetal: the pilgrims of time ascend towards it loaded with spiritual, mental and cosmic experience.
- centrifugal: the Supreme creators go in search of creatures and experience the life of the beings they created on their sphere of origin.

Until the completion of his advent, marking the limit of evolutionary growth of the Superuniverses, the Supreme Being will experience the unification of creature and Creator. Thus the Supreme Being synthesizes creature and Creator into one Deity (<a id="a63_247"></a>[UB 117:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p1_5)).

As the material or morontia mind becomes spiritualized, the Supreme Mind unifies the attributes of power and personality proportionally (<a id="a65_137"></a>[UB 116:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p1_2)).

When we speak of the Supreme Being, we are speaking of a unification of the three phases of Deity reality: God the Supreme (spirit), the Supreme Almighty (energy), the Supreme Mind (mental) (see <a id="a67_195"></a>[UB 22:7.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/22#p7_11)).

According to <a id="a69_13"></a>[UB 106:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/106#p5_2), we know that the personal qualities of the Supreme (God) are inseparable from the non-personal prerogatives of the Almighty: it is the personality-power synthesis of the Supreme Being.

To say that God the Supreme is only a personality without power is undoubtedly an exaggeration. Indeed, as God present in Havona, he possesses all infinity of power (although he is not absolute) and therefore all possibility of Action. He derives his omnipotence from the trinity itself, but within Havona the Almighty is not actual.

It must not be forgotten that the Supreme is the God of the Finite; therefore he desires to experience his children as the Creator Sons experience the creature. It is in the finite reality of the seven Superuniverses that God the Supreme actualizes himself as Almighty and experiences power, through the Sons of the local Universes. His Supreme Mind contains all the potential and knows all the actuality of his power.

The Supreme Being realizes the union of the triodities of actuality and potentiality (<a id="a75_86"></a>[UB 115:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p6_3)).

We can perhaps hazard a comparative hypothesis between the path that the Supreme takes to reach man and that which man takes in the opposite direction to reach divinity.

Indeed, the God of Havona, mind-spirit-personality, possesses Power, but this power-energy is not manifested or factualized.

Conversely, man, initially a simple mental energy and potential spirit, is endowed with free will, but not with true freedom. Free will allows man to choose or not the divine directives. However, as long as he has not made the choice to hand over his will to the complete custody of the one who adjusts his thought, man is not free from his destiny. Survival depends on this choice. Only religious life can make freedom possible. It is the spiritual or divine path that allows man to find true freedom.

Following the example of the Paradise Deity, I had thought that during the realization of the first experiential Trinity, that is to say the Ultimate Trinity, the Supreme Being and the Supreme Creative Personalities would also delegate their power of action or else all power would have become useless to them: the Supreme Being, recognized as such by all his creation, would get rid of the prerogatives of all power and would then become God the Supreme again. At least that is what the revelations of Melchizedek of Nebadon had led me to suppose at <a id="a83_551"></a>[UB 106:8.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/106#p8_10).

But <a id="a85_4"></a>[UB 0:12.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p12_7), the Divine Advisor of Orvonton mentions the Supreme Being and not God the Supreme as part of the Ultimate Trinity.

On the other hand, on the same pages and in the following paragraphs, the two revelators agree to say that God the Supreme will be one of the three components of the Absolute Trinity. What will then become of the power-energy of the Almighty?
