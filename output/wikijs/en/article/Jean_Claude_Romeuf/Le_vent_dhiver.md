The winter wind is cold
This evening,
But you,
my love, you're leaving.

As the winter wind blows through the clouds,
Carrying away birds of passage in spite of himself,
Life also moves towards other horizons
Far beyond the cries, to the happiness of songs

That the fairies cast like spells
So that words of love turn into snow.
Maybe one day you will have to remember
That I put your hand nice and warm in mine.

The winter wind is cold
This evening,
But you,
My love, you are leaving.

Should we have died in the battle,
For the wind to stop and winter to go away?
In spring the beautiful days return without delay
May the bird, the phoenix, rise from its ashes

I had built for you, my little stranger,
Near the fireplace, a nest in the cottage.
Happiness is everywhere when you know how to catch it,
But like the blue bird, the wind carried it away.

The winter wind is cold
This evening,
But you,
My love, you are leaving.

We should always pursue a star,
Let her not be hidden under a veil;
Fear is often the cause of our ills.
It hardens hearts and loses ideals.

When you leave to cross space,
Put on a little of the perfume that I gave you in Grasse,
And sow them far and wide when a meteor passes;
I will know your path and love you again.

Jean-Claude Romeuf
