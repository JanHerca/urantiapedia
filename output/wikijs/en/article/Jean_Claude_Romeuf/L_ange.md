Flora was playing on the beach, a beach like all beaches: with the sea in front, blue or gray as you prefer, that's not important. What matters is to imagine the little girl playing alone on the sand, at the edge of the sea.

An angel landed near her. She had known about the existence of angels for a long time. Seeing one was therefore possible. She was not overly surprised by this sudden apparition, which she did not consider to be a supernatural phenomenon. The form the angel took is no more important than the color of the sea, and I will not give in to the temptation to describe it here. What matters is to imagine Flora talking with the angel.

“What are you doing?” asked the celestial being. “I combine business with pleasure,” replied Flora. “With the bucket you see, I am emptying and filtering the entire sea into the hole I dug in the sand.”

“Hmm! I've heard that somewhere before,” murmured the angel. “You won't succeed. I'm the one who...” “I know,” Flora said, “you said it was easier to make all the water in the sea pass through this hole than to solve the mystery of the Trinity. I heard that in catechism.”

“Well, I have decided to tackle the impossible,” continued Flora, “it's the time I lack to empty the water from the sea, otherwise, I know I would succeed. I believe that everything that exists is destined to be known and I want to know everything. I'm in no hurry because I will have eternity to understand the whole reality of the universe; it will be really motivating! I don't think that God is this taciturn character, hidden in a lost corner of paradise and enjoying an eternal happiness that he shares with a few chosen ones who spend their time sunbathing and turning around on the beach. Little by little, over the millennia of eternity, he reveals himself to us, while we discover the workings of the world and the mysteries of life. We are not yet capable of understanding and loving everything, that's all! My hope is harder than iron.”

“Bravo for your stubbornness! I have to admit that you are not entirely wrong and I find there your stubbornness, your testudidge as you say in the Cévennes. I also recognize that the greatest satisfaction one can have is the accomplishment of something that one believed impossible. In the meantime, use your most useful brain portion. They say in heaven that humans are creatures with two brains. I believe that you have an intelligence brain and a stupidity brain. Although you are not completely stupid and even that you can sometimes show intelligence, you use your stupidity brain too often. This is what happens when you speak or act without thinking or when you do not take into account the hard lessons of existence.”

“I thought angels only gave advice when asked!...Did I upset him? Ugh! He left.”
