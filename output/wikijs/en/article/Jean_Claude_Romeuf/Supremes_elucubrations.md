In the introduction to The Urantia Book, it can be noted that the Supreme Being is a trinitarian component of the first experiential Trinity while it is God the Supreme who participates in the advent of the Absolute Trinity.

What might seem like a detail at first glance, is perhaps not written there without reason. Indeed, during the Age of Supremacy which is the current age of time and space, God the Supreme, by acquiring his _All Power_ is emerging as the Supreme Being. This grandiose event, at the limits of space and time, will give rise to the accomplishment of the Ultimate Trinity.

In the transcendental era of the Ultimate, it could be that the Supreme Being followed the example of the Universal Father who delegated his creative powers to the Eternal Son and the Conjoint Actor. For this to happen, the Supreme Being would have to tend to lose his Omnipotence during the four ages of Ultimacy and then become God the Supreme again to finally establish with God the Ultimate and the Consummator of universal destiny, the second experiential Trinity. This apparent retroactivity and turning back on himself of God the Supreme can in no way be a loss in deity or in divinity quality. Like the Universal Father who, despite his voluntary limitation in creative powers, retains the prerogative of personality and Thought Adjusters, it is not forbidden to think that the Supreme, in surrendering his power, does not acquire new unsuspected and unrevealed functions.

We know from reading The Urantia Book that the Almighty benefits from the experience of the creatures of time and space. At the spiritual death of every being populating the seven superuniverses, everything that has not succeeded in surviving individually or personally, but which has value, is taken into account and preserved in the oversoul of the Almighty. It is therefore logical to suppose that in abandoning his omnipotence, he then returns to the cosmos of the four ages of the Ultimate the aborted personalities and the animals (other than the spornagias) as individualities not having reached a level of total perfection in the first five adjutant mind spirits. Why could not the animals also, during the later ages, develop the equivalence of the spirits of worship and wisdom?

We could therefore expect that the advent of the Supreme Being (certainly simultaneous with the Ultimate Trinity), the passage through the different ages of ultimacy until the advent of the Absolute Trinity would be accompanied by resurrections of a magnitude disproportionate to the human mind.
