I could have told you: “Wait a little, wait until my guitar cries as it says goodbye to you.”

But no, I won't cry because I'm not sad. On the contrary, I'm happy for you. You're ready now for another adventure.

This world had to pass. This world is only an episode to be crossed in the course of eternal life. Do you remember the evenings when we cast our eyes among the stars. You said: “this is our path.” Then, we looked at the horizon, Sagittarius.

We talked a lot, but the most beneficial were the moments of silence because in the evening everything rests and dreams are open to the Spirit. God, how good it is to let yourself be invaded by you!

You and I knew that with every passing moment a divine spark warms our hearts and gives divine value to our earthly experiences. We knew that we would never lie beneath the earth.

We knew that life is sacred, even if it is hard. You were not made of wood from which flutes are made. I know that the disappointments and vicissitudes of life were only a springboard that allowed you to bounce back by enhancing your courage, your hope, your faith and your love.

We laughed like children when we talked about how lucky we were to be alive! We knew that one day we would be in the presence of God. I often think of this phrase: “Blessed are those who mourn, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” Yes, but we could add: “provided that despair does not subject them to the slavery of matter and does not cut them down like a withered trunk.”

You were neither a reed that bends, nor an oak that the wind uproots. Of course your feet rested on the earth, but your soul was ready to fly away. It is done! I am happy for you.

When you hold out to heaven the grail of your life, like the Magi who offered Jesus gold, incense and myrrh, I know that you will not be afraid. You will smile because your trust in God has no limits. No doubt you will say: “Here is my Father, the crystal clear water that you helped me to draw. It is the guarantee of sure values. I place it in your hands so that you may preserve it for me throughout eternity.”

Dear Jean, I must now leave you, because for the moment, we are not made to live together. I remind you, in case you have forgotten, of the promise we made to each other: the first of us to leave this planet will go and welcome the other in the resurrection rooms. So I am counting on you and would be very angry if you were not near me when I open my eyes to the world of houses!
