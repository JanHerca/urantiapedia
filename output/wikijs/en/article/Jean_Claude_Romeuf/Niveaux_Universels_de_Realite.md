It may seem that the French translation of “Transcendentals, This superfinite level (antecedently) follows finite progression” into “Ce niveau suprafini suit la progression finie (en l'anticipant)”, could be confusing. It must be understood that the plans for the creation of the Master Universe are under the control of the Architects of the Master Universe. There were plans for the genesis of the finite which were therefore prior to the finite and at this moment there are plans for the formation of the exterior spaces which will be inhabited after the Age of the Supreme. The Transcendental level therefore does not follow the progression of the finite at the same time as it anticipates it. This level preceded the finite and prepares its continuation. It prepares the Age of the Ultimate and follows its spatial direction. To say that it follows the progression of the finite at the same time as it anticipates it seems to me to be an error. This would contravene the logic of creation: a square cannot be round!

In connection with this, it is interesting to note that the Master Organizers do not work much within the boundaries of the Grand Universe but are much more active in outer space. When we appeal to the “I Am” to understand the differentiation of the Qualified and the Unqualified, we must not lose sight of the fact that this theory is hypothetical. Although it is not included in reality, it has the merit of giving us a glimpse of the origin of things and beings. There are seven Absolutes which are all existential, that is to say they have been since all eternity. But only the Universal Father is original. The three existential persons of the Trinity satisfy a personal experience through the three Experiential Absolutes.

All spatial, material potential is contained in the Unqualified Absolute and depends on the Eternal Isle of Paradise. All mental and spiritual potential is contained in the Deity Absolute and depends on the Trinity. As for the Universal Absolute, it is more difficult to define it, but we can put forward the idea that it is the creative potential of the eternal present moment, that is to say that it is the fact where the potential is transformed into the actual, the moment where the project is transformed into reality, but this, in a continuous way and without the possibility of exhaustion of its potentiality. It is the permanent potential of the creative moment.

Only the Universal Father is Infinite, but infinity is hypothetical. It precedes all beginnings and is in similarity to the pre-existential unqualified I Am. It is also posterior to experiential destinies and is in similarity to the post-experiential I Am.

The Deity encountered on the absolute level, being distributive of itself, it was necessary for subabsolute levels to exist for creation to occur. It was therefore necessary for plans to be developed accordingly. Being able to explain the nature of the Architects of the Master Universe would require the possession of a mind functioning in the absonite. But, it is not forbidden to think that these Transcendental beings could each represent a living concept of the Trinity of Paradise for a creative purpose. In this way, they would be neither creators nor creatures; they would therefore not be created, but would be the exteriorization of a concept! This is a bit like what happens with the sons trinitized by creatures. And as luck would have it, these trinitized sons become the wards of the Architects of the Master Universe and are put in reserve while waiting for the Age of the Ultimate. The role these threads will have to play on the levels of outer space is beyond doubt as they are living concepts usable for destiny.
