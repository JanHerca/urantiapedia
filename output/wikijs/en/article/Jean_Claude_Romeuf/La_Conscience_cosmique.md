From a mental perspective, the development of cosmic consciousness is not so much about discovering and understanding the laws of rotation of planets, suns and galaxies, as it is about feeling and intellectualizing the benevolence of the universe.

This clairvoyance becomes spiritual because it involves the recognition of a loving First Cause and comes from a revelation of divinity requiring the constancy of personal choice between good and evil, truth and error. It is accompanied and balanced by an increase in sensitivity to the perception of beauty in the apparent ugliness of things.

It is the fruit of the loving communion of the divine and the human. It is the very revelation of the inner spirit, the whispering but perceptible voice of God.

It demonstrates the superiority of personal religion over the creeds of theological religions.

It gives the personality a broader vision of reality and reinforces the certainty of security.

It pushes back the limits of fear, because it allows the understanding of the usefulness or better, the necessity of the trials of life on an experiential world. Thus, it makes one acquire strength and greatness, and allows man to flourish with charm.

It marks the exact position of the individual in the universe, revealing his irreplaceable and original character, as the only son of God and a cosmic citizen.

In summary, it shows the path to true freedom.

His name, like ours, is eternally inscribed on the symbolic banner of the Brotherhood of Celestial Beings.
