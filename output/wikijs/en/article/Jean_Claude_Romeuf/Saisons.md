A quick phone call,
It's breaking the silence,
The cry of a birth
A spring morning.
A quick phone call,
It's a little tenderness,
Time for a caress
Given to a child.

A quick phone call,
It's happiness that dances
In the three beats of a waltz
In the triumphant summer.
A quick phone call,
It's a slippery chord
At the guitarist's fingers
Towards the setting sun.
A quick phone call,
It's a heart that shivers
Under an autumn rain
And falls asleep dreaming.
A quick phone call,

It's a bridge that we cross,
A rainbow that pours
Streams of diamonds.

A quick phone call
Flying into space,
It's a love that passes
Winter in the firmament.
A quick phone call
When the voice cracks,
It’s the goodbye that we keep
Of the one who leaves.

Jean-Claude Romeuf,
