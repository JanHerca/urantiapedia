The true depth of a mind or soul can only be seen in clarity.
One can lie with sincerity if one deceives oneself. To be clear-sighted in one's thoughts, for oneself and for others, is to be just.
Who am I? If not nothing, I who remain only a shadow for you and for myself!
To be clear! To hide nothing! To keep the door of secrets open! To use your eyes as a mirror in which I see myself!
The power to read the quality of your love and accept you as you are without judgment is the measure of my love's capacity.

Jean-Claude Romeauf
