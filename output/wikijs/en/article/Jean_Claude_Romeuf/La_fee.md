The boat showed me many landscapes
I have met fairies on every continent
Madness helped me overcome mirages
But I sometimes succumbed to it for long periods of time.
When I no longer heard blowing in the clouds
The wind from the sky rushing into my heart
I lost my compass and found the storm
Who capsized the hours of happiness
My angel I am waiting for you like a promised fairy
Who traces the path of the stars and the wind
Beyond the sun, a breeze is taking shape
May the sailors here welcome with song
But the wickedness of this world is indifferent
The wind coming from the sky that I listen to while crying
For men defeated by their own misery
No longer believe in the fairy who guides them while dancing
My body is covered with the worst tattoos
Life wounds that bleed for a long time
What does it matter if the wind blows in the clouds?
Because it is you my love, you alone that I am waiting for.

Jean-Claude Romeuf
