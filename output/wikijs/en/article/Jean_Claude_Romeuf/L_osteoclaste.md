I cannot do without the osteoclast. I know this from experience. Each time the bone undergoes trauma, the osteoclasts, which are small cells, are mobilized to the bruised area. Their purpose is to digest the bone part that has become useless. This destruction, permitted by Shiva, brings in a multitude of young cells that secrete new bone. In this case and certainly in most cases, regeneration is necessarily subsequent to the destruction.

I know this from experience. The other day, a friend, luckily she was one!, came to see me so that I could load an implant that I had fitted three months earlier. I was sure of my case. A simple thing and I had not made any technical errors. Everything should have worked like clockwork! “What medication have you taken since then?” “Nothing important, just something to strengthen the bones, my doctor prescribed it for me”. I checked the Vidal: substance based on bisphosphonates, molecules that inhibit osteoclasts. I understood right away! I understood that my implant had had little chance of integrating into the bone, because the osteoclasts had been unable to play their role of activating osteosynthesis.

So I began to meditate. I told myself that what happened to the bone, happened to the whole of creation. I told myself that to grow, one must inevitably undergo a permanent destruction of oneself. The God Shiva wants it that way! If we look back to the past, we realize that our unfortunate experiences have made us what we are; we realize that we have grown since then. We also realize that we had to renounce our ancient beliefs to accept new ones. We could have lived in the tracks of popular beliefs and trusted the majority opinion, entered religion, we preferred the tangent and we did well. New horizons now present themselves before us because we have renounced a part of a past that did not satisfy us intellectually.

We live in an eternal present, it is the present alone that we should be concerned about. It alone is important and should be the only value that concerns us. The future should not be viewed with fear, it should only be a source of hope, a certainty in the benevolence of the universe or rather, in the benevolence of the one who directs it, a God who is not a redeemer, but a being endowed with infinite saving properties. We have exchanged our beliefs for a true faith, faith in a God of goodness; this is why, by placing our destiny under his control, we are no longer afraid of the future. It does not matter where we are going or think we are going. We know that we are citizens of a fraternal cosmos eager for perfection.

I don't think I'm of a particularly jealous temperament, but if Hindus have an osteoclast God, I want one too! I first thought of an antagonist of the Universal Absolute. It doesn't fit if creation and destruction are inseparable. There is as much potential in destruction as in creation. The three absolutes are the activators of both.

Furthermore, these three absolutes are not gods. We know that the Second experiential Trinity will be or could be formed if it comes to fruition, by God the Supreme, God the Ultimate and the Consummator of destiny.

Since a Trinity can only be active through relationships of deity and personality, the Consummator of destiny is necessarily a person and a God.

He is an experiential being. His concept necessarily takes its source in the Master Spirits. I do not think I am wrong in saying that he is not absolute and that he is contemporary with the Supreme and the Ultimate. Like them, he has his main residence in Paradise, but he has a secondary apartment in the worlds of time and space, inhabited or not, which he tends to engulf.

To say that I love this God who has not been revealed to me and for whom, however, I have made some hypotheses would be an unforgivable lie. I know, however, that my destiny is consumed and built at the same time. I know that there is no growth possible without affliction, without self-denial and without constructive decision, but not being a masochist for two cents, I do not see how I could pray to this osteoclast God to send me additional suffering. Heaven will take care of it all by itself, I know very well that I am not at the end of my troubles. Is it the question? “To be or not to be.”
