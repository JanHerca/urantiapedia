<p style="text-align:center;">
The tulip bloomed on the soldier's helmet,<br>
In Arabic tulip was the name of Allah.<br>
I who had picked it from the rock of Mount Palmyra,<br>
I mixed perfumes with my bursts of laughter.<br>
<br>
White, the dancing dervish and the slipping dress,<br>
Flutter in the silk and turn the chalice.<br>
Like the aroma of the wind in the air hides,<br>
The breath of the flower undulates deep in the soul.<br>
<br>
The tulip is the vase into which I poured,<br>
Many blessed sorrows and broken dreams,<br>
The wine of bitterness and the dew of the meadows.<br>
I found in tears, the smile of fairies.<br>
<br>
Soon I will fly to the rock of Mount Palmyra<br>
To give to my God, gold, incense and myrrh,<br>
And dew wine in the crystal cup<br>
Which the Arab one day engraved on metal.<br>
</p>
