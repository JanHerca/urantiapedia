Prior to Jesus' bestowal his brother Creator-Son, Immanuel, advised: "In this bestowal you have voluntarily divested yourself from all extra-planetary support and special assistance.

> Just as your mortal sons and daughters are entirely dependent upon you for safe conduct throughout their universe career, so must you be wholly dependent upon the Paradise Father for similar safe conduct. (<a id="a38_208"></a>[UB 120:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p1_3))

> By doing so, when you have finished the bestowal experience, you will know in vert truth the full meaning and the rich significance of that same **faith trust that you so unvaryingly require your mortal children to master.**" (<a id="a40_229"></a>[UB 120:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p1_3))

Immanuel added, “After you are sufficiently self-conscious of your divine identity, I council you to assume the additional task of terminating the Lucifer rebellion, and to do this as the 'Son of Man'—a wholly mortal creature of the realm.”

This adds up to Jesus' bestowal life being lived wholly as a normal human being but in total faith-trust in God—at least until after his baptism when he began to become conscious of his divinity.

Partial, incomplete, and evolving intellects would be helpless in the master universe, would be unable to form the first rational thought pattern, were it not for the innate ability of all mind, high or low, to form a universe frame in which to think.

If mind cannot fathom conclusions, if it cannot penetrate to true origins, then will such mind unfailingly postulate conclusions and invent origins that it may have a means of logical thought within the frame of these mind-created postulates. And while such universe frames for creature thought are indispensable to rational intellectual operations, they are, without exception, erroneous to a greater or lesser degree.

Nothing which human nature has touched can be regarded as infallible. Through the mind of man divine truth may indeed shine forth, but always of relative purity and partial divinity. The creature may crave infallibility, but only the Creators possess it.

True and genuine inward certainty does not in the least fear outward analysis, nor does truth resent honest criticism. You should never forget that intolerance is the mask covering up the entertainment of secret doubts as to the trueness of one's belief.

No person is at any time disturbed by a neighbor's attitude when that person has perfect confidence in the truth of that which is wholeheartedly believed. Courage is the confidence of thoroughgoing honesty about those things which one professes to believe. 

> _But long before reaching Havona, the ascendant children of time have learned to feast upon uncertainty, to fatten upon disappointment, to enthuse over apparent defeat, to invigorate in the presence of difficulties, to exhibit indomitable courage in the face of immensity, and to exercise unconquerable faith when confronted with the challenge of the inexplicable. Long since, the battle cry of these pilgrims became: “In liaison with God, nothing—absolutely nothing—is impossible.”_ (<a id="a56_487"></a>[UB 26:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/26#p5_3))

> He who would do good to another must do it in minute particulars. The general good is the plea of the scoundrel, hypocrite, and flatterer.
> _William Blake_

> If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts, but if he will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties.
> _Francis Bacon_
