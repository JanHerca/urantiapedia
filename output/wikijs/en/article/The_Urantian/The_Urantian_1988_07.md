## Springtime: A Study Of The Future

Since readers of _The URANTIA Book_ are surely interested in the subject of prophesy, it may be opportune and helpful to study more deeply what our book says about the relatively near future.

The most significant things Jesus said about it are to be found in section 2 of Paper 176, wherein he said: “_The things which you now look down upon are coming to an end, but this will be a new beginning out of which the gospel of the kingdom will go to all the world and this salvation will spread to all peoples. And when the kingdom shall have come to its full fruition, be assured that the Father in heaven will not fail to visit you with an enlarged revelation of truth..._” ([UB 176:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_3))

## Dedication

_Editor's note: The following words of deep commitment of one's life to our Father were discovered in the author's personal papers after he departed to begin his eternal career._

> “Into the Holy Omnipresence of God I give myself, my plans, my ideas, and all the affairs of my life this day. I dwell in the secret place of the Most High, and His overshadowing presence watches over me, my family, my business, and all things appertaining to me. God walks and talks in me, and wherever I go, His love accompanies me. His spiritual gifts flow to me endlessly and ceaselessly. I walk the earth with the praise of God forever on my lips.”

> “_The kingdom of the divine brotherhood is still alive and will eventually and certainly come forth from this long submergence, just as surely as the butterfly eventually emerges as the beautiful unfolding of its less attractive creature of metamorphic development._” ([UB 170:5.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p5_21))
