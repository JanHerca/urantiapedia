## Sexism And The Urantia Book

_This paper describes our world situations, not only the western societies._

_In brackets within many quotes from _The URANTIA Book_ are changes in gender language in keeping with the proposed alterations. These bracketed words are mine._

_The Author_

“_The Universal Father is the God of all creation, the First Source and Center of all things and beings._” ([UB 1:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p0_1)) Heretofore, the world view of this entity has been of a stern male God with emphasis on judgement, appeasement, and atonement. Larger numbers of people every year are searching the world over for religious and philosophical sources which include and honor a more feminine, wider and more humane view of ourselves and our cosmos, The URANTIA BOOK offers them this more mature vision as well as a more complete and accurate description of “God”.

A new concept, born of evolution and revelation, not only gives lip service to the high value of the fruits of the spirit, but also practices them. (See [UB 34:6.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_13)) These traits have long been both denigrated as feminine and sought after as the spiritual ideal. The female's practice of these virtues throughout ”herstory“ has awarded her the honorable status of spiritual leader of humankind. (See [UB 84:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p6_4)) The perception of “God” as a Father Patriarch no longer adequately describes our maturing concept of an entity who embraces not only the female and the male essences, but vastly more as well. This new concept, born with The Women's Movement, is a manifestation of the feminine aspect of The First Source and Center, which has been covertly and overtly excluded from development on this planet. The continuation of spiritual growth and awareness is dependent on the continuation of this evolution.

## Isolation

In these early days of the revelation, many readers of _The URANTIA Book_ find ourselves isolated from other readers by great distances. This brings perplexity along with the question of how we should deal with this type of isolation.

_The URANTIA Book_ has this light to offer us: “_Short seasons of retreat from the busy scenes of life may not be seriously dangerous, but prolonged isolation of personality is most undesirable._” ([UB 100:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p5_8)) Rodan of Alexandria tells us that “_Fear, envy, and conceit can be prevented only by intimate contact with other minds._” ([UB 160:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p2_7)) Finally, with Jesus talking to Nathaniel we find this admonishment: “_... in that event dedicate your life to proving that the God-knowing disciple can become a kingdom builder even when alone in the world and wholly isolated from his fellow believers._” ([UB 181:2.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/181#p2_22))

The world is full of wonderful people! Our beliefs aren't always the same, but so often our goals are very, very close.

> “_The presence of the Holy Spirit of the Universe Daughter of the Infinite Spirit, of the Spirit of Truth of the Universe Son of the Eternal Son, and of the Adjuster-spirit of the Paradise Father in or with an evolutionary mortal, denotes symmetry of spiritual endowment and ministry and qualifies such a mortal consciously to realize the faith-fact of sonship with God._” ([UB 34:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p5_7))
