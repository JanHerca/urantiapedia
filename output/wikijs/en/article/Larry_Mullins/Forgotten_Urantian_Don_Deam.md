During the 1970's and 80's Don Deam was often seen at Urantia Conferences quietly smoking a pipe and observing the goings on. He was always an active Urantian, and hosted a study group and his own regional conference in Topeka, Kansas before he retired from his law practice and moved to Arkansas. Don was especially supportive and helpful to me in various Urantia projects over the years. But, I really didn't know Don's remarkable background and service to his country until one quiet afternoon in his study. There, reluctantly — at my urging-he unfolded events and spun stories, and showed me unique artifacts and clippings from his adventures.

The world held its breath on June 6,1944 as Allied troops began to storm the beaches of Normandy, France. But the untold story really began the night before, when American paratroopers were dropped behind German lines. Don Deem was one of those brave men, a First Sergeant of the 501st Parachute Infantry of the 101st Airborne Division, the famous “Screaming Eagles.” Their mission was to land behind enemy lines in the dark, assemble (at the sound of a cow bell which the division commander would ring), and to drive backward toward Omaha Beach and link up with the 4th Infantry Division. What actually happened that night was vastly different. Deam said: “I never did hear any cow bell.”

To begin with, the 18 year old, 125 pound Deem landed in frigid canal waters and was promptly dragged to the bottom by his heavy gear. He cut himself loose, and struggled up a muddy bank, clutching his Tommy gun. His comrades were nowhere in sight. After a few minutes he found a Corporal from another division hanging helplessly in a tree. While cutting him down, in the corner of his eye he spotted two Germans with fixed bayonets approaching. Swiftly he hit the ground and opened fire. They dropped silently to the ground. Deam crawled over and discovered he had killed a cow. The “bayonets” that he thought he saw were the star-crossed animal's horns flashing in the moonlight. 

In the course of that golden afternoon Donald Deam told me other stories, including being trapped in Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge, and “seeing lots of good men die there” under withering Nazi SS fire. But Bastogne held. Deam recalled watching Patton arrive shortly after Bastogne was relieved, waving from his tank, his fancy pistols gleaming in the sun. What Don did not tell me that day was later revealed in a fading newspaper clipping. The story told of his heroism, and how he came to be awarded a Purple Heart and the coveted Silver Star for his gallantry in battle during those terrible days of uncertainty behind German lines. As “ranking officer,” Deam took charge of 200 men and evacuated them safely to link up with the main body of troops. The clipping read:

“_Directing the withdrawal, First Sgt. Deam supervised a stream crossing by all 200 men which he accomplished with precision and a minimum number of casualties, despite intense fire by the enemy. In the march that followed, Deam went from man to man, encouraging them not to be afraid and to keep low. Shot three times through the arm during the stream crossing, he ignored his own wounds and exposed himself continually to fire as he aided and supervised the group. He finally succeeded in leading them to Major Richard J. Allen . . . and with this additional strength Maj. Allen was able to capture BeuzeAddeville and later form part of the group who ... seized and held the La Barquette locks, a regimental mission._”

Don now lives alone in a retirement center in Topeka. His sight is failing, but he manages to read with the aid of modern technology. He loves to hear from Urantians, old and young. Drop him a few words of encouragement at: _Donald L. Deam, 3515 SW 6th, Apt. 228, Topeka, KS. 66606. Or pick up the phone and give him a call: (785) 235-5909. Don loves to hear from Urantians._
