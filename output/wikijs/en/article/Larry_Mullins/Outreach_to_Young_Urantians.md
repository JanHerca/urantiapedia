> “If the Christian church would only dare to espouse the Master's program,thousands of apparently indifferent youths would rush forward to enlist in such a spiritual undertaking, and they would not hesitate to go all the way through with this great adventure.” ([UB 195:10.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_10))

The most powerful and attractive religious potential ever to exist on this planet, and the greatest gift ever given to men and women, has been very slow in its development. We are told in the Urantia Papers that the most fertile domain for evangelism is the young. For those Urantians who are not deeply experienced in personal evangelism (and I am one), this kind of outreach offers a friendly, gentle atmosphere.

Urantian youth of all ages are quite hungry for the stories and messages in the Urantia Papers. Different approaches must be made to each age group, of course. Aside from Urantia programs developed for the very young, there seems to be fewer existing programs and study aids to challenge the critical preteen ages (circa ages 9-13), and even less material for the equally important later teen-years. Perhaps there are many efforts now being made to reach out and attract young Urantians that are not reported. Perhaps those who are active doers are less adept at writing about it.

As Urantians, we need to reach new levels in evangelism to our young. One opportunity may lie in “hooking-up” the many Urantians who are willing to work on outreach to our youth. Perhaps by sharing ideas we would set into motion an invisible, living network of humans to assist the Angels of Progress in their efforts to disseminate the teachings of the Urantia Papers to the young.

One or more well-written articles or papers on the subject of creating such a network would start this process in this neglected area. We are looking for informative, wellthought-out ideas from the silent, working evangelists who have experience in the area of Urantian youth-outreach of various ages. This is an appeal for such quality materials.
