Welcome to our Fellowship Herald issue focused on “unity not uniformity.” When we created this theme for _The Fellowship Herald_ we had many diverse responses.

Some authors wanted to write about spiritual unity and dynamic oneness. Others presented topics about how they came to understand what steps they use to achieve spiritual unity in the world, or within the divergent parts of themselves. Some authors saw the opportunity to reflect on how this theme could be better reflected in our community as a whole.

Many of the articles provide spiritual food for thought from the ideas in _The Urantia Book_. Other articles bring up memories of difficult times in _The Urantia Book_ movement and the challenges of living our values.

Sprinkled throughout many of those articles are suggestions for how to achieve greater working harmony. And all throughout, the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ inspire us to do the personal work necessary that we might accurately reflect the will of our Father, on earth as it is in heaven.

We hope that within this magazine, you gain new insight into the topic of “unity not uniformity” as well as increase your appreciation of different personalities and their unique creativity.

My goals for _The Fellowship Herald_ publication are the following:

- Create meaningful connections between authors and readers
- Offer new insights and clarify meanings of a topic
- Increase appreciation of our authors' unique perspectives and creativity
- Foster a feeling of belonging in _The Urantia Book_ community
- Recognize authors and the value they bring to _The Urantia Book_ community
- Help us all grow as presenters of _The Urantia Book_ teachings

This issue has been edited with gratitude that I will never be able to repay for all the love and support I have received from _The Urantia Book_ community. I hope each of you will find the same experience.

Write to the publications committee with your positive, negative, or in-between impressions of the magazine at publications@urantiabook.org and we'll start to publish letters to the editor through our weekly e-newsletter.

Thank you,

Cristina Seaborn
Publications Chair
