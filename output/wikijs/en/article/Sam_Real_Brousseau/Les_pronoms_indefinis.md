***Indefinite pronouns***

_“Once upon a time there were four individuals who were called_
***Everyone — Someone — Everyone — and Nobody.***

_There was important work to be done,_
_And we asked ***Everyone*** to do it._
***Everyone*** _was convinced that ***Someone*** would do it._
***Everyone*** _could have done it, but in reality ***Nobody*** did it._

***Someone*** _got angry because it was Everyone's job!_
***Everyone*** _thought that ***Everyone*** could do it_
_And ***Nobody*** doubted that ***Someone*** would do it._

_In the end, ***Everyone*** reproached Everyone_
_Because No One had done what ***Someone*** could have done._

MORALITY

_Without wanting to blame everyone,_
_It would be good if everyone_
_Do what he must without harboring hope_


Sam Real Brousseau
