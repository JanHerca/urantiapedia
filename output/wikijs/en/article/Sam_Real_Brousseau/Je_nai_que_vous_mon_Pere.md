Of course, I have a life, a family, friends, fun
to compensate for the rest which sinks into failure with the days.
But deep down inside me, I only have you as my “Father”!
There are the joys and sorrows of existence which, under pressure,
make me realize that sometimes even dreams come true.
But deep down inside me, I only have you as my “Father”!
There is also this century of madness on our land forging strong character
strengthening our faith also helping us to forget all our bitterness.
But deep down inside me, I only have you as my “Father”!
All these human emotions, all these deadly sins under our control
which must be banished in order to be united with one another as brothers.
But deep down inside me, I only have you as my “Father”!
All these extremists trampling on our lives that delay the past, these attackers
who lose their footing on our soil, on our faith to destroy us.
But deep down inside me, I only have you as my “Father”!
The more I think about it and the more I reflect, and deep down inside me, there is always
this same response that I call upon: “I only have you my “Father”!

Sam Real Brousseau
