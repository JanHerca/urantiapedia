The physical brain and nervous system, combined, possess an innate sensitivity to the ministry of thought, just as evolving thought possesses an aptitude for spiritual receptivity.

Spiritual endowments are perfectly integrated into the natural and established process of evolution.

This is why, in thought, we are unable to discern anything other than the action of nature and the working of natural processes.

The seven spirits that maintain contact with the human world are comparable to circuits. However, as we are in a world where the archetypes are experimental, because of this experimentation, we are less synchronized than the other archetypes of the other worlds.

These various forms of educational thought must continue their preliminary ministry for a long time before animal thought reaches human levels of spiritual receptivity.

The areas of physical (electrochemistry) and mental reactions to stimuli from the surrounding environment should always be differentiated. These are not phenomena of direct spirituality.

Space and time being indissoluble, the processes of life take place very slowly. They correspond to the physical metamorphoses generated in a world.

> Mortal mind is a temporary intellect system loaned to human beings for use during a material lifetime, and as they use this mind, they are either accepting or rejecting the potential of eternal existence. Mind is about all you have of universe reality that is subject to your will, and the soul—the morontia self—will faithfully portray the harvest of the temporal decisions which the mortal self is making. Human consciousness rests gently upon the electrochemical mechanism below and delicately touches the spirit-morontia energy system above. Of neither of these two systems is the human being ever completely conscious in his mortal life; therefore must he work in mind, of which he is conscious. And it is not so much what mind comprehends as what mind desires to comprehend that insures survival; it is not so much what mind is like as what mind is striving to be like that constitutes spirit identification. It is not so much that man is conscious of God as that man yearns for God that results in universe ascension. What you are today is not so important as what you are becoming day by day and in eternity. (<a id="a51_1120"></a>[UB 111:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_5))


The evolution of thought also depends on the long development of physical conditions, and spiritual progress depends on mental expansion, in culture, in education, in wisdom.

If an individual's various endowments fail to synchronize and coordinate, delays may occur, but if a person has chosen with all his soul, no obstacle can triumph over his will.

When spiritual values receive their due consideration, cosmic meanings become discernible. As a result, the personality is gradually freed from the limitations of time and space.

When I write these few lines, I imagine myself in a school where I am asked to analyze in The Urantia Book, what I have understood about thought. My analysis corresponds rather to the substance and the form of the teachings, while for the unconscious materialists who have chosen a restricted framework, thought will never be able to express itself in a universal framework, because they are in a labyrinth.
