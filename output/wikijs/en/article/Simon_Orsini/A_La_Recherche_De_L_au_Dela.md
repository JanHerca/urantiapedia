Simon Orsini

For the majority of earthlings, survival does not exist, they are present on this earth, but do not seem enthusiastic about the idea that there could be life after death.

I take responsibility for saying that the universe is created. I could tell scientists that they do not know the composition of the electron, I will not reveal it to the public, but if a scientist asks me I will do it.

Scientists have not found the true functioning of protons and neutrons. They only know a small part of how the atom works, while several thousand people in the world know this functioning without being scientists. So there are other sources of information.

On this planet everything seems to be made for humans to lead lives of responsibility in their struggles for life, on a world that has never been inhabited by other humans. Its creation being recent, two billion years for energy to become matter, from that moment, four billion years for matter to become visible.

The earth is in an orbit that protects it from the great cold of space and the heat of the sun. Some of us are lucky enough to live with seasons, an immense sea which is the basis of all life, between rain and good weather it deposits water on our mountains, it allows nature to flourish, to live.

We have a colorful world. Flowers for the satisfaction of our senses, fruits for the sensitivity of our palate, we breathe two gases different from other planets, we have the possibility of being inventive with an extraordinary brain,

If our brain did not have this incredible potential, we would have remained at the animal level.

Man searches, he wants to know, in the midst of all this animal life he is the only one who is aware of himself.

Humans have prehensile thumbs, monkeys don't.

However, we find men who seek life in the universe, but we seek men who find life, “a quote from my friend Yves Battini”.

We are protected from the cold by the ozone layer, from radiation by a magnetic belt which isolates the harmful radiation from the sun. The paradox of all this is that the vitamins which are necessary for life in general, pass through this barrier, don't tell me that this is due to chance, when we eat an apple in reality we eat a billion nanoparticles, atoms, cells, molecules.

We have discovered the enormous possibilities of data storage in the microcosm.

Proportionally the dimensions and distances of the particles, between the nucleus of the atom and the electrons, are the same as between the sun and Mercury and the other planets.

When I open my computer, I have information about the whole world, if there were not waves with appropriate lengths to communicate, and atmospheric levels prepared for this purpose in the stratosphere, sounds and images would travel on uncontrollable frequencies.

To discover all these things of the universe, we were given a brain with Ioo billion neurons, just one of these neurons has the power of a computer that solves several billion operations per second, so we can think that the design of our brain was designed in relation to the progression of our destiny.

We can probe the universe with our telescopes, and little by little we discover the beginning of the functioning of the universe. On the dial of the universe everything turns, except the photons which go in a straight line, but, as they have a mass they respond to the gravity of the planets.

We discovered on this clock, the first hour of the universe. Today with a simple primary school certificate, young people can discover the presence of an invisible planet thanks to the curvature of space.

But some scholars are still convinced that everything happens by itself, they lead with their materialistic presentations, the great mass of people into negative doubt, into uncertainty about the future, into a life without fundamental values, without principles, without hopes of survival, where selfish pleasures dominate individuals of weak reasoning, sharing and fraternity are no longer the primary motives of individuals.

An exhortation is made throughout the ages so that our humble origins lead us towards paths of progression until we reach perfection, we can do this because, in the spiritual universe, time does not exist.

This magnificent injunction (perfection) will be present in our minds during the years of experiences and progress through the spiritual levels.

The spiritual universe is something extraordinary, beauty has no limits, distractions are more intellectual than those we know, dance and music become creations, in the relief of sound space in several dimensions.

The view will be overdriven, we will see a detail 30 km away, the same goes for physical abilities, as our body is used to eating, we will continue to feed ourselves, but the evacuation of waste will be done through the pores.

We will not have wings because angels do not have any, we will not be masters of our movements before having reached the higher levels, we will have the chance to be educated for thousands of years, because the people who will have inhabited our planet will have access to responsibilities because of their journey.

The ambition of creatures struggling in the unknown of an isolated planet, for future perfection, without direct information about their destiny, will be rewarded.

It is obvious that we will never be perfect in the infinite sense, since we will never know what infinity is, only the three absolute persons know it.

The purpose of life is to fulfill a destiny, to achieve self-fulfillment. Perfection will become final and complete when all aspects of the nature of God are discovered.

Perfection drives man forward in this long and fascinating struggle to reach higher and higher levels of spiritual values, in correlation with the true meanings of the universe.

This sublime quest is the supreme adventure of human beings.

There is nothing man can do for God except submit to the Father's values and will. He simply asks us to live the life we have chosen and believe in Him.

God is not a mere concept of potentialities, power and righteousness, nor is he a synonym for nature, God is a transcendent reality, a saving person, a loving Father.

He who has faith in God, who educates his family in values, will find it again at the first stage, I think of all those who have seen their children leave too early, their ancestors, friends. These people see the birth of a transcendental hope, which will be there from century to century, and at the same time we understand why we are here below.

This is why I love the Universal Father.

The greatest proof of the existence of God is found within ourselves, in the thought and development of the immortal soul destined to live eternally.

Three phenomena are at the origin of the knowledge of the existence of God.

1. the ability to know it,
2. the search for the Universal Father
3. the sincere desire to do his will.

However, the true concept of the reality of God is reasonable for logic, plausible for philosophy, essential for religion.

God is the physical controller of the material universe. The mystery of God lies in the inherent difference that exists between the infinite and the finite, the temporal and the eternal, the creatures of space-time and the Universal Creator.

God is not a mystery, but when we want to explain the realities of the world of the spirit to human thinkers, the mystery appears. God does not hide himself from any of his creatures. If he is unapproachable, it is only because he dwells in such a light that no material creature can approach.

The material body is not essential in the spiritual universe, as far as we are concerned, we will have a body for eternity.
ty, you will be recognized by your peers, you will recognize them.

The error of corporeality appears in both extremes of human philosophy.
1. materialism, man ceases to exist as a personality, since he loses his body upon his death.
2. In pantheism God is not a person since he does not have a body.

Someone who thinks, someone who sees, someone who hears, who is self-conscious, is a person. The superhuman type of progressive personality will function in a union of thought and spirit.

God cannot grow in knowledge and wisdom. The Universal Father participates in the personal struggle of every imperfect soul in the universe; neither mathematics, nor logic, nor philosophy, can grasp the ultimate reality of the universe. Only an experience by faith can bring about the clear, real, and spiritual conception of the personality of God.
