## FOREWORD

If you like astronomy or astrophysics, if you are curious and a little spiritual, if you want to discover some of the secrets of the universe, read these lines, they will shed new light on space.

If you are materialistic and you dispute the spiritual universe, or the existence of God, I advise you not to read this.

My goal is not to make converts, everyone has free will.

This does not prevent you from sharing a positive thought.

A cause devoid of thought cannot transmute what is rudimentary and simple into refined and complex elements.

Likewise experience without spirituality cannot transmute the material thought of mortals of time into the divine character of eternal survival.

For unbelieving materialists, man is simply an evolutionary accident, his fears, his loves, his desires are only the accidental juxtaposition of certain atoms of matter devoid of life.

The best of men are doomed to annihilation through death, man's only reward for living and working under the temporal sun of earthly existence. Yet one courageous display of faith from the most ignorant to the most educated child of God is enough to be saved....

I asked Yves Battini, retired principal of Marignana (CORSICA) to correct my text. Here is what he says about it: — “the detractors of religion generally resort to science to hold metaphysics in check by declaring God unknowable. Simon uses his scientific knowledge to demonstrate with extreme logic the existence of God.”

My quest simply aims to make people aware that we are in a material and spiritual universe. I am always amazed by what I discover, never disappointed.

I am in opposition to rationalist astrophysicists. Thanks to revelations we now know how space-time works. We can answer these questions: why are we on earth and where are we going? But be careful, this is not a criticism of scientists, who can only study radiation by going back to its origin. Their research is limited to effects. The universe teaches us to be modest in its discovery. May its laws enlighten scientists as much as the lights that reach us! The universe has a cause, whether they like it or not. I prefer organization with its values rather than chaos and disorder, life rather than death, hope rather than despair.

Our universe is a living organism, in the same conditions as the human vehicle. Black holes or rather dark bodies, are by their density a stabilizing element in a galaxy, they are not there by chance.

They serve for the recycling of space residues which they transform into energy. The dark bodies also serve as a dynamo of space, receiving energy from Paradise for the different manifestations of force and functioning.

If we look towards the Milky Way, at an enormous distance, we can locate the center of all things exactly as we locate Rome or Paris.

Since Galileo, astrophysicists have made enormous progress. Astronomers in the vision of the universe have not found the functioning of the constellations, our world does not rush blindly without diagram or compass into an unexplored space. Our galaxy follows a determined and well-prepared trajectory. We belong to a relatively recent universe. We do not circle blindly in unknown regions. In the distant future, our galaxy will cross again, the space in which we dive today. The Earth belongs to an eccentric system close to the outer limits of our local universe in the galaxy, we call this set of worlds capable of supporting life a system.

In our galaxy, there are ten million constellations; the galaxy is divided into several small universes, then come the minor sectors, around a thousand.

The major sectors, which include (systems, constellations, minor and major sectors, about seventy in number. Finally, some galaxies that follow the same trajectory as us. Practically all the starry kingdoms, visible to the naked eye, belong to the Milky Way. The vast star system of the Milky Way represents the central core of the galaxy. This great aggregation of suns, dark space islands, double stars, globular clusters, star clouds, spiral nebulae or others, as well as myriads of individual planets, form an oval, elongated grouping with a watch profile encompassing about one seventh of the galaxy. Eight major sectors have been identified out of the ten existing ones. The center of rotation of our minor sector is located far away in the enormous and dense star cloud of Sagittarius, one can observe two large streams of star clouds emerging in the form of prodigious stellar whirlpools. Some confusions of observers of stars of the Earth come from optical illusions and relative deformations, produced by the following multiple movements: 1/ the revolution of the Earth around the sun. 2/ the circuit of our solar system around the core of our ancient nebula. 3/ the rotation of the stellar family of associated groups around the complex center of rotation-gravity of our local universe 4/ the trajectory of the local stellar cloud and its associated creations around the center of their minor sector located in Sagittarius. 5/ the rotation of the minor sectors including Sagittarius around the major sector. 6/ the whirlwind of the ten major sectors the so-called star trails around their central point. 7/ the movement of the galaxy around the center of all things. Almost all of these movements are of a genetic nature, inherent in their origin. All other intermediate movements are of complex origin. ,In part they derive from the constitutive segmentation of matter energy and in part they were produced by intelligent and intentional action. Black holes have an enormous influence on the balance of the universe, they function like powerful pendulums exerting their influence on large neighboring systems.

_Where does the energy come from, how does it reach the nebula?_

When a galaxy is created, the currents of force energy leave Paradise and are sent to the intended limits of space-time, they cross successive levels of space and all forms of force and all phases of energies appear to be encircuited.

Energy currents circulate throughout the universe and return by precise routes. All forces, all energies, all matter are one. Pre-gravity is force, it is the first step that spatial power takes to individualize itself into a pre-energetic form of cosmic force.

In this energy there is a potential passive force and a primordial active force. When the energies of the universe are slowed down to the point of reaching the necessary slowdown, then, under favorable conditions they become masses.

Energy travels through intermediate space at a level undetectable by material instruments, in space prodigious circuits of force and energy gather, cold and other energies are at work to creatively organize the first particles which will compose the electron, heat is the measure of electronic activity, while cold is the relative rest of energy, it is gravity which prevents the appearance of absolute zero.

The universe is so much more immense than what the means of investigation allow us to analyze, that in reality, what we take for fossil radiation is only the radiation of all the nebulae which formed our galaxy, we are only a component, a part of the whole.

Galaxies move in an established order, they revolve around a center (Heaven) in four billion years. All galaxies are confronted with the breathing of space, their suns are expanding for two billion years and contracting during the same time while rotating around a center. If some galaxies give the impression of going anywhere it is because they circulate around a fixed point in a direction opposite to ours.

Scientists are unaware that galaxies are organized, despite an apparent anarchy. There are four belts of galaxies that revolve around the center of all things. The first in a counterclockwise direction, the second in the same direction as the hands, the third like the first. The belts are separated by areas of space two hundred thousand light years across. In the entire universe there are as many stars as there are drops of water in the oceans.

## Formation of a nebula

According to the dictionary: (the formation of new stars takes place within complex and dense nebulae extending over a hundred light years called molecular clouds because they contain numerous molecules and not just atoms and ions).

All material creations arise from gaseous, circular nebulae, and all these primary nebulae are circular during the first part of their gaseous existence.

A long time ago our nebula reached gigantic proportions, at that time all the materials were contained within the limits of this immense space wheel, much later the nebula acquired its maximum mass, at that time it was a gigantic cloud of a shape quite similar to that of a flattened spheroid. Such was the initial period of differential formation of mass and variation in rotation speed. Gravity and other influences were going to begin their work of converting the gases of space into organized matter. The enormous nebula then began to gradually take on a spiral shape, and to become visible to even distant astronomers.

The nebula of our portion of the universe was born in the charge of universal force (emerging energy) of restricted space (inside the Milky Way). We then waited for the conditions of space to be favorable to inaugurate phenomena of materialization in the sector of our galaxy. Our galaxy was created, one nebula after another. All the spatial energies of this time were organized to give birth to our nebula, when the conditions of space were favorable.

Before the birth of our nebula, the energy whirlwind was triggered which was later to transform into a space cyclone. It was following prolonged activities at another level of space that the nebular rotations were triggered, then the qualities inherent in the energy ensured the progressive and orderly evolution of our physical system.

At the moment when the maximum mass was reached, the gravitational control began to weaken and a phase of gas escape followed.

The gushing gases appeared in the form of two gigantic and distinct arms which left from two opposite sides of the mother mass. The rapid rotation of the enormous central core soon gave a spiral appearance to the two streams of gushing gases.

But the nebula had begun to contract and its increasing rotational speed further reduced the control of gravity. Soon after the outer gaseous regions actually began to escape the immediate grip of the nebular core, emerging into space in irregularly shaped shapes.

The ever-increasing speed of the whirlwind was soon to launch enormous suns into space on independent circuits.

The majority of suns in our galaxy were born in a similar way. The perfected universal mechanism of our nebula began to function for the first time. A long time ago the tension reached its peak, the maximum point of tension was reached, (this is called the critical stage of the struggle between heat and gravity). But sooner or later, heat wins the battle over gravity and the spectacular period of the dispersion of suns. This marks the end of the career of a space nebula.

Between a distant epoch of 25 billion and 10 billion years, the maximum temperature of the nuclear mass had been reached. The critical point of condensation was approaching, the original mother core convulsed under the combined pressure of the tension of its own internal heat and the increasing cyclic gravitational attraction of the surrounding swarm of liberated solar systems.

The nuclear eruptions which were to inaugurate the second nebular cycle of solar dispersion were imminent, the quaternary cycle of nebular existence was about to begin, after that of the third cycle (the dispersion of the suns). 7 billion years ago the largest suns were born. 6 billion years ago the terminal dislocation and the birth of our sun took place.

From now on the nebula no longer exists, the last nuclear residue of this magnificent nebula still burns with a reddish glow, it is one of the so-called (fossil) rays that all scientists are studying at the moment, thinking that it is the birth of the universe, but not being able to cross the Planck wall with their telescopes, this remains a theory.
