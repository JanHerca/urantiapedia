The binding belief has been overtaken by a higher consciousness of destiny, it is liberated by faith. Faith is the test pilot of the mind, because it allows each individual to have a direct connection with our creator.

When we decide to adopt spiritual values, we are in good resolution, the spirit intercedes for us, because all those who are led by the spirit are sons of God.

It is important to advance the potential in a positive way, giving the negative only the value of an experience due to evolution.

All reflection must be motivated by a collective sense of values, there is nothing easy in the struggle for life, it is the failures of each individual, and the progress of which makes us progress, which reflect the guiding line on which we orient ourselves.

> THE experience of dynamic religious living transforms the mediocre individual into a personality of idealistic power. Religion ministers to the progress of all through fostering the progress of each individual, and the progress of each is augmented through the achievement of all.

Contact between humans is sometimes difficult, so we must leave it to those who are most gifted to lead human nature towards a higher harmony.

Today I have passed the milestone of certain mysteries of the universe. I am beginning to understand the spiritual and material universe. I can analyze events from the inside, they give us another different vision of things, we can detect an organization. Time is no longer important since eternity is at our door, we would be wrong to deprive ourselves of it.

Some hide behind prayer because they think that man has an innate guilt, man is not guilty of anything, that is my conviction, we simply ask him to live his life and believe in a Universal Father. Those who believe in a vindictive God, ignore everything about his nature, his perfection, his compassion, his infinite love for his children.

It is however true that we do not mock God, if man sins, he will have to repent, he will be judged on his actions and perhaps also on his intentions which are not necessarily negative. If an individual does not survive, it is his own will which is engaged, he has his free will, he is simply asked to make a choice, why does he not do it?

An abyss separates God from man, it is because of his infinite and eternal nature, man will emerge from his time on earth enhanced, through his heroism and his faith.

Each individual must be aware that many of our ancestors have already joined the spiritual universe, that they are impatient to see us again, it is up to us not to disappoint them. On this earth, our struggle for life is not easy, we must keep in our consciousness, that among the inhabitants of the spiritual worlds, an enormous quantity of people are present for the success of our passage (the guardian angels).

Our problem is that all this is hidden from us. An entire organized system gravitates around us, without us being able to verify it and for some to believe it. This is the price of freedom.

Interventions on the material world are exceptional, but necessary at certain times, it is important to say that all things work together for the good of all. When we are exhausted by efforts of mental concentration often due to stress, it is restful to remember the difficult passages of the past, and to tell ourselves that when we believe we have failed because of the difficulties of reception of those around us, on the revelations of the spiritual universe, others take over without us being aware of it.

The future means struggle and progress, it announces work, efforts, accomplishments, the struggle of the part benefits the whole.

Humor is the safety valve of every individual, it allows us not to take ourselves too seriously, it is the divine antidote to self-exaltation. It is valuable both as health insurance, and as a releaser of emotional pressures, it prevents harmful nervous tensions.

Let us be careful not to forget the great river of truths that has flowed down the ages, in constant progression, which has reached us, experienced by our ancestors, very often at the risk of their lives. Let us use this experience across the centuries, and thanks to the gift of personality, we can make predictions for the future.
