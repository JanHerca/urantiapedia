Some say that time does not exist, I am convinced of the opposite. Time is certainly not a concrete thing that can be demonstrated by mathematics. However, time can be the sum of two or more factors which often represent something more than the sum of the predictable consequences, we have the example of water (hydrogen plus oxygen) water extinguishes fire.

Space creates movement, time is the duration of movement. The function of water is not predictable by analysis, it reveals to us an entirely new orientation that science cannot explain.

For a believer, time does not depend on causality in relation to people or events in the universe, but with the awareness of the sequences of time which are inherent in thought, the moments.

Jesus explained to us that time was the flow of events perceived by human consciousness, it is because time flows, that we can separate them, understand them, live them. Time is the moving image of eternity. The first vision of time is linear, the experienced vision becomes global because ideas begin to develop in a universal framework.

> Patience is exercised by those mortals whose time units are short; true maturity transcends patience by a forbearance born of real understanding. ([UB 118:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p1_6))


The only thing free of time is human creative imagination. Creation is a phenomenon of the mind, which goes beyond material thought.

The mechanist does not have a positive vision of time since he does not have the possibility of defining it.

The only things it discerns are: the past, the present, the future. The synthesis between causality and the constraint of time does not seem obvious to me, if we consider that time does not exist. Space and time are created on appropriate archetypes, space is perceived by analysis, it is not empty since there are 100 particles per cubic decimeter, these particles are points of force (dark matter), time is analyzed by synthesis.

The archetype of time defines moments by the duration of events, which allows us to understand time and movements in space. The energies of the archetypes are not sensitive to gravity, they are a configuration of energies that have been desensitized by anticipated action.

Newton discovered linear time as a symbolic representation of time.

Einstein's special relativity untangles time by reducing it to its primary function, motion.

The man of faith in a Creator of the universe is aware of ascension time, because it is the time of the spirit, that which helps thought to discover the seven levels of spiritual growth.

The human personality is not only a concordance of events in time and space, it can also act as a cosmic cause in events. Only thought can associate the physical forces and energies of the material level with the spiritual powers and beings of the spirit level.

Whenever we contemplate universal phenomena let us ensure that we take into consideration the interrelationship of physical, intellectual, and spiritual energies.

Space and time allow such a diversity of reactions in the face of an apparently uniform causality (time, space), this causality reveals to the other causalities which are connected to it, that the law in the universe is the invariant way of an absolute Spirit, which is the universal source of all the personalities of this great universe.

If we broaden the framework of time, we can better discern the will of God, in the spiritual fruits of his human creatures guided by the spirit. Brotherhood is an overall reality; it consequently reveals the qualities of the whole with the qualities of the part.

Human thought is the technique by which realities arising from the mind become realities of experiences.

The unifying possibilities of human thought are the ability to coordinate things and ideas, all these devices have a supramaterial origin.

I will try to understand why in the atom two identical things can exist in two different places while having the same behavior, the same functions, the same attitude.

There must be a special cause-and-effect relationship between the ten heaviest electrons in the atom.

We know that absolutes act at the atomic level, so the creation of independent electrons was planned. Independent electrons are the heaviest, they are also the most visible of the quantum. They can act in any situation in moving space, at the same time, with the same attitude, the same behavior, because their independence allows them to escape the control of the mother nucleus.

I hypothesize that it is the heavier, more independent electrons that have been organized to behave differently.

The fact that astrophysicists discover a different organization, an interaction between electrons whatever their position in space, does not prove that there are several electrons.

The interelectronic space is animated by wave manifestations perfectly synchronized with the speed of the electrons, this force is not entirely dominated by the recognized laws of positive and negative attraction. This is why it sometimes behaves in an unpredictable manner.

> Time and space are a conjoined mechanism of the master universe. They are the devices whereby finite creatures are enabled to coexist in the cosmos with the Infinite. Finite creatures are effectively insulated from the absolute levels by time and space. But these insulating media, without which no mortal could exist, operate directly to limit the range of finite action. Without them no creature could act, but by them the acts of every creature are definitely limited. ([UB 118:9.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p9_1))

The width of the intervals between particles of matter, as well as the initial speed of the energy rays, cause the wave-like appearance of many forms of matter energies. Rapidly moving particles cause the excitation of the contents of space, they produce a wave reaction.

This anonymous influence seems to be a space-force reaction of the unconditioned absolute.

If we consider that the speed of certain electrons around the nucleus of the atom is between 20,000 and 30,000 revolutions per second, there is a chance that an independent electron in its path around the nucleus will undergo a form of variable circuit, suggesting that there are several electrons in its orbit, but in reality that it is always the same electron.

We can control electrons as negative or positive, but at certain times we must also tell ourselves that it is the position that determines the positive or the negative as the circuit of the proton and the neutron proves to us. The fact is, that in the case of superposition of two particles we can no longer know where the positive or the negative is. If the first electron is positive, the second is negative, but this is only a hypothesis. The ordered and safe association of various energies constitutes matter. Civilizations arise and disappear, but science, morality, religion always survive the collapse.

> Like space, time is a bestowal of Paradise, but not in the same sense, only indirectly. Time comes by virtue of motion and because mind is inherently aware of sequentiality. From a practical viewpoint, motion is essential to time, but there is no universal time unit based on motion except in so far as the Paradise-Havona standard day is arbitrarily so recognized. The totality of space respiration destroys its local value as a time source. ([UB 12:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p5_1))

> Time and space are inseparable only in the time-space creations, the seven superuniverses. Nontemporal space (space without time) theoretically exists, but the only truly nontemporal place is Paradise *area.* Nonspatial time (time without space) exists in mind of the Paradise level of function. ([UB 12:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/12#p5_3))
