Belief is the first step of faith. This analysis depends entirely on revelations and leaves no room for improvisation.

To arrive at faith, the human heart must thirst for perfection; what knowledge and reason cannot do for us, faith can accomplish.

Faith eliminates religious fear, it destroys superstition

The believer has faith in a God of love, it is by drawing inspiration from this love, which should be the essence of all religion, that he can move forward.

A soul who knows God dares to say, I know the Universal Father, I am one of his sons.

Religions can never achieve philosophical uniformity, but can feel a spiritual unity.

A child sincerely loves his parents, it is through this deep feeling that love for one's neighbor develops, through the education of the embryonic soul which must evolve to survive.

Belief binds, faith liberates.

It is the living faith in the superhuman origin of our ideals that validates our faith as sons of God.

Man has free will, he is neither a powerless slave nor the victim of a mechanical cosmic determinism, he is the architect of his own destiny.

Theology is the study of the actions and reactions of the human mind. The observation and study of the universe is done from the outside in relation to the center of all things, they give rise to the various physical sciences.

When the search is done from the inside (Paradise) it gives origin to theology.

> If something has become a religion in your experience, it is self-evident that you already have become an active evangel of that religion since you deem the supreme concept of your religion as being worthy of the worship of all mankind, all universe intelligences. If you are not a positive and missionary evangel of your religion, you are self-deceived in that what you call a religion is only a traditional belief or a mere system of intellectual philosophy. If your religion is a spiritual experience, your object of worship must be the universal spirit reality and ideal of all your spiritualized concepts. All religions based on fear, emotion, tradition, and philosophy I term the intellectual religions, while those based on true spirit experience I would term the true religions. The object of religious devotion may be material or spiritual, true or false, real or unreal, human or divine. Religions can therefore be either good or evil. (<a id="a61_949"></a>[UB 160:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p5_3))

At the human stage nothing can be proven, science and religion are both based on assumptions, science becomes the mental realm of mathematics.

It is the deep faith and unwavering certainty of believers that should challenge the uncertainty of unbelievers.

The ideal of philosophy is absolute trust in the Universal Father.

In the higher philosophy of the universe, wisdom and reason are allied with faith; when reason recognizes good and evil, it demonstrates wisdom.

Faith deals with living spiritual experience, each one must live his life by educating himself in the different levels of existence; The mental level, the level of brotherly love, the moral level, the spiritual level, the level of the Universal Father.

Every time I construct a text, I consider it as a duty. (To be taken in both senses)
