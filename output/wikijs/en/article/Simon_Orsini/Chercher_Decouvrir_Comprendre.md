> _Children are permanently impressed only by the loyalties of their adult associates; precept or even example is not lastingly influential. Loyal persons are growing persons, and growth is an impressive and inspiring reality. Live loyally today—grow—and tomorrow will attend to itself. The quickest way for a tadpole to become a frog is to live loyally each moment as a tadpole._ (<a id="a34_382"></a>[UB 100:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p1_4))

The _Urantia Book_ gives us, through this example, the way to live one's life in a personal experience, which must grow, in proportion to the increasing search for final values.

At some point in our lives, we become aware of ourselves. We then seek to understand why we are on earth and what our destiny is.

What we are can be discovered in the mathematical fabric hidden in the universe.

If thought did not evolve within a universal framework, we could only develop our ideas and our research within a restricted framework.

In human beings, foresight always precedes prediction.

If an individual is not open to a global view, he reduces his clairvoyance accordingly.

In our dictionary, the definition of the word personality does not have the same meaning as in the _Urantia Book_.

On earth, personality is the set of behaviors, aptitudes, motivations whose permanent unity constitutes individuality.

In The Urantia Book, personality is a gift from the Universal Father. Although devoid of identity, it can unify the entire energy system of the human being.

It is unique in time, in space, in Eternity.

There can be no copy of the personality. It is a super self. It enables man to coordinate his ideas in his thoughts within a universal framework.

> _In the maturity of the developing self, the past and future are brought together to illuminate the true meaning of the present. As the self matures, it reaches further and further back into the past for experience, while its wisdom forecasts seek to penetrate deeper and deeper into the unknown future. And as the conceiving self extends this reach ever further into both past and future, so does judgment become less and less dependent on the momentary present. In this way does decision-action begin to escape from the fetters of the moving present, while it begins to take on the aspects of past-future significance._ (<a id="a58_625"></a>[UB 118:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p1_5))

Thought is entirely subject to the will, but it can be endangered when the rules and values are not respected.

It is the will that chooses, that decides, what is good or bad, what is positive or negative.

We often ask ourselves this question, why do we suffer at certain times?

Jesus gives us the following answer: “The kingdom of my Father is a kingdom of the spirit.”

We need to mentally separate spiritual realities from the material, social, economic problems of our time, and understand that freedom and free will have consequences in an evolutionary framework.

The triumph of death on the cross is summed up by the behavior of Jesus towards his attackers.

He made the cross an eternal symbol of the victory of love over hate, of truth over evil, saying: “Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.”

He also says, “I am the living way.” Jesus is indeed the living way leading believers from the material level of self-consciousness, to the spiritual level of God-consciousness.

Man grows consciously, through the strength and persistence of his own decisions.

How can we understand or appreciate the waiting time to join the world of houses? For Jesus it was three days. Personally, on the day of my arrival, I would like to meet up with my family and friends, so as not to be too disoriented and to be able to share my impressions with them.

Observing the incessant struggles of creatures to attain perfection, I think that their endless efforts denote the spirit of will which animates them, and leads them to spiritual fulfillment. If we proclaim the truths of the spirit, the spirit will testify in our hearts that our message is authentic. If we receive God as Father, then, in truth we will be part of his universe, we will obtain eternal life.
