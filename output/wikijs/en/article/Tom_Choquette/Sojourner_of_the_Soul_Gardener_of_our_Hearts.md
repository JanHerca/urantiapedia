This sharing is based on my personal journey into partnership with the Spirit of Truth. The spirit of our beloved Jesus—our spiritual trainer and true north, the gardener of our hearts— resides within those that are honest and sincere of heart and willing to do His bidding. 

Any child of God who is searching for spiritual truths, by this action alone, is proof that they are indwelt by both the Spirit of Truth and a fragment of our Father. 

If we acknowledge the presence of, and instructions from this wonderful Source from the Divine, He will guide us to truth and bless us with the ability to share those truths with all of God’s children. He promises us this for our generation and all generations to come. The primary purpose of the Spirit of Truth is to live in and through us, to restate the message of Jesus to the world in which we live. We have been chosen as messengers to share the love of God with all. 

(Editor's note: Beloved refers to the divine spark of God that indwells each one of us.) 

Our Beloved, the Thought Adjuster, needs the Spirit of Truth to indwell us. That which would become our eternal partner (our Thought Adjuster) relies on the Spirit of Truth to approach each of Their children just as each of us is reliant upon the Spirit of Truth to begin our eternal dance with the Divine. The Thought Adjusters are not universally bestowed until the Spirit of Truth is poured out on those sincere and honest of heart. And that only happens after a Creator Son has accomplished all seven of His bestowals. The Spirit of Truth makes way for the Beloved to discover us, and in turn, for us to discover the Infinite within. 

I have found that the reward for making a sincere, honest choice to devote my ministry here on this world to doing the will of God by following the word of God, is the blessing of the conscious recognition of my Lord and Master, Jesus, within me. Jesus’ embrace is indescribably delicious. His partnership is the spiritual lifeline for our very existence in the here and now and the launchpad to life eternal. 

I am becoming more aware of the various spiritual energies that clamor to assist us in our becoming one with our eternal partners. I am thankful for the adjutants, our angels, the Holy Spirit, the touch of the Beloved and other spiritual influences that allow us to tread the path of the Infinite. For the most part, in this article, I purposely leave out our Thought Adjusters’ indispensable influence and energy. This article is meant to be an adventure with the Spirit of Truth. This is perhaps one of the most overlooked and critical spiritual influences available to us young spiritual fledglings. 

## The Passion of Personal Revelation Started to Grow Within Me 

_The Urantia Book_ found me 50 years ago. It was a dark, cold, and windy night. Well, maybe not so much. I was actually with two wonderful friends in front of a roaring fire in the heart of Alaska. 

My romance with _The Urantia Book_ was slow and methodical—adrift on a sea of doubt and hope, confusion and clarity, curiosity and satisfaction—and then one day the passion of personal revelation started to grow from living the facts of our epochal revelation (i.e., _The Urantia Book_ ). As I applied the directions of _The Urantia Book_ in my life, the gift of true knowledge emerged from my actions, awakening a personal revelation within my heart. My mind connected with the facts of _The Urantia Book_ and my life was forever changed. It took a while for the revelation of _The Urantia Book_ to touch my heart and ignite an insatiable desire to know and serve our Master (Jesus). Sometimes, it seems, the twelve inches from head to heart is a mile wide. Revelation as an epochal phenomenon is periodic but as a personal human experience it is continuous. As I lean in closer to the Divine in my life, I find this to be unconditionally true. 

God has already given me more than I could have ever dreamed of. And His giving through the Spirit of Truth has no limits. His main desire is to give each of us as much as we can imagine and even more. His conditions are: serve the Father’s children, and turn your will over to the Father’s will. The real beauty of this promise is that we can make the decision to partner with the Spirit of Truth at any time in our lives. The Divine is patient and the option to choose the Beloved’s love is always within reach and available to us. 

I was, for a long time, a Jesus apologist. Christianity had soured anything that was associated with the risen Christ for me. I guess I was ashamed of aligning with any symbol attached to Christianity. I took solace in the deeper studies of _The Urantia Book_ , and developed a strong relationship with our Mother Spirit through service to Her children without and communing with the Beloved within. 

I cannot point to any given moment in time when I became aware of my spiritual folly. I had made the assumption that I could develop a relationship with God without turning my life over to the direction of His Son—the word of God—without allowing me to be nurtured and led by the Spirit of Truth, a necessary step for cuddling up more closely with my Beloved.

Some Discoveries Made Along the Journey 

We are told that through the Spirit of Truth and His leadings we will be led into a **conscious** relationship with Jesus. I have found this to be true, as we all can. Let me share some of the discoveries I have made. They are the journey from my mind to my heart, from belief to faith, from knowing to doing, from my will to God’s will that allowed me to become consciously aware of the Spirit within. 

These discoveries come in no particular chronology. They are not in order of importance or personal awareness. They are the gatherings of an unfinished jigsaw puzzle, a puzzle each of us will put together differently— a puzzle that with each piece added leads us closer to the heart of God and His will for us and the growth of the Supreme. I will list several quote references at the end of this article to introduce you more fully to our indispensable, priceless, merciful, Spirit of Truth. 

The coming of the Spirit of Truth at Pentecost endowed us with the ability to forgive personal injuries. Consider this quote: 

> ”Pentecost endowed mortal man with the power to forgive personal injuries, to keep sweet in the midst of the gravest injustice, to remain unmoved in the face of appalling danger, and to challenge the evils of hate and anger by the fearless acts of love and forbearance.” [[UB 194:3.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_12)] 

This quote was the beginning of an awareness of how the Divine clearly communicates with and empowers each of us, perhaps not in any language of the realm, but in the “language of the gods.” The Spirit of Truth was poured out upon this world at Pentecost. I realized that our ability to forgive, promote peace or minister mercy was directly linked to our relationship with the Spirit of Truth, with Jesus. More importantly it is the Son’s forgiveness that flows out from within us, should we let it. With our permission we learn to forgive, promote peace and understand the language of mercy from the Son. _This is true ***conscious*** communion with the Son through the Spirit of Truth. _

## Jesus Lives Anew in Us and Through Us 

On Pentecost the Spirit of Truth became the personal gift from the Master to every one of us that are _honest and sincere of heart_. The main purpose for this bestowal was to qualify each believer to more readily share the love of God and offer the friendship of God to all. We of the revelation are blessed with this knowledge. Should we do something other than what the Master asks? 

We are told that Jesus, through the Spirit of Truth, lives anew in the experience of every truth-taught believer. The Master lives through us, if we only allow it. He will guide us unerringly into the love of the Father and out into the ministry of all of His children if we will just accept this deeply sought after and privileged position. We are told that Thought Adjusters flock to a world such as ours in the hopes of partnering with a child of God dedicated to doing the will of God, to become one with Him. We each have the ability to consummate this desire of our Beloved by following the directions and leadings of the Spirit of Truth. Wow! 

The Spirit of Truth asks us to reveal truth to the world around us by allowing the love of the Divine to pass through our personal experience and into the lives of others. We must remake ourselves into fountains of living truth, (born again), and share that truth with those that hunger. We, in partnership with the Spirit within, create a living pathway through which those who are lost can find their way home. We are the ones who spread the crumbs that identify a path through the dark forest floor to the illuminated valley waiting to embrace all who come—to the very source of love.

There is so much more to say regarding this wonderful partner and eternal friend that we have residing in us. My heart is filled to bursting. May you all share in His grace. A gift beyond imagining. 

Consciously, or unconsciously, the Spirit of Truth is an inseparable part of our hearts, much as our cellular structure is to our body. Without our cells, our bodies would simply dissolve. Without the Spirit of Truth, our hearts would harden and madness would drift into our lives. How fortunate the world is. 

Love you all this day, and the infinite days to come. Tom
