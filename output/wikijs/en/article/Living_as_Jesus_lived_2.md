## Living as Jesus lived—Jesus' task

> “In entering upon the Urantia bestowal, you have voluntarily divested yourself of all extraplanetary support and special assistance such as might be rendered by any creature of your own creation. As your created sons of Nebadon are wholly dependent upon you for safe conduct throughout their universe careers, so **now must you become wholly and unreservedly dependent upon your Paradise Father** for safe conduct throughout the unrevealed vicissitudes of your ensuing mortal career. And when you shall have finished this bestowal experience, you will know in very truth the full meaning and the rich significance of that faith-trust which you so unvaryingly require all your creatures to master as a part of their intimate relationship with you as their local universe Creator and Father.” (<a id="a38_794"></a>[UB 120:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p1_3))

> “Throughout your Urantia bestowal you need be concerned with but one thing, **the unbroken communion between you and your Paradise Father**; and it will be by the perfection of such a relationship that the world of your bestowal, even all the universe of your creation, will behold a new and more understandable revelation of your Father and my Father, the Universal Father of all.” (<a id="a40_386"></a>[UB 120:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p1_4))

> “Your great mission to be realized and experienced in the mortal incarnation is embraced in your decision to live a life wholeheartedly motivated to do the will of your Paradise Father, thus to reveal God, your Father, in the flesh and especially to the creatures of the flesh .... Exhibit in your one short life in the flesh, as it has never before been seen in all Nebadon, the transcendent possibilities attainable by a God-knowing human during the short career of mortal existence.” (<a id="a42_490"></a>[UB 120:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p2_8))

> This life is but the passage of a day, 
> This life is but a pang and all is over; 
> But in the life to come which fades not away 
> Every love shall abide and every lover.
> _Christina Rossetti_

> Life may change, but it may fly not; 
> Hope may vanish, but it can die not; 
> Truth be veiled, but it still burneth; 
> Love repulsed,—but it returneth!
> _Percy B. Shelley, Hellas 1._

## Living as Jesus lived—Our task

> “This gospel of the kingdom belongs to both Jew and gentile, to rich and poor, to free and bond, to male and female, even to the little children. **And you are all to proclaim this gospel of love and truth by the lives which you live in the flesh**. You shall love one another with a new and startling affection, even as I have loved you. You will serve mankind with a new and amazing devotion, even as I have served you. And when men see you so love them, and when they behold how fervently you serve them, they will perceive that you have become faith-fellows of the kingdom of heaven, and they will follow after the Spirit of Truth which they see in your lives, to the finding of eternal salvation.” (<a id="a58_706"></a>[UB 191:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/191#p6_2))

> “As the Father sent me into this world, even so now send I you. You are all called to carry the good news to those who sit in darkness. This gospel of the kingdom belongs to all who believe it; it shall not be committed to the custody of mere priests. Soon will the Spirit of Truth come upon you, and he shall lead you into all truth. Go you, therefore, into all the world preaching this gospel, and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the ages.” (Jesus) (<a id="a60_467"></a>[UB 191:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/191#p6_3))

> “**Your mission to the world** is founded on the fact that I lived a God-revealing life among you; on the truth that you and all other men are the sons of God; and it **shall consist in the life which you will live among men**—the actual and living experience of loving men and serving them, even as I have loved and served you.” (Jesus) (<a id="a62_341"></a>[UB 191:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/191#p5_3))

If you give your lives truly to the gospel, **you shall live by the gospel**.

Salvation is the free gift of God, but those who are born of the spirit will immediately begin to show forth the fruits of the spirit in loving service to their fellow creatures. And the fruits of the divine spirit which are yielded in the lives of spirit-born and God-knowing mortals are: loving service, unselfish devotion, courageous loyalty, sincere fairness, enlightened honesty, undying hope, confiding trust, merciful ministry, unfailing goodness, forgiving tolerance, and enduring peace. **If professed believers bear not these fruits of the divine spirit in their lives, they are dead; the Spirit of Truth is not in them; they are useless branches on the living vine**, and they soon will be taken away.

Jesus had come “**to establish and demonstrate a standard of human life for all peoples** upon all worlds throughout his entire universe. And this standard approached the highest perfection, even the final goodness of the Universal Father”

\[**Note**: Living as Jesus lived must commence **in the home or, at least, among those who know us best**. To attempt to live as Jesus lived only when we move outside the home heralds that we are really **play-acting**. And others will soon recognize that our act is a sham, a lie. Jesus was not enamored with hypocrisy.\]

> And I said to a man that stood at the gate of the year: ‘Give me a light that I might tread safely into the unknown.’ And he replied: ‘Go out into the darkness and put your hand into the hand of God. That should be, to you, better than a light, and safer than a known way’.
>       _Minnie Louise Haskins, “The Desert”_

> I stood upon that silent hill 
> And stared into the sky 
> until my eyes were blind 
> with stars and still 
> I stared into the sky.
> _Ralph Hodgson_
