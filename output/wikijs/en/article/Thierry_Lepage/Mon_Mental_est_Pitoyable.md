Thierry Lepage

There is contempt, judgment, criticism, towards those I find unsightly, towards the handicapped, the poor, the foreigner...

There is greed, lack of generosity, selfishness, fear of giving, fear of missing out.

There is egocentrism, the search for an advantage for me, the best for me.

There is the search for domination, to come before the other, to be the strongest, to win, to be right.

There is the insatiable need for recognition, to have the best place, to be the most looked at.

There is laziness, pride, believing yourself to be superior to others, giving yourself importance...

So for this new year I am making resolutions.

Devote time to your relationship with God, pray, worship, give thanks...

Be vigilant, present, in order to quickly flush out what is petty and small in me, and put an end to it as soon as possible.

Be vulnerable, let myself be touched by what is true, beautiful and good.

Be compassionate, let myself be touched by the suffering of others.

Be generous, be neither afraid of giving nor afraid of missing out.

Being fraternal. The others are my brothers, my equals, my fellow men, who like me feel, suffer, retreat, progress, close themselves off, open up, hate, love... The other is as important as me, God loves me, and loves everyone with an equal love.

Forget myself, devote myself to the service of fraternity.

Be humble and gentle, don't try to put myself forward or shock, respect others.

And I make a wish.

May my failing mind be replaced by the mind of Jesus.

And so like Jesus.

I trust in the goodness of the universe.

I trust the man.

I seek to do God's will.

I dedicate myself to loving and serving the Father.

I dedicate myself to loving and serving my brothers.

I dedicate myself to establishing the Kingdom of Heaven on earth.
