I have no eyes,
only for God.

Young or old,
let us be pious.

In order to attain the kingdom of heaven,
and thus taste the marvelous.

To no longer be anxious,
to finally be joyful.

Let us say goodbye to suffering,
let's live for the better.

Let us rejoice in bright tomorrows,
let us rejoice in all places.

In the world let us be bold,
Let us be merciful with our brothers.

And silent, communions with God.

Thierry
