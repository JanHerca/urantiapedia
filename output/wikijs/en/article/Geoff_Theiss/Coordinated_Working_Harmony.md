_by Geoffrey Theiss_

It is less complicated to work alone. It is less difficult when distractions can obfuscate an inconvenient truth. We can sidestep the conflicts of growth by hitting the snooze button one more time. But these are not our values. 

We are challenged instead to invigorate in the presence of difficulties and exhibit courage in the face of immensity. And what could be more immense than sharing an epochal revelation with the world? This exhilarating challenge is one _we choose to strive for together_.

It is no easy task.

We are reminded in _The Urantia Book_ how “A social group of human beings in coordinated working harmony stands for a force far greater than the simple sum of its parts.” ([UB 133:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p5_6)) The harmony of our efforts together _demands_ coordination. It _requires_ work. And that sustained effort _needs_ you.

The Urantia Book Fellowship (a.k.a. the Fellowship) invests significant resources into working across every border-international and organizational-to strive towards the highest values of effective collaboration. We need your support to capitalize on these incredible opportunities to further develop our partnerships within the broader _Urantia Book_ movement, with the following 2024 shared goals:

<br style="clear:both;"/>

- The Fellowship and Groupo Orvonton of Mexico: Launch a dedicated Spanish community website.
- The Fellowship and Urantia Foundation: Expand _Urantia Book_ distribution in remote areas, increase study group support, and develop new translated secondary works.
- The Fellowship and Urantia University Institute: Develop a new educational curriculum and expand prison ministry educational resources.
- The Fellowship and Urantia Association International: Sponsor joint community activities and conferences, increase study group support, and collaborate to expand reader services.
- The Fellowship and the Christ Michael Center in Nigeria: Expand Urantia Book placement in Africa and partner to publish _The Urantia Book_ in Nigeria.
- And many more shared goals.

Having more than two hundred volunteers has allowed us to accomplish quite a bit on a relatively small budget, but as the revelation spreads, so do the demands on our financial resources.

Your help will make us exponentially more effective. Please consider making a generous gift to support a specific collaboration or to help us sustain our partnership efforts as one revelation family:
