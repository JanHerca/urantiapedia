The XII Meeting of readers began at 5 pm on Friday, May 31. Shortly before, the attendees had been arriving at the hotel, where lively conversations were held from the beginning. In total we met almost 50 people from both Spanish territory (Madrid, Barcelona, Girona, Tarragona, Valencia, Mallorca, Murcia, Malaga, Seville, Alicante, Toledo, Burgos, Santander and Vizcaya) and other European countries (Germany, Portugal and Switzerland). Our most sincere thanks to all of them, because they are the ones who make the Meetings great.

At the inaugural meeting, the material that was going to be used in the Meeting was distributed and a brief review of the activities program was given. Then, without further delay, five short presentations related to the theme of the Gathering were given: _The Urantia Book_: why? As? That? At the end of these presentations, there was a lively discussion among the participants.

After dinner, to give official status to something that was carried out spontaneously among the readers in previous Encounters, the so-called “Comanche territory” was instituted: a space for free debate among the attendees, in which any topic related to the teachings of the book without a previous script. Before the debate, we had a moment of remembrance for Josefina Canseco, who continued on her way to the mansion worlds in February of this year. An emotional presentation with photos and music was projected in which this great heroine of the Urantia movement in Spain was remembered.

The session of “Comanche territory” was very intense and lasted until sleep took its toll on the participants. Time flies by when discussing the contents of the book!

The following day in the morning, Saturday, the attendees were divided into 8 groups of between 5 and 6 participants each. The group facilitators were the board members, plus some readers already experienced in this type of activity. In each group there was a person in charge of taking note of what was said, to later share it with all the attendees. That was the time to spread out around the hotel facilities and work on these four points:

1. Why do we do what we do to publicize the teachings of _The Urantia Book_?
2. What are the key concepts of _The Urantia Book_ that should be conveyed to potentially interested persons?
3. What makes _The Urantia Book_ different from other doctrines or worldviews?
4. Create a slogan or motto regarding _The Urantia Book_: the book in one sentence.

After lunch, most of the attendees went on a short excursion to Parque del Capricho, located near the hotel, guided by Mariano Pérez, the study group coordinator. This was not only an opportunity to contemplate the beauty of nature, but also to socialize with other members of the group.

On the return, we all met to share what we had discussed in the workshops. We were able to verify that very good ideas arose, which can also be used for the future dissemination of the book.

After dinner, we returned with the second session of “Comanche country.” On this occasion, it was preceded by the singing of the “unofficial” hymn of the Urantia readers, “Pray, tell me how”, in Spanish version (“Enséñame”), thanks to the contribution of Erwin and Nils, the German readers who They joined us. Our thanks to both! For the rest, this second session of free debate was as intense or more than the previous one. The debate had to be moderated, as there were many people and it was difficult to maintain a participatory conversation. Also, like the night before, we finished very late. We couldn't seem to wait to go to bed!

On Sunday, the last day, there was also room for two activities, one already common in recent Meetings and another that was something new. First of all, the novelty. First thing in the morning, there was a question-and-answer session about the book's teachings. The attendees had the opportunity to write a question on a piece of paper and deliver it to Ismael, the secretary of the meeting, so that he could compile it. On Sunday morning the questions were read and everyone tried to answer all of them. Once again, the discussion that followed each question was very enlightening and lively.

These were some of the questions that were raised in the session on Sunday:

- What do we do to strengthen our faith and allow spiritual gravity to influence our lives?
- How does _The Urantia Book_ fit in with the theme of ghosts and spirits seen in EVP and poltergeist phenomena?
- How can we reach the vast majority of the world's population that is not Christian?
- Are the physical controllers influencing to fix climate change?
- Are there readers of the book who, due to fanaticism, abandon what is truly required of us?
- When is the decision to follow up to the Father made: in this world or after awakening?

Lastly, and before lunch, the assembly of the Urantia Association of Spain was held, where the attendees were informed about the activities (in support of the study and dissemination) carried out during the last twelve months, as well as about future projects. . It was also a time for attendees to say what they thought of the Meeting, and to make suggestions on how to improve the experience of a readers' meeting. Then, and after the meal, we say goodbye with charged spiritual batteries. It doesn't matter how tired or how many hours you have lost sleep when you enjoy the company of so many kindred spirits!

(**Editor's Note:** On the website of the Urantia Association of Spain, more specifically in the “general” section of “Works”, the ideas compiled in the XII Encounter workshop will be published).
