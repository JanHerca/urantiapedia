## Editorial

Dear friends: another year draws to a close, and we remain faithful to our quarterly appointment to offer articles based on _The Urantia Book_ that help readers better understand the teachings contained in this wonderful book. First of all, we offer the second and final installment of Jacob Dix's very interesting article on the inhabited worlds of Satania and his hypothesis about the “surprise” that our solar system could contain.

Next, we stop to offer a very personal and inspiring prayer by Jesús Rodríguez, who from Mexico shares with us his version of the Our Father. It is followed by an enlightening article by our friend Efraín Vivanco, who from Ecuador tells us about the Thought Adjuster and our relationship with them.

We continue with another great article, this time by Horacio Gamboa, who from Chile addresses the issue of Lucifer's rebellion linked to the supposedly channeled messages that indicate that the Lucifer trial is close to issuing a sentence, and that they are having a certain echo among some groups of readers. The article refers to another article by Chuck Thurston that was published in the December 2012 issue of AUI Journal, and that we encourage you to read here, if you haven't already done so, at the following link: https://urantia-uai.org/publications/uai-journal/journal-archives/.

As always, we close this issue with two fixed sections: on this occasion, “convergences and divergences” will deal with evolution and its similarities and differences with respect to the theories supported by current science. Finally, we include the responses to our Urantia questionnaire from Jaime Marco, Vice President of the Urantia Association of Spain.

From here, we wish you a good start to the year, and that the holidays pass in peace and harmony.

Olga Lopez.
