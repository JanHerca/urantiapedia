## Presentation

Dear friends: after the monograph on our last annual Readers' Meeting, we once again offer different works related to _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings. First of all, we have Eduardo's article, where he deals again with the issue of the dissemination of the Book's teachings. The origin of the article on Orvonton and the Milky Way was a discussion held by email that continued at the last Gathering. Due to its interest, we thought it worth sharing with other readers through this newsletter. Jean-Claude Romeuf's article tries to shed some light on the role of God the Absolute, in relation to the other personalities of the Deity. And finally, my article is a little digression about how mathematics allows us to approach the Supreme Intelligence as well.

Fraternally
