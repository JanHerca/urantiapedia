## Presentation

Dear friends, we continue to offer you an issue with interesting conversations from the Internet study group. We hope these conversations will encourage you to start a study group in your area. There are many benefits that result from creating a stable study group: you lose the feeling of “spiritual isolation” that lonely readers often have, and you gain a greater understanding of the book's teachings. With the topics published in this bulletin we intend to reflect what study sessions can be that, even if they are “virtual” since their components are geographically dispersed, can help us clarify confusing points.

In this issue we also make room for poetry inspired by the book with a poem that Ernesto Veloso sends us from Cuba and that is dedicated to the Adjuster. Finally, we attach a brief summary of how our annual meeting (the eighth organized in our country) took place, recently held in Madrid, as well as the latest news on the UAI International Conference, which will be held in Benalmádena Costa (Málaga). in April next year. These international gatherings are also very important in order to feel part of a slowly but constantly growing community: the community of those who have decided to live according to the book's teachings and are committed to its dissemination, both in their daily lives and in a larger sphere.

Fraternally
