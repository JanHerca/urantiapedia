## Presentation

Dear friends: once again we are on the verge of publishing another issue of our magazine. We wholeheartedly appreciate the collaboration of readers who want to share with us their reflections on the teachings of the book. In this case we have a new collaborator: Horacio Gamboa, who from Chile sends us a very interesting and revealing work about the function and purpose of the mind in light of the book's teachings. For yet another issue, we have the invaluable collaboration of Ernesto Veloso from Cuba, to talk to us this time about one of the most inspiring encounters in the life of Jesus of Nazareth: the one he had with a Samaritan woman. Will we also be able to put prejudices aside and notice when we find ourselves before someone who yearns, like us, to reach the Father?

In keeping with custom, we present here another Internet study group dialogue, this time about the Thought Adjuster and its interaction with the human mind in which it resides. We also include in this issue an article by L.Coll about how he believes the dissemination of the teachings should be approached, highlighting the key points of the fifth revelation.

And, finally, and as usual in recent issues, we will give a glimpse of the most outstanding news related to the activities of our association.

I hope you enjoy your reading.

Fraternally

Olga Lopez
