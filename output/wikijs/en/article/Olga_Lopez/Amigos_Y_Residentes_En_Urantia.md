In many passages of the Book the revelators tell us of beings who reside on our planet and who are not ascending mortals like us. Some of them are here because that is what is customary in all the worlds of time and space (such as the midwayers, permanent citizens of the evolutionary worlds, and the Life Carriers, who can choose to stay on the world where they planted the life, once its mission is over). Others are here because of our peculiar condition as the world chosen to host the seventh bestowal of our Creator Son, and some more reside here as a consequence of the Lucifer rebellion, such as the Vorondadek son we have here on Urantia. I thought it would be interesting to make a count, a list of “other Urantia denizens”, as perhaps it would help us to be aware that we are not as abandoned by God as we think.

In this account I have considered only those beings who reside on our planet permanently or for a long time, at least for the duration of this age of the universe. In order of appearance in the Book, these are the “other dwellers” I have encountered:

1. **Conciliators**: group belonging to the hosts of space messengers. They are not permanently in a world, but they begin their service in worlds like ours. Therefore it is quite likely that there are some of these beings in our world right now (<a id="a43_247"></a>[UB 25:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/25#p3_3)).
2. **Recording Angels of the inhabited planets**: they also belong to the hosts of space messengers. (<a id="a44_102"></a>[UB 25:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/25#p5_2))
3. **Primary Supernaphim**: The current “chief of the seraphim” on Urantia is a primary Supernaphim of Paradise origin (<a id="a45_120"></a>[UB 27:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p0_2); <a id="a45_163"></a>[UB 37:8.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p8_10); <a id="a45_208"></a>[UB 114:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_2)).
4. **Mechanical Controllers**, belonging to the group of Master Physical Controllers: there are currently ten stationed on Urantia (<a id="a46_132"></a>[UB 29:4.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_19); <a id="a46_177"></a>[UB 39:5.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p5_14))
5. **Energy Transmitters** - There are thousands on Urantia, providing the initial boost for the seraphic party (<a id="a47_113"></a>[UB 29:4.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/29#p4_19); <a id="a47_158"></a>[UB 39:5.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p5_14)).
6. **Mortal Finaliters** - We are told that there are one or more companies on our planet (<a id="a48_91"></a>[UB 31:0.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p0_11)).
7. **Life Carriers and associates**: There are presently on Urantia two Carriers and twelve associates (<a id="a49_104"></a>[UB 36:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p3_9); <a id="a49_147"></a>[UB 62:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p7_3)).
8. **Vorondadek Son**: stationed on Urantia as an observer since the Caligastia betrayal. The current one makes the number 23 serving on Urantia (<a id="a50_146"></a>[UB 36:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p6_8); <a id="a50_189"></a>[UB 43:5.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/43#p5_17); <a id="a50_234"></a>[UB 114:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p6_2)).
9. **Archangels**: There is a divisional headquarters on Urantia, and this is something quite exceptional (<a id="a51_107"></a>[UB 37:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p3_3)).
10. **Midwayers**: permanent citizens of Urantia (<a id="a52_50"></a>[UB 37:9.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p9_11); <a id="a52_95"></a>[UB 38:9.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/38#p9_1); <a id="a52_138"></a>[UB 77:8.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p8_10)).
11. **Seraphim**: These are the different groups of seraphim that we can find on Urantia, not counting the guardian seraphim:
    - **Supreme Seraphim**, such as Manotia, the associate chief of the Seraphim on Urantia (<a id="a54_93"></a>[UB 39:0.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p0_9); <a id="a54_136"></a>[UB 53:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p6_6)).
    - **Assistant educators**: a body of this order exercises its activity here (<a id="a55_81"></a>[UB 39:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p2_7)).
    - **Administrative Assistants**: there is on Urantia a body made up of 1000 seraphim of this order (<a id="a56_104"></a>[UB 39:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p4_3)).
	In <a id="a57_4"></a>[UB 39:5.2-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p5_2) we are told about the planetary helpers that usually exist on inhabited worlds, all of them seraphim. Although many were removed from our planet after the Adamic fault, we still have seraphim here from these groups:
	- **Voices of the Garden**
	- **Spirits of Brotherhood**
	- **Souls of Peace**: their boss is Vevona
	- **Spirits of Trust**.
	- **Transporters**: there are a large number of them stationed on Urantia (<a id="a62_76"></a>[UB 39:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p5_10)).
	According to the Book, during the days in which the revelation was transmitted, there were some 501,234,619 pairs of seraphim (<a id="a63_128"></a>[UB 114:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p0_2)).
12. **Transport Advisers**: A body of 70 of this class of celestial craftsmen are serving on Urantia (<a id="a64_102"></a>[UB 44:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/44#p5_6)).
13. **Communications Experts**: Twelve of this class of celestial craftsmen are in service on Urantia (<a id="a65_103"></a>[UB 44:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/44#p5_7)).
14. **Racial Interpreters** - Referred to in <a id="a66_45"></a>[UB 48:6.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p6_22).
15. **Mind Planners** - Referred to in <a id="a67_39"></a>[UB 48:6.24](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p6_24).
16. **Lanonandek Son**: Caligastia, although devoid of all authority, is still on Urantia (<a id="a68_91"></a>[UB 66:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p8_6)).
17. **Personalized Adjusters**: Three of them appeared before the planetary Vorondadek of Urantia without being called, and continue in service here (<a id="a69_150"></a>[UB 109:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p7_7)).
18. **Resident Governor General**: little information is given to us about him; the revelators don't want us to know who the current governor is to prevent us from worshiping him. He is a member of the commission of 24 ancient Urantians installed on Jerusem and since he was appointed Governor General, he has permanently resided on Urantia. These governors take turns every hundred Urantian years. The most extensive reference is in Paper 114, but in previous documents it is also mentioned (<a id="a70_493"></a>[UB 39:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p4_3) and <a id="a70_539"></a>[UB 39:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p5_5)).

Curiously Machiventa Melchizedek, the vicegerent Planetary Prince of Urantia, does not reside on our planet. In <a id="a72_112"></a>[UB 55:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p7_3) it is said that he will occupy the seat of Planetary Sovereign when the planet reaches the stage of light and life. Meanwhile, the resident governor general is the one who represents him. Others who should be there and are not there because of their lack are our Material Sons. Although, as they belong to the Jerusem council of 24 (<a id="a72_487"></a>[UB 76:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p6_3)), they may have been resident governors for a hundred years.

## Where do “the other inhabitants” reside?

Once the count of the different beings permanently residing on Urantia has been made, the question that immediately arises is: where are they? Since in paper 44 it is said that spirit and morontia beings not only live in physical (material) spheres, but also have spiritual residences and accommodations (<a id="a76_305"></a>[UB 44:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/44#p3_1)), it seems logical to deduce that those non-material beings who reside on our planet they must have somewhere to dwell, spiritual or morontia residences not visible to our human eyes. Furthermore, we have in the Book the example of Caligastia, our rebellious Planetary Prince, who on his arrival on Urantia resided in Dalamatia even though he was not visible to humans.

Searching the Book for the aforementioned beings, several references appeared to the “_universal energy pole of the planet_” (<a id="a78_126"></a>[UB 39:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p5_13)), to the “_planetary pole of space communications_” (<a id="a78_223"></a>[UB 62:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p7_2)), to the “_place of the spiritual polarization of the planet_” (<a id="a78_329"></a>[UB 189:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/189#p3_2)). There may be another reference. I understand that this “pole” corresponds to a physical location, a geographical location on our planet, and I assume that the three previous references refer to the same place.

Is this “pole” the place where “the other inhabitants” reside?

It would be plausible to affirm that the residences of these beings must be in remote places with difficult access (I can't imagine the Governor General residing on the island of Manhattan or Hong Kong, to give a couple of examples). It is also possible that these places have some characteristics that make them different from the rest: either by the composition of the terrain, the orography, the geographical location (latitude/longitude), etc.

Thinking about all this, some supposedly “energetic” places on the planet came to mind, where strange phenomena have been observed since time immemorial: [Cerro Uritorco](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uritorco), next to the Argentine town of Capilla del Monte, the [ Barranco de Badajoz](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barranco_de_Badajoz) in the Tenerife town of Güímar, the mythical [Shangri-Lá](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shangri-La) of Tibet, the [Última Thule](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tule_(mitolog%C3%ADa)) of the northern polar deserts... It does not seem unreasonable to consider that beings of a different nature from ours have their refuge in these places, who are here fulfilling a mission, and whose “traces” are sometimes visible in the form of balls of light (visible) or strange prints on cameras (that the eye does not see).

Since they are beings that move at the speed of light or even faster (remember that midwayers move almost at the speed of light, and seraphim three times as fast), they can be anywhere on the planet. almost instantly. Physical distances are not a problem for them, so they can afford to live in remote places on the planet.

Of course, all of this is just conjecture. But perhaps this explains the strange phenomena that always occur in the same places. For the rest, wherever they are, we must be sure that although human government is going on such apparently chaotic courses, there is a “superhuman” government that is there with us and that works correctly. Residing on this planet are other invisible beings who help us where they can. They are “friends and residents on Urantia.”
