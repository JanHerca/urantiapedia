## Editorial

Dear friends: once we are here, faithful to our appointment, to deliver the first issue of the year. In this issue we end with the debate that arose from the publication of Stephen Hawking's latest book, in light of the revelation expressed in _The Urantia Book_.

Also once again we reserved a small place for poetry with a poem by our friend José Antonio.

Next, we include a work that due to its length we will publish in two parts, written from Chile by our friend Horacio Gamboa and that deals with the unification of personality. This is a concept that is totally redefined in _The Urantia Book_, and that Horace tries to break down and clarify a little more in his work.

In this issue we also have a work-dialogue by Antonio Moya and Carmelo Martínez, on the curious circumstance that occurred on our planet, so far removed in many aspects from the course of a normal world, from the enormous lapse of time elapsed between the appearance of the first human beings and the arrival of the Planetary Prince.

And, finally, we give you the information about our next Readers Meeting, which will be held for the first time in Catalan lands. More specifically in Valls, province of Tarragona, from May 5 to 8 of this year. From here we encourage you to attend this Encounter, which once again will have a different format to address the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ in different and enriching ways. In this case, the issue that will occupy us will be that of evolutionary religion versus revealed religion.
