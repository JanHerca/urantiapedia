## Editorial

Dear friends:

One year is about to end; a difficult year for many, but in which we want to maintain a positive spirit. _The Urantia Book_, as we pointed out in a previous issue, is a book for hope, so let us keep up the good spirits, let us act so that times are better and, of course, let us know the teachings of the book with our living example and in the way that best suits us.

This number brings, as usual, articles that come from interesting conversations of the study group on the Internet. The first arose from a question that arose in the northern study group about what times of day the Thought Adjuster works. The second article arises from another question, which this time was raised at the X Meeting of Readers, held last May in Valls: How to give examples of a triad as facts/meanings/values, so that we can all understand what each of the elements of this triad refers to? The answer is left open to the reflection of the reader.

We also have here an article by our friend L. Coll on secularism and true religion, which is what the world needs most in these moments of material and spiritual anxiety. Next, we have the second installment of Santi's section “Convergences and divergences”, which this time deals with human chromosomes and what science and the UB say about them.

Finally, a brief article related to the activities of the Urantia Association of Spain is included, more specifically about the meeting that took place on November 26 in Seville to reactivate the study group.

Enjoy reading!

Olga Lopez
