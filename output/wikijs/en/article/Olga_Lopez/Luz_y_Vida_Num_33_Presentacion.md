## Editorial

Dear friends: As usual, the summer issue of the magazine “Luz y Vida” will be dedicated practically entirely to the annual meeting of readers, of which we have already had twelve editions. This year it was held at the Osuna hotel in Madrid, from Friday, May 31 to Sunday, June 2, and it has been a complete success of participation, which we hope will be repeated in the future.

Our intention is that you can have an idea of what was experienced during those days, although there are no words that can convey what it means to experience it “live and direct”. Those of you who have attended book reader meetings know perfectly well what I mean. In the Meetings we have the opportunity to enjoy a camaraderie and an exchange of impressions that in our daily life is very difficult for us to experience.

In all the Meetings, a series of activities have been carried out that we want to keep in written form so that attendees can save them, and this year has not been an exception. In this issue and in the “Works” section of the website, you will have at your disposal the content generated during the Meeting.

Finally, and as a closing, the usual news section of the association, which includes the most outstanding initiatives that the board of directors has taken in recent months to support the study and dissemination of the book.

Have a good read!

Olga Lopez
