## Editorial

Dear friends: the June issue is always a monograph on the Readers' Meeting that is held every year, and this year is not going to be an exception. As you already know, this time we had to travel to the north, to the beautiful and dynamic city of Bilbao, where we were from Thursday, April 28 to Sunday, May 1. Although the weather promised to be cold and unstable, in the end the weather behaved quite well and we were able to enjoy a couple of outings to explore the center of the city.

Regarding the theme of the Meeting, all the presentations were related to the ascending race of mortals. A good part of their content will be included in this issue, although it is difficult to convey on paper all the feelings and thoughts they produced (we always say it, but it really is!).

I know that by dint of saying it it sounds like a cliché, but you have to see how time flies! We have no less than fifteen national meetings of readers, all different in terms of content and location, but identical in terms of the good atmosphere that is breathed in them. We hope that many of you will be encouraged to join us next year at the XVI Meeting, which at the time of writing these lines it is not known where it will be held. Any suggestion in this regard will be welcome!

Enjoy reading!

Olga Lopez
