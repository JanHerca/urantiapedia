## In this number:

- How many survive?, by various authors
- News about the UAI International Conference
- News from Urantia Association of Spain


## Presentation

Dear friends: in this issue we offer two articles. The first, by Mariano Pérez, is a very interesting work in which, following a trip to Israel made by the Madrid study group, he presents a comparison of the Holy Places according to tradition and according to what the revelators indicate in The lu. We also have in this issue another conversation among those maintained by the Internet study group, regarding eternal survival.

As a novelty, we also offer news about our association and the information currently available about the UAI 2009 International Conference, which will be held in Benalmádena Costa (Málaga), and which will be attended by readers from all over the world. In future issues of the newsletter we will give more news related to this event, the most important in the international arena in regards to the Urantia movement. We wait for you!

Fraternally
