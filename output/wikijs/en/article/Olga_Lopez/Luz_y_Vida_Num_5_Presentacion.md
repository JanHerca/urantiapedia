## Presentation

Dear friends: it is rigorously true that “time flies”. A year has passed since we started publishing this bulletin, a year has passed since the last Encounter, and it seems like yesterday!

The balance of the time elapsed between the two Meetings has been, how could it be otherwise, positive. The bulletin, which was initially going to be biannual, has seen four issues published in one year. From the association we would love to continue with this rhythm and we will do everything possible to make it so, but we need your collaboration.

This number, as happened with the first, will be devoted entirely to the debates held during the VI Meeting of Readers, which was held from April 28 to May 1, 2006 at the San Juan de la Cruz Monastery, located in the millennial Segovia city. We hope to reflect here the work carried out during those days and, of course, the spirit that governed the relations between the attendees. All of you who have attended a Meeting know that there is something special in the atmosphere that is impossible to avoid.

Fraternally
