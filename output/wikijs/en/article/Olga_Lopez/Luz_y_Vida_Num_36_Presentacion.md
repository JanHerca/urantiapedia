## Editorial

Dear friends: now that we are leaving winter behind, a new issue of our magazine arrives faithful to its appointment, with very interesting contributions and with the information of the next Readers' Meeting (number thirteen), which will be held at the end of May in the beautiful and bright city of Valencia. This city is the last in which a study group was created, so the Meeting serves to support readers in the area, apart from being the annual meeting point for readers from all over the country. As you will see, the protagonist of this Meeting will be our beloved Jesus of Nazareth, around whom the activities of this national conference of readers will revolve.

But before the information about the Meeting, we have several very interesting articles. The first, “Eugenics, a controversial issue”, is a choral work that originated in an email conversation. This is a subject that usually raises blisters due to the bad reputation of the term, but as open-minded people we must approach it courageously. The second article is another passionate article by Horacio Gamboa, who from Viña del Mar (Chile) shares his vision about death and the best way to face this inevitable fact, in light of the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. It is followed by a brief but intense reflection by L. Coll on today's society and the lack of harmony that reigns within it. Finally, two fixed sections: the “convergences and divergences” of our friend Santi, which on this occasion deals with an apparent contradiction that arises when one wants to find out how long it can take a mortal to reach Paradise; and the “Urantian Questionnaire”, which on this occasion will be answered by Ismael Gracia, the secretary of the association.

Have a happy and enlightening read!

Olga Lopez.
