## Editorial

Dear friends, as we have fully entered the new year, we have some good jobs to offer you. First of all, we recovered a conversation that took place in the Association's list, “Urantia Corner”, about the recent discovery of a new planet in the solar system, located beyond the orbit of Pluto. Let's remember that in the book the solar system is mentioned to have twelve planets (counting the asteroid belt), so it will be very interesting to see how the observations of science reconcile with what is said in the book about it.

Next, we have an article that includes two interventions by David Carrera and Santiago Flores on one of the “thorny” topics of the book: eugenics. We appreciate such unprejudiced and courageous views on an issue that has been misunderstood for decades.

Finally, we have the regular sections of this magazine: the convergences and divergences of Santiago Rodríguez, which in this case will deal with a recent discovery that will undoubtedly be of great importance for the advancement of science: gravitational waves, which Einstein had predicted in his theory of general relativity but they had not yet been detected experimentally. Next comes the Urantia Questionnaire, which this time will be answered by the writer. And last but not least, news from the Urantia Association of Spain, which will focus on the annual meeting of Spanish readers, which in this case will travel north to the dynamic city of Bilbao. We hope that many of you will be encouraged to come to experience an atmosphere of great brotherhood during these almost four days. Also, Bilbao is well worth a visit!

Enjoy reading!

Olga Lopez
