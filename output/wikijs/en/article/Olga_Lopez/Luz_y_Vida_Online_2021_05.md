We arrive at the month of MAY with an extraordinary and valuable baggage in our hands.

On the one hand, we have the joy of meeting brothers and sisters of different races, continents, countries... women and men united by the same transcendent and marvelous ideal: to do the divine will on our planet.

This flash of light and life that the XI International Urantia Conference in Peru has shown to the world allows us to have more hope to cope with our daily lives. We now have greater certainty that we are not alone in our desire to spread Goodness, Truth and Beauty on our blue planet. There are people in multiple parts of the planet who are guided by their wonderful Adjuster, with whom we are in tune, and we are undoubtedly protected by countless celestial presences or older brothers.

> “And all this is ever true, for, where two or three believers are gathered together, there am I in the midst of them.” (<a id="a66_122"></a>[UB 159:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p1_3))

But we also have another piece of good news: our beloved Urantia Book comes out more splendid and neat than ever before with the new Spanish translation or revision. A high-quality translation, up to the times we live in and that will allow us to better grasp and learn the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ starting in 2021.

And if we keep looking in our luggage, dear reader, we have even more elements of joy. You can leaf through this Urantia Association Spain Newsletter with the certainty of finding not only news, but also quality works that will allow you to better understand _The Urantia Book_:

- The reality of matter and energy, from our beloved Carmelo Martínez.
- The calm of Santiago Rodríguez's reflection on the undemonstrability of God.
- The trips and experiences lived by Jesus in the Roman Empire, by Demetrio Gómez, or
- Javier Martínez's profound reflection on the future of our planet.

Do we check our luggage more thoroughly, to see what else we find?

Fancy reading a Urantia-inspired book? Well, we show you two books by two veteran UB readers that are priceless.

Do you want some help to study? We offer you the precious work of Eduardo Altuzarra on the fourth part and a very interesting blog to follow, that of Jael González.

Do you want to get to know a reader up close? We show you the testimony of the current treasurer of the Association, Ana María García, and the YouTube video where Ginés Avilés talks with Julio Miranda on a splendid subject.

Anyway, everything is interesting, like life itself. Well, everything is new when you look at it with patience and intensity. We are surrounded by so many things to discover. And it is that we go through life too fast, without fixing our gaze on things, without stopping to discover and think about them. For this reason, against the drowsiness of habit or the already hackneyed, the vigilance of astonishment.

Welcome then to the amazing and eternal adventure that opens with the reading of _The Urantia Book_.

[Matter and energy. Physics and _The Urantia Book_ (Carmelo Martínez)](/en/article/Carmelo_Martinez/La_materia_y_la_energia_La_fisica_y_LU) (also on the [association's website](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/03/La-materia-y-la-energ%C3%ADa.-La-f%C3%ADsica-y-El-libro-de-Urantia.pdf))

In this extensive work, Carmelo Martínez (already graduated from this world) discusses material reality in the light of _The Urantia Book_, but without losing sight of the findings and theories of science. To do this, he briefly reviews the history of physics until he reaches particle physics and ends with his personal vision of ultimatons (not yet discovered by science), morontia matter and spiritual matter, based on the teachings from the book.

[See here the supporting PowerPoint presentation](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/05/La-materia-y-la-energ%C3%ADa.-La-f%C3%ADsica-y-El-libro-de-Urantia-presentaci%C3%B3n.pdf)

[Unprovability of the existence of God (Santiago Rodríguez)](/en/article/Santiago_Rodriguez/Indemostrabilidad_de_la_existencia_de_Dios) (also on the [association's website](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/03/Indemostrabilidad.pdf))

How many times have we thought about convincing others of the existence of God? In this brief but accurate reflection of the author, he starts from the gift of free will to human beings and from our condition as children of God by faith to reach the conclusion that the existence of God cannot be demonstrated objectively.

[The Scribe of Damascus (Demetrio Gómez)](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/03/EL-ESCRIBA-DE-DAMASCO.pdf)

In this work, which was presented at one of the national meetings of the Urantia Association of Spain, Demetrio reviews the part of Jesus' life that is detailed in _The Urantia Book_ but does not appear in the gospels: the journey for the Roman empire that Jesus made together with Gonod and Ganid, a wealthy businessman from India and his teenage son. This is a period in the life of Jesus that is worth studying in depth, since it was much more than the prelude to the public life of the Master.

[The future of our planet (Javier Martínez)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Jzywq0r7btQ5gxgTiATyH7P2QApyywI9)

In this work (which is the basic text for a presentation given in a virtual room), the author analyzes the current situation of our planet and the obstacles humanity faces, to then go through the planetary stages it is going through all humanity according to _The Urantia Book_ until arriving at light and life.

<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2021_05/Levoileseleve.jpg" alt="Caen los velos" width="130">
</figure>

The Veils Fall (Joseph Servant)

_The veils fall_ is the Spanish translation of the novel by the French reader Joseph Servant _Le voile se lève_, a story in which a breakdown suffered by two astronauts is the starting point of an encounter with two aliens who take them in their spacecraft back home and on the way they show them the main teachings of _The Urantia Book_. A story that readers of the book will like and that addresses the teachings from the unique point of view of its author.

The Circles of Truth (Cristian Liur)

The Circles of Truth is the first and so far the only novel by Cristian Liur, a reader who with this book has wanted to make known the existence of _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings in the form of an adventure that takes the protagonist to Peruvian lands. . It is highly recommended to introduce the teachings of the book to those who are searching for the Truth.

## Recommended Blog: Study of the Urantia Writings, by Jael González

<figure id="Figure_9" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2021_05/EstudiosdelasEscrituras.jpg" alt="Estudios de los Escritos de Urantia">
</figure>

This blog by Jael González, a reader who has lived in Argentina for many years, helps a lot to clarify certain issues in _The Urantia Book_, especially those that have to do with the ancient history of our planet and with scientific issues. It is also very interesting because it compares current knowledge with the teachings of the book, so that the reader can see how little by little the book's statements are confirmed by recent scientific discoveries.

In the last few weeks many of his works are being moved to YouTube videos, from the channel [Urantia Writings Studies](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7jKlrYCBGq0CiLTGDq-0KQ).

## Urantia Association International Virtual Conference – April 24 & 25

</figure>

Last weekend of April 24 and 25, the first virtual Urantia Association International conference took place, to which more than 1,900 people from all continents registered. The event was broadcast in four languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese, and French) and was divided into two parts: in the first, plenary talks were given, and in the last two hours, simultaneous workshops were offered.

This conference was the largest of all Urantia conferences held so far, which gives much hope for the development of the book's community of readers throughout the world. It has also been the first one that has been developed virtually, so it was a challenge in many aspects (especially in the technical aspects), but the important thing is that the participants were able to enjoy the talks and workshops to which they signed up and feel that they were part of a larger community of kindred spirits who share the same concern to contribute to creating a better world.

One of the highlights of the virtual conference was the presentation of the new revision of the Spanish translation of _The Urantia Book_, which has involved ten years of work by a team of volunteers, work that is already in its phases. end of orthotypographic revision. The digital versions are expected to be available on the Urantia Foundation website in mid-summer, and the printed book is expected to be published in late fall. The unity effort has finally paid off and there will be only one Spanish translation!

The virtual experience has set a valuable precedent for future conferences that, even if they are face-to-face, should also have a virtual part, to give other readers the opportunity to participate in the event.

Our congratulations to the organizing team of the Urantia Association of Peru for an intense weekend in which the Urantia teachings were the protagonists.

## Urantia Questionnaire: Ana María García

</figure>

Ana María García Simón, a native of Estepona (Málaga), by profession, administrative assistant in a public administration for 28 years now. Mother of two daughters from a first marriage and unfortunately recently widow of my second husband with whom I had the experience of sharing the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. I am the treasurer of the Urantia Association of Spain.

1. **How did you get to _The Urantia Book_ and why do you think you found it?**

I have always been a seeker, I have always kept in communication with the Father. My husband had read the book in depth, he wanted to know my impression about these topics while we were getting to know each other and he left me clues to see where my curiosity would take me. Finally, he discovered that my interest was more common between us and I am still discovering his teachings.

2. **What was your first impression when reading it?**

There were parts of the book that came to impact me and I still have that feeling today. Although I still do not feel capable of transmitting what I know, when I read it it is a map, a guide, as if many theories and knowledge from within me were consolidated.

</figure>

The Association is organizing Urantia Talks so that all who wish can join and discuss topics that interest them. The idea is that the moderators propose a starting topic, which can then be followed by others at the proposal of the attendees.

At the moment these talks are fortnightly (every other Friday) and their purpose is to maintain contact between readers in the absence of face-to-face events, as well as to share the teachings in an atmosphere of fraternity and camaraderie.

Meetings will be held in the [Association Zoom room](https://zoom.us/j/362798144).

The meetings for the month of May will be on Fridays **7 and 21 at 7:00 p.m.** (Spanish peninsular time). We wait for you!
