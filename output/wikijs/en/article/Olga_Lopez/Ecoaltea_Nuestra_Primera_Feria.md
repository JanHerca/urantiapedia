Waiting for the visitors, with the newly assembled stand. As we already announced in this magazine, the Urantia Association of Spain was present with a stand at the EcoAltea fair, which was held in the Alicante town of Altea from October 2 to 3. The stand was attended by Andrés Pérez (treasurer), Eduardo Altuzarra (vice president) and Olga López (president), together with their respective spouses.

We were very fortunate that the warm and sunny weather accompanied us during the two days of the fair, as well as the luck of enjoying a good location in one of the entrances. The stands of the fair were spread out in the gardens that surround the Palau Altea and the Miguel Hernández University, so the environment was calm and very appropriate for the theme of the fair, which dealt with environmentalism and alternative therapies.

Almost everyone who passed near our stand stopped to read what was on the displays that we had placed on both sides of the stand. Some people asked us what _The Urantia Book_ was about and then we gave them informational pamphlets. Others simply picked up the brochures without asking anything. But there were also a few who took a few minutes of their time to chat with us. As night began to fall we screened several introductory presentations to _The Urantia Book_, to catch the attention of the visitors.

During the two days that the fair lasted, we were pleasantly surprised to meet people who had been reading the book for some time and who asked us about other readers in the area. We gave one of them the contact information for the study group in Murcia, which was the closest geographically, although the ideal would be to create a study group in the province of Alicante. We believe that this area has great potential for study groups; Its climate and its geographical location have made it a point of influx of many citizens from northern Europe and this has influenced it to be fertile ground for spiritual research.

Before going to the fair, we were afraid of not fitting in, but this fear dissipated as soon as we began to experience the good atmosphere among the fairgrounds and when we saw the type of public that visited the fair. After this experience, which has seemed enormously positive to us, we are determined to repeat attendance at this type of fair if our economic possibilities allow it, and in this way make _The Urantia Book_ known to the general public and our association to readers. in particular.

If you know of any fair of this type in your neighborhood, do not hesitate to contact us at our email address, urantiaesp@gmail.com
