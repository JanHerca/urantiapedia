In document 100, “Religion in Human Experience,” and more specifically in section 5, “Conversion and Mysticism,” there are some very interesting and thought-provoking paragraphs:

> _The world is filled with lost souls, not lost in the theologic sense but lost in the directional meaning, wandering about in confusion among the isms and cults of a frustrated philosophic era. Too few have learned how to install a philosophy of living in the place of religious authority. (The symbols of socialized religion are not to be despised as channels of growth, albeit the river bed is not the river.)_
> 
> _The progression of religious growth leads from stagnation through conflict to co-ordination, from insecurity to undoubting faith, from confusion of cosmic consciousness to unification of personality, from the temporal objective to the eternal, from the bondage of fear to the liberty of divine sonship._
> 
> _It should be made clear that professions of loyalty to the supreme ideals—the psychic, emotional, and spiritual awareness of God-consciousness—may be a natural and gradual growth or may sometimes be experienced at certain junctures, as in a crisis. The Apostle Paul experienced just such a sudden and spectacular conversion that eventful day on the Damascus road. Gautama Siddhartha had a similar experience the night he sat alone and sought to penetrate the mystery of final truth. Many others have had like experiences, and many true believers have progressed in the spirit without sudden conversion._
> 
> _Most of the spectacular phenomena associated with so-called religious conversions are entirely psychologic in nature, but now and then there do occur experiences which are also spiritual in origin. When the mental mobilization is absolutely total on any level of the psychic upreach toward spirit attainment, when there exists perfection of the human motivation of loyalties to the divine idea, then there very often occurs a sudden down-grasp of the indwelling spirit to synchronize with the concentrated and consecrated purpose of the superconscious mind of the believing mortal. And it is such experiences of unified intellectual and spiritual phenomena that constitute the conversion which consists in factors over and above purely psychologic involvement._
> 
> _But emotion alone is a false conversion; one must have faith as well as feeling. To the extent that such psychic mobilization is partial, and in so far as such human-loyalty motivation is incomplete, to that extent will the experience of conversion be a blended intellectual, emotional, and spiritual reality._
> 
> _If one is disposed to recognize a theoretical subconscious mind as a practical working hypothesis in the otherwise unified intellectual life, then, to be consistent, one should postulate a similar and corresponding realm of ascending intellectual activity as the superconscious level, the zone of immediate contact with the indwelling spirit entity, the Thought Adjuster. The great danger in all these psychic speculations is that visions and other so-called mystic experiences, along with extraordinary dreams, may be regarded as divine communications to the human mind. In times past, divine beings have revealed themselves to certain God-knowing persons, not because of their mystic trances or morbid visions, but in spite of all these phenomena._
> 
> _In contrast with conversion-seeking, the better approach to the morontia zones of possible contact with the Thought Adjuster would be through living faith and sincere worship, wholehearted and unselfish prayer. Altogether too much of the uprush of the memories of the unconscious levels of the human mind has been mistaken for divine revelations and spirit leadings._
> 
> _There is great danger associated with the habitual practice of religious daydreaming; mysticism may become a technique of reality avoidance, albeit it has sometimes been a means of genuine spiritual communion. Short seasons of retreat from the busy scenes of life may not be seriously dangerous, but prolonged isolation of personality is most undesirable. Under no circumstances should the trancelike state of visionary consciousness be cultivated as a religious experience._
> 
> _The characteristics of the mystical state are diffusion of consciousness with vivid islands of focal attention operating on a comparatively passive intellect. All of this gravitates consciousness toward the subconscious rather than in the direction of the zone of spiritual contact, the superconscious. Many mystics have carried their mental dissociation to the level of abnormal mental manifestations._
> 
> _The more healthful attitude of spiritual meditation is to be found in reflective worship and in the prayer of thanksgiving. The direct communion with one’s Thought Adjuster, such as occurred in the later years of Jesus’ life in the flesh, should not be confused with these so-called mystical experiences. The factors which contribute to the initiation of mystic communion are indicative of the danger of such psychic states. The mystic status is favored by such things as: physical fatigue, fasting, psychic dissociation, profound aesthetic experiences, vivid sex impulses, fear, anxiety, rage, and wild dancing. Much of the material arising as a result of such preliminary preparation has its origin in the subconscious mind._
> 
> _However favorable may have been the conditions for mystic phenomena, it should be clearly understood that Jesus of Nazareth never resorted to such methods for communion with the Paradise Father. Jesus had no subconscious delusions or superconscious illusions._ [UB 100:5.1-11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p5_1)

These paragraphs from the UB show us the right direction when it comes to living the true religious experience. Mystical raptures are not only unnecessary, but they are detrimental to communicating with our Thought Adjuster. We must maintain a serene attitude, have faith, but a reasoned faith, not blind faith. There is no master other than our “divine spark.” Those who seek out masters and gurus do so because they want to be given the path already prepared.

In LU, it is often stated that religious experience is personal and therefore non-transferable; no one can live it for us, nor can we live that of others. There is no religious authority other than that dictated by intuition and our understanding; there are no dogmas, no official interpretations; we are free to live our religious experience as we see fit. Those who fervently adhere to an “ism” are merely restricting their freedom for the sake of dubious security, in the mistaken hope of earning heaven on earth by following the precepts of the guru of the moment.

For me, true “conversion” is one that happens gradually but inexorably. I always say that the UB has changed me, slowly but surely, and in a way that there's no turning back. And, rather than trying to convince others of the great truths that the UB holds for us, it's much more effective (although it works more in the long term) for our friends and family to see that we truly live a life of peace and harmony, which may make them wonder, in the long run, what has produced these changes in us.

Of those who have learned about the LU from friends or family, some will have started reading it and relegated it to the forgotten shelf. Others will have refused to even read a single line, thinking that a book revealed by celestial entities can contain nothing but superstition. But there is always someone who can be “touched” by what is said in the LU, so there is no need to be discouraged by it, nor stubbornly insist on “selling” the LU to everyone who knows us. I am convinced that the LU always arrives at the right time. “Someone” up there makes sure that this happens.
