## Presentation

Dear friends: after the monograph on our last annual Readers' Meeting, we once again offer different works related to _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings. In this issue we offer two of the very interesting conversations held by the Internet study group. First, we have a dialogue about the Jerusem circles discussed in paper 46. Second, a conversation about the possibility (or impossibility) of interworld communications in light of the UB. We also have an article by José Alberto Wonsover, which would be the continuation of his article “The adventure of living”, which was published in our December 2006 issue. Finally, we also include a small article by L. Coll whose theme It is the star of Bethlehem and what is said about it in the UB, compared to what scientists say.

We hope you find the content interesting.

Fraternally
