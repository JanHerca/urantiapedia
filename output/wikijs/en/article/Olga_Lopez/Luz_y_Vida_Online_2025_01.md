At this point, it seems pointless to deny that we are possibly experiencing one of the greatest changes ever seen in human history. The transformation is taking place at all levels: social, labor, economic, financial, environmental, cultural, consciousness, etc., and it affects us all, regardless of the country or continent we live in, race, creed, or socioeconomic level.

It's a tsunami that affects everything and everyone. We're talking about a paradigm shift that is revolutionizing our lives. Do you realize how fortunate we are to witness these historic moments?

Beyond our everyday, personal experience, the data suggests that all this we see is just the **tip of the iceberg**. A study by **Karl Fisch** provides figures that suggest the big change is yet to come.

His research points out aspects such as these:

<br style="clear:both;"/>

- In the next eight seconds, for every baby born in the U.S., four will be born in China and five in India.
- The 25% of Chinese population with the highest IQ exceeds the entire population of the United States.
- Nintendo's research and innovation budget exceeds the US government's education budget.
- This year alone, more information will be generated than in the previous five thousand years!

## Works – Our Recommendations of the Month

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">

[**Simplification of the Foreword (Bill Sadler)**](/en/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/A_Simplification_of_the_Foreword_to_The_Urantia_Book) (also on the [association website](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/03/Simplificaci%C3%B3n-del-Pr%C3%B3logo.pdf))

The Prologue is always a daunting part of the book, especially when first encountering it. In this transcript of a talk by Bill Sadler, son of Dr. William Sadler, he addresses the concepts found in the Prologue and explains them in a very conversational and accessible manner. This work is highly recommended for anyone wishing to clarify the concepts found in the Prologue, which are then key to understanding the teachings of other parts of the book.

[**Is Orvonton's Superuniverse the Milky Way? (Eduardo Altuzarra)**](/en/article/Eduardo_Altuzarra/El_superuniverso_de_Orvonton_es_la_Via_Lactea) (also on the [association's website](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/03/El-Superuniverso-de-Orvonton-%C2%BFEs-la-V%C3%ADa-L%C3%A1ctea.pdf))

In this 11-page work, the author, Eduardo Altuzarra, a veteran reader of the book, expounds, based on quotes from the book, graphs, and secondary works by other readers, his thesis that Orvonton is the Milky Way galaxy.

Santiago Rodríguez is a veteran reader and amateur astronomer. A few years ago, he wrote this extensive but extremely interesting work on the dimensions of Nebadon, based on the book's description and current astronomical data and quotes. The reference quote, which alludes to Antares as the largest star in Nebadon, gives the author the opportunity to establish the approximate size and location of our universe.

In recent years, many works of fiction related to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ have been published, but this is a story that was written when there were still few secondary works in the form of fiction (1994) and that Carmelo Martínez translated into Spanish in 2011. As its title clearly indicates, it is an account of someone who wakes up in the resurrection chamber of the first mansion world due to an accident. Once there, he experiences what _The Urantia Book_ explains as the morontial life in its full extent.

## History and Teachings: Chronicle of the Life of Jesus

**JOURNALISTIC ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE AND TEACHINGS OF JESUS ​​ACCORDING TO _THE URANTIA BOOK_**

We present the next installment of the chronicles of Jesus' life, which this time contains what the revelators tell us in Document 163 (The Ordination of the Seventy in Magadan). Within the PDF, you will find a button to access the text of the document from the Urantia Foundation website.

<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2025_01/Ruth-y-sus-amistades.jpg" alt="Ruth and her friendships" width="250">
</figure>

We continue reviewing the secondary work _A Child's Guide to The Urantia Book_ by Mary Livingston. This is the next chapter, which deals with the children's close relationship with Jesus while he was still living in the family home in Nazareth.

"When Jesus turned 25, little Ruth was 10 years old. Jesus worked in the caravan warehouse, making repairs. Jesus loved children. He would gather sand, blocks, and stones from the area to play with them. Many children came to play."

## Other books on spiritual growth

<figure id="Figure_8" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2025_01/El-arte-de-la-felicidad.png" alt="The art of happiness" width="250">
</figure>

**The Art of Happiness (Dalai Lama and Howard C. Cutler)**

This book takes us on a transformative journey toward personal fulfillment and the constant pursuit of happiness in our lives. Throughout these pages, we delve into in-depth conversations between the authors, the Dalai Lama and psychiatrist Howard C. Cutler, who explore the fundamental keys to achieving true happiness.

The fundamental premise of this book is that the pursuit of happiness is a universal right of all human beings. The Dalai Lama teaches us that mental disposition is crucial on this path, since without the right attitude, no external source of pleasure can bring us lasting happiness.

In his conversations with Cutler, the Dalai Lama explores the importance of eliminating negative feelings and accepting suffering as an inevitable part of life. Only by transforming our minds can we achieve true happiness and become warm and caring people.

**The Seven Most Important Revelations of The Urantia Book (UrantiaGuide)**

This video from the [Urantia Guide](https://bit.ly/44StnMX) channel takes us on an extraordinary journey through the most profound and transformative revelations in _The Urantia Book_, exploring seven fundamental truths that change our understanding of the universe, our origin, and our divine destiny. From the true nature of God as Universal Father and the presence of Thought Adjusters in our minds to the fascinating history of the Lucifer rebellion and its consequences for our planet, it uncovers the truth about Adam and Eve as superior beings sent to elevate our civilization and introduces the mysterious midwayers who have been silent witnesses to our history. It also touches on our true origin and purpose as a species and shows us the extraordinary journey that awaits us after physical death, through the mansion worlds and beyond. This isn't just information: it's an invitation to expand consciousness and understand our place in a universe infinitely vaster and more meaningful than we have ever imagined.

## Navigating through life: The Father's shoes

<figure id="Figure_10" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2025_01/Los-zapatos-del-Padre.jpg" alt="The Father's Shoes" width="350">
</figure>

I come from a humble family and I remember when I was little that my feet were covered by simple canvas slippers with a ribbon across the instep that was tied with a fat, rounded button.

My memory takes me back to those moments when I helped my father clean his shoes on Sunday mornings before going to Mass. Shoes were big and worn, but sturdy and clean.

Sometimes, I dreamed of the day I, too, would have a pair of my own, as elegant and well-kept as his. There I would go, hand in hand with my father, tall and elegant, impeccable in his Sunday best and his fascinating shoes, to his Sunday routine. I imagined growing up with that bearing, those shoes, and that distinction.

Today I wear shoes and I have known another Father for thirty years and I have sometimes heard something like wearing God's shoes or feeling like I am in God's shoes.

## Ideas taken from the Circle of Trust group: the Spirit of Truth

<figure id="Figure_11" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2025_01/Espiritu-de-la-Verdad.jpg" alt="Circle of Trust: The Spirit of Truth" width="350">
</figure>

[Third installment of the ideas that emerged from the Circle of Trust conversations supported by the Urantia Association of Spain. We believe these reflections can be useful to others and spark new thinking, while respecting the privacy and anonymity of the circle members.]

**14th Meeting of the Circle of Trust, October 4, 2024**

- The spiritual agencies are coordinated: Thought Adjuster and Spirit of Truth. When you experience the Creator Son, you are also connected to the Spirit of Truth. The answers to life always come through this connection. This is the engine of change.
- What one wants to believe is the individual (relative) truth. The truth must flow into the soul.
- Truth is received in the mind. It's experienced as an awakening. It's a sincere conversation with oneself.
- True ideas that enter the mind are transformed into good actions and consequences related to spiritual evolution.
- People who are seekers of Truth must have a close connection with the Spirit of Truth.
- The connection with the Spirit of Truth must be like a TCP/IP connection with a circuit.
- The Spirit of Truth makes us distinguish the important things in life. These important truths are transformed into facts and then into meanings.
- The consequences of connecting with the Spirit of Truth give us peace. Silence is a good ally for connecting with the Spirit of Truth.
- You have to be receptive to connecting with the Spirit of Truth. You have to seek the truth; it doesn't come unless you ask for it.

## Urantian Questionnaire

Ariel lives in Santiago, Dominican Republic. He is a writer and film director by profession. He is single and has no children.

**1. How did you come across _The Urantia Book_ and why do you think you found it?**

I first came across The Urantia Book through the novels by JJ Benítez and Lucifer's Rebellion. After reading the latter, I was so impressed that I wanted to continue expanding my knowledge.

**2. What was your first impression when you read it?**

From the very beginning, I considered it a true revelation. I had already had an open mind because of *The Lucifer Rebellion*, and upon reading *The Urantia Book*, I was struck by the depth of its content.

## Comanche Territory: Opening of a new virtual discussion forum

<figure id="Figure_14" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2025_01/Territorio-Comanche.jpg" alt="Comanche Territory" width="350">
</figure>

In our ongoing quest to disseminate The Urantia Book and foster interaction among readers, both in Spain and abroad, we are excited to launch the virtual forum "Comanche Territory." This space will be a forum for debate and discussion dedicated to the exchange of ideas related to this wonderful revelation.

The sole purpose of this forum is the growth of all who participate, through the exchange of ideas and opinions on any topic related to **_The Urantia Book_**. By sharing our concerns and reflections, we help others understand certain concepts more deeply. Furthermore, by listening to different perspectives, we avoid laziness or stagnation and stay on the path of personal growth. Expressing ourselves openly is a magnificent way to refine ourselves as the imperfect beings that we are.

The moderators of this space only ask for two essential ingredients: respect and good humor. Both attitudes will be essential for our conversations to flow in an enriching and harmonious manner.
