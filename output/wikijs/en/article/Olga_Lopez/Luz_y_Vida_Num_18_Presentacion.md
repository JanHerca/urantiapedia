## In this number:

- The mind according to revelation (last part), by Horacio Gamboa
- The Unmanifested, by Ernesto Veloso
- How Many Mortals Survive, by Trevor Swadling
- The four candles, by L. Coll
- News from Urantia Association of Spain

## Presentation

Dear friends: After the monographic issue dedicated to the triennial conference of Urantia Association International, we once again offer articles written by readers. In this newsletter we offer the third and final part of Horacio Gamboa's work on the mind and what is mentioned about it in _The Urantia Book_. We include another writing by our friend Ernesto Veloso, with his reflections on the unmanifested and his relationship with God, a being that cannot be fully encompassed or defined.

You can also read here an interesting article by Trevor Swadling, a lucid Australian reader, who makes an amazing (and also controversial) reflection on the percentage of mortals who finally survive final death. And the collaborations for this issue close with a poetry-parable by L. Coll.

Finally, we include a section that includes the most outstanding news related to the activities of our association.

I hope you enjoy reading.

Fraternally

Olga Lopez
