## Presentation

Dear friends: true to our date, here is the last issue of “Light and Life” for this year. A lot of healthy debate has been generated among the study groups on many topics, which we gradually try to reflect in this newsletter. Our issue opens with an article originating from one of these debates, about the size of Satania and other administrative units of Orvonton, written by Carmelo Martínez, from the study group of the north. Below, we include a contribution from a reader from across the Atlantic, María José García, who from Chile makes an interesting reflection on forgiveness. Back in our territory, we have the collaboration of L. Coll (member of the Barcelona study group) who starts from the question “Did God make a mistake when creating our planet?” to express very enlightening ideas that appear in the book. We continue with a brief but precious poem by our Canarian friend José A. Rodríguez Jorge. And, to finish with the articles based on the contents of the book, we have the first part of two installments on one of the most difficult concepts in the book to understand: the absonite.

In the final part of the magazine, you can see news related to the activities of our association.

I hope you enjoy reading.

Fraternally

Olga Lopez
