## Works – our recommendations of the month

<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2023_10/LU-para-ninos-Oracion.jpg" alt="Meditar, orar y adorar" width="250">
</figure>

[**Meditate, pray and worship (Mariano Pérez)**](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/03/MeditarOrar.pdf)

In this article, the author discusses the difference between these three actions, which are often confused in our religious practice. In his introduction, he states: “For those who seek the Truth, Beauty and Goodness that exists in Creation and in the hand that directs it, it is of utmost importance to be clear about these concepts and techniques in order to apply them in their daily lives and to evolve in the perfection of the soul. Meditation, prayer and worship are precious and very necessary tools for those who truly want to achieve one day, in this life or later in their future existence, the true objective of our endeavors: The union with our inner Being with the divine spirit that dwells within us.”

</figure>

[**Was the crucifixion really necessary? (Ken Glasziou)**](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/03/Crucifixion.pdf)

Thus, with that question, the author begins his essay. A question whose answer begins with “it depends on each person's theology” and which continues by alluding to the doctrine of atonement. Curiously, the author points out that “although it is mentioned in the gospels and in the epistles of the New Testament, it is doubtful that the doctrine of atonement was of great importance to the first Christian communities.” It was much later when the ideas of Saint Augustine of Hippo about original sin and that we are all born in a state of guilt and condemnation were those that were propagated and gained importance in later Christian theology. The author also reflects on the attitude that we as readers should have towards those who believe in it, in light of the teachings of _The Urantia Book_.

[**The transformative revelation. Personal transformation (Javier Martínez)**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_UQKbEFXyAtSHjzRB41kUx0wQ46PY6lm)

In this presentation, the author expresses the transformation that the revelation contained in the pages of _The Urantia Book_ brings about within us, both from a theoretical (conceptual) and practical (daily life) point of view. The author points out that the book answers the great questions that we ask ourselves as members of humanity and not only that: it encourages us to put its teachings into action, in the form of service to our fellow human beings with love and respect. Because we must not only intellectually assimilate the teachings of the book, but also apply them in our daily lives.

</figure>

[**Anova (Jean Royer)**](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/03/Anova.pdf)

The book speaks at length about the age of light and life, in which a planet reaches a state that we could define as heaven on earth. But there is an interesting reference to a world, Anova, which the revelators tell us is the oldest inhabited world in the Satania system to which we belong. The author takes that reference and, from other statements in the book, deduces (according to his interpretation) that this world is in the seventh stage of light and life.

**JOURNALISTIC ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE AND TEACHINGS OF JESUS ACCORDING TO _THE URANTIA BOOK_**

We present to you the next installment of the chronicles of the life of Jesus, which on this occasion contains what the revelators tell us in paper 149 (The second preaching tour). Inside the PDF you will see a button from which you can access the text of the document from the Urantia Foundation website.

## Urantia Book Children's Guide: Jesus at Age 15

<figure id="Figure_6" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2023_10/Jesus-a-los-15-anos.jpg" alt="José y María encuentran a Jesús" width="250">
</figure>

We continue reviewing the secondary work _A Child's Guide to_ The Urantia Book, by Mary Livingston.

This is the next chapter, which is about Jesus at fifteen years old, and it begins like this:

«Mary had a baby girl whom they named Ruth. Jesus did everything he could to make his mother feel good. He really loved baby Ruth very much. He acted like a good father-brother to all the children.

»James was then 11 years old, Miriam 10, Joseph 8, Simon 7, Martha 6, Judah 4, Amos 2, and now the newborn arrived. It was necessary to care for and feed all these children.»

## Other books on spiritual growth

<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2023_10/Dinero-y-conciencia.jpg" alt="Dinero y conciencia" width="250">
</figure>

**Money and conscience: who does my money serve? (Joan Antoni Melé)**

How many times have we lamented that it is money that moves the world, that it is the origin of many wars and injustices? In this sense, precisely the fact that it is money that makes the world move can turn it into a powerful weapon precisely to improve society. This essay delves into this idea to show the importance of each individual in the functioning of the market and the power that they are capable of exercising in it. In the words of the author: “if we all change our way of thinking, being, acting and investing our money, the functioning and direction that the economic model takes will change... the power of the citizen does not reside so much in his vote as in the direction in which he directs his money, his way of consuming and investing his savings.”

**Transcendence, by Ernesto Veloso (“Light and Life” Space on Radio Urantia)**

In this installment of [**Radio Urantia's “Light and Life” space**](https://www.ivoox.com/podcast-luz-vida_sq_f11070301_1.html) the author begins by saying that transcending this world was always a great concern for him, even before learning the teachings of the book. According to the author, Jesus demonstrated the fallacy of death with his resurrection, but will we all survive? Nobody knows how far God's mercy can go, and it is clear that not all of us will survive. Furthermore, the fact that it is an experimental planet makes us walk blindly, but that does not justify us choosing to do evil. The author also reviews some of the existing theories on the subject of survival after earthly life, and relates the possibility of survival with free will, in light of the teachings of the book.

## Navigating through life: Dandelions

<figure id="Figure_9" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2023_10/dientes-de-leon-Navegando-por-la-vida.jpg" alt="Dientes de león-Navegando por la vida" width="350">
</figure>

A man who was very proud of the grass in his garden one day discovered that a large number of dandelions were growing in said grass. And although he tried by all means to get rid of them, he could not prevent them from becoming a real plague.

In the end he wrote to the Ministry of Agriculture, describing all the attempts he had made, and concluded the letter by asking: “What can I do?” Shortly afterwards the response arrived: “We suggest you learn to love them.”

I also had a lawn that I was very proud of, and I also suffered from a plague of “dandelions” that I tried to combat with all the means at my disposal. So learning to love them was not easy at all.

I began to speak to them every day in a cordial and friendly manner. But they only responded with their sullen silence. They were still smarting from the battle I had waged against them. They were probably suspicious of my motives.

But I didn't have to wait long for them to smile again and regain their peace. They even responded to what I said to them. Soon we were friends.

Of course my lawn was ruined, but how lovely my garden became!

Little by little he was going blind, even though he tried to prevent it by all means. And when the medicines no longer worked, he had to fight with all his emotions. I myself needed to muster up the courage to tell him: “I suggest you learn to love your blindness.”

It was a real struggle. At first he resisted making contact with her, resisted saying a single word to her. And when he finally managed to speak to his blindness, his words were angry and bitter. But he kept talking and, little by little, the words became words of resignation, tolerance and acceptance... until one day, to his surprise, they became words of sympathy... and love. The moment had come when he was able to put his arm around his blindness and say: “I love you.” And that day I saw him smile again. And what a sweet smile!

Naturally he had lost his sight forever. But how beautiful his face became! Much more beautiful than before blindness overtook him.

(Anthony de Mello)

## My favorite paragraph — José Manuel Díaz

<figure id="Figure_10" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2023_10/Amor-celestial-mi-parrafo-favorito.jpg" alt="Mi párrafo favorito - nov 2023" width="250">
</figure>

**The difficult legacy that the Master left us**

**An eye for an eye**, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a life... is the vengeful attitude of retaliation that society adopted in primitive times and that all tribes in the process of evolution followed (Cf <a id="a207_206"></a>[UB 70:10.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p10_9)). Much later, this recognition was put in writing and considered the law of Moses.

Jesus' response to this supposed law of Moses - which he totally disapproved of, since he rejected any concept of resentment or private revenge (Cf <a id="a209_148"></a>[UB 140:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_5)) - was: “Your rule is not to be measure for measure... You shall return good for evil” (<a id="a209_280"></a>[UB 140:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p6_9)). He dared to propose the novel idea of “doing something positive to save the evildoer instead of following the old principle of retaliation” (<a id="a209_467"></a>[UB 159:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p5_11)). “My disciples must not only stop doing evil, but learn to do good” (<a id="a209_583"></a>[UB 156:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p2_7)). Jesus abhorred both the idea of revenge and the idea of resignation to being a passive victim of injustice. So he boldly proposed this third way to the conflict.

## Urantian Questionnaire — Fernando Carazo

<figure id="Figure_11" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2023_10/Fernando-Carazo.jpg" alt="Fernando Carazo" width="250">
</figure>

I am Fernando Carazo, I live in Madrid. I have two professional profiles: initially as an operating systems analyst-programmer in technology companies and later I retrained, as I am also a clinical psychologist and opened my own practice. I am currently retired early and I dedicate myself to playing sports, studying Physics and _The Urantia Book_. I also take care of my mother who is very old and quite deteriorated. I am divorced and have two adult daughters who live and work abroad.

**1. How did you come across _The Urantia Book_ and why do you think you found it?**

I came across _The Urantia Book_ in 2000 but couldn't get past the Prologue. I wasn't used to continuing to read if I didn't understand the text, so I was stuck for quite a while. Later, in 2007, I decided that I had to continue, even though I didn't fully understand the concepts, and I finished reading it completely in 2009. Since then I have studied it in depth, on my own and as a member of study groups, especially in the Madrid group and the virtual ones.

I came across _The Urantia Book_ thanks to reading _The Lucifer Rebellion_ by J.J. Benítez. I have always been interested in reading books about mystery, philosophy, religion, science, etc. This book drove me crazy. I couldn't conceive how a fantasy book could describe what it called “the fifth revelation” as something invented and I decided to look for the source. Searching on the Internet I found many references to the fact that, in reality, both _The Lucifer Rebellion_ and the Trojan Horses saga were plagiarism of a book called _The Urantia Book_. That's where it all began.
