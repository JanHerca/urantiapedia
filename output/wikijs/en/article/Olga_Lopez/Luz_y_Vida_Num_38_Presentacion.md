## Editorial

Dear friends: for the first time since the magazine began its journey, we have missed a quarterly appointment. For reasons beyond our control, we have been delayed in the delivery of September, so that December has ended up on us. We apologize and hope to return to our usual rhythm of a quarterly issue.

For the rest, and with the summer holidays as a distant memory, we already face the end of the year with the same enthusiasm as always to offer quality articles to the readers of _The Urantia Book_. The first article, The Religion of One, is a reflection of an American reader looking for points of convergence with other religions so that readers can find a way to attract people of other faiths to the fifth epochal revelation.

This article is followed by another collaboration by our dear friend Jesús Rodríguez, who from Mexico makes us reflect by asking questions that every sincere reader of the revelation should ask themselves from time to time: do we really live the teachings? Is our life up to what a God-knowing human being should be?

Then we have two brief but no less intense contributions: a poem by Agustín Barajas about love, and the eternal dilemma of “God yes, God no” posed by L.Coll.

Finally, we have the regular sections of the magazine: a new installment of “Convergences and Divergences”, in which our friend Santi compares what science currently says about the appearance of matter and energy with what is stated in _El Urantia Book_. And finally, the “Urantia Questionnaire” answered on this occasion by Eduardo Altuzarra, treasurer of the association, and the highlights of the news produced in the Urantia community in this corner of the world.

Have a good read! We also take this opportunity to wish you a good start to the year.

See you next year!.

Olga Lopez.
