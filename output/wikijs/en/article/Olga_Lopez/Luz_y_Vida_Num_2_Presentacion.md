## Presentation

Dear friends: once the summer vacation period is over, here is the second issue of our newsletter. The first article deals with the integration of the teachings of the Book in personal experience. The articles that revolve around the “center of attention” are texts that “dialogue” with each other and highlight above all the role of a great “school” that the superuniverses and Havona have, a school that the Deities have designed to allow us to advance spiritually. And finally, I wanted to highlight the two articles on the 1999 Meeting in Dakar (Senegal), in which Moussa N'Diaye and his method of disseminating the teachings of the Book are discussed. This method seems especially interesting to us in order to put it into practice in our country.

As you have been able to observe, number two was released a few months ahead of schedule, since we considered that there was enough material to publish a bulletin on these dates. This seems very positive to me, as it is a sign of activity in the Urantia movement in Spain. Hopefully this activity will continue in the future! From the Association we fully trust that this is the case.

We hope you find these articles interesting, and we encourage you to participate with your opinions.

Fraternally
