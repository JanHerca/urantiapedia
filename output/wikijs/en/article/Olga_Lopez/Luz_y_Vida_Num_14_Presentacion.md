## Presentation

Dear friends: we continue in this number with the interesting conversations of the Internet study group. We begin with a reflection based on the affirmation that the universe is an effect, and we continue with the third and last installment (for now, since the topic has already given rise to a previous reflection, already published in this bulletin) on the subject of survival. We include Santiago Rodríguez's presentation on this subject as a separate article, with the comments of other study group participants as a closing. But the issue does not end here, as we have incorporated the contribution made by Ernesto Veloso from Cuba who, as a result of reading this very interesting debate, wrote a letter that we also share with all of you.

We also include in this issue a short but powerful prayer created by Jeanette Francis (resident of Miami, Florida, USA) for her young daughter. This reminds us (the UB takes care of saying it very clearly) that the sentence does not have to be a stereotyped formula; What's more, prayer is really effective when it arises spontaneously and sincerely from the one who recites it.

Finally, we include some latest news from the Urantia Association of Spain, so that you are informed of our projects.

Fraternally

Olga Lopez
President of the Urantia Association of Spain
