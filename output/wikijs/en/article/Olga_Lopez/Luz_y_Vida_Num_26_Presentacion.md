## Editorial

Dear friends: summer is about to end, and by the time you read these lines, many of you will have finished your vacations, but we are here, always ready to offer quality works and reflections about the wonderful teachings of _The Urantia Book_. This time, we're including another online study group discussion topic, this time focused on the age of the universe. We also take up the second and last part of the work of our Chilean friend Horacio Gamboa on personality, a complex subject for which all help is little.

In this issue, we inaugurate a fixed section in our magazine, entitled “Convergences and divergences”, in which Santi, the secretary of our association, will include an article related to scientific news or other news that are online (or not) with what is said in _The Urantia Book_. In this case, Santi considers exoplanets, planets that orbit around other stars.

And, finally, we include a glimpse of our experience in the Leadership Symposium organized by Urantia Association International, which took place at Techny Towers (near Chicago, USA) from July 13 to 17 of this year. I have no doubt that, in the Urantia movement, there will be a before and after this symposium. Hopefully we can transmit even a part of the experiences and sensations that we experience in those unforgettable days, in which (as is usual in readers' meetings) we live a foretaste of the fraternity that exists in the worlds of mansions and beyond. At the end, and as usual, we include a piece of news related to our association.

Enjoy reading!
