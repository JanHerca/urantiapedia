**Washing ourselves in silence**

A very overwhelmed young nun went to consult her spiritual director:

—Look, Father, I'm very worried. It's just that, when I feel better in the chapel is when I don't do anything, I don't think about anything; I just am.

The priest smiled.

—Don't worry, sister, you just discovered **silence**.

The nun did not leave very convinced. How could she achieve that inner peace without thinking, without reflecting, without reading something? And yet, simply being like that, she savored a stillness and a joy that she had never enjoyed until then.

## Presentations from the XIX Meeting of Readers of The Urantia Book in Spain

**The commitment to be a believer**

[**Meditation in the Urantian movement (Francisco J. Santos)**](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/LA-MEDITACION-EN-EL-MOVIMIENTO-URANTIANO-FCO.-JAVIER-SANTOS.pdf)

Paco begins by reviewing what _The Urantia Book_ says about meditation, and reaches some initial conclusions about it:
<br style="clear:both;"/>

- It is a tool to connect mind and spirit
- It must be a habit that favors religious growth
- It is a practice that the Master carried out regularly
- It is a perfect activity to do as a community.

However, the book does not explain to us how to meditate, but rather we must be the ones to find out how to do it. Starting from the definition of meditation, it then explains what its components are: relaxation, concentration and introspection. It is about emptying the mind and filling it with transcendental things (such as God, the Adjuster, etc.).

Within the PDF you will see a button from which you can access the text of the document from the Urantia Foundation website.

We continue reviewing the secondary work _A Child's Guide to_ The Urantia Book, by Mary Livingston.

This is the next chapter, which is about Jesus at fourteen years old, and it begins like this:

“During that summer Jesus went up to the top of the mountain many times. There, He would talk with God and worship Him. Slowly He remembered that He was a Paradise Son of God. Slowly He also remembered about God's plan for the children of Paradise.”

## XIX Readers' Meeting – Ciudad Real, 2023

**Date:** September 7-10, 2023
**Location:** Hotel Santa Cecilia, C/ Tinte nº 3, Ciudad Real
**Topic:** The commitment to be a believer. Life practices in light of _The Urantia Book_

The XIX Meeting of Spanish Readers began on Thursday, September 7 in the afternoon at the Hotel Santa Cecilia, located in the center of Ciudad Real. About 30 people attended from all corners of the country: Alicante, Almería, Ávila, Barcelona, Burgos, Cáceres, Madrid, Málaga, Murcia, Navarra, Seville, Tarragona and Valencia. We also had the presence of Antonio Schefer, from the Netherlands, president of the AUI Congress Committee, who honored us with his presence.

After eighteen national meetings of readers in Spain, the time has come to reflect and weigh what _The Urantia Book_ has contributed to our lives, after so many years of readings, debates, analysis and meetings. As readers of the book we face a great challenge: if society, or at least an important part of it, is lethargic, precarious, infantilized, polarized, what can we offer to wake it up and revitalize it? If we live in a “postmodern” society that denies and rejects everything that came before, that only pays attention to the present without thinking about the past, where the value of commitment and certainties is lost and characters as mediatic as they are mediocre and transitory are adored, the readers of _The Urantia Book_ can offer an anchor that stabilizes this life adrift that we observe. And that was precisely the topic that was discussed at this meeting.
