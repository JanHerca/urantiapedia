## Editorial

Dear friends: the year 2012, a year in which many people have paid attention for different reasons, is coming to an end, and we remain faithful to our quarterly appointment offering the last issue of the year. At this point in the year, it seems inevitable to take stock of what has been experienced in the last twelve months. For the Urantia Association of Spain, this year has been a year of changes: the board of directors was almost completely renewed, and the new members have given a great impetus to what is the main mission of the association: the dissemination of the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ and the service to Spanish readers. There is a new study group and more readers are being added to the existing groups. Spain is the European country where _The Urantia Book_ is sold the most, and this should give us pause. That means there are a lot of people out there looking for answers, and we must do what we can to reach them and make it easy for them to reach us.

Focusing on the articles of our magazine, this time the international presence is covered with two articles by Jesús Rodríguez and Horacio Gamboa, from Mexico and Chile respectively. Jesus, in his article on organic evolution, focuses his attention on the origins of the human species and its connection with the appearance on the scene of the helper spirits of the mind, especially the spirits of adoration and wisdom, who are the ones who They make the difference between animals and humans.

Next, we have a beautiful reflection by Horacio Gamboa on the will of the Father, on how it is manifested and how we should manifest it in our daily lives. Precisely to this, to our daily life, our next collaboration also alludes, “The little things in life”, in which our friend L. Coll emphasizes the importance of manifesting the fruits of the spirit in daily life. No need to perform heroic gestures; sometimes a kind word or a nice gesture can have important repercussions among our peers.

This brief article is followed by Santi's section “Convergences and divergences”. On this occasion, and after the commotion caused by the discovery of the Higgs boson (misnamed “God particle”), Santi explains the importance of this discovery for current science, and how it fits into what the UB says. with respect to the elementary particles of matter.

Here is a candid and powerful reflection from Jaime Marco, vice president of the association, regarding peace on Urantia and what it takes to achieve it. These reflections were sent to the association's mailing list and Facebook page, and had the virtue of creating an interesting flow of responses from readers. We hope that they provoke reflection in those who read their lines from this magazine.

It had been a while since we had published a poem in the magazine, and it was time to return to good customs. On this occasion, the poem is from a reader from the province of Barcelona, Agustín Barajas, who has very generously allowed us to publish this beautiful poetry about the spark that lives within us. And finally, you have two reviews about the UB presentations that took place this past fall in Valencia and L'Aldea (Tarragona). There are other presentations in the offing in different Spanish cities, so stay tuned!

From the Urantia Association of Spain, we wish you a good start to the year, and that 2013 be a year of spiritual growth for everyone.

Olga Lopez
