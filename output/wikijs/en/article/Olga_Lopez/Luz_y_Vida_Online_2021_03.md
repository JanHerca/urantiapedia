> _THE age of light and life is the final evolutionary attainment of a world of time and space. . . ._ (<a id="a56_104"></a>[UB 55:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p0_1))

We start the month of March 2021 with hope beating in our hearts and with the aim of contributing, modestly, to the unstoppable arrival of the wonderful age of LIGHT and LIFE on our planet.

Those of us who have read _The Urantia Book_ and delved into it know that our planet, Urantia, is different from the others in our system and even from Nebadon, our universe. But we also know from the book itself that we are not forgotten and left behind by the advice of the universe.

We are not alone. We are not abandoned and destined for final disaster.

## History and teachings – Chronicles of the life of Jesus

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2021_03/02.jpg" width="250">
</figure>

We present you the chronicle of the life of Jesus, which we will publish on the web as we progress in its preparation. The idea is that these chronicles contain the highlights of the life and teachings of Jesus and that they serve as an aid to the study of the fourth part of the book. Finally, when it is complete, it can be grouped into a whole by attaching all the PDF files.

Inside the PDF you will see a button from where you can access the text of the document from the Urantia Foundation website.

[Chronicles of the life of Jesus – document 120](http://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/Documento-120-1.pdf)

## Works – our recommendations of the month

**[Simplified Prologue (Bill Sadler)](/en/article/William_S_Sadler_Jr/A_Simplification_of_the_Foreword_to_The_Urantia_Book)**

The Prologue is always a part that overwhelms the reader, especially when facing it for the first time. In this transcript of a talk by Bill Sadler, son of Dr. William Sadler, he discusses the concepts that appear in the Foreword and explains them in a very conversational and accessible way. A highly recommended work for all those who wish to clarify the concepts that appear in the Prologue, and which are later key to understanding teachings in other parts of the book.

**[Is the Orvonton superuniverse the Milky Way? (Eduardo Altuzarra)](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/03/El-Superuniverso-de-Orvonton-%C2%BFEs-la-V%C3%ADa-L%C3%A1ctea.pdf)**

In this 11-page work, the author, Eduardo Altuzarra, a veteran reader of the book, explains his thesis that Orvonton is the Milky Way galaxy, based on quotes from the book, graphics and secondary works by other readers.

**[An approximation to the local universe of Nebadón (Santiago Rodríguez)](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/03/UnaAproximacionAlUniversoLocalV9.pdf)**

Santiago Rodríguez is a veteran reader and amateur astronomer. A few years ago he wrote this extensive but very interesting work on what the dimensions of Nebadon would be according to what is said in the book and based on current astronomical data and quotes. The reference quote is the one that alludes to Antares as the largest star in Nebadon, which gives rise to the author to establish what would be the approximate size and location of our universe.

**[A Day in the Life of a Mansion Worlds Student (Tom Maringer)](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/03/Un-d%C3%ADa-en-la-vida-de-un-estudiante-de-los-mundos-mansi%C3%B3n.pdf)**

Many works of fiction related to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ have been published in recent years, but this is an account that was written when there were still few secondary works in the form of fiction (1994) and that Carmelo Martínez translated into Spanish in 2011. As its title very well indicates, it is a story of someone who wakes up in the resurrection room of the first mansion world due to an accident. Once there, he experiences what _The Urantia Book_ explains as morontia life in its entirety.

## Books – our recommendations of the month

**The three visits (Olga López)**

In this novel, the author reviews the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ according to a fundamental triad to understand any subject in the universe: origin, history and destiny. To do this, he exposes the protagonist of the story (David, a middle-aged man who claims not to believe in God) to a supernatural experience where he is shown the teachings according to these three main lines.

As with all of the author's novels, it can be downloaded for free in PDF format. In [this link](https://aue.urantia-association.org/inspirado-en-el-lu-las-tres-visitas/) you have the information to obtain it.

**Introduction to _The Urantia Book_ (Marcelino Ramírez)**

Marcelino Ramírez is a veteran reader from Venezuela who has spent the last few years disseminating the book's teachings by organizing study groups and conferences in his country, often against all odds. Little by little he was preparing a kind of summary of the most important teachings of _The Urantia Book_, which finally took the form of a book. This introduction can be especially useful for first-time readers who want an overview of the teachings, expressed in a very simple but rigorous way and supported by quotations from the book.

In [this link](https://aue.urantia-association.org/inspirado-en-el-lu-introduccion-a-el-libro-de-urantia/) you have more information about the book and how to get it.

This very interesting [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU_S1xr00nw) of the channel [Urantia Writings Studies](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7jKlrYCBGq0CiLTGDq-0KQ) brings new discoveries that support what is said in _The Urantia Book_ about the location of Dalamatia, the seat of government of the Planetary Prince that is currently under the waters of the Persian Gulf.

## My favorite book – a blog to publicize The Urantia Book

<figure id="Figure_10" class="image urantiapedia">

</figure>

Luis Coll, a reader for many years, has created a blog whose intention is, in his own words, «to share comments and opinions on different topics of daily life, such as: nature, spirituality, books, comments of the day, as well like photos and comments of the place where I live”.

This is the address of his blog:

## Urantiapedia, a Wikipedia of The Urantia Book

I am pleased to inform you that the website [https://urantiapedia.site](https://urantiapedia.site/) is finally accessible to the public, and I encourage you to visit it.

This project came to me as an idea a year ago and it is, of course, a long way from being finished. But it does contain a good handful of content, enough to show what is intended with it and attract the attention of more contributors.

The goal that I set for myself at the beginning was to create a website that would allow us to study _The Urantia Book_ in a much more coordinated way, where references to other books, to the sources of _The Urantia Book_, to other general content, would be all linked together and it will not be necessary to go to a multitude of websites or books to have everything at hand.

## Extraordinary Assembly of February 16, 2021

Last Tuesday, February 16, an assembly of members was held in the Zoom room of the Urantia Association of Spain, on the occasion of the change in the composition of the association's board of directors.

In said assembly the appointment of Eduardo Altuzarra (Miranda de Ebro, Burgos) as vice president was agreed. It was also agreed that the position left vacant on the advisory council would be filled by Santiago Rodríguez (Reus, Tarragona), who was secretary of the association from 2004 to 2012.

Congratulations to both of you, and our best wishes for you to serve the Urantia Revelation in our country in the best possible way!

## Friday Urantia Talks

<figure id="Figure_13" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2021_03/13.jpg" width="200">
</figure>

The Association has decided to organize some Urantia talks so that all who wish can join and discuss the topics that interest them. The idea is that the moderators propose a starting topic, which can then be followed by others at the proposal of the attendees.

At the moment these talks will be biweekly (every other Friday) and their purpose is to maintain contact between readers in the absence of face-to-face events, as well as to share the teachings in an atmosphere of fraternity and camaraderie.

Meetings will be held in the [Association Zoom room](https://zoom.us/j/362798144).

The first two meetings will be on Friday, March 5 and 19 at 7:00 p.m. (Spanish peninsular time). We wait for you!
