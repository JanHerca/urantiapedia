## Editorial

Dear friends: once we are here, faithful to our appointment, to deliver what is the last number of the year of this bulletin. Once again, we incorporate a very interesting conversation from the study group on the Internet, which takes as its starting point the publication of Stephen Hawking's latest book, in which he rules out the existence of God, to reflect on the current relationship between science and religion. and it is compared with what _The Urantia Book_ affirms about it.

Also once again we reserve a small place for poetry and for inspiring artistic expression, with a poem/prayer by our friend José Antonio, and a composition made by L. Coll.

The following article is part of a chapter of the novel “Dialogues with Sofía”. Surely when you read this excerpt you will know what (rather, who) our dear Sofia refers to with “the god who learns.”

And finally, we offer you a brief chronicle of our experience at the EcoAltea fair, - which was held at the beginning of October in the beautiful Alicante town of Altea.

I take advantage of this space to wish you a good start to the year, and that you spend the Christmas holidays in peace and harmony with your loved ones. We will see you in a next issue of “Light and Life” next year, although the Urantia Association of Spain continues to be at your disposal every day of the year for whatever you need.
