## Presentation

Dear friends, here is the first issue of our “Light and Life” newsletter. In this newsletter we want to publish, on the one hand, original works in Spanish related to the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ and, on the other, news related to the Book in Spain.

In principle, we want this newsletter to be published every six months, although we leave open the possibility of increasing its frequency so that it is quarterly or even bimonthly. This will depend on the response we get from readers.

This first issue will be devoted entirely to the debates held during the V Meeting of Readers, which was held from April 29 to May 2, 2005 in the Madrid town of San Lorenzo de El Escorial. We hope you find it interesting, and from here we encourage you to send us any work, opinion, comment, etc. for the following numbers. Without the collaboration of the readers, this bulletin would not make sense.

Fraternally
