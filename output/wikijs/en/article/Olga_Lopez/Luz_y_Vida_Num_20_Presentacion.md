## Presentation

Dear friends: in this issue it seems that it is necessary to look back and take stock, since our (and your) “Light and Life” has completed 20 issues. We have been faithful to each of the quarterly appointments for five years, and that is something we can be proud of. Although, in my opinion, the best of all is not so much our continuity as having been able to publish high-quality readers' work. On many occasions we have had material for two and three consecutive issues, and whenever there has been some concern about what was going to be published in the next issue, someone would appear sending us their work. We hope this does not change and that we can continue to share readers' work for a long time.

But not only the content is important, but also the form. It is time to start considering a change in the design, to give our magazine a more professional touch. In this, as in the articles, we appreciate all the suggestions and help you can give us.

In the final part of the magazine you can see news related to the activities of our association. On this occasion we give the information about our next Meeting (the ninth), which will consist of a seminar on the “cultivation of universal intelligence”, which will be given by Sheila Keene-Lund (United States). We hope that there will be many of you who want to join us. in this new meeting of Spanish readers.

I hope you enjoy reading.

Fraternally
