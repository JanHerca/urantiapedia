## 1. Introduction

As readers committed to the book's teachings, we want a guide that will help us educate children in the teachings of the fifth revelation. Unfortunately, children don't come with an instruction manual, so we have to make do as best we can when we bring a new life into the world.

Although there are no specific documents on this topic, the book contains many pearls of wisdom here and there that can serve and inspire us. Here are some examples:

> ***When children have their ideals, do not dislodge them; let them grow.*** _And while you are learning to think as men, you should also be learning to pray as children._ [UB 48:6.32](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p6_32) bold added

> ***Give every developing child a chance to grow his own religious experience;*** _do not force a ready-made adult experience upon him. Remember, year-by-year progress through an established educational regime does not necessarily mean intellectual progress, much less spiritual growth. Enlargement of vocabulary does not signify development of character..._ [UB 100:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p1_3) bold added

> ***Children are permanently impressed only by the loyalties of their adult associates; precept or even example is not lastingly influential.*** _Loyal persons are growing persons, and growth is an impressive and inspiring reality. Live loyally today—grow—and tomorrow will attend to itself. The quickest way for a tadpole to become a frog is to live loyally each moment as a tadpole._ [UB 100:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p1_4) bold added

On this occasion, however, I want to focus on the example Jesus gave us as a father and brother to his earthly family, and also on the teachings he offered regarding the education of children and how he viewed them.

## 2. Jesus as a son

Already at age 11, Jesus was forced to assume the responsibilities of the firstborn son, one or two years earlier than was normal in Jewish culture at that time, following the birth of his brother Judah.

> _Never again did this youth find it possible to return to the childlike attitude of his earlier years. From the time of his mother’s illness—just before he was eleven years old—he was compelled to assume the responsibilities of the first-born son and to do all this one or two full years before these burdens should normally have fallen on his shoulders._ [UB 124:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p3_4)

The relationship he had with his brothers is very well expressed in this paragraph, which refers to when Jesus was 12 years old: he got along well or very well with everyone, with the exceptions of Joseph and especially Judah:

> _From this time on he became more successful in getting along with his brothers and sisters. He was increasingly tactful, always compassionate and considerate of their welfare and happiness, and enjoyed good relations with them up to the beginning of his public ministry. To be more explicit: He got along with James, Miriam, and the two younger (as yet unborn) children, Amos and Ruth, most excellently. He always got along with Martha fairly well. What trouble he had at home largely arose out of friction with Joseph and Jude, particularly the latter._ [UB 124:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p4_3)

As the firstborn son, Jesus made adjustments in his family, always with respect and with the intention of improving family life:

> _As time passed, Jesus did much to modify their practice of religious forms, such as the family prayers and other customs._ [UB 124:4.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p4_8)

> _As time passed, Jesus did much to liberalize and modify the family teachings and practices related to Sabbath observance and many other phases of religion._ [UB 127:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p4_9)

Although he did not always agree with his parents and the customs of the time, Jesus always maintained an attitude of respect and obedience toward his parents.

> [Jesus] _never shirked the responsibility of making the necessary daily adjustments between these realms of loyalty to one’s personal convictions and duty toward one’s family, and he achieved the satisfaction of effecting an increasingly harmonious blending of personal convictions and family obligations into a masterful concept of group solidarity based upon loyalty, fairness, tolerance, and love._ [UB 124:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p4_9)

## 3. Jesus as father-brother

There was a decisive event in Jesus' transformation from firstborn son to head of the family: the death in an accident of his earthly father, Joseph:

> _... were permitted those occurrences of the natural order of events on Urantia which would force this young man of destiny so early to assume these heavy but highly educational and disciplinary responsibilities attendant upon becoming the head of a human family, of becoming father to his own brothers and sisters, of supporting and protecting his mother, of functioning as guardian of his father’s home, the only home he was to know while on this world._ [UB 126:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p2_2) bold added

> _Jesus had a larger and longer experience rearing this family than was accorded to Joseph, his father; and he did measure up to the standard which he subsequently set for himself: ***to become a wise, patient, understanding, and effective teacher and eldest brother to this family***—his family—so suddenly sorrow-stricken and so unexpectedly bereaved._ [UB 124:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p5_6) bold added

As the Creator Son, Jesus was forbidden to have children of his own upon his mortal bestowal, so having to take care of his earthly family was the perfect circumstance to experience fatherhood.

Despite the importance of his bestowal mission, the welfare of his family always came first. He did not begin his public life until his brother James became the head of the family and his older siblings began to marry. He even took his brothers to Jerusalem for the Passover, even though economic conditions were poor. _Jesus never showed any favoritism in his dealings with his family._ [UB 128:1.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p1_15)

> He was a real though youthful father to the family; he spent every possible hour with the youngsters, and they truly loved him. [UB 127:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p1_8) bold added

Regarding the dynamics and functioning of Jesus' family, I would like to highlight these aspects:

- <ins>Jesus' educational method: positive teaching</ins>. In a society where there were hundreds of prohibitions, it's striking by contrast that Jesus focused not on what couldn't be done, but on what could be done:

> _By the beginning of this year [12 AD] Jesus had fully won his mother to the acceptance of his methods of child training_—***the positive injunction to do good in the place of the older Jewish method of forbidding to do evil***. _In his home and throughout his public-teaching career Jesus invariably employed the positive form of exhortation. Always and everywhere did he say, “You shall do this—you ought to do that.” Never did he employ the negative mode of teaching derived from the ancient taboos. He refrained from placing emphasis on evil by forbidding it, while he exalted the good by commanding its performance. Prayer time in this household was the occasion for discussing anything and everything relating to the welfare of the family._ [UB 127:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p4_2) bold added

> ***Jesus began wise discipline upon his brothers and sisters at such an early age that little or no punishment was ever required to secure their prompt and wholehearted obedience.*** _The only exception was Jude, upon whom on sundry occasions Jesus found it necessary to impose penalties for his infractions of the rules of the home. On three occasions when it was deemed wise to punish Jude for self-confessed and deliberate violations of the family rules of conduct, his punishment was fixed by the unanimous decree of the older children and was assented to by Jude himself before it was inflicted._ [UB 127:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p4_3) (1401.3) bold added

> _While Jesus was most methodical and systematic in everything he did, ***there was also in all his administrative rulings a refreshing elasticity of interpretation*** and an individuality of adaptation that greatly impressed all the children with the spirit of justice which actuated their father-brother. He never arbitrarily disciplined his brothers and sisters, and such uniform fairness and personal consideration greatly endeared Jesus to all his family._ [UB 127:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p4_4) bold added

> ***James and Simon grew up trying to follow Jesus’ plan of placating their bellicose and sometimes irate playmates by persuasion and nonresistance, and they were fairly successful***; _but Joseph and Jude, while assenting to such teachings at home, made haste to defend themselves when assailed by their comrades; in particular was Jude guilty of violating the spirit of these teachings. But nonresistance was not a rule of the family. No penalty was attached to the violation of personal teachings._ [UB 127:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p4_5)

> _In general, all of the children, particularly the girls, would consult Jesus about their childhood troubles and confide in him just_ ***as they would have in an affectionate father.*** [UB 127:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p4_6)

- <ins>The teaching of his sisters</ins>: In contemporary Jewish society, women lacked the same opportunities and rights as men, and a clear example is that they didn't go to school, unlike boys. Here, too, Jesus made a difference in his family:

> Ordinarily the girls of Jewish families received little education, but Jesus maintained (and his mother agreed) that girls should go to school the same as boys, and since the synagogue school would not receive them, there was nothing to do but conduct a home school especially for them. [UB 127:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p1_5) bold added

- Involvement of the entire family in important matters: for example, the decision to diversify the jobs of their siblings.

> _... This decision_ [that his brother Simon should work as a bricklayer, not a carpenter] _was the result of several family meetings at which it was concluded that all the boys should not dedicate themselves to carpentry but rather diversify their trades in order to be able to aspire to contracts for the construction of entire buildings._ [UB 128:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p2_2)

- <ins>Regular Family Meetings</ins>: At one such meeting, Jesus officially appointed his brother James (then 18 years old) as the new head of the family ([UB 128:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p2_4)). At this time, he began to prepare his older brothers to take over the responsibilities of the household, a slow but steady transition to provide for his family. As his brothers and sisters married and established their own homes, he always saw to it that other brothers would care for the household in Nazareth. [UB 128:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p5_8)

All of us parents know how difficult our children's adolescence can be, both for them and for us. Jesus was no stranger to this problem:

> _This was one of several years during which Jesus’ brothers and sisters were facing the trials and tribulations peculiar to the problems and readjustments of adolescence. Jesus now had brothers and sisters ranging in ages from seven to eighteen_, ***and he was kept busy helping them to adjust themselves to the new awakenings of their intellectual and emotional lives***. _He had thus to grapple with the problems of adolescence as they became manifest in the lives of his younger brothers and sisters._ [UB 128:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p2_1) bold added

In addition to the circumstances that every family must face, Jesus' family had to face truly difficult and painful situations:

- The financial difficulties resulting from Joseph's death, which increased after the death of his brother Amos ([UB 127:3.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p3_14)). Jesus proved to be a wise and effective administrator of the family estate.
- The Death of Amos [UB 127:3.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p3_13) (1400.5). In every family, the death of a child is one of the hardest blows that can occur. Jesus and his family had to face the pain of losing a very young member.

> _On Saturday afternoon, December 3, of this year, death for the second time struck at this Nazareth family. Little Amos, their baby brother, died after a week’s illness with a high fever._ ***After passing through this time of sorrow with her first-born son as her only support, Mary at last and in the fullest sense recognized Jesus as the real head of the family***; _and he was truly a worthy head._ [UB 127:3.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p3_13) (1400.5), bold added

> [Jesus’ words to his mother:] “_Mother-Mary,_ ***sorrow will not help us; we are all doing our best, and mother’s smile, perchance, might even inspire us to do better. Day by day we are strengthened for these tasks by our hope of better days ahead.***” _His sturdy and practical optimism was truly contagious; all the children lived in an atmosphere of anticipation of better times and better things. And this hopeful courage contributed mightily to the development of strong and noble characters, in spite of the depressiveness of their poverty._ [UB 127:3.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p3_14) bold added

- Judah as a problematic brother and the positive influence Jesus had on him. It's truly inspiring to see how Jesus, with his firm but loving approach, transformed Judah from an impulsive and rebellious young man into the best version of himself. Here's a look back at the highlights of Judah's life, the youngest of the living brothers in Jesus' family:
  - _Jude was a firebrand. He had the highest of ideals, but he was unstable in temperament. He had all and more of his mother’s determination and aggressiveness, but he lacked much of her sense of proportion and discretion._ [UB 127:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p4_7)
  - Judah’s Arrest, When Jesus Brought Him Up to Jerusalem for the Passover ([UB 128:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p6_4)-8): _Jesus did not tell the family about his young brother’s arrest at Jerusalem, but he had a long talk with Jude about this episode some three weeks after their return. After this talk with Jesus Jude himself told the family. He never forgot the patience and forbearance his brother-father manifested throughout the whole of this trying experience._ [UB 128:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p6_8) (1416.1)
  - _Jesus was a man of peace, and ever and anon was he embarrassed by Jude’s belligerent exploits and numerous patriotic outbursts. James and Joseph were in favor of casting him out, but Jesus would not consent. When their patience would be severely tried, Jesus would only counsel:_ “***Be patient. Be wise in your counsel and eloquent in your lives, that your young brother may first know the better way and then be constrained to follow you in it.***” _The wise and loving counsel of Jesus prevented a break in the family; they remained together. But Jude never was brought to his sober senses until after his marriage._ [UB 128:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p7_4) bold added
  - [By the time James married and his brother Joseph became the head of the household] _Jude was now very faithfully sending his share of funds home each month. The weddings of James and Miriam had a very beneficial influence on Jude, and when he left for the fishing grounds, the day after the double wedding, he assured Joseph that he could depend on him “to do my full duty, and more if it is needed.” And he kept his promise._ [UB 128:7.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p7_11)
  - Despite the rift that was created between Jesus and his family during his years of preaching, Judah was present at the crucifixion with his mother until Jesus' last breath ([UB 187:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p5_4)).


## 4. Jesus' teachings on the education of children

Jesus also referred to the education of children during his public ministry, and he always had a loving attitude toward them that inspires us to approach them with an appreciation for the value of the early stages of a human being's development:

- “He was always ready to learn even from the humblest child” [UB 126:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p2_3). If a Creator Son can learn from the humblest child, can we not also?
- “Uncle Joshua” ([UB 128:6.10-11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p6_10)). The children loved Jesus because he listened to them and was happy to spend as much time with them as necessary:
  - “He who harms these little ones had better throw a stone around his neck and throw himself into the sea” ([UB 158:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/158#p8_1))
  - He would pause in the middle of a discourse to attend to a child's request. _He would interrupt an important conversation with his apostles to confer with an importunate child._ [UB 138:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p8_9)
- The Conversation with John Mark ([UB 177:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/177#p2_1)-7): On the Wednesday of Jesus' last Passover, John Mark insisted on accompanying him on his day of rest, and he had memorable conversations with him precisely regarding the importance of having parents who foster the personal development of their children:

> _Jesus said many things that helped John_ [Mark] _to better understand his parents and other members of his family._ [UB 177:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/177#p2_1) (1921.5)

> ***You are the product of a home where the parents bear each other a sincere affection, and therefore you have not been overloved so as injuriously to exalt your concept of self-importance.*** _Neither has your personality suffered distortion in consequence of your parents’ loveless maneuvering for your confidence and loyalty, the one against the other._ ***You have enjoyed that parental love which insures laudable self-confidence and which fosters normal feelings of security***. _But you have also been fortunate in that your parents possessed wisdom as well as love; and it was wisdom which led them to withhold most forms of indulgence and many luxuries which wealth can buy while they sent you to the synagogue school along with your neighborhood playfellows, and they also encouraged you to learn how to live in this world by permitting you to have original experience..._ ***Intelligent parents like yours see that their children do not have to hurt love or break loyalty in order to develop independence and enjoy exciting freedom when they reach your age.*** [UB 177:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/177#p2_2) bold added

> _“Love, John, is the supreme reality of the universe when bestowed by all-wise beings, but_ ***it is a dangerous and oftentimes semiselfish trait as it is manifested in the experience of mortal parents***. _When you get married and have children of your own to rear, make sure that your love is admonished by wisdom and guided by intelligence._ [UB 177:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/177#p2_3) bold added

> _You possess a strong and well-knit character_ ***because you grew up in a home where love prevailed and wisdom reigned.*** _Such a childhood training produces a type of loyalty which assures me that you will go through with the course you have begun._ [UB 177:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/177#p2_4) bold added

> _The Master went on to explain to John how a child is wholly dependent on his parents and the associated home life for all his early concepts of everything intellectual, social, moral, and even spiritual since the family represents to the young child all that he can first know of either human or divine relationships. The child must derive his first impressions of the universe from the mother’s care; he is wholly dependent on the earthly father for his first ideas of the heavenly Father. The child’s subsequent life is made happy or unhappy, easy or difficult, in accordance with his early mental and emotional life, conditioned by these social and spiritual relationships of the home._ ***A human being’s entire afterlife is enormously influenced by what happens during the first few years of existence.*** [UB 177:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/177#p2_5) bold added

## 5. Final reflections

After everything reviewed above, these quotes illustrate very well what the final conclusions could be about how to educate children in the family, in accordance with the religion of Jesus and the example he gave with his earthly family:

> _It is our sincere belief that the gospel of Jesus’ teaching, founded as it is on the father-child relationship, can hardly enjoy a world-wide acceptance until such a time as the home life of the modern civilized peoples embraces more of love and more of wisdom. Notwithstanding that parents of the twentieth century possess great knowledge and increased truth for improving the home and ennobling the home life, it remains a fact that very few modern homes are such good places in which to nurture boys and girls as Jesus’ home in Galilee and John Mark’s home in Judea_, ***albeit the acceptance of Jesus’ gospel will result in the immediate improvement of home life. The love life of a wise home and the loyal devotion of true religion exert a profound reciprocal influence upon each other. Such a home life enhances religion, and genuine religion always glorifies the home.*** [UB 177:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/177#p2_6) bold added

> _It is true that many of the objectionable stunting influences and other cramping features of these olden Jewish homes have been virtually eliminated from many of the better-regulated modern homes. There is, indeed, more spontaneous freedom and far more personal liberty, but this liberty is not restrained by love, motivated by loyalty, nor directed by the intelligent discipline of wisdom._ ***As long as we teach the child to pray, “Our Father who is in heaven,” a tremendous responsibility rests upon all earthly fathers so to live and order their homes that the word father becomes worthily enshrined in the minds and hearts of all growing children.*** [UB 177:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/177#p2_7) bold added

All of this should lead us to ask ourselves these questions, which I'm sure many of you have already asked yourselves:

- What can we learn from Jesus' experiences as head of the household in Nazareth?
- What is our experience as parents?
- What is the best way to instill values in our children?
- How can we pass on the teachings of the fifth revelation to our children so that they have strong and balanced characters?

As a chain of values, the family is a fundamental institution in society. Let's take care of it!
