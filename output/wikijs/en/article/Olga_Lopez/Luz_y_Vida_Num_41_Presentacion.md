## Editorial

Dear friends, we hope that the summer holidays have returned you to your daily routine with more energy to face the next twelve months. In this September issue, we bring you some articles that we hope will help guide the course of your lives. The materialistic inertia of life often leads us to deviate slightly from the path we have set for ourselves. Therefore, it is healthy to reflect on our spiritual growth and guide our course from time to time.

Here you have an extensive article that collects the virtual conference that Olga López gave in the chat room of the Urantia Association of Brazil. Starting in July 2015, the Conference Committee of Urantia Association International will sponsor these types of talks to encourage contact and exchange between readers who speak the same language. These conferences will be announced in different social media (forums, mailing lists, Facebook, etc.), so we recommend that you stay tuned. In principle, it is planned to give two of these talks each month.

Next, we have a reflection by L. Coll regarding the everlasting struggle between science and religion, Santi's usual collaboration with his “Convergences and divergences”, in this case on the beginning of agriculture, and another of the usual sections of these latest issues: the Urantia Questionnaire. In the first installments, the current members of the association's board have appeared. From now on, we will give a voice to other readers who have been committed to the dissemination and study of the fifth revelation for many years. On this occasion, we bring you the responses of María José Sánchez Santamaría, host of the Malaga study group and who has maintained her commitment to spreading the teachings of the fifth revelation since the late 1990s.

I hope you enjoy reading!

Olga Lopez
