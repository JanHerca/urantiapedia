## Presentation

Dear friends: now that the international conference is over and we have good memories of the days lived, we want to share with all of you what have been the best moments of this conference, as well as part of the process that has led us to organize an event like this. It is very difficult to convey everything that was experienced in those days, but we will try to give you an idea of what happened in those April days when the attention of the Urantia movement was fixed on a tourist town in southern Spain called Benalmádena Costa.

From here I want to thank everyone who has contributed to the success of this conference. There are no small contributions; all are valuable as there are many details to take into account and all of them contribute to the smooth flow of conference activities and preparations. This conference has been a team effort and precisely that has made us learn a lot from this experience.

I hope you enjoy reading.

Fraternally

Olga Lopez
