## Presentation

Dear friends: we are still here with two collaborators from the last issue. In this bulletin we offer the second part of the very interesting work of Horacio Gamboa, who from Chile sends us his reflections regarding the mind, always keeping in mind the affirmations that _The Urantia Book_ makes in this regard. We also include another article by Ernesto Veloso, our Cuban friend, with his comments about spiritual progress and the great expectations that open up before us just by wanting to survive physical death.

In order not to break the custom, we present here another dialogue of the Internet study group, related to that divine “alchemy” that is implicit in the different transformations of energy, force and matter. And, finally, the one that since the last issues is a fixed section in our newsletter, with the most outstanding news related to the activities of our association.

I hope you enjoy reading.

Fraternally

Olga Lopez
