## Editorial

The year 2015 has already come a long way, and we are here once again to share with you some very interesting articles. First of all we offer you the presentation that Doris Calmel, a reader from Geneva (Switzerland), gave at the last conference of European readers held in Berlin in August last year. Doris establishes some very interesting parallels between her practice of psychoanalysis as a therapist and the concept of personality survival as it appears in the book, which have led her to very specific conclusions regarding the arrival of personality in the human being.

Below, we offer a brief reflection by L. Coll on the immensity of the universe, of which we are often unaware. If the solar system already seems enormously large to us, it is in comparison a tiny grain of sand on the enormous beach that is the universe. That undoubtedly leads us to feel humble and aware of our smallness. But it is also true that (in the words of the revelators) we are governed as if we were the only inhabited world in the universe. That is how efficient the heavenly government is!

The following article is a tribute to David Zebedeo written by our friend Horacio Gamboa (Chile). David Zebedee, brother of the apostles John and James Zebedee, is one of the unsung heroes of the gospels, a key figure in the events surrounding the public life of Jesus of Nazareth. Curiously, he was one of the few who really believed that Jesus would rise again on the third day, unlike others closer to the Master. David Zebedee is a figure that should inspire us in many ways: in his unwavering confidence, in his leadership skills and in his great speed of reaction.

As usual, we offer a new installment of the “Convergences and Divergences” section, where our friend Santi offers another comparison between current knowledge and that which appears as revealed in _The Urantia Book_. In this case, Santi addresses the so-called “anthropic principle” and makes some wonderful reflections on the error of refusing to admit that there is a purpose in the creation that we know, similar in its implications to the error of admitting that not everything is the work of God in the universe.

Finally, you will also be able to read the Urantia Questionnaire by Mariano Pérez, coordinator of the study groups in Spain, who shares with us how he got to the book and what changes have taken place in his worldview since then. The magazine closes with the announcement of the XIV Meeting of readers of _The Urantia Book_ in Spain, which will be held on this occasion in the southeast of the peninsula, in the ancient city of Cartagena, from April 30 to May 3. Don't miss out on this great opportunity to meet other kindred spirits!

What do you enjoy reading?

Olga Lopez.
