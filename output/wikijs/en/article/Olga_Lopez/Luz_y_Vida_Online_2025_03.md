First of all: thank you for being here, for taking a few minutes.

In these times of hyperstimulation, screens, instant messaging (with the expectation of an instant response), videos about healthy cookies and kittens... pausing for a moment to read these lines is almost an act of rebellion. So, let's go for the cause!

I'm asking for a minute. Close your eyes and breathe deeply. Just one minute of your day to dedicate fully to yourself and your breathing. Nothing more. Set a timer, if you like.

Imagine a path beneath your feet, the sound of your footsteps, the spring sun on your face, the sensation of fresh air, a clear mind...

Imagine the feeling of deep connection with a group of friendly Urantia Book readers, the nonjudgmental listening, the laughter in the background, the knowing glances, the first-day nerves, the eagerness to learn, the pleasure of hearing other ideas...

## Works – Our Recommendations of the Month

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">

[**Matter and Energy: Physics and The Urantia Book (Carmelo Martínez)**](/en/article/Carmelo_Martinez/La_materia_y_la_energia_La_fisica_y_LU) (also on the [association website](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/03/La-materia-y-la-energ%C3%ADa.-La-f%C3%ADsica-y-El-libro-de-Urantia.pdf))

In this extensive work, Carmelo Martínez (a graduate of this world since 2020) discusses material reality in the light of The Urantia Book, but without losing sight of the discoveries and theories of science. To do so, he briefly reviews the history of physics, reaching particle physics, and concludes with his personal vision of ultimatons (not yet discovered by science), morontia matter, and spiritual matter, based on the book's teachings.

[See the supporting PowerPoint presentation here](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/05/La-materia-y-la-energ%C3%ADa.-La-f%C3%ADsica-y-El-libro-de-Urantia-presentaci%C3%B3n.pdf)

How many times have we thought about convincing others of the existence of God? In this brief but insightful reflection, the author begins with the gift of free will to human beings and our status as children of God through faith, leading to the conclusion that God's existence cannot be objectively demonstrated.

In this work, which was presented at one of the National Meetings of the Urantia Association of Spain, Demetrio (also a graduate of this world) reviews the part of Jesus' life detailed in The Urantia Book but not included in the Gospels: the journey through the Roman Empire that Jesus made with Gonod and Ganid, a wealthy businessman from India and his teenage son. This is a period in Jesus' life that deserves in-depth study, as it was much more than a prelude to the Master's public life.

In this work (which is the basic text for a presentation given in a virtual room), the author analyzes the current situation of our planet and the obstacles facing humanity, and then goes through the planetary stages that all humanity goes through according to _The Urantia Book_ until reaching light and life.

We continue reviewing the secondary work _A Child's Guide to The Urantia Book_ by Mary Livingston. This is the next chapter, which describes the family events that occurred before Jesus left their home in Nazareth, and which begins:

James and Joseph were carpenters. Simon was a stonecutter. Judah was a fisherman. All of Jesus' brothers had chosen a job. There were two weddings in the family; James married Esther and Miriam married Jacob at the same time. It was a joyful time.

**Inner Voice: A Guide to Finding the Spiritual Path (Eileen Caddy)**

Like a perpetual diary, this work offers us 365 pieces or testimonies of guidance received by Eileen Caddy in her meditations. They are thought-provoking teachings that bring joy, inspiration, and peace to our lives.

"Helping a soul on the spiritual path isn't doing the work for them, but rather teaching them to find their own guidance. This is achieved through silence, through daily mental and physical stillness, which allows the wisdom within each human being to reveal itself. Only by opening the doors to our inner selves can we know our own INNER VOICE."

**Jesus and the Samaritan Woman (Radio Urantia's “Luz y Vida” program)**

In this podcast, author Ernesto Veloso, a Cuban reader, reflects on this inspiring episode from the life of Jesus. The Gospel of Jesus, not limited to a specific era, country, or race, has a cosmic and universalist value that transcends the boundaries of narrow theological dogmas—dogmas that limit not only the development of society but also the evolution of the mind and of religion itself. Jesus' conversation with the Samaritan woman, recounted in the Gospel of John, is a clear example of the universality of his teachings.

This story is more than just a conversation between an ordinary man and woman. It is also a multifaceted symbol of various facets and aptitudes, a reflection of society throughout the ages, pettiness that prevents us from objectively assessing our neighbors, to the point of considering them unworthy of our consideration, much less of receiving the message of salvation.

## Ideas taken from the Circle of Trust group: kindness

<figure id="Figure_11" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">

</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

[Fourth installment of the ideas that emerged from the Circle of Trust conversations supported by the Urantia Association of Spain. We believe these reflections can be useful to others and spark new thinking, while respecting the privacy and anonymity of the circle members.]

**16th Meeting of the Circle of Trust, November 15, 2024**

At this meeting, the topic of kindness was introduced by reading an excerpt from _The Urantia Book_ that defines kindness as a divine quality and an active force manifested through selfless service.

Participants explored the concept of kindness from diverse perspectives and discussed its nature, its manifestations, and its relationship to other values ​​such as responsibility and love. They shared personal experiences and reflections on how to practice kindness in different contexts, especially in family relationships, and discussed the challenges and benefits of being kind.

The discussion also addressed topics such as assertiveness, silence, and self-reflection associated with kindness.

- A personal experience with kindness is shared, explaining how she invokes “universal kindness” in difficult situations and receives immediate responses. She emphasizes that kindness is a gift present in each individual's personality and can be activated through concentration and sending positive thoughts. She emphasizes how she invokes kindness in difficult situations and in strangers.
- A vision of kindness is expressed as a personal action toward others, acknowledging the difficulties in being kind to people one knows, partly due to prejudice, which is often a major obstacle to developing kindness. Kindness is a fruit of the spirit; it is sharing and generosity. Being good is not the same as being foolish.
- Kindness is love in action. It expresses surprise at the love shared by the Crystal generation (adolescents) in the recent DANA disaster in Valencia. Kindness is selfless and altruistic; it means wishing well to both acquaintances and strangers. From personal experience, it expresses that kindness also benefits those who give it. Meditation is an effective tool for sending love. Do wishes or invocations of kindness reach? Are they effective? Yes.
- You share a personal difficulty practicing kindness with your immediate family, despite being able to do so with others (friends and acquaintances), and you seek to understand this discrepancy in their behavior. This creates a conflict, since by being critical of your family, you lose the opportunity to be patient, understanding, and tolerant. Kindness should be sweet and spontaneous.
Several people in the group identify with the above attitude, and one of them gives the example that family is a person's “kryptonite.” The genius of the comparison is evident. Family sometimes weakens us, and we behave with helplessness, impatience, and intolerance toward it.
- Opinions about kindness are expressed, such as: not giving an opinion unless asked; keeping quiet if what I'm going to say isn't more beautiful than silence; sometimes kindness is doing nothing; do you recognize kindness in others? Then you have it; the important thing in kindness is motivation; we must first be kind to ourselves; kindness is giving without expecting anything in return.
- A participant provides a testimony about caring for their elderly mother, who is physically and cognitively impaired, and states that there is a degree of kindness in this act. Another participant expresses that caring for a family member is more an act of responsibility than kindness. A discussion on this topic is scheduled for the next meeting. Meanwhile, both terms are defined to identify similarities and differences. “Responsibility” and “kindness” are not the same; they are distinct concepts, although they may be related in certain contexts. Their main differences are explained below:
- **_Responsibility_** is the ability of a person to assume the consequences of their actions and fulfill the commitments made.

Orientation: Focuses on fulfilling duties and obligations, both towards oneself and towards others.

Basis: It may be based on social, ethical or legal norms.

Example: Taking care of a child, arriving on time to work, or returning a borrowed item.

- **Kindness** is the inclination to do good, to act with generosity, empathy and compassion towards others.

Orientation: focuses on benefiting others without expecting anything in return.

Basis: It arises more from personal values ​​and the desire to help.

Example: Helping a stranger on the street, comforting someone in need, or donating to a charitable cause.

- Key differences:

1. Objective: Responsibility is oriented toward fulfilling tasks or duties. Kindness is oriented toward seeking the well-being of others.
2. Motivation: Responsibility is usually an external or internal obligation. Goodness comes from a personal choice or an ethical inclination.
3. Scope: Responsibility can be professional, personal, legal, or moral. Kindness is more closely linked to morality and human relationships.
4. Relationship between the two: Although they are different, a responsible person can be kind, and vice versa. For example, someone can be responsible when caring for a sick relative, but if they also do so with love and dedication, they are also acting kindly.

### Presentation Topics

**1. Exploring Spiritual Awakening: Personal Knowledge and Reflection (Fernando Carazo)**

A presentation aimed at emphasizing the importance of recognizing and transcending identification with the mind and ego, between matter and spirit; of how our lives are often conditioned by limiting programming and habits; of recognizing how spirituality can positively influence society and the individual.


**2. Spiritual practices: reflection, meditation, prayer and divine connection (Paula Requejo)**

A thematic development that shows us how to delve deeper into diverse and varied spiritual practices; profound reflections that teach us how to quiet the mind and seek to connect with the divine entity; aids that reduce the everyday and the habitual (stress, worries, concerns, and mental agitation) and allow us to listen to the voice of our conscience.


**3. Impact on society: collective spiritual behavior and action (Mariano Pérez)**

This explanation emphasizes how spirituality influences contemporary society; it emphasizes that this collective spiritual awakening is leading to a reevaluation of fundamental values. Spirituality can be a bridge between different cultures and religions, and it fosters mutual respect and collaboration.

**Documentary: Wake Up (co-director and presenter: Mónica Esgueva)**

We humans live immersed in our daily lives, with little reflection on who we really are, where we are here, or where we are going. We believe we are limited by our bodies, by personal circumstances, by our shortcomings, and by our history—says Mónica Esgueva.

When your consciousness identifies with this mind or ego construct, you become bound to received programming, social conditioning, and harmful habits. In this complicated situation... can you awaken? Not only can you, but we are convinced that this is the ultimate goal of our lives. That's why we spoke with experts on this fascinating topic and covered a wide variety of psychological and spiritual approaches to offer a path to self-transcendence that is understandable and accessible to all those interested in progressing and elevating their level of consciousness. If you want to change the world, the process must begin with you...

WAKE UP!!

In Spanish, sessions last between 60 and 90 minutes and are held on the first Sunday of the month at 6 p.m. (Madrid, Paris, and Rome time). The presenter gives an introductory presentation on the topic, followed by an opportunity for attendees to participate in a discussion.
<br style="clear:both;"/>

In case you missed it, here's April's presentation:

**God has a plan**

To discover the plan of ascension for Adjuster-fusion mortals and to take a brief tour in the reverse direction of the fifth revelation. This plan involves traveling both an external path (stage) and an internal path (self-transformation). Its successful completion guarantees the transformation of a mortal from the Adjuster-fusion realm into a finaliter, thus fulfilling the mandate to “BE PERFECT AS I AM PERFECT.”

**Host**: Jaime Marco

Jaime Marco is Spanish and lives in Lorquí, a town in the Murcia region of southeastern Spain. He is married to María Dolores and has a son and a grandson, both also named Jaime. He makes a living as a practicing systems engineer.

He has been a regular reader of _The Urantia Book_ since 1999. He is committed to its dissemination by participating in UBIS as a facilitator, in the Urantia Association of Spain as president, giving presentations when requested, and participating in debate and discussion forums.

It is clear that everything in _The Urantia Book_ is true, but all truth is not contained in _The Urantia Book_.
