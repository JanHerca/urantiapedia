## Editorial

Dear friends: in this new issue of Light and Life, we offer you contributions on a wide range of topics that help us to clarify concepts and broaden our insights into what we are told in _The Urantia Book_. Firstly, a conversation held in the Internet Study Group, in which we begin by talking about the tasks that await us once we cross the threshold of death, in the first mansion world, and then express our perplexity. that this information does not cause more than indifference among many people who have had access to it.

Next, we have the essay by our collaborator Jesús Rodríguez, who from Mexico illustrates our condition as children of God by faith, as the Master was in charge of emphasizing whenever he had the opportunity. It is followed by two brief (but no less inspiring) contributions by L. Coll and Agustín Barajas, which approach truth from two different points: one from its relative character at the level of existence in which we find ourselves, and the other from the love.

Finally, we have another delivery of the section “Convergences and Divergences”; in this case, it is a convergence with the book regarding reflectivity and the so-called quantum entanglement. And this issue closes with news from the association which, as is customary at this time, has already prepared the next National Readers' Meeting, which will be held in Madrid on the first weekend of June. We'll be there!

We hope you enjoy reading,

Olga Lopez
