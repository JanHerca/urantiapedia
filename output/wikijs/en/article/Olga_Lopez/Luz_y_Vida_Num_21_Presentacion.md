## 2. PRESENTATION

Dear friends: last year it was the international conference that occupied the corresponding monographic number of our meetings, and this year we once again dedicate the number to a national meeting. Once again, we wanted to do something different and take a step forward in our desire to spread the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. So we invited Sheila Keene-Lund to give us a seminar on what she calls the “cultivation of universal intelligence.” Sheila is a US-based reader, born in Spain to an English father and a Puerto Rican (and therefore bilingual) mother, who is involved in educational work in different international organizations of the Urantia movement. Sheila has recently published a book, Heaven is not the last stop, where she lays out the main UB teachings against science, philosophy and world religion. And not only this, but it gives us the keys on how to apply these teachings for personal improvement and for the peoples of the Earth.

We hope to be able to transmit in these pages what this seminar consisted of and the sensations we had. I believe that this Meeting has marked a before and after in our readers' meetings, that we have made a qualitative leap and, as readers of many years ago, there is the intention of going up a step in our dissemination of the book and in the application of its lessons in everyday life.

I hope you enjoy reading.

Fraternally
