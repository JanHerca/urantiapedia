## Editorial

Dear friends: the year 2015 is coming to an end, and with it comes the last issue of our Luz y Vida magazine. We hope you all have a good farewell to the year that is leaving, and a good start to the year that is coming.

On this occasion, we have a series of very varied articles related to the book and its relationship with the world in which we live. First of all, we are pleased to present an extensive article by Derek Grimm, a reader from Perth (Australia) who published a piece of work on his blog and on social networks that we found interesting to share with Spanish-speaking readers. Those who enjoyed the Wachowski brothers' “Matrix” trilogy will quickly grasp Derek's approach, which draws parallels between the Matrix and the society we live in, without losing sight of what _The Urantia Book_ says about our isolated world. and plunged into confusion.

Below is a brief article in which L.Coll expresses some very simple but powerful reflections on cities and life in the future, which he reinforces with very illuminating quotes from the book on the ideal of human life. It is followed by an article in which it is intended to publicize a study aid that until now has not had the publicity it deserves but that has been operating in Spanish for three years now: the School of _The Urantia Book_ on the Internet (Urantia Book Internet School, UBIS in English). This virtual school offers free ten-week courses on a wide variety of _The Urantia Book_ topics, where readers have the opportunity to share with other readers from around the world and deepen their knowledge of the book's teachings.

On this occasion, the delivery of “Convergences and Divergences” has a different approach. Instead of dealing with the world of facts, Santi addresses the convergences and divergences between the values that appear in _The Urantia Book_ with respect to those that predominate in today's society. Given recent events, this approach seems very current and worth taking into account. For the Urantia questionnaire of this number, we have precisely Santi answering the questions, so his collaboration with this number is double. Finally, closing this issue, the news from the Urantia Association of Spain.

Happy reading and new year!

Olga Lopez
