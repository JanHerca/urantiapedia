## In this number:

- Holy places? (second part), by Mariano Pérez
- What is expected of us?, by various authors
- More on how many survive (part one), from various authors
- News about the UAI International Conference


## Presentation

Dear friends: in this first issue of the year, we continue with the journey through the Holy Places that Mariano takes us at work, and we also offer three more conversations held by the Internet study group, which we hope you will find interesting . The last conversation could be considered a reflection after the conversation published in the last issue, entitled “How many survive.” This debate generated many interesting exhibitions that we will be publishing in successive installments.

This year, and due to the fact that the preparations for the international conference occupy a large part of our time, we cannot offer you anything certain about our annual Meeting at the moment. We hope to be able to tell you something about it as soon as possible. Meanwhile, here you have the latest news about the UAI 2009 International Conference, which will be held in Benalmádena Costa (Málaga) from April 17 to 21 of next year.

Fraternally
