## Presentation

Dear friends: here you have, once again, the debates held during the VII Readers' Meeting, which was held from April 28 to May 1, 2007 at the Vistamar hotel in Benalmádena Costa, on the Costa del Sol in Malaga. We hope that the work carried out during those days is reflected here and, of course, the spirit that presided over the relations between the attendees. All of you who have attended a Meeting know that there is something special in the atmosphere that is impossible to avoid.

Fraternally

Olga Lopez
