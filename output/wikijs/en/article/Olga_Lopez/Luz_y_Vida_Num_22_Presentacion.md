## Editorial

Dear friends: I suppose you are enjoying a well-deserved vacation, or about to. And what better than to reserve a moment of the holidays for the reading of topics related to _The Urantia Book_! Now that the pace of life seems to relax a bit, we are in the best frame of mind to face those readings that, during the rest of the year, we cannot carry out due to lack of time.

In this number you will find very varied articles within the subject matter related to _The Urantia Book_. We start strong with an article about space and its relationship with Paradise, combining the ideas of the book with the theories of current science. Then we continue with a reflection by L. Coll taking as a starting point the film “Ágora” by Alejandro Amenábar. In this issue we also include a corner for poetry by one of our collaborators, José Antonio Fernández Jorge. Below is a small personal reflection on what our attitude should be towards the catastrophic thoughts that have been installed in the collective unconscious since the middle of the last century, and a curious “test” created by Mark Kurtz, who from Indiana (USA) invites us to answer their questions honestly and ask ourselves these questions from time to time throughout our lives, to check if our spiritual progress is on the right track. And finally, some news about the Urantia movement in Spain and about the activities that our association is carrying out.

From these pages we wish you a happy summer, and that these days of rest are days not only of fun but also of reflection.
