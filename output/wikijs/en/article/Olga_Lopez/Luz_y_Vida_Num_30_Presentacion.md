## Editorial

Dear friends: once again, and faithful to our appointment, here is the issue of “Light and Life” with some very interesting readings for the month of September.

For many, summer vacations are a thing of the past, and what better way to overcome post-vacation depression than to immerse ourselves in readings that lift us from the daily grind to higher levels of spirituality.

In the first place, we have the second and last part of our friend Jesús Rodríguez who, from Mexico, continues to develop the theme of the spiritual evolution of man, whose goal is the divine mandate to “be perfect just as I am perfect.” Next, we have some reflections by L. Coll about what _The Urantia Book_ says about reincarnation, about which the book contains very clear and explicit references. Something that does not happen with the issue of abortion, which was addressed by the study group on the Internet, and which these days is very topical in our country. Finally, this series of articles on UB closes with a work by Santiago Rodríguez, exhibited at the study group in Barcelona, which deals with what our daily life should be like after reading UB. On this occasion, we do not have delivery of the series “Convergences and divergences”, but instead we have these valuable reflections by Santi.

Finally, and as usual, we include some news about the past and future activities of the Urantia Association of Spain.

Enjoy the reading!

Olga Lopez
