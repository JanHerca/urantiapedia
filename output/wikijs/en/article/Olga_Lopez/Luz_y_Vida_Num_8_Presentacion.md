## Presentation

Dear friends, in this issue we offer the third and final installment of the interesting exchange of ideas on the relationship between Orvonton and the Milky Way. We hope that you find this dialogue enlightening and that it raises fruitful questions that will make us all delve deeper into the teachings of the Book.

We also include here another of the poems sent by our friend José Antonio Rodríguez Jorge, and an article articulated as a dialogue that is actually a discussion line of the recently formed Internet study group. We hope that these works give rise to other people to contribute their grain of sand in understanding the issues raised.

Fraternally

Olga Lopez
