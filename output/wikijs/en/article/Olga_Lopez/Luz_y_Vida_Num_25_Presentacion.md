## Editorial

Dear friends: once again around these dates, we offer you a monograph of our national meeting. In this last meeting, the tenth that is celebrated in our country, we carried out a workshop-seminar inspired by the format used in the Internet School of _The Urantia Book_ (Urantia Book Internet School, UBIS). The purpose of this school is to train instructors and help readers of _The Urantia Book_ to improve their understanding of the book's teachings.

We hope you can get an idea of what happened from May 5 to 8, 2011 at the Hotel Félix de Valls (Tarragona), a perfect location for a meeting where we had the opportunity to delve into the comparison between evolutionary religion and revealed religion.

As we want other readers to take advantage of what was done at the Meeting, in this magazine and on our website we will publish the materials that have emerged from the group activities and subsequent discussions, so that it is possible to repeat the experience on a smaller scale in a study group, or who knows if in another meeting held in another country.

Also, as a closing to this issue, we put a news item on the activities carried out by the Urantia Association of Spain, related to the dissemination of _The Urantia Book_. On this occasion we were present in the beautiful city of Seville, where we offered a book presentation to all those who responded to our call.

I hope you enjoy reading!

Olga Lopez
Urantia Association of Spain
