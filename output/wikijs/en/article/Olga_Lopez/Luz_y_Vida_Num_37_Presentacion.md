## Editorial

Dear friends: as usual, the summer issue of the magazine “Luz y Vida” will be dedicated entirely to the Annual Meeting of Readers, of which we have already had no less than thirteen editions. This year, as a show of support and recognition for the study group that was created in Valencia last year, the conference was held at the Abba Acteón hotel in this beautiful Mediterranean city, from May 23 to 25.

By the way, the name of the hotel must undoubtedly be very suggestive for the readers. Let us remember that “abba” is the Aramaic equivalent of “dad”, the name used by Jesus of Nazareth when referring to his heavenly Father. Just this year the theme of the Encounter has been Jesus and his message, which has been addressed based on four passages from _The Urantia Book_. This is the first meeting of Spanish readers in which Jesus of Nazareth and his teachings has been the main theme. After twelve Encounters, it was time to address the figure of the ruler of our local universe!

Our intention is that you can have an idea of what was experienced during those two intense days, although there are no words that can convey what it means to experience it “live and direct”. The Encounters are unique opportunities to enjoy the company of other readers and to exchange impressions with people who are on the same spiritual “wavelength” as we are. So, I hope you are encouraged to come next year and meet us!

Have a good read!

Olga Lopez
