## Editorial

Dear friends: once again around these dates, we offer you a monograph of our national meeting. At this last meeting, the eleventh to be held in our country, we held a workshop-seminar that was also held at the Urantia Association International Leadership Symposium, held in July 2011 in Chicago (USA).

We hope you can get an idea of what happened from May 11 to 13, 2012 at the Inturjoven hostel in Seville, a perfect location for a meeting that, although brief in time, was very intense and gave us the opportunity to fraternize and deepen in values necessary to make known the teachings of _The Urantia Book_.

As always, we want other readers to take advantage of what was done at the Encuentro, so we publish here the presentations that were given on the first day. The contents of the leadership values workshop will also be published on the association's website, which will include the most outstanding reflections. In this way, there is the possibility of repeating the experience on a smaller scale in a study group or in any other gathering of readers.

Also, as a closing to this issue, we post news about activities related to readers and the Urantia Association of Spain. Precisely in the assembly of partners that was celebrated taking advantage of this Meeting, the board of directors was renewed. The time finally came for me to pass the baton to Carmelo Martínez, the new president of the association, to whom I wish the best in this new venture and that the Urantia movement in Spain continues to spread.

I hope you enjoy reading!

Olga Lopez
