On Sunday, May 22, at 12 noon, Olga López gave a presentation of _The Urantia Book_ in the activities tent of the Seville Book Fair. There was a previous introduction by Pilar Vaz, owner of the Anatma Bookstore, to whom we are grateful for the opportunity she gave us to make _The Urantia Book_ known in the Andalusian capital.

The presentation focused primarily on what distinguishes _The Urantia Book_ from other teachings and cosmologies. Given the material impossibility of offering an exhaustive list of all the teachings contained in the book, we wanted to focus on the most outstanding parts, which could give an idea of the global content to those people who had heard about _The Urantia Book_ for the first time.

After the presentation itself, there was a brief question and answer session, in which Eduardo Altuzarra, vice president of the association, also participated. Once finished, Olga López was at the Anatma bookstore booth to sign copies of her novels, “Dialogues with Sofía” and “See you in your dreams.” Three copies of the book were sold at the booth that morning and, in addition to answering questions from interested people, we put readers of the book in contact with the group from Seville that attended the conference. So we are sure that new seeds have been planted in the Seville capital, and that the Urantia movement will continue to spread slowly but surely in southern Spain.

This conference gave us the opportunity to meet old friends as well as make new ones in a city where _The Urantia Book_ was already known in the late 1970s, long before the Spanish translation was published. From here we want to thank our Sevillian friends for their hospitality and their love. They made our stay in Seville a joy for the body, mind and spirit.
