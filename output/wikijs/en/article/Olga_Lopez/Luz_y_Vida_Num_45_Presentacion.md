## Editorial

Dear friends: for many, the summer holidays have come to an end, and after them comes the routine of the rest of the year. To continue feeding mind and spirit and to lighten the load of daily work, what better than some readings related to _The Urantia Book_ and its teachings? So here we are again, offering some articles that I hope you like and give you food for thought.

On this occasion, we begin with a very interesting article by Santiago Flores, a Uruguayan reader who took it upon himself to write the Wikipedia entry on _The Urantia Book_. This experience, along with debating critics of the book in various Internet forums, has given him the opportunity to confront fallacious arguments that he lists in this article. I believe that it is well worth reading it because, as Santiago very well says in his article, “improving our understanding of the presentation of arguments and contrasting them will allow us to optimize resources and energy, and thus achieve debates with more substance, with more 'wheat' and less 'straw', both between us and (especially) in contexts more hostile to our theses”.

Below, we offer you the transcript of the talk I gave in the virtual Zoom room of the Urantia Association of Brazil last April. In this talk, I reflect on the content of document 72 (The government of a neighboring planet) and on what we could put into practice to get a little closer to the age of light and life. This document is one of my favorites in the book, and I think this talk made it pretty clear!

We continue with another of L. Coll's simple, brief and powerful reflections, this time on free will, one of the most precious gifts that the Father gives us and that we do not always value as it deserves.

The following article is part of the section “Convergences and Divergences” by our friend Santi. In this case, he returns to the subject of the origin of agriculture that he already discussed last year, but this time addressing how knowledge was shared based on genetic studies of ancient populations.

And finally, the fixed section “Urantia Questionnaire”, which on this occasion is answered by Miguel Bustos, a reader from Palma de Mallorca who is very active in disseminating the book and who has recently joined the board of directors of the Urantia Association of Spain. as secretary.

Happy reading!
Olga Lopez
