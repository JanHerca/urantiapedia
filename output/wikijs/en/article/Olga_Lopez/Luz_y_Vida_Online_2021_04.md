## Editorial Light and Life – April 2021

Maria Jose Sanchez Santamaria

### We are bearers of good news

The newly released spring in the Northern Hemisphere is here, with all its display of freshness, life and colors. And with it comes the memory of the Resurrection of our beloved Jesus of Nazareth. A wonderful opportunity to reflect on his life and divine example, and to see that his example guide our efforts to “revive” our consciousness, to bring forth in our lives the high ideals and true freedom our Adjuster so deeply craves.

Following the detailed news that the media serve us is an exercise that can gradually empty us of illusion, of hope for the future. But we readers of _The Urantia Book_ have enough cosmic perspective to nurture that hope and we know that the best is yet to come.

With this April issue of the Light and Life Newsletter in your hands, dear reader, you have enough “spiritual food” to direct your mind and soul towards lofty and inspiring ideals:


- You will find works that explain the cosmic design of our reality, such as the excellent works of Jan, Rafael or Mariano.
- Another work shows us facets of a close collaborator of Jesus on Earth, Judas Iscariot, that you will be interested in knowing.
- The precious _Chronicle of the Life of Jesus_ continues to show us another document from the fourth part, ready to be studied in a group of readers.
- We do not forget very beautiful urantian books like Bob Slage's or Rick Warren's.
- The Internet is an amazing mine of Urantian materials: we review a blog, a Youtube channel, the Urantian talks in our Zoom room, the famous UBIS courses, and the long-awaited International Conference of readers.
- You will see a different section: the _Urantia Questionnaire_, where prominent readers from the Urantia community will share how the book's teachings have changed their lives.

All this shows us a vibrant, dynamic, increasingly interconnected and planetary URANTIA MOVEMENT. A movement that bears good news for this world, which we want to expose in this simple monthly bulletin (or so we pretend, at least).

**[Mr. Hubble and _The Urantia Book_ (Dick Bain, with comments by Jan Herca)](/en/article/Dick_Bain/Mr_Hubble_and_the_Urantia_Papers)** (also on the [association's website](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/02/El-Sr-Hubble-y-el-LU.pdf))

In this paper, Dick Bain (with additional comments by Jan Herca, the article's translator) compares Hubble's theory that the universe is constantly expanding against the book's claims to this perception, especially centered on the breathing of space. , which leads him to reflect on the cosmology of the book and the possible criticisms it may have from non-readers related to the need to review it.

[The upward race, by Rafael Mondéjar](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/03/CARRERA-ASCENDENTE-Rafa-Texto-para-el-Power-Point.pdf)

In this extensive and exhaustive work, the author, a veteran reader of the book, exposes the ascending career from our stage as planetary mortals to the stage of citizens of Paradise, with all the milestones that characterize each of the stages and what we are learning in them. .

[What to do with human evolution?, by Mariano Pérez](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/03/Que-hacer-con-la-evoluci%C3%B3n-biol%C3%B3gica.pdf)

This work was exposed in a virtual chat on Zoom on October 25, 2015. In this talk the author, based on the teachings of the book, asks if something should be done to biologically improve the races of the Earth and, if so , how to carry it out. To answer these questions, the author strives to contextualize the teachings with an open mind and a critical spirit to propose which are the tools that should be used in the improvement of the races. Here is the [supporting PowerPoint presentation](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/08/Reflexiones-urantianas-sobre-las-instituciones-humanas-PowerPoint.pdf)

[Judas Iscariot, the 12th apostle, by Javier Martínez](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/10/Seminario-Judas-Iscariote-Ver-1.4.pdf)

In this PowerPoint presentation is the content of the virtual talk that the author gave on Zoom, in which he analyzes the figure of Judas Iscariot: his origin, his personality traits, his negative aspects and the process that led him to move away from the uplifting influence of the Master and to embrace evil.

You can see the video of the presentation [here](https://youtu.be/9zrKdtQwz0o).

## The astronomical secrets of the sky

John B Parkinson

### Background

The following article is a brief introduction to my main research and writing project, which has to do with the astronomical search and identification of those stars, asterisms and constellations associated with the celestial worlds of our local universe of Nebadon, as revealed in the 1955 publication known as _The Urantia Book_. Specifically, those clusters of divinely created architectural spheres known in _The Urantia Book_ as Jerusem, Edentia and Salvington.

Since _The Urantia Book_ does not explicitly reveal the location of these places, we must turn to other sources of information both ancient and modern to try to unlock these secrets. After years of studying _The Urantia Book_ I have identified at least one key passage that gives us an indispensable clue that greatly narrows the search for Edentia, the constellation sky. Here's the story.

## Books – our recommendations of the month

<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2021_04/07.jpg" width="130">
</figure>

**Tales of Joshua (Bob Slagle)**

_Tales of Joshua_ is an excellent account of the childhood of Jesus of Nazareth, as narrated in _The Urantia Book_, expressed in very simple language and with numerous illustrations, which makes it especially suitable for children.

</figure>

**Resurrection Room (Rick Warren)**

_Resurrection Room_ is a beautiful story that gives free rein to the imagination but taking into account what is told in _The Urantia Book_ about life on the mansion worlds, from when we woke up in the resurrection rooms until we merged with the Adjuster. A story full of hope and one that could very well be quite close to what life on morontia really is.

## Looking for Jesus – Jan Herca's blog

<figure id="Figure_9" class="image urantiapedia">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2021_04/09.jpg"  width="600">
</figure>

This blog by Jan Herca, a reader from Valladolid, contains a lot of interesting material about his project to write a complete biography of Jesus of Nazareth. Although it hasn't been updated for a while, it is worth reviewing the blog and reading all the information it contains about the life and teachings of the Master. In addition, it is possible to download for free the deliveries of the biography, titled _Jesús de Nazareth_.

## Video – our recommendation of the month

**The Anunnaki and _The Urantia Book_**

<figure id="Figure_10" class="image urantiapedia">

In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m67qNM25gs0) of the channel [Urantia Writing Studies](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7jKlrYCBGq0CiLTGDq-0KQ) one of the works of Jael González, a veteran reader who has delved into the parallels of the history of humanity with what is affirmed in the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. Here he postulates an interesting theory about the true identity of the Anunnaki, those mysterious gods of the Sumerians.


## Urantia Questionnaire: Ginés Avilés

_Editor's Note: We are starting a new section, in which a featured reader will answer some questions about how he came to _ The Urantia Book _and why he finds it so inspiring. On this occasion, Ginés Avilés, current president of the Urantia Association of Spain, will answer our questionnaire._

<figure id="Figure_11" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left" style="display:block;">

</figure>

Hello brothers! I am Ginés and I am a seeker of Truth, that is the most important thing I can say about myself, my best resume.

In addition, I am married with two beautiful children and I live happily in the city of Murcia. I have a varied life but mainly I am a public employee in the Bank of Spain and, as you all know, I participate in the Urantia Association of Spain.

From a very young age I was curious and open, I was interested in almost everything, I wanted to know more about people in general... and I think that this same attitude with its comings and goings was what led me to this new spirituality that _The Urantia Book_ represents.

## Urantia Talks for the month of April

<figure id="Figure_12" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2021_04/12.jpg" width="200">
</figure>

The Association is organizing Urantia Talks so that all who wish can join and discuss topics that interest them. The idea is that the moderators propose a starting topic, which can then be followed by others at the proposal of the attendees.

At the moment these talks will be biweekly (every other Friday) and their purpose is to maintain contact between readers in the absence of face-to-face events, as well as to share the teachings in an atmosphere of fraternity and camaraderie.

Meetings will be held in the [Association Zoom room](https://zoom.us/j/362798144).

The first two meetings will be on Fridays **April 9 and 24 at 7:00 p.m.** (Spanish peninsular time). We wait for you!
