## Editorial

Dear friends: as usual, the summer issue of the magazine “Luz y Vida” is devoted entirely to the XIV Annual Meeting of Readers, which this year was held in the ancient city of Cartagena (Murcia) on April 30. to May 3.

In this issue, we have included all the presentations that have been compiled so that, as far as possible, you have an idea of what was experienced during those days, although it is difficult to transmit through this means the experience of living the debates, the talks in person in “petit committee” and all those things that make the Encounters unique experiences that are very worthwhile, those things that allow us to enjoy the company of people who share our spiritual concern and who, like us, have that desire to seek the truth wherever it is. So, I hope you are encouraged to come next year and meet us!

Have a good read!

Olga Lopez
