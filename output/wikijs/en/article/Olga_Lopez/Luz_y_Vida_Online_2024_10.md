**Hope**

Welcome to this new issue of the “Light and Life” newsletter.

“If you think we can't change the world, it simply means that you are not one of those people who will do it” (Jacques Fresco).

This provocative phrase, more than a statement, is an invitation to get up from our comfort zone, an invitation to be the protagonists of our own story, with the conviction that change is possible when we believe in it and pursue it with determination.

The media, social networks, constantly inflict problems on us, they lower our morale with worries about an avalanche of all kinds of setbacks, so what is it that allows us to continue moving forward in life and not throw in the towel on life right now? Why do we continue moving forward and not falter?

The answer is hope, that internal force, that spark that drives us to dream of a better future and to work to make it a reality. A force that our beloved Master bequeathed to us, in his words and in his works, and that his followers (then and now) want to continue:

## Works – our recommendations of the month

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2024_10/El-universo.jpg" alt="Orvonton" width="250">
</figure>

[**Superuniverse of Orvonton (Eduardo Altuzarra)**](/en/article/Eduardo_Altuzarra/El_superuniverso_de_Orvonton_es_la_Via_Lactea_2006) (also on the [association's website](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/10/Super-Universo-Orvonton.pdf))

This work, in addition to referring to contents of _The Urantia Book_, is based on secondary works carried out by other readers: “ASTRONOMY AND THE SUPERUNIVERSE” by Troy R. Bishop (1982), “What is Orvonton really like?”, by Antonio Moya (1987), “From Urantia to the master universe, interesting data”, by Humberto Andrade (1997), “How big is Orvonton really?”, by Norm Du Val, accompanied by photos from Hubble.

[**The survival of values (Paula Requejo)**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WmzcSb5bZz5a_FHVEZwcWyiIoSDKflnw/view?usp=sharing)

This work contains the presentation that Paula gave at a Readers' Meeting in Spain about the Thought Adjuster. In this case, the novelty is that it is articulated in the form of a beautiful story, which could very well be aimed at children, since it is expressed in very simple language but which transmits very profound truths. The presentation is contained in a ZIP, which can be downloaded from the link. Note! Each slide has an audio fragment in the lower left corner.

[**The figure of Jesus of Nazareth (L. Coll)**](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/01/La-figura-de-Jes%C3%BAs-de-Nazaret.pdf)

This brief work is related to the artistic representations that have been made of Jesus throughout history. Right at the beginning, its author says: “If I had to believe in that type of Jesus as some cartoonists have painted him, that Jesus so sweet, so pretty, so loving, so gentle and so handsome, with a wax face like a Sunday holy card, or that Jesus dressed in gold and jewels who only seems to bless the rich, or that type of Jesus with the face of a vagabond, if I had to believe in that type of Jesus I would have become an atheist a long time ago.”

[**The inner life: upwards (Ana María García)**](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/05/La-vida-interior-hacia-arriba.pdf)

This is the text of a presentation given at a Readers' Meeting, whose main theme was “The Inner Life,” and which deals with worship, meditation, and adoration. In the words of the author: “Worship is the hallmark that we are candidates for spiritual ascension. The practice of meditation in worship and effective prayer take us upward. Worship and prayer require, among other things, attention, vigilance, diligence, constancy, discipline, insistence, silence, and stillness. Worship and prayer are significant and valuable tools for going upward.”

## History and teachings: Chronicle of the life of Jesus

**JOURNALISTIC ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE AND TEACHINGS OF JESUS ACCORDING TO _THE URANTIA BOOK_**

We present to you the next installment of the chronicles of the life of Jesus, which on this occasion contains what the revelators tell us in paper 160 (Rodan of Alexandria). Inside the PDF you will see a button from which you can access the text of the document from the Urantia Foundation website.

## Urantia Book Children's Guide: Jesus at Age 23

<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2024_10/Jesus-a-los-23-anos.jpg" alt="Jesús a los 23 años" width="250">
</figure>

We continue reviewing the secondary work _A Child's Guide to The Urantia Book_, by Mary Livingston. This is the next chapter, which deals with the time when Jesus was 23 years old, and it begins like this:

“Jesus, James, Joseph and Simon all worked. Miriam sold milk and butter. Martha was a good weaver. She made cloth. Jesus stopped working for three weeks. This was the longest time he took off from work.”

**Alchemy of Being (Cristina Shârak)**

In the words of its author: “In this book I will teach you techniques, tools and advice that will help you achieve the optimal balance between your emotions and your mind. You will learn to free yourself from emotions and thoughts that limit you. I will help you to be yourself and live the life you want. To pamper your body, listen to your soul and feel in harmony with yourself and the world around you, thus achieving the Alchemy of Being.”

Dipti Bhakti (stage name of Luis Miguel Morales, a Colombian reader living in Argentina) has been making electronic music inspired by _The Urantia Book_ for many years. We recommend this video from [his channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DiptiBhakti), which features our Creator Son, and is accompanied by very beautiful and evocative images and texts taken from the book.

## Navigating through life: I explain myself to God — Ángela Figuera Aymerich

</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

Lord, if I don't sing to you, don't be angry.
You see, I don't have time for anything.
You have to live, walk, be with people;
look at the forest, the sea; climb heights,
pains, stairs; going down basements,
abysses, mines, wells, hearts;
enter the workshops and kitchens;
sow, harvest, deal with metals,
carving rock, planing wood;
sweat in the sun, get wet in the rain;
open windows, keep the fire going;
bake bread, shout along the roads;
put the child to sleep, mend clothes;
cry for the deceased and learn
death itself a little every day.

## My favorite paragraph — José Luis Navarro

<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2024_10/Adan-y-Eva-mi-parrafo-favorito.jpg" alt="Adán y Eva" width="350">
</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

> ADAM AND EVE arrived on Urantia, from the year A.D. 1934, 37,848 years ago. It was in midseason when the Garden was in the height of bloom that they arrived. At high noon and unannounced, the two seraphic transports, accompanied by the Jerusem personnel intrusted with the transportation of the biologic uplifters to Urantia, settled slowly to the surface of the revolving planet in the vicinity of the temple of the Universal Father. All the work of rematerializing the bodies of Adam and Eve was carried on within the precincts of this newly created shrine. And from the time of their arrival ten days passed before they were re-created in dual human form for presentation as the world’s new rulers. They regained consciousness simultaneously. The Material Sons and Daughters always serve together. It is the essence of their service at all times and in all places never to be separated. They are designed to work in pairs; seldom do they function alone. (<a id="a206_960"></a>[UB 74:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p0_1))

The first time I read it while browsing the book on the internet (I hadn't yet decided whether to buy it) it had a huge impact on my belief system. It resonated very strongly within me because of the incredible coherence of the story.
