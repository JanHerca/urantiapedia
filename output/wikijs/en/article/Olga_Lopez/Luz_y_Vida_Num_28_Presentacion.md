## Editorial

Dear friends of “Light and Life”:

In this issue we have many and varied contributions from readers from different places, to offer content inspired by the contents of _The Urantia Book_. First of all, we offer here an article by Santiago Flores, who from Montevideo (Uruguay) reflects on the famous triad “facts, ideas and relationships” alluded to in a previous article in the magazine. Next, we have another Internet study group conversation, about some enigmatic birds that are talked about in the book: the fandores.

Next, we continue with Santi's fixed section of “Convergences and divergences”, which in this case deals with the formation of the solar system, and how science has been approaching the book's statements about this remote event. Finally, we have included content about the dissemination of the book, using different ways: on the one hand, José Antonio shares with us his experiences placing copies of the book in Gran Canaria, where he lives. And we explain how the interview conducted on the “Lights in the Dark” program was, where both the origin of the book and its content were discussed.

Finally, and as usual on these dates, we offer you information about our next Readers Meeting, which this year will be held in the beautiful city of Seville. We hope that many of you will be encouraged to come. The theme of the Meeting on this occasion will be “Leadership in action”, inspired by the Leadership Seminar that took place in July last year in Chicago (USA). We want to echo the importance of having future leaders and instructors spreading the revelation throughout the world and for years to come.

Enjoy reading!

Olga Lopez
President of the Urantia Association of Spain
