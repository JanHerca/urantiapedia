## Editorial

Dear friends: at a time when the summer heat subsides and vacations for many are just a memory, we take the opportunity to return to the charge with renewed energy and more food for the mind and spirit. In this issue, we present an essay that was published in The Fellowship Herald last summer, which stems from a question born out of curiosity: why is Urantia, being a decimal world, numbered 606 and not a number? multiple of ten? As a result of this question, Jacob Dix, a young reader from Sweden, develops a very interesting work in which, starting from the traditional method of “the old woman's account”, and gathering scattered quotes in the book, he reaches very interesting conclusions. Due to its length, in this issue we will only publish the first half of the work, but we encourage you to read it in its entirety. We are sure that you will discover new knowledge.

Next, we incorporate an interesting conversation regarding the doubt that many readers have raised about the current situation of Caligastia, according to what is said in _The Urantia Book_. This is followed by a visual presentation by L.Coll of our Creator Son, incarnated in our world as Jesus of Nazareth. Of which, by the way, a few days ago the 2019th anniversary of his birth was fulfilled.

Finally, we have two fixed sections. The first one already has a certain path, “Convergences and divergences”. In it, Santiago Rodríguez compares the scientific statements with those of the book regarding a specific topic. In this case, he will tell us about the appearance on Earth of placental mammals. As for the second fixed section, we are going to inaugurate it in this issue. It is the “Urantia Questionnaire”, twelve questions that we will pose to prominent readers of the Urantia movement in Spain. And, to inaugurate it, what better than to start with the president of the Urantia Association of Spain, Carmelo Martínez.

We hope you have a happy and enlightening read!

Olga Lopez
