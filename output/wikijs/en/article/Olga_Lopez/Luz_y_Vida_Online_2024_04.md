**Master of Happiness**

When we read our beloved Urantia Book, we can fall into the temptation of treating the book with solemnity, seriousness, and a certain grandiloquence, letting ourselves be carried away by the atavism of handling sacred books and organized religions. But far from that, the book encourages us to look at the world with joy and optimism, to judge human beings with understanding and to take events from a cosmic perspective, giving hope to all those who have grown tired of hearing that life is crap and our species is a mistake of evolution that should disappear from the face of the Earth.

Etty Hillesum is not as famous as Anne Frank, perhaps because dying at twenty-nine seems less dramatic than dying at fifteen, but the truth is that both of them burned in the crematoriums of concentration camps in Nazi Germany. Both left us moving diaries that recounted their hardships and showed the resistance of the human spirit to sink into despair, hatred and resentment, even when faced with the possibility of a violent and early death. They have left us a great lesson of life and hope.

Anne Frank never lost her ability to rejoice in the small field of vision she could observe from her hiding place:

## Works – our recommendations of the month

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">

[**Master Universe Hypothesis (Bill Sadler)**](https://www.urantia.org/es/charlas-de-bill-sadler/hipotesis-del-universo-maestro)

On the [Urantia Foundation website](http://www.urantia.org/) we find this transcription of one of the talks that Bill Sadler gave to a study group, in which he addresses a part of the teachings that may be most difficult for us to understand due to our condition as beings circumscribed to space and time: that hypothetical moment of the eternity in which the I AM is "split" into the deified (personal) and non-deified (non-personal) reality. With a clear and simple style, it also explains what was the origin of the creation of the universe and the beings that direct it. It is a highly recommended work to clarify the sequence of events that led to the creation of the master universe.

[**Advertising for _The Urantia Book_ (Eduardo Altuzarra)**](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/03/Publicidad.pps)

As its author points out, this presentation attempts to briefly explain what a good dissemination of _The Urantia Book_ and its in-depth study can be, so that we can become an example of life for our fellow men. At a time when the book is available in the languages ​​of nearly 80% of the world's population, it is important to consider how best to spread its teachings. According to the author, dissemination must be slow and publicity progressive, as too rapid a growth would be counterproductive.

[**How ​​Big Is Orvonton? (Norm Du Val)**](/en/article/Norm_Duval/How_big_is_Orvonton) (also on the [association's website](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/03/ComograndeOrvonton.pdf))

This paper begins with this statement: “Many people have wondered and speculated about the actual size of our superuniverse, grand universe, master universe, etc., especially since The Urantia Book and science do not seem to be in very good agreement.” So how big is Orvonton? Do we need to change The Urantia Book to fit the science of today, or worse, the science of yesterday? These are the questions the author attempts to answer in this article, looking both at what the book says and at what is part of human knowledge.

[**A description of reality (Antonio Moya)**](https://aue.urantia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/03/DescripcionRealidad.pdf)

The introduction to this extensive work is a declaration of intentions by the author: «Human beings walk a bit lost, disoriented, through this world. We are drifting a bit, groping in the dark, because we do not know a description of Reality (…) Human beings do not know for certain what they are doing here, how and why they have emerged in the Cosmos, what purpose this existence has, what is expected of them and, in any case, what their destiny is (if there is one). Throughout the centuries, we men have sought answers to the reason for our existence and the Universe. This little work is an attempt to suggest a possible explanation to the questions we ask ourselves: "What place do we occupy in the Universe? And ultimately, what is the structure of Reality really like?" »

## History and teachings: Chronicle of the life of Jesus

**JOURNALISTIC ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE AND TEACHINGS OF JESUS ​​ACCORDING TO _THE URANTIA BOOK_**

We present to you the next installment of the chronicles of the life of Jesus, which on this occasion contains what the revelators tell us in the document 155 (The Flight to Northern Galilee). Within the PDF you will see a button from which you can access the text of the document from the Urantia Foundation website.

</figure>

We continue our review of the secondary work _A Child’s Guide to The Urantia Book_ by Mary Livingston. This is the next chapter, which deals with the events of Jesus’ life after he took his brother James to Jerusalem, and it begins like this:

“Jesus went back to work at the caravan shop. He fixed things made of wood and leather. He was happy to be back in the warehouse where he had been for four years. There he had the opportunity to see people from all over the region again. He truly loved people.”

**The Universe Has Your Back. From Fear to Faith (Gabrielle Bernstein)**

As the author points out: «My commitment with this book is to awaken as many people as I can to their connection with faith and joy. In that connection we can be guided to our true purpose: to be love and to spread love. These words can no longer be pretty, hackneyed phrases that we simply post on social media. They must become our mission. The happiness and security we long for reside in our commitment to love.

## Navigating through life:The Truth Store

<br>

<figure id="Figure_10" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-center">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2024_04/La-tienda-de-la-verdad.jpg" alt="La tienda de la verdad">
</figure>

A man was walking through the small streets of a provincial town. He had time and so he stopped for a few moments in each shop window, in each business, in each square. When he turned a corner he suddenly found himself in front of a modest shop with a blank awning.

Intrigued, he approached the window and put his face to the glass so he could look into the dark window. Inside he could only see a lectern holding a small handwritten sign that read: “THE TRUTH SHOP.”

The man was surprised. He thought it was a fantasy name, but he couldn’t imagine what they were selling. He went in. He approached the lady at the first counter and asked:

“Excuse me, is this the truth shop?

” “Yes, sir. What kind of truth are you looking for? Partial truth, relative truth, statistical truth, complete truth?

So they sold truth here. He had never imagined that this was possible: to arrive at a place and take the truth with him, it was wonderful.

“The whole truth,” the man replied without hesitation.

“I am so tired of lies and falsifications,” he thought. “I do not want any more generalizations or justifications, deceptions or deceptions.”

“The whole truth!” he confirmed.

“Fine, sir, follow me. ”

The young lady accompanied the customer to another section and, pointing to a very stern-faced salesman, said:

“The gentleman will attend to you.

” The salesman approached and waited for the man to speak.

“I have come to buy the whole truth.

” “Aha! Excuse me, does the gentleman know the price?

” “No, what is it?” he answered routinely. In fact, he knew that he was willing to pay anything for the whole truth.

“If you take it,” said the salesman, “the price is that you will never be at peace again. ”

A chill ran down the man’s spine; he had never imagined that the price would be so high.

“Th… thank you, excuse me,” he stammered.

He turned around and left the store looking at the floor. He felt a little sad when he realized that he was not yet ready for the absolute truth, he still needed some lies to find rest in, some myths and idealizations to take refuge in, some justifications to avoid having to face himself.

"Maybe later," he thought.

## My favorite paragraph — Jaime Marco

<figure id="Figure_11" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2024_04/El-alma.jpg" alt="Mi párrafo favorito - mayo 2024">
</figure>

You will agree with me that it is very difficult to choose one paragraph. There are so many, and so laden with wisdom and revelation. So many that open up new perspectives on Deity, Jesus, our planet, creation, etc.

Nevertheless, I bring you the following paragraph:

The transcripts of mortal mind and the active configurations of creature memory, as transformed from the material to the spiritual levels, are the individual property of the separated Thought Adjusters; these spiritualized factors of creature mind, memory, and personality are forever a part of those Adjusters. The creature's mind matrix and the passive potentials of its identity are present in the morontia soul entrusted to the care of the seraphic guardians of destiny. The reunion of the morontia soul entrusted to the seraphim and the spiritual mind entrusted to the Adjuster is what reassembles the creature's personality and constitutes the resurrection of a sleeping survivor. <a id="a232_687"></a>[UB 47:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p3_3)

## The Urantia Questionnaire — Luis Alfonso Rojas Rosillo

<figure id="Figure_12" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2024_04/Luis-Alfonso-Rojas.jpg" alt="Luis Alfonso Rojas" width="350">
</figure>

Luis Alfonso was born in the magical region of the Eastern Plains of Colombia 61 years ago. He is married and has two children. He resides in Bogotá, Distrito Capital, with his family. He works as an independent legal consultant, mainly in the economic regulation of energy markets and energy transition. Since 1997 he has worked as a university professor in different areas of law. He has been studying The Urantia Book since 2003 and has participated in various courses as a student and professor-facilitator at UBIS.

**1. How did you find The Urantia Book and why do you think you found it?**

I learned about the book in early 1997 when I asked my brother-in-law, a wonderful human being and an excellent ENT doctor, what he wanted as a present for his fiftieth birthday. He only knew that it had no known author and that it dealt with the universe and the history of the planet. Three years later, to my surprise, I found it displayed in a bookstore among books dealing with natural gas and electric energy markets. The only similarity between those books was the blue and white color of the cover.

The book came into my life when I was looking for answers to the most transcendent questions I was asking myself at that time: Who am I? Why do I exist? What is my mission in life? I like to believe that the book came to me at the stage when my Thought Adjuster was beginning to move from Adjuster to Controller.

## Draft commission for monographic studies

<figure id="Figure_13" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2024_04/estudioLU-abr21.jpg" alt="Estudios monográficos" width="350">
</figure>

The "Monographic Studies" project was born from the desire of several readers of _The Urantia Book_ to study specific, concrete issues in depth, in order to understand these topics more broadly and intelligently.
<br style="clear:both;"/>

**OBJECTIVES**

- To achieve greater discernment of _The Urantia Book_.
- Increase the interest of readers interested in classified reading towards deeper interests.
- Provide the opportunity for relevant scholars to participate.
- Whatever comes out of this current initiative.

**PROCEDURE**

- With the approval of the board of directors, the project proposal will be communicated to readers so that those volunteers who wish to do so can participate, both to be part of the commission and to participate as a listener.
- All the norms and values ​​of the study groups of The Urantia Book are respected (moderation, empathy, fraternity, order, etc.) in order to understand and comprehend each other in order to achieve a common goal.
- The responsibility falls on the volunteers who make up the research commission.
- In the development, a statement is made on a specific topic (for example, the absonite level).
- The basics of the texts are argued and the work plan is established.

**STRUCTURE**

- Basically, two communication channels are established: WhatsApp group and Zoom room.
- The commission will not be made up of more than five or seven people.
- The Zoom room sessions will be open to other readers as mere listeners and observers, without the possibility of intervention.
- The number of participants as listeners, as well as the frequency of the meetings, will be determined based on the agreements made once the research commission has been formed.

Readers interested in being part of this commission can contact the Association by email at [urantiaesp@gmail.com](mailto:urantiaesp@gmail.com) requesting your participation.

## Circle of Trust

<figure id="Figure_14" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2024_04/Los-retos-de-los-lideres-de-la-quinta-revelacion.png" alt="Círculo de Confianza" width="350">
</figure>

The Urantia Association of Spain has supported the creation of a "circle of trust", which met for the first time on April 19 via Zoom.

The creation of the Circle of Trust is justified by the need of some readers to alleviate the feeling of loneliness and difficulty that we sometimes feel in applying the knowledge of our beloved book in everyday life.
<br style="clear:both;"/>

**OBJECTIVES**

- To have the opportunity to express doubts, concerns, problems, personal gains, etc., about the application of the knowledge of _The Urantia Book_ in everyday life.
- To be able to help and accompany other members of the group in their process of applying said knowledge of _The Urantia Book_.
- To increase the personal bond of the group participants through this activity.

**PROCEDURE**

It is similar to virtual study groups via Zoom:

- A moderator or facilitator gives way to the participants according to the order in which they raise their hands.
- The testimonies of the participants can be to originate a personal matter or to contribute and add to a testimony originated by another partner previously.
- The originator of a testimony, to the extent possible, will provide the reference(s) of _The Urantia Book_ related to his/her testimony.
- The expression of a testimony can entail the manifestation of emotions (anger, sorrow, fear, joy, etc.), which at a given moment can overflow. It is the facilitator's job to direct said manifestation so that, with the help of the group members, it ends in a smooth way and with personal gain.
- The moderator may also originate his/her own testimonies and contribute to those of the other members.
- All the rules and values ​​of the study groups of _The Urantia Book_ will be respected (respect, empathy, fraternity, order, etc.).
- Participation in the Circle of Trust is, of course, voluntary, both when registering or expressing interest in participating, and when providing testimony or intervention once a session has started.
- The testimonies expressed within the group are confidential and should not leave that environment. What is said in the group stays there. This is an ethical commitment that every member must respect.
- The time allotted for the expression of a testimony is indefinite, it cannot be limited, since the participant must be as calm as possible to express himself. The rest of the companions must listen carefully and do an exercise of empathy in order to, if they wish, contribute to it later. All participants will have the opportunity to contribute testimony. If there is no time in a specific session, it will be in the next ones.
- There may be very valuable testimonies and worthy of being known for the benefit of the Urantia brothers. If any member wishes to make his testimony known outside the circle of trust, he may do so himself (or delegate it to another member) within the channels available to the association (magazine "Luz y Vida", mailing list "El rincón de Urantia", etc.).

**STRUCTURE**

- The sessions will be held via Zoom.
- Depending on the number of participants, the duration of the sessions will be:
	- Ten or more attendees: two hours.
	- Less than ten attendees: one and a half hours.
- Minimum number of participants: five.
- It would be positive to create a specific WhatsApp group for the Circle of Trust to know in advance how many participants there will be in a session. Another function of this WhatsApp group is to give continuity on a day-to-day basis to everything expressed in the sessions.
- Initially, the frequency of these sessions will be 15 days. Later, and depending on demand and participation, it may be weekly.
- Initially, and until a certain threshold of trust is created among the members to generate testimonies, specific topics may be proposed to facilitate participation.

**Those readers who are interested in being part of this group** can write an email to urantiaesp@gmail.com requesting their participation.

The person responsible for this group is Fernando Carazo, a long-time reader of _The Urantia Book_.


## New Study Aid by Hara Davis Now Available in Spanish: Divine Love

<figure id="Figure_15" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left">
<img src="/image/article/Luz_y_Vida/LyV_2024_04/Amor-divino.png" alt="Amor divino" width="350">
</figure>

_Amor divino: La religión de Jesús_, a new Study Aid by Hara Davis, is now available in Spanish. He has been dedicated for many years to summarizing and condensing the teachings of _The Urantia Book_, grouped according to different themes.

In the author's words: “This visual representation of Jesus' coming to this planet is intended to show us how the truths He revealed can help and inspire us to live more meaningful lives with a living faith. By examining Jesus' faith and religion as the son of man and the son of God, we will discover how our own religion can grow and be nourished as a personal experience. Jesus showed us how to live the perfect life. This study aid will explore His selfless love, His living faith, and the ways in which faith and personal religion work together to enhance each other.”
