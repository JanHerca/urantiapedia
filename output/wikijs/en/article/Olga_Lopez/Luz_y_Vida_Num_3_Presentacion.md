- A personal panorama, by Santiago Rodríguez (second part)

## PRESENTATION

Dear friends: here you have the third issue of our newsletter, with the year about to end. We continue with the continuation of Santi's work and with the second part of the article on the Moussa N'Diaye method. Also, as articles “in dialogue”, we include a series of exchange of opinions and reflections born around a question: why, in the organization of the universes, are there positions or functions in which there are no substitutes when those who perform them fail in their task?

The newsletter closes with a brief but very beautiful reflection by José, a reader from the Canary Islands who sent us this text after the publication of the first issue. I hope that many more readers will follow José and be encouraged to contribute to the newsletter by sending drawings, texts, poems, diagrams, etc., inspired by _The Urantia Book_.

As always, we hope you find the content of the newsletter interesting, and we encourage you to participate with your opinions.

Fraternally
