Like most readers of _The Urantia Book_, the fourth part is one of my favorites. Jesus, our Creator Father, Teacher and brother, freed us from the chains of evolutionary religions, and came to teach us the love of Heavenly Father. Jesus should be an inspiration for us to follow. Within our imperfection, we can be perfect like Him. I can imagine it through the description given in the following paragraph:

<br style="clear:both;"/>

> The Master displayed great wisdom and manifested perfect fairness in all of his dealings with his apostles and with all of his disciples. Jesus was truly a master of men; he exercised great influence over his fellow men because of the combined charm and force of his personality. There was a subtle commanding influence in his rugged, nomadic, and homeless life. There was intellectual attractiveness and spiritual drawing power in his authoritative manner of teaching, in his lucid logic, his strength of reasoning, his sagacious insight, his alertness of mind, his matchless poise, and his sublime tolerance. He was simple, manly, honest, and fearless. With all of this physical and intellectual influence manifest in the Master’s presence, there were also all those spiritual charms of being which have become associated with his personality—patience, tenderness, meekness, gentleness, and humility. ([UB 141:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p3_4))

In his farewell speech I find strength and great hope that helps me in my daily life, until the last page of my calendar falls. Here are some of my favorite paragraphs:

> Therefore I give you a new commandment: that you love one another as I have loved you. And if you love one another in this way, everyone will know that you are my disciples. [UB 180:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p1_1)
> 
> «When I invite you to love one another as I have loved you, I am placing before you the supreme measure of true affection, for no one has a greater love than that which gives one's life for one's friends. You are my friends, and you will continue to be my friends if you are willing to do what I have taught you. You have called me Master, but I do not call you servants. Only if you love one another as I love you will you be my friends and I will always tell you what the Father reveals to me. [UB 180:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p1_3)
> 
> “Not only have you chosen me, but I also chose you, and I have commanded you to go out into the world to serve your fellow men out of love just as I have lived among you and revealed the Father to you. The Father and I will work with you and you will experience the divine fullness of joy if only you obey my command to love one another as I have loved you.” [UB 180:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p1_4)

## The vine and the branches

> ““As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Live in my love even as I live in the Father’s love. If you do as I have taught you, you shall abide in my love even as I have kept the Father’s word and evermore abide in his love.””
> 
> ““As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Live in my love even as I live in the Father’s love. If you do as I have taught you, you shall abide in my love even as I have kept the Father’s word and evermore abide in his love.”” ([UB 180:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p2_2))

## The enmity of the world

> "I will not leave you alone in the world. When I am gone I will immediately send you a spiritual helper. You will have someone who will take my place among you, who will continue to teach you the path of truth and who will even comfort you. [UB 180:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p3_3)
> 
> “Do not let your hearts be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in me. Although I have to leave you, I will not be far from you. I have already told you that in my Father's universe there are many dwelling places. If this were not true, I would not have spoken to you so many times about them. I am going to return to those worlds of light that are stations in the Father's heaven to which you will ascend one day. From those places I came to this world, and now the time is near when I must return to my Father's work in the spheres above.” [UB 180:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p3_4)
