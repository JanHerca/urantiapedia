There is no infallible and “turnkey” system for succeeding in your projects. To compensate for this deficiency, here are some principles presented in the form of a cooking recipe for succeeding in your projects (in general) and your life project (in particular).

## The recipe

- Take a good portion of conviction.
- Gently add a large piece of vinaigrette, then,
- Slowly incorporate the necessary price to pay.
- Observe the first stirrings of success. Then let your project simmer over a gentle flame of patience until the desired result is perfect.
- Don't forget to introduce the flavor and value of ethics into your project; it alone allows you to maintain your projects with a common good in mind.
- If you do not have all the ingredients in your reserve, you will certainly find them at the partnership market.


## The main ingredients

1) ***Conviction*** (or the fact of believing, of hoping)

“Faith is the firm conviction of what one hopes for, the demonstration of things not yet seen.” It is almost impossible to begin a project without a certain dose of hope. Let us clarify that this is in no way a blind faith, quite the contrary. There is a form of secular belief which consists of considering a project valid if it is reasonably possible and achievable in a given time. Faith in a transcendence or a spirituality can be helpful, of course, but, in this area, the object of faith is secondary. The essential thing consists in setting in motion the energies essential to “start” the project. The meaning of this project will rest on its ethical aspect...

We believe that “it is necessary to hope in order to undertake and to succeed in order to persevere. Hope against all hope” is the expression of a form of faith, and “the energy of despair” is nothing other than the energy of hope taken to the highest degree. That is to say, the energy of the “will to live”.

Believing in your project is therefore the first ingredient in the recipe that can lead us to success. Conviction is like salt: you don't need to add a lot of it to feel its taste and effects.

2) ***The will***

Will reinforces conviction, because it is common to believe in a project and not want to commit to it. There are several levels to will: from organic will which seeks the means of subsistence, to heroic will through reflective will. A well-constituted will is defined as “Human will is built by the energy of a thought manifesting itself in time by an act with a view to an end.”

3) ***Pay the price***

Everything that requires the use of energy, movement of matter and reflection has a price. In the case of a project, its success is linked to the acceptance of the price to pay. The price is sometimes calculated in money, often in energy and always in time devoted to the realization of this project. Hoping for a result without a price to pay is postulating an effect without a cause.

4) ***Ethics***

Ethics is based on an internal approach that questions the aim of human values in their relationships between oneself and what is other. It is constructed through reflection that confronts discourses and behaviors. Ethics is taking a risk in the direction of good and justice. Its intention is expressed in thought, word and action. Building a project on the foundations of ethics is a sign of moral perfection.

5) ***The partnership***

Partnership allows us to have the resources we lack, in particular to carry out a project. Partnership is a cooperative approach. It is based on an ethical and not simply utilitarian concept of human relations. It is built when several people create relationships to share a timely idea. These actors, different, complementary and free, involve their goodwill in the action in order to achieve a compatible objective using appropriate means.

## The Will

“Human will is constructed by the energy of a thought manifesting itself in time by a free act with a view to an end.” Its five dimensions — thought, — time, — act, — freedom, — an end — must be present in their indicators for the will to be considered full, entire and operative.
1. Thought: it is useless to deliberate on the possible priority of thought over other dimensions:
   - reflective thought: it is thought that stops to examine a chosen object.
   - a conscious thought: because a non-conscious thought relates to the involuntary.
   - a deliberate thought: this human thought has a meaning, a design capable of evolving.
2. Time, the voluntary act is inscribed in time according to a triple understanding: the specific time of the voluntary act is the time of the realization of the action which includes: an objective or chronological time of relations and clocks and a subjective time: of a psychological nature, it is “the duration” varying according to the circumstances.
3. The act, in fact the will only exists through a real act (without which it is only wishful thinking). The act must be:
   - identifiable, the voluntary act must be recognized as the result of a specific action (not chance),
   - a measurable act, this measurement is in reasonable proportion to the act performed,
   - an attributable act, that is to say clearly attributed to the author of the action.
4. Freedom is expressed in the possibility of making choices within the realm of possibility:
   - possible freedom (not being totally determined by internal or external obligations),
   - intentional, because voluntary action is determined by the intention of the author,
   - motivated freedom, this freedom is the capacity to abstain or to carry out unconstrained acts.
5. A finality, because the proper object of the will is the end accepted in all its consequences.
   - a desired end, it must present a practical and concrete consistency.
   - a real end, it is the culmination of an evolutionary process desired by its author.
   - a consented purpose, this acquiescence completes the desired act by integrating it into the actor's experience. This “ideal” conceptual description of the voluntary act is very rarely observed in everyday reality. The facts lead us to consider three levels in the will:
   - _the organic will_: it is the threshold where the involuntary becomes voluntary; it expresses the needs of existence: to live, to reproduce, to feed oneself... Actions are turned towards maintaining the past and tend to reproduce a pleasure or to satisfy a sensual need. This embryo of will pursues an immediate objective, it has an interest in the material and the concrete. It is at work in beings who function according to the impulses of “everything and right away”.
   - _The reflective will_: it has a conceptual existence and a functioning tending towards abstraction. It is a first step towards autonomy, it precedes and accompanies rational activity. Looking towards the future, it integrates the principles of causality, it is often in contradiction, or in tension with the organic will. The reflective will is the faculty of the citizen integrated into his social, family and professional context.
   - _The higher will_: it is the accomplishment and surpassing of organic and reflective wills. It is also the pacified synthesis of lower volitions. The higher will is the harmonious culmination of wanting. It would be the privilege of realized beings having resolved the main psychological contradictions. It joins ethics.

**ETHICS** is a voluntary and perfectible approach. It is part of the long term according to: a right thought, a right word, a right action. It integrates the ultimate mystery of the being participating in life. It is based on an internal approach which questions the aim of human values in their relationships between oneself, others and things. It is constructed by a reflection confronting speeches and behaviors. It is a risk-taking in the direction of good and justice. Its intention is expressed in thought, word and action according to the fundamental principles of: justice, freedom, autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, universality, communication, coherence and transcendence.

_The principle of justice_: it includes theoretical and practical aspects in the material and intellectual domains. It consists of considering the other as we would like to be considered ourselves. To treat our neighbor according to his potential (and not through an isolated act). To be fair in the evaluation of his constraints and needs in relation to those of others.

_The principle of freedom_: it formally applies in personal and public domains: The recognition of the other in his right to be free (to think, to do, to evolve at his own pace...) Non-interference on the person, except in legitimate or urgent cases (respect for private life, for the past). In the granting of the means of these freedoms (as long as it belongs to us).

_The principle of autonomy_: it respects the will of any person who peacefully seeks the general good. In their ability to think and make voluntary choices by prioritizing their own objectives. In their power to express themselves sovereignly without fear of harmful consequences. In their capacity to take independent actions that are consistent with their own wishes.

_The principle of non-maleficence_: it joins the different forms of the “precautionary principle”. It is based on the desire to prevent anything that is considered a danger or violence (for oneself and others.) It ensures that what is presumed to be false, bad and a possible generator of subsequent suffering is avoided. It strives not to harm, not to destroy and not to add harm to harm unnecessarily.

_The principle of beneficence_: it is the duty to do good which tends towards universality, it questions what is thought, said and done: is it beneficial for the individual and society (in the short and long term)? Does what is undertaken generate, a priori, a favorable effect with appropriate means? Does the action (planned or in progress) bring more good than harm (for oneself and others)?

_The principle of universality_: it concerns every human being, without any restriction. Values, speeches and behaviors are applicable to each and every one. It states that any distinction based on race, religion, sex, culture, wealth, etc. is not ethical. It questions every act in its consequences: “What if everyone did the same?”

_The principle of communication with others_: This is appropriate communication and “good faith”. It is cooperation in truthful communication with others and all humans. It is the altruistic quality of communication with others (it aims for the general interest). This relationship is true, sincere, marked by compassion and not just utilitarian.

_The principle of coherence_: It concerns the relationship between the means used and the ends. It states that the end never justifies the means, on the contrary: It considers that the ends exist in germ in the means employed. Coherence seeks to transform the irreducible contradictions of life into manageable tensions.

_The principle of transcendence_: It gives ethics an opening of values towards the infinite and the unspeakable. It bets that the human being is not reduced to the only phenomena that he expresses. This transcendence is part of everyday life, but it goes beyond the “here and now”...

_According to Jean-Armand Hourtal, Doctor of Human Sciences with a degree in medical ethics_
