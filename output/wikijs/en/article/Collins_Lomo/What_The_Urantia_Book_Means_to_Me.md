_By Collins Lomo, associate trustee, Urantia Foundation, Accra, Ghana_

“What were you searching for when you discovered _The Urantia Book_ on the internet?” Whenever I am asked this, I am reminded how easily I could have missed my opportunity to find this awesome revelation. I really don’t remember what I was searching for, but whatever it was, it must have been something special. I could have taken a brief glance at the website before moving on to other things, or perhaps read a few passages and dismissed it as just one of those flaky, oddball isms and cults. But thankfully, curiosity got the best of me on that fateful day!

One thing I can tell you is that I am a curious person. From a young age I’ve questioned things and bombarded my parents with uncomfortable inquiries. In short, I was a constant question mark, even to adulthood. Perhaps this propensity to search for the unusual, the not-so-comfortable—you might even say the weird stuff in life—is what brought me to _The Urantia Book_. Even now, where most people don’t want to look, that is exactly where I want to look. What seems different is what gets my attention. To follow the normal path, to walk the broad way and be at ease—those prospects never arouse my interest and participation.

So, a simple topic or title referencing Adam and Eve, or Melchizedek, or Jesus’ early childhood, or the big one—government on a neighboring planet—would have been all the words and topics I needed to see on my browser to find out what this book had to offer. And that’s where I remain, after 13 years of discovery. Each time I read and share the revelation, I am more and more intrigued by it.

If there is one bit of advice that I’d like to offer to anyone on this strife-torn, confused world—be it my own children, a friend, or a stranger whom I chance upon—it would be this: _Don’t settle!_

Be eager to know about more than just the causes and effects of commonplace events and phenomena.

Let your little piece of this life be an unforgettable one. Save nothing for another day. Leave nothing to chance. Become your own miracle. Live, and live _for_ something. Live the planetary mortal life with the mind and perspective of the next.

> Peace in this life, survival in death, perfection in the next life, service in eternity—all these are achieved (in spirit) _now_ when the creature personality consents—chooses—to subject the creature will to the Father’s will. And already has the Father chosen to make a fragment of himself subject to the will of the creature personality. [UB 111:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p5_4)

I live this short material life in such a way that when I eventually awaken on the mansion worlds and I’m afforded the chance to look back at what my sojourn on earth was all about, I’ll be proud knowing I left nothing to chance, that I lived my full potential in the faith and discovery of the grandeur of eternal life in every moment.

This perception is what drives my passion and energy to share the fifth epochal revelation on this planet and to be dedicated to its service until I receive a new form and enlarged perception on the worlds ahead to resume the quest of fostering the fatherhood of God and brotherhood of man.
