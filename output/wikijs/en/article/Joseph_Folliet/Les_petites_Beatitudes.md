**“For God’s humor”**

Blessed are those who know how to laugh at themselves.
They haven't finished having fun.

Blessed are those who can distinguish a mountain from a molehill.
They will be spared a lot of hassle.

Blessed are those who are able to rest and sleep without making excuses. They will become wise.
Blessed are those who know how to be silent and listen.

They will learn new things.
Blessed are those who are intelligent enough not to take themselves seriously. They will be appreciated by those around them.

Happy are you if you know how to look at small things seriously and at serious things peacefully.
You will go far in life.

Happy are you if you know how to admire a smile and forget a grimace, your life will be sunny.

Happy are you if you are able to always interpret the attitudes of others with kindness, even if appearances are contrary.
You will seem naive, but charity comes at a price.

Blessed are you if you know how to keep quiet and smile, even when someone interrupts you, contradicts you or steps on your toes.
The gospel begins to penetrate your heart.

Blessed above all are you who know how to recognize the Lord in all those you meet. You have found the true light, you have found true wisdom.

Joseph Folliet
