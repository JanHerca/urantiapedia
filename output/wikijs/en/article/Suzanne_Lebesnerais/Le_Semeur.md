<p style="text-align:center;">
<i>The Sun illuminated the plain;</i><br>
<i>A man was happily walking along the path:</i><br>
<i>He went to the fields, and many seeds</i><br>
<i>Filled the bag he was holding in his hand.</i><br>
<br>
<i>He sang, and his step, marking the cadence,</i><br>
<i>Seemed to accentuate the harshness of the singing</i><br>
<i>Who spoke of battles, of soldiers, of bravery,</i><br>
<i>Fertile furrows to submerge with blood....</i><br>
<br>
<i>Suddenly, images danced before his eyes:</i><br>
<i>Those suggested by the lugubrious song...</i><br>
<i>Then he saw big, heavy, black clouds</i><br>
<i>Turn off the Sun shining on the horizon.</i><br>
<br>
<i>The countryside, darkened, appeared tragic,</i><br>
<i>Dug in many places by devouring chasms</i><br>
<i>Where they came to be swallowed up, driven by panic,</i><br>
<i>Men of all ages, women, children!</i><br>
<br>
<i>And the man jumped: he had just understood</i><br>
<i>What was monstrous about this war song,</i><br>
<i>And he whose simple heart was loving and tender</i><br>
<i>Had repeated the horrible words so many times!</i><br>
<br>
<i>When he was in his field, bowing to the earth</i><br>
<i>To sow the seeds he had brought,</i><br>
<i>He knelt down, praying for brothers</i><br>
<i>They were quickly enlightened in turn!!</i><br>
<br>
<i>For they all uttered a terrible blasphemy</i><br>
<i>By repeating this song, unworthy of humans...</i><br>
<i>What will we reap if we always don't sow</i><br>
<i>Only fierce hatred and never the good grain?</i><br>
<br>
<i>So, with love, he threw the seed</i><br>
<i>In the deep furrows that he had prepared:</i><br>
<i>The Sun reappeared in its magnificence,</i><br>
<i>Caressing the Universe with its golden rays!</i><br>
</p>
