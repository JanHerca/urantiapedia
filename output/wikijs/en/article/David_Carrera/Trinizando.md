All human beings who have children agree that this is one of the most wonderful experiences in life. Also an enormous responsibility, since the education and affection received during childhood largely mark the rest of the earthly life of these children.

Sometimes we speak of “creating” a life, but wise parents know that by having such a child, God has used them to bring this new being into existence.

_The Urantia Book_ allows us to fine-tune and recreate ourselves in that fascination that is life: Now the parents know that they have helped to bring into existence a new being with the potential of ascension to the very gates of Paradise and with the potential of meeting their Creator. From that child, his biology is inherited from his parents through models contained in the evolutionary programs that have been implanted by the Life Carriers, decided by Miguel de Nebadon and with the authorization of the Eternal Son. That child will live immersed in some archetypes of energy, matter and mind deployed by the Infinite Spirit through the mediation of Master Spirit number seven, the one that brings together features of the three persons of the Trinity, and with the intervention of the Mother Spirit of our Local Universe. That child will receive two direct gifts from the Universal Father; the personality, whose most outstanding feature will be the presence of will, and the Spirit, with whom he will be able to identify himself to the degree that he chooses through that same will. Personality and Spirit will configure the Soul, that which is properly its own for the first time and that survives this first stage.

With this perspective, conscious parents are grateful to have only part of the role in relation to the CREATION of this life. In this world, which is like a cosmic kindergarten, we have adequate and sufficient responsibility. It is a rule of universal equilibrium that beings have at all times degrees of freedom that are comparable to the degrees of responsibility displayed.

And, in this world, our degree of freedom to CREATE, truly CREATE something by ourselves, is limited to great buildings, inspiring books, beautiful dances, sure bridges, insightful philosophy, automated machines, suggestive music, functional furniture, just laws. , great art, wonderful poetry... and a few other things, which have in common to stick to the domain of the material or the mental.

As our progress continues, we accumulate experiences and succeed in various tests that await us, that is, as we have demonstrated a greater degree of awareness and responsibility, our degrees of freedom to intervene in the creation of new realities will increase. And when we are already in Paradise, well fused with the Adjuster and we distinguish ourselves in the Finalitary Body, we will have the opportunity to CREATE or at least intervene with a huge degree of involvement in the creation of some very special beings that will be called Trinitized Sons of Perfection. (<a id="a51_574"></a>[UB 22:1.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/22#p1_12)), of which EACH ONE of them will be the EMBODIMENT of an ORIGINAL AND SELECT CONCEPT until then without being trinitized.

They will be much more than the “ordinary” “final degree projects” or “doctorates” that we know here, they will imply an enormous effort and determination in a project chosen by us and with no guarantee of success, to the point that if we fail we will go on to form part of a special group of finaliters, “_those who have made the ultimate effort and endured the ultimate disappointment_”

Be that as it may, “_all trinity-creature beings are endowed with personality by the Universal Father_”, but the initiative to embark on this unique adventure that will consist of GIVING IDENTITY to A CONCEPT will be ours. It will be a project that we can try with another being with an ascending career like ours, or with a “Paradise” or a “Havonian.” After a lot of work or effort, it may happen that that feat receives the embrace of the Trinity, with which the Trinitized Son-Creature of which we speak will result.

Depending on whether we forge the project with another ascendant being or with a native of Havona or Paradise, the resulting creature will go on to serve in one of the Superuniverses or will go on to be in charge of the Architects of the Master Universe, because "those new children of ours” may be so special that their reason for existence may not yet belong to this evolutionary moment of the Universe (!) Incredible. They are both Children of Time and Children of Eternity.

We present the project to the Deities, and if the fruit of that commitment receives the Trinitarian embrace, if we manage to “_make the paradisiacal effort of spiritualizing, idealizing and realizing the original and select concept that we have previously chosen_”, we will not only have been involved with greater merit in the CREATION of a creature, but as a result a kind of fusion will take place between the parents that seems taken from the most beautiful romantic story: the two parents become in a certain sense and spiritually one. “One at the Ultimate functional level” “_No created being in the universe can fully explain this amazing phenomenon; it is an almost divine experience_”.

The question is: How many and what types of ideas or ideals are we capable of imagining RIGHT NOW that they may have in their day or have already had an incarnation as a Trinitized Son? Shall we play “concretize” a bit, even at the risk of blurting out something ridiculous? What range of coverage may have that idea or ideal to consider?

Let's take a look; the children that we may have as finaliters (creature triune children), if they prove to be of sufficient merit or utility, can receive a new embrace from the Trinity (double triune beings) through which the Trinity will turn these creatures into an invaluable help for ALL the administrators of the superuniverses, by representing IN THEMSELVES ALL the accumulated knowledge that EXISTS in ALL Creation about SAID concept!

If the Trinization experience is going to be something that every ascending being of the Finalitary Corps can attempt, that means that there must be millions and millions of DIFFERENT ideas or ideals that are WORTHY of being embodied in a Trinization process.

The Revealers keep repeating to us that the mind we have is still tremendously limited. We know that as soon as we enter the morontia milieu we will feel that our ability to philosophize will acquire a new dimension by becoming receptive to new senses, to new meanings, to new cosmic realities... and with it, to new ideas and ideals.

We can say that our “philosophical sensibility” here is “monophonic” or coming from only one point, while on awakening in the morontia worlds it becomes “stereophonic” and also with an enormous sensitivity to nuances.

How many ideas and ideals could we ALREADY imagine that could find trinization? Let's play? Do we all make a list so that we can get a notion of what we are talking about?

Because... some ideal that we could come up with in this life will have been trilled, I say, right? What is your opinion?

For example; today, a key ideal of the human being is “Peace”. But “Peace” is something very generic. Will there be in the entire great Universe a single Trinitized Son that represents Peace? Or will there be a Trinitized Son that represents Peace for each local universe, or for each world, or for each relationship between peoples/ethnic groups/races?

The condition seems to be that it be a <ins>divine idea</ins>, or some <ins>universal ideal</ins>, which has never before been conceived, expressed or trinitized. (<a id="a77_164"></a>[UB 22:10.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/22#p10_4)) Therefore, material projects of the type:

- Suitability of semiconductor materials in material worlds.

- Viable feeding programs in desert areas of material worlds

- The mechanism of empathy between material minds.

- Fractal mathematics (?) (ideas)

I think that for these four examples the Technical Advisors could already be there.

Other examples that we can think of and therefore could meet the conditions do seem more “divine” and “universal”... let's see this hypothetical list:

- Intelligent peace between towns (?) (ideal)

- Environmental balance (i?) (ideal)

- [Forms of] Loyalty to the Creator Son (could it be?)

- Adolescent psychology (?) (idea)

- Ethics applicable to genetic engineering (?) (ideal)

- Couple relations (?) (ideal)

- ... (so that we can continue together)

A list without great pretensions, which allows us to open our minds a bit. Giving examples, ideas or concrete ideals, surely it is good for all of us to know a little about what we are talking about. A list for us, as is. Things that we can already imagine. Surely, “when we are already up”, we will talk about all these trinitizable ideas or ideals that occur to us with the added tagline of “in mortal worlds”. :smile:

Or, perhaps, someone will show us that shots don't go around here.

I do not rule out anything.

Thus, the debate on a fascinating topic remains open.
