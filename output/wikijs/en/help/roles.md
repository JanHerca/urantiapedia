If you want to collaborate on this project, the best way to contact us is by email at urantiapedia@gmail.com. Send a message stating your interest in the project and the Administrators will give you access.

Another way that will be available soon is through registration on the website [Blue Fields](https://blue-fields.netlify.app/), which is a website that has been created to unite and organize readers of *The Urantia Book* who wish to participate in intelligent, purposeful, and altruistic projects around the world. Once registered, the project team will contact you. The Urantiapedia project on Blue Fields can be accessed here: [Urantiapedia on Blue Fields](https://blue-fields.netlify.app/projects/292396532506821125). However, this website is not 100% operational, so contact via email is recommended.

The profiles we are looking for to collaborate are these:

## “Administrator” profile

*Administrators* are responsible for maintaining the web server, configuring the website, and bulk uploading data. They are the only ones allowed to edit everything, including *The Urantia Book*, *The Bible*, and other specific content. Check more in [Admin help](/en/help/admin).

* They have an account in this with admin permissions, and another in [GitHub](https://github.com/).
* They can add content both through this website (without restrictions) as well as through the two Urantiapedia projects on GitHub: [Urantiapedia](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia) and [Urantiapedia-backup](https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia-backup). They can do bulk load of changes using the second project.
* The task will be to manage the server and the website.

*Editors-in-Chief* can also contribute content through this site and GitHub, just like Administrators. However, they do not manage the site, they do not have all the editing capabilities of an Administrator, such as *The Urantia Book*, *The Bible*, and some other sensitive content, and through GitHub they can only make pull requests, never direct changes. Check [Editors-in-Chief help](/en/help/github).

However, only pull requests can be made through these projects. Changes to unauthorized content on GitHub will be rejected upon submission.
