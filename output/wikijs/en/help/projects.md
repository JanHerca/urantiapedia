_Urantiapedia_ is "only" **a shared effort** with many other projects for the dissemination of the _Fifth Epochal Revelation_. It aims to provide several projects within a much larger context. We believe that these projects are necessary and essential to facilitate the current generation of readers and future generations a broad understanding of this extensive and complex revelation.

It is evident that the last epochal revelation has been given to us in an unusual way. The usual way of sending a great revelation to the inhabited worlds has always been to send a bearer of that revelation, a person or persons who by their incarnation and life example have left a revelatory message, usually a life example rather than a collection of writings. The Fifth Epochal Revelation, however, takes the form of a written text, and that doubtless has important implications. We are limited by language and format barriers as to the content of this revelation. We do not have in this revelation the life example of an incarnated celestial personality.

It is inevitable and even necessary that this written format evolve into a multitude of other formats that allow for a better dissemination and understanding of this text. With this objective, many readers, from the first moment of publication and even before[^1], have created additional projects based on _The Urantia Book_. It is within this **great shared effort** that _Urantiapedia_ is framed. The table below is a sample of other projects that have either already been undertaken, or are currently in progress, or have been formulated as an idea but have not been put into action. From here we want to encourage the community of readers of _The Urantia Book_ to observe these projects as a possible goal for their altruistic collaboration with the purpose of achieving the greatest possible dissemination of these wonderful revelations.

The list in the table offers the name of the project that we consider of great interest for the dissemination of the _Fifth Revelation_, its promoter along with the languages ​​in which the product was published, as well as the contributions to that list by _Urantiapedia_, either as a promoter or as a user of other products.

As can be seen from the table, the list includes 24 major projects, and _Urantiapedia_ is involved in the direct production of 8 of those projects, possibly the largest contribution currently being made in this field. Still, we want to emphasize that _Urantiapedia_ is just a drop of water in an ocean of **present and future efforts** that must be made to achieve the greatest and best possible dissemination of the extraordinary revelations of _The Urantia Book_. With the help of our invisible friends and a lot of patience, it will be achieved, without a doubt. :wink:
