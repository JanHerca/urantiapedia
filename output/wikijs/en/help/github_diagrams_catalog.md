Here is how to create a catalog of _The Urantia Book_ diagrams.

## Process

The process is identical to the one explained for articles. See [Creating an Article Catalog](/en/help/github_articles_catalog). The provisional list of diagrams can be found here: [Planned diagrams](/en/index/diagrams).

To edit that list, you can do it in two ways:

- Log in here at _Urantiapedia_. Go to the list of diagrams: [Planned diagrams](/en/index/diagrams). Put the page in edition in the _Page actions > Edit_ menu in the upper right button panel. A simple Markdown editor will open where you can edit the listing. (IMPORTANT: to be able to do this you need an Administrator to enable editing permissions on that page.)
- In the GitHub project modify this file: `/output/wikijs/en/index/diagrams.md`. To modify it you can simply download that file or the entire project from GitHub. See the [Assistant Editors Help](/en/help/github_assistant) for how to download things from GitHub.

In either of the two previous cases, the file to be edited is a very simple Markdown file where for each diagram the following must be included, in the form of a table:

- A `:white_square_button:` flag indicating that the diagram has not yet been created.
- Title.
- The author.
- Some optional labels that categorize the diagram.
- The URL from where that diagram can be downloaded.

For example:

```
| Status                | Title                              | Author  | Tags  | URL                               |
| ----------------------| -----------------------------------| --------| ----- | --------------------------------- |
| :white_square_button: | "The Kingdom of Heaven Revelation" |         |       | http://www.universalfather.info/  |
```

## Sending files

If you have modified the listing from the file on GitHub, you have two options for committing your changes: 1) if you are a “Chief Editor” use GitHub as detailed in the [Chief Editors Help](/en/help/github); if you are an “Assistant Editor”, you can simply send that modified Markdown file to any Administrator's email or to urantiapedia@gmail.com.
