## Who is this manual for?

This manual is for "Developers", or users that comply with these requirements:
- registered users with an account on [Blue Fields](https://blue-fields.netlify.app/), on [Urantiapedia](https://urantiapedia.org) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
- authorized as project collaborators by the team that runs the project on [Blue Fields](https://blue-fields.netlify.app/) platform.
- with a good knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

## GitHub workflow

The process is the usual GitHub workflow:
1. "Developer" creates a *fork* (a copy in its own account) of *Urantiapedia* project on GitHub (https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia) for developing in *Urantiapedia Tools*, or creates a *fork* of Wiki.js (https://github.com/Requarks/wiki) for developing in *Wiki.js*.
2. "Developer" creates a local copy of the project on PC. The local copy must be of the latest version of the master branch. This is done first through a *clone* action and later through *pulls* actions to the project, that downloads any change to the local copy.
3. "Developer" makes changes in the local copy and commmits to it.
4. "Developer" sends changes to GitHub through a *push*. 
5. For *Urantiapedia Tools*, as it is an owned repo it is possible to do a *pull request* from GitHub website. In case of *Wiki.js*, as it is owned by a third party, it is needed to create a *merge* in the this *fork* https://github.com/JanHerca/wiki to centralize *pull requests* to Wiki,js *upstream* when it is needed and to coordinate developments.
6. *Pull requests* are reviewed by authorized developers, in charge of doing a *merge* in the master branch of all changes that are OK. Any invalid change is rejected and is notified for a fix.
7. When changes are made to Wiki.js and are OK we can proceed to launch a new version of the server. This task is done by "Admins".
8. The process is repeated as many times as needed, returning to point 3.
