## About Urantiapedia

[Urantiapedia](https://urantiapedia.org) is a collaborative website based on [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki/) with the purpose of being a unified center for the dissemination of all knowledge regarding *The Urantia Book*.

## About registering on Urantiapedia and Blue Fields

If you want to collaborate on this project, the best way to contact us is by email at urantiapedia@gmail.com. Send a message stating your interest in the project and the Administrators will give you access.

Another way that will be available soon is through registration on the website [Blue Fields](https://blue-fields.netlify.app/), which is a website that has been created to unite and organize readers of *The Urantia Book* who wish to participate in intelligent, purposeful, and altruistic projects around the world. Once registered, the project team will contact you. The Urantiapedia project on Blue Fields can be accessed here: [Urantiapedia on Blue Fields](https://blue-fields.netlify.app/projects/292396532506821125). However, this website is not 100% operational so contact via email is recommended.

## About GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a platform for version control in collaborative projects, especially code or web content projects.

The *Urantiapedia* project on GitHub (https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia) is a project that contains all of the content of the website, as well as an application (*Urantiapedia Tools*) to help automate content creation. The *Urantiapedia-backup* project (https://github.com/JanHerca/urantiapedia-backup) is the mechanism used to be able to perform mass uploads of content.

## Who is this manual for?

This manual is intended for users * administrators*, or *admins*, that is:
- users registered on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
- users authorized as *admins* by the team that runs the Urantiapedia project.
- registered users on Urantiapedia. Only another *admin* user can register a user as *admin*.
- users with knowledge of Linux, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Kubernetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes), [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/).
- users with knowledge of *The Urantia Book* in at least one language in which it is published, and preferably with a good command of the English version.
- users who wish to selflessly collaborate in the incorporation of information related to *The Urantia Book* in *Urantiapedia*.

The web administrators are the only ones in charge of uploading massive changes to the *Urantiapedia* website during each of the project phases. More about the project phases at [Help start](/en/help/phases).

## GitHub Workflow

The GitHub workflow is detailed in the Urantiapedia GitHub Project User Manual. You should start by taking a look at [Getting started on GitHub](/en/help/github_fork) and then continue from there with the rest of the steps and options for working on GitHub.

This is the complete index of the manual:
- [Getting started with GitHub](/en/help/github_fork)
- Working on GitHub:
  - [Working directly from the GitHub website](/en/help/github_edit_on_web)
  - Working locally on GitHub:
    - [Setting up your GitHub project](/en/help/github_setting)
    - [Working locally on your PC](/en/help/github_edit_local)
- [GitHub project content](/en/help/github_content)
- [Workflow for creating initial content in a language](/en/help/github_initial_flow)

## Collaboration through this website

Due to the risks it entails, this type of collaboration is reserved for *Administrators* and *Editors-in-Chief* users. The former can edit any content; in the case of the latter, they will only have editing access to certain sections.

In this case, all tasks are performed through this website. It is necessary to log in with the editing account provided, and follow the manuals on how to make edits:
- [Urantiapedia Interface and Basic Use](/en/help/web_basics)
- [Managing Pages](/en/help/web_pages)
- [Using Editors](/en/help/web_editors)
  - [Using the Visual Editor](/en/help/web_visual_editor)
  - [Using the Markdown Editor](/en/help/web_markdown_editor)
  - [Using the HTML Editor](/en/help/web_html_editor)
