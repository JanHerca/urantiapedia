Here it is described how to obtain the articles of readers related to _The Urantia Book_, and that have been cataloged following the task [Creating an article catalog](/en/help/github_articles_catalog).

## Process

Everything said about books in [Getting “source” books](/en/help/github_sourcebooks_markdown) also applies here. The articles can be found in the form of a web page that already hosts them, as a PDF without text, or as a PDF with text. They can also be individually or as part of a magazine or joint publication with other articles. In any case, the first step is to convert that magazine to Markdown format.

This task, carried out with different software depending on the case, has already been done in part with a good collection of articles, which are available on GitHub in `/input/markdown/en/Innerface` and `/input/markdown/en/Herald` for two well-known publications related to _The Urantia Book_, the *Innerface International* and the *Fellowship Herald*. The article catalog is already built for these publications here: [Planned Articles](/en/index/articles).

The task now is to use the content of the aforementioned folders and build the individual articles, since in those folders there are complete magazines.

### Structure of articles in Urantiapedia

If you are a “Editor-in-Chief” and will be using the GitHub platform, articles should be saved in these GitHub project folders: `/output/wikijs/en/article` for English articles, `/output/wikijs/es/article` for articles in Spanish, etc. Within these folders we will create another one, if it does not exist, with the author's name (with blank spaces replaced by underscores). Finally, inside the author's folder, we will create a Markdown file to which we will give a unique name following this criteria:
  - The name will use the title of the article but as abbreviated as possible.
  - The name will always be in English, so if the original article is not in English, the title is translated.
  - Blank spaces are replaced by underscores.
  - Special characters like colons or exclamations are removed.
  - For example, if the title of an article is *Time for More Change? Symbols, Cults, and The Urantia Book* a possible file name would be `Time_for_More_Change_Symbols_Cults.md`. If the title is *Jerusalén en tiempos de Jesús* (Spanish), the file would be `Jerusalem_in_Jesus_times.md`.

If you are an “Assistant Editor” and you are not going to use the GitHub platform to send files, simply create any folder on your PC in which to leave the articles you create. Then when you send your work to an Administrator he or she will take care of creating the correct folders.

An example of a finished article can be seen at `/output/wikijs/en/article/Ann_Bendall/Adam_an_Eve.md`.

### Basic format of an article on Urantiapedia

The format to use is Markdown, which is extremely simple to give styling compared to other alternatives.

The “Assistant Editor” should review the text and add the following:
- A header in each file.
- Immediately below the header, an indication of the author.
- Section marks within the article.
- Correct paragraphs.
- Bold and italics.
- Quotes.
- Images.
- References to images.
- Footnotes.
- Tables.
- Mathematical formulas or characters in scientific notation.

All these items have already been explained when talking about how to format book chapters: [Get “source” books](/en/help/github_sourcebooks_markdown). All the hints given there also apply here in the case of articles.

## Sending files

If you are a “Editor-in-Chief” using GitHub you can submit articles as detailed in [Editors-in-Chief Help](/en/help/github); if you are an “Assistant Editor”, you can simply send the Markdown files to any Administrator's email or to urantiapedia@gmail.com.
