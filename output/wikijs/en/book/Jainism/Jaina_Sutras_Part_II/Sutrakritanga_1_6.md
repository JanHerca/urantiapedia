SIXTH LECTURE, CALLED PRAISE OF MAHÂVÎRA.

<i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>as and Brâhma<i>n</i>as, householders and heretics, have asked (me): Who is he that proclaimed this unrivalled truly wholesome Law, which was (put forward) with true knowledge [^847]? (1)

What was the knowledge, what the faith, and what the conduct of the <i>G</i><i>ñ</i>ât<i>ri</i>putra? If you know it truly, O monk, tell us as you have heard it, as it was told you! (2)

This wise and clever great sage possessed infinite knowledge and infinite faith. Learn and think about the Law and the piety of the glorious man who lived before our eyes [^848]! (3)

This wise man had explored all beings, whether they move or not, on high, below, and on earth, as well as the eternal and transient things. Like a lamp he put the Law in a true light. (4)

He sees everything; his knowledge has got beyond (the four lower stages) [^849]; he has no impurity; he is virtuous, of a fixed mind, the highest, the <span id="p288"><sup><small>[ p. 288 ]</small></sup></span> wisest in the whole world; he has broken from all ties; he is above danger and the necessity to continue life [^850]. (5)

Omniscient, wandering about without a home, crossing the flood (of the Sa<i>m</i>sâra), wise, and of an unlimited perception, without an equal, he shines forth (or he does penance) like the sun, and he illumines the darkness like a brilliant fire, (6)

The omniscient [^851] sage, Kâ<i>s</i>yapa, has proclaimed this highest Law of the <i>G</i>inas; he, the illustrious one, is prominent (among men) like the thousand-eyed Indra among the gods of heaven. (7)

His knowledge is inexhaustible like the (water of the) sea; he has no limits and is pure like the great ocean; he is free from passion, unfettered, and brilliant like <i>S</i>akra, the lord of the gods. (8)

By his vigour he is the most vigorous; as Sudar<i>s</i>ana (Mêru), the best of all mountains, or as heaven, a very mine of delight, he shines forth endowed with many virtues. (9)

(Mêru) a hundred thousand yô<i>g</i>anas high, with three tiers [^852], with the Pa<i>n</i><i>d</i>aga (-wood) as its flag, rising ninety-nine thousand yô<i>g</i>anas above the ground, and reaching one thousand below it; (lo)

It touches the sky and is immersed in the earth; round it revolve the suns [^853]; it has the colour of gold, and contains many Nandana (parks) [^854]; on it the Mahêndras enjoy themselves. (11)

<span id="p289"><sup><small>[ p. 289 ]</small></sup></span>

This mountain is distinguished by (many) names; it has the colour of burnished gold; it is the greatest of all mountains, difficult to ascend on account of its rocks; this excellent mountain is like a part of the earth on fire. (12)

The king of mountains, standing in the centre of the earth, is seen in a pure light [^855] like that of the sun. With such beauty shines forth this many-coloured, lovely (mountain), which is crowned with radiance. (13)

Thus is described the glory of mount Sudar<i>s</i>ana, the great mountain; similar to it is the <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a <i>G</i><i>ñ</i>ât<i>ri</i>putra, who is noble, glorious, full of faith, knowledge, and virtue. (14)

As Nishadha [^856] is the best of long-stretched mountains, and Ru<i>k</i>aka of circular ones, so is he (Mahâvîra) among sages the wisest in the world, according to the declaration of the wise ones. (15)

After having taught the highest Law he practised the highest contemplation [^857], which is the purest of pure, pure without a flaw, thoroughly white (as it were) like mother-of-pearl and the moon. (16)

Having annihilated all his Karman, the great sage by his knowledge, virtue, and faith reached <span id="p290"><sup><small>[ p. 290 ]</small></sup></span> the insurpassable, highest perfection, a state which has a beginning but no end. (17)

As the <i>S</i>âlmalî, in which the Supar<i>n</i>a [^858] gods take their delight, is most famous among trees, as Nandana is among parks, so is the Omniscient most famous through his knowledge and virtue. (18)

As thunder is the loudest of sounds, as the moon is the most glorious of heavenly bodies, as sandal is the best of perfumes, so of monks is he who had renounced all wishes or plans. (19)

As (the ocean on which sleeps) Svayambhû is the best of seas, as Dhara<i>n</i>êndra is the best of Nâgas, as the juice of sugarcane is, as it were, the flag of juices, so is he (Mahâvîra) the flag of monks by his austerities. (20)

As Airâva<i>n</i>a is the best of elephants, the lion of beasts, Gaṅgâ of rivers, as Garuda, Vê<i>n</i>udêva [^859], is the best of birds, so is <i>G</i><i>ñ</i>ât<i>ri</i>putra the best of those who have taught the Nirvâ<i>n</i>a. (21)

As Vishvaksêna [^860] is the most famous of warriors, as the lotus is the best of flowers, as Dantavakra is the best of Kshattriyas, so Vardhamâna is the best of sages. (22)

As giving safety is the best of gifts, as the best of true speeches is that which causes no distress, <span id="p291"><sup><small>[ p. 291 ]</small></sup></span> as chastity is the highest of austerities, so is the <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a <i>G</i><i>ñ</i>ât<i>ri</i>putra the highest of men. (23)

As the Lavasaptamas [^861] are the highest of those gods who live very long, as the palace Saudharman is the best of heavenly abodes, as Nirvâ<i>n</i>a is the chief object of the Law, so there is no wiser man than <i>G</i><i>ñ</i>ât<i>ri</i>putra. (24)

He (bears everything) like the earth; he annihilates (his Karman); he is free from greed; he, the Omniscient, does not keep store (of anything); he has crossed the ocean of life like the sea: he, the Hero, who grants protection to all, and whose perception is infinite. (25)

Having conquered the passions which defile the soul: wrath, pride, deceit, and greed, the Arhat, the great sage, does not commit any wrong, nor does he cause it to be committed. (26)

He understood the doctrines of the Kriyâvâdins, of the Akriyâvâdins, of the Vainayikas, and of the A<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>ânavâdins [^862]; he had mastered all philosophical systems, and he practised control as long as he lived. (27)

He abstained [^863] from women, and from eating at night, he practised austerities for the removal of pain, he knew this world and that beyond; the lord renounced [^863] everything at every time. (28)

Having heard and believing in the Law, which <span id="p292"><sup><small>[ p. 292 ]</small></sup></span> has been proclaimed and taught by the Arhat, and has been demonstrated with arguments, people will either make an end of their mundane existence, or they will become like Indra, the king of gods. (29)

Thus I say.

## Footnotes

[^853]: 287:1 The question is supposed to be addressed by <i>G</i>ambûsvâmin to Sudharman.

[^854]: 287:2 <i>K</i>akkhupahê <i>th</i>iyassa = <i>k</i>akshu<i>h</i>pathê sthitasya, literally, ‘who stood (or stands) in the path of the eyes.’ We are scarcely entitled to infer from this phrase that the author had actually seen Mahâvîra as tradition would make us believe.

[^855]: 287:3 Abhibhûya-nâ<i>n</i>î. Concerning the five stages or kinds of knowledge, see above, [p. 352](Sutrakritanga_2_1#p352). The Kêvala knowledge is intended.

[^856]: 288:1 To render anâyu<i>h</i>.

[^857]: 288:2 Âsupanna = â<i>s</i>upra<i>g</i><i>ñ</i>a, literally, ‘quickly witted;’ the word is usually explained by kêvalin.

[^858]: 288:3 Ka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, one of stone, one of gold, and one of turquoise.

[^859]: 288:4 As is well known the <i>G</i>ainas assume a plurality of suns.

[^860]: 288:5 The names of these four parks are, according to the commentary, p. 289 <i>S</i>âlavana, Nandanavana, Saumanasavana, and Pa<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka (or Pâ<i>n</i><i>d</i>uka) vana. The first is at the foot of Mêru, the second 500 yô<i>g</i>anas above it, the third 62,000 above the second, and the fourth 36,000 above the last, i.e. at the very top.

[^861]: 289:1 Suddha-lessê = <i>s</i>uddhalê<i>s</i>ya. Here lê<i>s</i>yâ is equal to tê<i>g</i>as.

[^862]: 289:2 Nishadha and Ru<i>k</i>aka are two fabulous chains of mountains situated beyond <i>G</i>ambûdvîpa.

[^863]: 289:3 This is the <i>s</i>ukla dhyâna. As <i>s</i>ukla, which I translate ‘pure,’ originally means white,' the comparison with the moon is natural in the original.

[^864]: 290:1 They belong to the Bhavanapatis, see above, [p. 225](Uttaradhyayana_36#p225).

[^865]: 290:2 The commentator says that Vê<i>n</i>udêva is another name of Garu<i>d</i>a. Vê<i>n</i>u stands perhaps for ve<i>n</i>hu = vish<i>n</i>u; but I do not know that Garu<i>d</i>a ever was directly identified with Vish<i>n</i>u.

[^866]: 290:3 Vîsasêna. Vishvaksêna is a name of K<i>ri</i>sh<i>n</i>a. The commentators make Vi<i>s</i>vasêna of Vîsase<i>n</i>a, and seem to take it as a synonym of <i>k</i>akravartin or universal monarch. Dantavakra is mentioned in my ‘Ausgewählte Erzählungen,’ p. 35, line 36.

[^867]: 291:1 The commentator identifies them with the fifth class of Anuttara gods (see Uttarâdhyayana XXXVI, 215, above p. 227), and explains the name by saying if they lived seven lavas longer, they would reach perfection.’

[^868]: 291:2 Concerning these four principal heresies see note on Uttarâdhyayana XVIII, 23, above p. 83.

[^870]: 291:3 Vâriya, literally ‘forbade.’
