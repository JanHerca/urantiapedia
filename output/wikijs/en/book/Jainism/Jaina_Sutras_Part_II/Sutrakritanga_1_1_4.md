FOURTH CHAPTER.

These (philosophers) who are vanquished (by their passions) cannot help you in cases where a sinner perishes [^715]; though having given up their former occupations they will give advice in worldly matters. (1)

A wise monk who fully appreciates this, should not mix with those (heretics); without conceit and not attached to them a sage should lead a life equally removed (from love and hate). (2)

Some say that those who own possessions and engage in undertakings (may reach perfection); but a monk should take his refuge to those who neither own possessions nor engage in undertakings. (3)

A wise man should beg food which has been <span id="p247"><sup><small>[ p. 247 ]</small></sup></span> prepared (for somebody else), and he should accept what is freely given him, without greed and passions; he should abstain from overbearing behaviour [^716]. (4)

He should know the talk of people: some say things which are the outcome of a wrong understanding and are but opinions of others repeated. (5)

‘The world is boundless and eternal, it exists from eternity and does not perish [^717]; (another) bold philosopher [^718] says that the world is limited, but eternal. (6)

‘Some say that the knowledge (of the highest authority) is unlimited; but the same bold philosopher says that it is limited in every way [^719].’ (7)

Some beings have motion, others not; it depends on certain conditions whether they are in the one state or in the other. (8)

(E. g. big creatures) have one form of bodily existence and then another [^720]. But all are subject to pain; hence they should not be killed. (9)

This is the quintessence of wisdom: not to kill anything. Know this to be the legitimate conclusion <span id="p248"><sup><small>[ p. 248 ]</small></sup></span> from the principle of the reciprocity with regard to non-killing [^721]. (10)

Living (according to the rules of conduct), and without greed, one should take care of the highest good [^722].

In walking, in sitting and lying down, and in food and drink: with regard to these three points a monk should always control himself.

And he should leave off pride [^723], wrath [^724], deceit [^725], and greed [^726]. (11, 12)

Possessing the Samitis and being protected by the five Sa<i>m</i>varas, a pious monk should live, till he reaches perfection, as a man free from fetters among those bound in fetters (viz. the householders). (13)

Thus I say.

## Footnotes

[^719]: 246:3 A various reading first commented upon by <i>S</i>îlâṅka is: bâlâ pa<i>n</i><i>d</i>itamâ<i>n</i>i<i>n</i>ô, being ignorant men who fancy themselves learned.

[^720]: 247:1 Omâ<i>n</i>a = apamâna.

[^721]: 247:2 According to <i>S</i>îlâṅka the eternity of things means, with these philosophers, that one thing always retains the same genus or <i>g</i>âti, e.g. that he who was a man in this life will again be a man in the next.

[^722]: 247:3 According to the commentators Vyâsa is intended. The doctrine referred to in the text is that of the Purâ<i>n</i>as.

[^723]: 247:4 The commentators interpret this verse as if not two philosophical opinions but only one was spoken of. Unlimited knowledge is according to them different from omniscience; in the second part of the sentence ‘limited’ refers to the sleep of Brahman during which he is unconscious.

[^724]: 247:5 Men are some time embryos, then young men, then old men.

[^725]: 248:1 Ahi<i>m</i>sâsamaya<i>m</i> = ahi<i>m</i>sâsamatâ<i>m</i>, viz. as you do not wish to be killed, so others do not wish to be killed. The last part of the sentence might also be translated: know this to be the real meaning of the Law (samaya) of ahi<i>m</i>sâ. The same verse recurs I, 11, 10.

[^726]: 248:2 Âdâna, right knowledge, right faith, and right conduct.

[^727]: 248:3 Ukkasa = utkarsha, mâna.

[^728]: 248:4 Gala<i>n</i>a = <i>g</i>valana, krôdha.

[^729]: 248:5 Nûma = mâyâ.

[^730]: 248:6 Ma<i>g</i><i>gh</i>attha = madhyastha, lôbha. Compare the similar expressions in I, 1, 2, 12, above, [p. 241](Sutrakritanga_1_1_2#p241), notes 1-4, and I, 2, 2, 29, below, [p. 257](Sutrakritanga_1_2_2#p257).
