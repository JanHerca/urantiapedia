SECOND CHAPTER.

There are some tender affections which monks cannot easily overcome. On their account some become disheartened, and are unable to practise control. (1)

His relations on seeing him will surround him and cry: 'Child, we have brought you up, (now) support us! O dear! why will you leave us? (2)

‘Child, your father is an old man; your sister is still very young; (and here), O dear, are your own brothers from the same mother; why will you leave us? (3)

‘Support your mother and father, thus you will win this world; it is a duty in this world to protect one's mother. (4)

‘The old people are kind-spoken; your sons, child, are very young; you have married your wife; (take care) that she will not go to another man. (5)

<span id="p264"><sup><small>[ p. 264 ]</small></sup></span>

‘Come, child, let us go home; we can do all the work, you need not (do it); the next time we shall take care (that you will not be overburdened with work); child, let us meanwhile go to our house. (6)

‘Afterwards you may go again; by this (visit of yours) you will not cease to be a <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a; who will hinder you to practise control when you have done with worldly desires [^772]? (7)

‘All your outstanding debts we have divided between us, and we shall give you the money (required for) business.’ (8)

In this way (his relations) come to him, lamenting, and try to persuade him. Held fast by his attachment for his relations, he quickly returns to his house. (9)

As a creeper encircles a tree growing in the forest, so his relations press him hard that he should leave off control. (10)

He is held fast by his attachment for his relations. So the keepers always follow a newly-caught elephant, and a cow which has just calved never goes far (from the calf). (11)

Men do not (easily) get over this attachment, as (they do not get over) the ocean [^773]. For its sake the weak suffer pains, being engrossed by their attachment for their relations. (12)

But a monk should renounce it; for every attachment is but a cause of sin. He should not desire life, having been instructed in the best Law. (13)

There are these whirlpools which have been <span id="p265"><sup><small>[ p. 265 ]</small></sup></span> pointed out by <i>K</i>â<i>s</i>yapa: the wise keep clear of them, but the ignorant go down in them. (14)

Kings and ministers of kings, Brâhma<i>n</i>as and Kshattriyas try with pleasant things to seduce a monk who leads a holy life. (15)

(They try to seduce him) with elephants, horses, chariots, and cars, with pleasure-trips (saying to him): 'Enjoy these excellent pleasures, great sage, we worship you! (16)

‘Clothes, perfumes, ornaments, women, and beds: enjoy these pleasures, friend, we worship you! (17)

‘All the vows which you, holy man, have kept while a monk, are compatible with your living in a house. (18)

‘It will be no sin, for you have wandered about long (enough).’ In this way they try to tempt him, as men decoy a pig with wild rice. (19)

Weak men who are exhorted to live as monks, but who are unable to practise control, break down like weak (bullocks carrying a heavy burden) uphill. (20)

Unable to practise the rough (i.e. control), and harassed by the austerities, weak men break down, like old oxen in going uphill. (21)

When men who are greedy, attached to women, and who love pleasures, are tempted in the way described above, they return to their houses. (22)

Thus I say.
