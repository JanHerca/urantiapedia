SEVENTEENTH LECTURE. THE BAD <i>S</i>RAMA<i>N</i>A.

A Nirgrantha who has entered the order, who has learned the Law, who has received religious <span id="p78"><sup><small>[ p. 78 ]</small></sup></span> discipline, and who has obtained the benefit of Bôdhi which is difficult to obtain, may perhaps afterwards begin to live as he likes. (1)

(He will say:) I have a good bed and wherewithal to cover me; I obtain food and drink; I know everything that comes to pass, friend; why then should I study, sir? (2)

He who, after entering the order, always sleeps, eats, and drinks as much as he likes, and lives comfortably, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (3)

The sinner who despises the learning and discipline which his preceptor and teachers have taught him, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (4)

He who does not, as he should, strive to please his preceptor and teachers, and does not, in his arrogance, treat them with respect, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (5)

He who hurts living beings, seeds, and sprouts, who does not control himself, though he believes himself well-controlled, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (6)

He who uses a bed, a plank, a chair, a seat, or his duster [^204], without having well wiped these things, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (7)

He who walks with great haste and without care, being overbearing and fierce, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (8)

<span id="p79"><sup><small>[ p. 79 ]</small></sup></span>

He who carelessly inspects things [^205], throwing down his duster at random, not being attentive to the inspection of things, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (9)

He who carelessly inspects things, his attention being absorbed by what he hears, who always slights his teachers, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (to)

He who is deceitful, talkative, arrogant, greedy, who does not control himself, nor share (his food, &c. with those who are in want), and is not of an amiable disposition, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (11)

He who is a controversialist, and ill-behaved, who perverts the truth, and delights in quarrels and contentions, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (12)

He who sits down on a weak, shaking seat wherever he lists, and is not careful in sitting down, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (13)

He who sleeps with dusty feet and does not inspect his couch, being careless about his bed, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (14)

He who eats milk, curds, and other things produced from milk, and does not practise austerities, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (15)

He who eats after sunset, and when admonished, makes an angry reply, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (16)

He who leaves his own teacher, and follows heretical ones, who continuously changes his school [^206], being of a bad disposition, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (17)

<span id="p80"><sup><small>[ p. 80 ]</small></sup></span>

He who has left his own house, and busies himself in another's house, who lives by fortune-telling, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (18)

He who eats the food of his relations, and does not like living by alms [^207], who reposes on the seat of the householder, is called a bad <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a. (19)

Such a monk, who, like the heretics [^208], does not protect himself from sins, who though having the appearance (of a monk) is the lowest among his worthy brethren, is despised in this world like poison; he is nobody in this world and in that beyond. (20)

But he who always avoids these sins, and is pious amongst his brethren, is welcomed in this world like nectar; he conquers this world and the next [^209]. (21)

Thus I say.

## Footnotes

[^205]: 78:1 Pâdakambala, usually called ra<i>g</i>ôhara<i>n</i>a. One commentator suggests, as a possible rendering, pâtrakambala ‘a cloth to cover his almsbowl.’

[^206]: 79:1 It is a monk's duty closely to inspect everything that he uses or comes in contact with, in order to avoid hurting inadvertently anything considered to possess life. This is called pa<i>d</i>ilêhâ.

[^207]: 79:2 Gâ<i>n</i>a<i>m</i>ga<i>n</i>ika, according to the commentators one who attaches himself to another ga<i>n</i>a every half-year.

[^208]: 80:1 Sâmudâ<i>n</i>iya, explained bhaiksham.

[^209]: 80:2 Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>aku<i>s</i>îla, literally, those who practise the five wrong <i>s</i>îlas, whereby probably those are denoted who do not keep the five great vows of the <i>G</i>ainas. Note that the Buddhists too have their pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>s</i>îla. They could therefore have been called pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>aku<i>s</i>îla by the <i>G</i>ainas.

[^210]: 80:3 The text is not settled in the last line; but there can be no doubt about the meaning.
