SECOND CHAPTER.

A monk, living single [^803], should not fall in love; if he loves pleasures, he should again become indifferent. Now hear the pleasures of <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>as, which some monks enjoy. (1)

When a monk breaks the law, dotes (on a woman), and is absorbed by that passion, she afterwards <span id="p276"><sup><small>[ p. 276 ]</small></sup></span> scolds him [^804], lifts her foot, and tramples on his head. (2)

‘O monk, if you will not live with me as a woman who has still her hair, I shall tear it out; but do not live separated from me.’ (3)

But when they have captured him, they send him on all sorts of errands [^805]: 'Look (for the bodkin to) carve the bottle-gourd [^806], fetch some nice fruit. (4)

‘(Bring) wood to cook the vegetables, or that we may light a fire at night; paint my feet [^807], come and meanwhile rub my back! (5)

‘Look after my clothes, bring food and drink, get me some perfume, a broom, a barber [^808] (to shave my head)! (6)

‘Give me the collyrium-box, my ornaments, the lute, Lôdhra-powder [^809], a Lôdhra-flower, the Vê<i>n</i>upalâsika-lute [^810], a pill! (7)

‘A Utpalakush<i>t</i>a [^811], Tagara [^812]\-powder, and aloe pounded together with U<i>s</i>îra [^813], oil for anointing the <span id="p277"><sup><small>[ p. 277 ]</small></sup></span> face, baskets of bamboo wickerwork to put my things in! (8)

‘Reach me the lip-salve, fetch the umbrella and slippers, the knife to cut the string, have my robe dyed bluish! (9)

‘Give me the pot to cook the vegetables in, Myrobalans [^814], the jar to fetch water in, the stick to paint the mark upon the forehead, the pin to apply collyrium (to the eyelids), or the fan when it is hot! (to)

‘Fetch me the pincers [^815], the comb, the ribbon to bind up the hair, reach me the looking-glass, put the tooth-brush near me! (11)

‘Fetch me areca-nut and betel, needle and thread, the chamber-pot, the winnowing basket, the mortar, the pot for liquefying natron [^816]! (12)

‘Give me the vessel (used in worshipping the gods [^817]), the water-pot. Friend, dig a privy. Fetch the bow for our son, the bullock for the <i>S</i>râma<i>n</i>êra! (13)

‘The small pot, the drum, and the ball of cloth for the boy (to play with). <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a, the rainy season is at hand, look after the house and the stores! (14)

‘(Fetch) the chair with woven twine seat [^818], the wooden shoes [^819] to walk on!’ Pregnant women order <span id="p278"><sup><small>[ p. 278 ]</small></sup></span> their husbands about like slaves to fulfil their craving. (15)

When a son, the reward (of their wedded life), is born, (the mother bids the father) to hold the baby, or to give it her. Thus some supporters of their sons have to carry burdens like camels. (16)

Getting up in the night they lull the baby asleep [^820] like nurses; and though they are ashamed of themselves, they wash the clothes like washermen [^821]. (17)

This has been done by many men who for the sake of pleasures have stooped so low; they become the equals of slaves, animals, servants, beasts of burden—mere nobodies. (18)

One should not mind the entreaties of women, but abstain from their friendship and company. These pleasures which are derived therefrom are called causes of blamable actions. (19)

Restraining himself by the thought that these dangerous (pleasures) will not be to his benefit, a monk should abstain from women, and commit no unnatural crime [^822]. (20)

A wise and learned monk whose soul is in a pure condition (Lê<i>s</i>yâ), will abstain from doing work for others; in thoughts, words, and actions he will bear all troubles. (21)

The hero (of faith) who has vanquished sin and delusion, has said all this. A monk, therefore, whose soul is pure (and free from sins) should wander about till he reaches final liberation. (22)

Thus I say.
