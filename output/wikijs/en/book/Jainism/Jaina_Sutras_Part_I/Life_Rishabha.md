In that period, in that age lived the Arhat <i>Ri</i>shabha, the Ko<i>s</i>alian [^659], four important moments of whose life happened when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism Uttarâshâ<i>dh</i>â; the fifth, when in conjunction with Abhi<i>g</i>it: (204) in Uttarâshâ<i>dh</i>â he descended from heaven, &c. (all down to) in Abhi<i>g</i>it he obtained final liberation. (205)

In that period, in that age, in the fourth month of summer, in the seventh fortnight, the dark (fortnight) of Ashâ<i>dh</i>a, on its fourth day, the Arhat <i>Ri</i>shabha, the Ko<i>s</i>alian, descended from the great Vimâna called Sarvârthasiddha, where he had lived for thirty-three Sâgaropamas, here on the continent <i>G</i>ambûdvîpa, in Bharatavarsha, in Ikshvâkubhûmi, and in the middle of the night, &c., he took the form of an embryo in the womb of Marudevî, wife of the patriarch [^660] Nâbhi. (206)

The knowledge of the Arhat <i>Ri</i>shabha about this, &c. (all as in the case of Mahâvîra, but note the following differences: the first dream is a bull ‘coming forward with his face,’ the other (mothers of Tîrthakaras see first) an elephant. She (Marudevî) relates them to Nâbhi, the patriarch; there <span id="p282"><sup><small>[ p. 282 ]</small></sup></span> are no interpreters of dreams; Nâbhi, the patriarch, himself interprets them). (207)

In that period, in that age the Arhat <i>Ri</i>shabha, the Ko<i>s</i>alian,—in the first month of summer, in the first fortnight, the dark (fortnight) of <i>K</i>aitra, on its eighth day, &c.,—(Marudevî), perfectly healthy herself, gave birth to a perfectly healthy boy. (208)

(The circumstances connected with the birth of <i>Ri</i>shabha are the same as in the case of that of Mahâvîra, only that the contents of §§ 100 and 101 do not apply to the present case.) (209)

The Arhat <i>Ri</i>shabha, the Ko<i>s</i>alian, belonged to the Kâ<i>s</i>yapa gotra, and he had five names: <i>Ri</i>shabha, First King, First Mendicant, First <i>G</i>ina, and First Tîrthakara. (210)

The Arhat <i>Ri</i>shabha, the Ko<i>s</i>alian, clever, with the aspirations of a clever man, of great beauty, controlling (his senses), lucky, and modest, lived two millions of former years [^661] as a prince, and six millions three hundred thousand former years as a king. During his reign he taught, for the benefit of the people, the seventy-two sciences, of which writing is the first, arithmetic the most important, and the knowledge of omens the last, the sixty-four accomplishments of women, the hundred arts, and the three occupations of men [^662]. At last he anointed his <span id="p283"><sup><small>[ p. 283 ]</small></sup></span> hundred sons as kings, and gave each a kingdom. Then the Laukântika god, following the established custom, &c. (see §§ 110-112, down to) indigent persons. In the first month of summer, in the first fortnight, the dark (fortnight) of <i>K</i>aitra, on its eighth day, in the latter part of the day, riding in his palankin called Sudarsanâ, followed on his way by a train of gods, men, and Asuras, &c. (<i>Ri</i>shabha) went right through the town Vinîtâ to the park called Siddhârtha Vana, and proceeded to the excellent tree A<i>s</i>oka. There, &c. (see § 116, down to) four handfuls. When the moon was in conjunction with the asterism Ashâ<i>dh</i>â, he, after fasting two and a half days without drinking water, put on a divine robe, and together with four thousand of high, noble, royal persons, and Kshatriyas, he tore out his hair, and leaving the house entered the state of houselessness. (211)

The Arhat <i>Ri</i>shabha, the Ko<i>s</i>alian, for one thousand years neglected his body, &c. (see §§ 1 I7-120, down to) meditated upon himself for one thousand years. Thereupon—it was in the fourth month of winter, the seventh fortnight, the dark (fortnight) of Phâlguna, on its eleventh day, in the early part of the day, when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism Ashâ<i>dh</i>â, outside of the town Purimatâla, in the park called <i>S</i>aka<i>t</i>amukha, under the excellent tree Nyagrodha—(<i>Ri</i>shabha) after fasting three and a half days without drinking water, being engaged in deep meditation, reached the infinite, &c. (see § 120, down to) highest knowledge and intuition called Kevala, &c. (see § 121, down to) moment. (212)

<span id="p284"><sup><small>[ p. 284 ]</small></sup></span>

The Arhat <i>Ri</i>shabha, the Ko<i>s</i>alian, had eighty-four Ga<i>n</i>as and eighty-four Ga<i>n</i>adharas. (213)

The Arhat <i>Ri</i>shabha, the Ko<i>s</i>alian, had an excellent community of eighty-four thousand <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>as with <i>Ri</i>shabhasena at their head; (214) three hundred thousand nuns with Brahmîsundarî at their head; (215) three hundred and five thousand lay votaries with <i>S</i>reyâ<i>m</i>sa at their head; (216) five hundred and fifty-four thousand female lay votaries with Subhadrâ at their head; (217) four thousand seven hundred and fifty sages who knew the fourteen Pûrvas, &c.; (218) nine thousand sages who were possessed of the Avadhi knowledge; (219) twenty thousand Kevalins; (220) twenty thousand six hundred sages who could transform themselves; (221) twelve thousand six hundred and fifty sages of vast intellect, &c.; (222) twelve thousand six hundred and fifty professors; (223) twenty thousand male and forty thousand female disciples who had reached perfection; (224) twenty-two thousand nine hundred sages in their last birth, &c. (225)

The Arhat <i>Ri</i>shabha, the Ko<i>s</i>alian, instituted, &c. (see § 146, down to) the former ended after numberless generations, the latter from the next Muhûrta after his Kevaliship. (226)

In that period, in that age the Arhat <i>Ri</i>shabha, the Ko<i>s</i>alian, lived two millions of former years as a prince, six millions three hundred thousand former years as a king, together eight millions three hundred thousand former years as a householder; a thousand (former) years in a state inferior to perfection, nine-and-ninety thousand former years as a Kevalin, together a hundred thousand former years as a <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a, and eight <span id="p285"><sup><small>[ p. 285 ]</small></sup></span> millions four hundred thousand years on the whole. When his fourfold Karman was exhausted, and in this Avasarpi<i>n</i>î era the Sushamadu<i>h</i>shamâ period had nearly elapsed, only three years and eight and a half months being left, in the third month of winter, in the fifth fortnight, the dark (fortnight) of Mâgha, on its thirteenth day, in the early part of the day when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism Abhi<i>g</i>it, (<i>Ri</i>shabha), after fasting six and a half days without drinking water, on the summit of mount Ash<i>t</i>âpada, in the company of ten thousand monks in the Samparyaṅka position, died, &c. (all down to) freed from all pains. (227)

Since the time that the Arhat <i>Ri</i>shabha, the Ko<i>s</i>alian, died, &c. (all down to) freed from all pains, three years and eight and a half months elapsed; thereupon one ko<i>t</i>i of ko<i>t</i>is of Sâgaropamas, less forty-two thousand and three years and eight and a half months, elapsed. At that time the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra died; after his Nirvâ<i>n</i>a nine centuries elapsed, of the tenth century this is the eightieth year.

End of the Life of <i>Ri</i>shabha.

End of the Lives of the <i>G</i>inas.

## Footnotes

[^666]: 281:1 Kosaliya = Kau<i>s</i>alika. He is thus called because he was born in Ko<i>s</i>alâ or Ayodhyâ.

[^667]: 281:2 Kulakara; these Kulakaras were the first kings and founders of families at the time when the rest of mankind were ‘Yugalins.’ The first Kulakara was Vimalavâhana; the seventh and last of the line Nâbhi.

[^668]: 282:1 See Â<i>k</i>ârâṅga Sûtra I, 6, 3, § 2, note 1.

[^669]: 282:2 The arts, as those of the potter, blacksmith, painter, weaver, and barber, each of which five principal arts is subdivided into twenty branches, are inventions and must be taught; while the occupations, agriculture, trade, &c. have everywhere developed, as it were, of themselves. The accomplishments of women are dancing, singing, &c. The commentator adds to these a detailed list of those questionable accomplishments which Vâtsyâyana has so curiously described, and refers the reader to the <i>G</i>ayamaṅgala for further details. The latter work, a still extant commentary on the p. 283 Kâma Sûtra, must therefore be older than 1307, the date of <i>G</i>inaprabhamuni's commentary on the Kalpa Sûtra.
