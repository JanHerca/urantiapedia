In that period, in that age lived the Arhat Arish<i>t</i>anemi, the five most important moments of whose life happened when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism <i>K</i>itrâ. In <i>K</i>itrâ he descended from heaven, &c. (see § 149, down to) obtained final liberation. (1 70)

In that period, in that age, in the fourth month of the rainy season, in the seventh fortnight, the dark (fortnight) of Kârttika, on its twelfth day, the Arhat Arish<i>t</i>anemi descended from the great Vimâna, called Aparâ<i>g</i>ita, where he had lived for thirty-six Sâgaropamas, here on the continent <i>G</i>ambûdvîpa, in Bharatavarsha, in the town of <i>S</i>auripura [^652], and in the middle of the night when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism <i>K</i>itrâ, he took the form of an embryo in the womb of the queen <i>S</i>ivâ, wife of the king Samudravi<i>g</i>aya, &c. (the seeing of the dreams, the accumulation of riches, &c., should be repeated here). (171)

In that period, in that age the Arhat Arish<i>t</i>anemi—after the lapse of nine months and seven and a half days, in the first month of the rainy season, in the second fortnight, the light (fortnight) of <i>S</i>râva<i>n</i>a, on its fifth day, &c.—(<i>S</i>ivâ), perfectly healthy herself; gave birth to a perfectly healthy boy. (Repeat the account of the birth, substituting the name Samudravi<i>g</i>aya, <span id="p277">[<sup><small>p. 277</small></sup>]</span> all down to) therefore shall the name of our boy be Arish<i>t</i>anemi [^653].

The Arhat Arish<i>t</i>anemi, clever, &c. (see §§ 155157, all down to) indigent persons. (172) In the first month of the rainy season, in the second fortnight, the light (fortnight) of Srâva<i>n</i>a, on its sixth day riding in his palankin called Uttarakurâ, and followed on his way by a train of gods, men, and Asuras, &c. (Arish<i>t</i>anemi) went right through the town of Dvârâvatî to the park called Revatîka, and proceeded to the excellent A<i>s</i>oka tree. There, &c. (see § 116, down to) five handfuls. When the moon was in conjunction with the asterism <i>K</i>itrâ, after fasting two and a half days without drinking water, he put on a divine robe, and together with a thousand persons he tore out his hair, and leaving the house entered the state of houselessness. (173)

The Arhat Arish<i>t</i>anemi for fifty-four days neglected his body, &c. (see §§ 117-120). During the fifty-fifth day—it was in the third month of the rainy season, in the fifth fortnight, the dark fortnight of Â<i>s</i>vina, on its fifteenth day, in the last part of the day, when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism <i>K</i>itrâ—(Arish<i>t</i>anemi) under a Ve<i>t</i>asa [^654] tree on the summit of mount Girnâr [^655], after fasting three and a half days without drinking water, &c., obtained infinite, &c., highest knowledge and intuition called Kevala, &c. (see § 121, down to) moment. (174)

<span id="p278">[<sup><small>p. 278</small></sup>]</span>

The Arhat Arish<i>t</i>anemi had eighteen Ga<i>n</i>as and eighteen Ga<i>n</i>adharas. (175)

The Arhat Arish<i>t</i>anemi had an excellent community of eighteen thousand <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>as with Varadatta at their head; (176) forty thousand nuns with Ârya Yakshi<i>n</i>î at their head; (177) one hundred and sixty-nine thousand lay votaries with Nanda at their head; (178) three hundred and thirty-six thousand [^656] female lay votaries with Mahâsuvratâ at their head; (179) four hundred sages who knew the fourteen Pûrvas, &c.; (180) fifteen hundred sages who were possessed of the Avadhi knowledge; fifteen hundred Kevalins; fifteen hundred sages who could transform themselves; one thousand sages of vast intellect; eight hundred professors; sixteen hundred sages in their last birth; fifteen hundred male and three thousand female disciples who had reached perfection.

The Arhat Arish<i>t</i>anemi instituted, &c. (see § 146, down to) the former ended in the eighth generation, the latter in the twelfth year of his Kevaliship. (181)

In that period, in that age the Arhat Arish<i>t</i>anemi lived three centuries as a prince, fifty-four days in a state inferior to perfection, something less than seven centuries as a Kevalin, full seven centuries as a <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a, a thousand years on the whole. When his fourfold Karman was exhausted and in this Avasarpi<i>n</i>î era a great part of the Du<i>h</i>shamasushamâ period had elapsed, in the fourth month of summer, in the eighth fortnight, the light (fortnight) of Ashâ<i>dh</i>a, on its eighth day, in the middle of the night when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism <i>K</i>itrâ, (Arish<i>t</i>anemi), after fasting a month <span id="p279">[<sup><small>p. 279</small></sup>]</span> without drinking water, on the summit of mount Girnâr, in the company of five hundred and thirty-six monks, in a squatting position, died, &c. (all down to) freed from all pains. (182)

Since the time that the Arhat Arish<i>t</i>anemi died, &c. (all down to) freed from all pains, eighty-four thousand years have elapsed, of the eighty-fifth millennium nine centuries have elapsed, of the tenth century this is the eightieth year. (183)
