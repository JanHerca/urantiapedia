In that period, in that age lived the Arhat Pâr<i>s</i>va, the people's favourite [^645], the five most important moments of whose life happened when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism Vi<i>s</i>âkhâ: in Vi<i>s</i>âkhâ he descended (from heaven), and having descended thence, entered the womb (of his mother); in Vi<i>s</i>âkhâ he was born; in Vi<i>s</i>âkhâ, tearing out his hair, he left the house and entered the state of houselessness; in Vi<i>s</i>âkhâ he obtained the highest knowledge and intuition, called Kevala, which is infinite, supreme, unobstructed, unimpeded, complete, and full; in Vi<i>s</i>âkhâ he obtained final liberation. (149)

In that period, in that age, in the first month of summer, in the first fortnight, the dark (fortnight) of <i>K</i>aitra, on its fourth day, the Arhat Pâr<i>s</i>va, the people's favourite, descended from the Prâ<i>n</i>ata Kalpa [^646], where he had lived for twenty Sâgaropamas, here on the continent <i>G</i>ambûdvîpa, in Bharatavarsha, in the town of Benares; and in the middle of the night when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism Vi<i>s</i>âkhâ, after the termination of his allotted length of life, divine nature, and existence (among the gods), he took the form of an embryo in the womb of the queen Vâmâ, wife of A<i>s</i>vasena, king (of Benares). (150)

The knowledge of the Arhat Pâr<i>s</i>va, the people's <span id="p272"><sup><small>[ p. 272 ]</small></sup></span> favourite, (about this) was threefold, &c. (repeat §§ 3-95 after making the necessary substitutions, and omitting what exclusively applies to Mahâvîra, all down to) comfortably carried her unborn child. (i51)

In that period, in that age the Arhat Pâr<i>s</i>va, the people's favourite [^647]\—after the lapse of nine months and seven and a half days, in the second month of winter, in the third fortnight, the dark (fortnight) of Paushya, on its tenth day, in the middle of the night when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism Vi<i>s</i>âkhâ—(Vâmâ), perfectly healthy herself, gave birth to a perfectly healthy boy. (152)

In that night in which the Arhat Pâr<i>s</i>va, the people's favourite, was born, &c. (repeat §§ 97-107 with the necessary alterations, all down to) therefore shall the name of our boy be Pâr<i>s</i>va [^648]. (153, 154)

The Arhat Pâr<i>s</i>va, the people's favourite, clever, with the aspirations of a clever man, of great beauty, controlling his senses, lucky, and modest, lived thirty years as a householder. Then the Laukântika gods, following the established custom, addressed him with these kind, pleasing, &c., sweet, and soft words: (155)

‘Victory, victory to thee, gladdener of the world!’ (see § 111, down to) Thus they raised the shout of victory. (156) Before the Arhat Pâr<i>s</i>va, the people's favourite, had adopted the life of a householder, &c. (see § 112, down to) indigent persons.

<span id="p273"><sup><small>[ p. 273 ]</small></sup></span>

In the second month of winter, in the third fortnight, the dark (fortnight) of Paushya, on its eleventh day, in the middle of the night, riding in his palankin called Vi<i>s</i>âlâ, followed on his way by a train of gods, men, and Asuras, &c. (Pâr<i>s</i>va) went right through the town of Benares to the park called A<i>s</i>ramapada, and proceeded to the excellent tree A<i>s</i>oka. There, &c. (see § 116, down to) five handfuls.

When the moon was in conjunction with the asterism Vi<i>s</i>âkhâ, he, after fasting three and a half days without drinking water, put on a divine robe, and together with three hundred men he tore out his hair, and leaving the house entered the state of houselessness. (157)

The Arhat Pâr<i>s</i>va, the people's favourite, for eighty-three days neglected his body, &c. (see § 117, down to) animals. (158)

Thereafter the Arhat Pâr<i>s</i>va, the people's favourite, was houseless, circumspect, &c. (see §§ 1 18-120, down to) meditated upon himself for eighty-three days.

During the eighty-fourth day—it was in the first month of summer, in the first fortnight, the dark (fortnight) of <i>K</i>aitra, on its fourth day, in the early part of the day, when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism Vi<i>s</i>âkhâ—Pâr<i>s</i>va, under a Dhâtaki tree, after fasting two and a half days without drinking water, being engaged in deep meditation, reached the infinite, &c. (see § 120, down to) highest knowledge and intuition called Kevala, &c. (see § 121, down to) moment. (159)

The Arhat Pâr<i>s</i>va, the people's favourite, had eight Ga<i>n</i>as and eight Ga<i>n</i>adharas (enumerated in a <i>S</i>loka):

<span id="p274"><sup><small>[ p. 274 ]</small></sup></span>

<i>S</i>ubha and Âryaghosha, Vasish<i>th</i>a [^649] and Brahma<i>k</i>ârin, Saumya and <i>S</i>rîdhara, Vîrabhadra and Ya<i>s</i>as. (160)

The Arhat Pâr<i>s</i>va, the people's favourite, had an excellent community of sixteen thousand Srama<i>n</i>as with Âryadatta [^650] at their head; (161) thirty-eight thousand nuns with Pushpa<i>k</i>ûlâ at their head; (162) one hundred and sixty-four thousand lay votaries with Suvrata at their head; (163) three hundred and twenty-seven thousand female lay votaries with Sunandâ at their head; (164) three hundred and fifty sages who knew the fourteen Pûrvas, &c. (see § 138); (165) fourteen hundred sages who were possessed of the Avadhi knowledge; one thousand Kevalins; eleven hundred sages who could transform themselves, six hundred sages of correct knowledge, one thousand male and two thousand female disciples who had reached perfection, seven hundred and fifty sages of vast intellect, six hundred professors, and twelve hundred sages in their last birth. (166)

The Arhat Pâr<i>s</i>va, the people's favourite, instituted two epochs in his capacity of a Maker of an end: the epoch relating to generations and the epoch relating to psychical condition; the former ended in the fourth generation, the latter in the third year of his Kevaliship. (167)

In that period, in that age the Arhat Pâr<i>s</i>va, the people's favourite, lived thirty years as a householder, eighty-three days in a state inferior to perfection, something less than seventy years as a Kevalin, full seventy years as a <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a, and a hundred years on the whole.

When his fourfold Karman [^651] was exhausted and in this Avasarpi<i>n</i>î era the greater part of the Du<i>h</i>shamasushamâ period had elapsed, in the first month of the rainy season, in the second fortnight, the light (fortnight) of <i>S</i>râva<i>n</i>a, on its eighth day, in the early part of the day when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism Vi<i>s</i>âkhâ, (Pâr<i>s</i>va), after fasting a month without drinking water, on the summit of mount Sammeta, in the company of eighty-three persons, stretching out his hands, died, &c. (all down to) freed from all pains. (168) Since the time that the Arhat Pâr<i>s</i>va, the people's favourite, died, &c. (all down to) freed from all pains, twelve centuries have elapsed, and of the thirteenth century this is the thirtieth year. (169)

End of the Life of Pâr<i>s</i>va.
