SIXTH LECTURE, CALLED BEGGING FOR A BOWL [^432].

## FIRST LESSON.

A monk or a nun wanting to get a bowl, may beg for one made of bottle-gourd or wood or clay, or such-like bowls. If he be a youthful, young, &c. (see II, 5, 1, § 1) monk, he may carry with him one bowl, not two [^433].

A monk or a nun should not resolve to go farther than half a Yo<i>g</i>ana to get a bowl.

As regards the acceptance of a bowl, those four precepts which have been given in (the First Lesson of the First Lecture, called) [^434] Begging of Food, concerning one fellow-ascetic, &c., should be repeated here, the fifth is that concerning many <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>as and Brâhma<i>n</i>as.

A monk or a nun should not accept a bowl which the layman has, for the mendicant's sake, bought, &c. (see the Lecture called Begging of Clothes [^435]). (I )

A monk or a nun should not accept any very expensive bowls of the following description: bowls made of iron, tin, lead, silver, gold, brass, a mixture of <span id="p167"><sup><small>[ p. 167 ]</small></sup></span> gold, silver, and copper, pearl, glass, mother of pearl, horn, ivory, cloth, stone, or leather; for such very expensive bowls are impure and unacceptable. (2)

A monk or a nun should not accept bowls which contain a band of the same precious materials specialised in § 2; for &c. (3)

For the avoidance of these occasions to sin there are four rules for begging a bowl to be known by the mendicants.

Now this is the first rule:

A monk or a nun may beg for a bowl specifying its quality, viz. bottle-gourd or wood or clay. If they beg for such a bowl, or the householder gives it, they may accept it, for it is pure and acceptable.

This is the first rule. (4)

Now follows the second rule:

A monk or a nun may ask for a bowl, which they have well inspected, from the householder or his wife, &c. After consideration, they should say: ‘O long-lived one! (or, O sister!) please give me one of these bowls, viz. one made of bottle-gourds or wood or clay.’ If they beg for such a bowl, or the householder gives it, they may accept it; for &c.

This is the second rule. (5)

Now follows the third rule:

A monk or a nun may beg for a bowl which has been used by the former owner or by many people. If they beg for it, &c. (see § 5).

This is the third rule. (6)

Now follows the fourth rule:

A monk or a nun may beg for a left-off bowl which no other <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a or Brâhma<i>n</i>a, guest, pauper, or beggar wants. If they beg for it, &c. (see § 5).

This is the fourth rule.

<span id="p168"><sup><small>[ p. 168 ]</small></sup></span>

A monk or a nun having adopted one of these four rules should not say, &c. (see II, 1, t r, § 12, all down to) we respect each other accordingly. (7)

A householder may perhaps say to a mendicant begging in the prescribed way: ‘O long-lived <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a! return after a month,’ &c. (all as in the Lecture called Begging of Clothes [^436]). (8)

The householder may say (to one of his people): ‘O long-lived one! (or, O sister!) fetch that bowl, rub it with oil, ghee, fresh butter or marrow, we shall give it,’ &c. (see II, 5, 1, § 11); or wash, wipe, or rub it with perfumes,' &c.; or ‘wash it with cold or hot water;’ or ‘empty it of the bulbs,’ &c. (see II, 5, 1, §§ 11 and 12). (9)

The householder may say (to the mendicant): ‘O long-lived <i>S</i>rama<i>n</i>a! stay a while till they have cooked or prepared our food, &c., then we shall give you, O long-lived one! your alms-bowl filled with food or drink; it is not good, not meet that a mendicant should get an empty alms-bowl.’ After consideration, the mendicant should answer: ‘O long-lived one! (or, O sister!) it is indeed not meet for me to eat or drink food &c. which is âdhâkarmika; do not cook or prepare it; if you want to give me anything, give it as it is.’ After these words the householder might offer him the alms-bowl filled with food or drink which had been cooked or prepared: he should not accept such an alms-bowl, for it is impure and unacceptable. (10)

Perhaps the householder will bring and give the mendicant an alms-bowl; the mendicant should then, after consideration, say: ‘O long-lived one! (or, O <span id="p169"><sup><small>[ p. 169 ]</small></sup></span> sister!) I shall in your presence closely inspect the interior of the bowl.’

The Kevalin says: This is the reason: In the alms-bowl there might be living beings or seeds or grass. Hence it has been said to the mendicant, &c., that he should closely inspect the interior of the alms-bowl. (11)

All that has been said in the Lecture called Begging of Clothes (II, 5, I, § 15 down to the end) is mutatis mutandis to be repeated here. (In § 15, add before perfumes) with oil, ghee, butter or marrow.

This is the whole duty, &c.

Thus I say. (12)




## SECOND LESSON.

A monk or a nun, entering the abode of a householder for the sake of alms, should after examining their alms-bowl, taking out any living beings, and wiping off the dust, circumspectly enter or leave the householder's abode.

The Kevalin says: This is the reason: Living beings, seeds or dust might fall into his bowl. Hence it has been said to the mendicant, &c., that he should after examining his alms-bowl, taking out any living beings, circumspectly enter or leave the householder's abode. (1)

On such an occasion the householder might perhaps, going in the house, fill the alms-bowl with cold water and, returning, offer it him; (the mendicant) should not accept such an alms-bowl [^437] either in <span id="p170"><sup><small>[ p. 170 ]</small></sup></span> the householder's hand or his vessel; for it is impure and unacceptable. (2)

Perhaps he has, inadvertently, accepted it; then he should empty it again in (the householder's) water-pot; or (on his objecting to it) he should put down the bowl and the water somewhere, or empty it in some wet place. (3)

A monk or a nun should not wipe or rub a wet or moist alms-bowl. But when they perceive that on their alms-bowl the water has dried up and the moisture is gone, then they may circumspectly wipe or rub it. (4)

A monk or a nun wanting to enter the abode of a householder, should enter or leave it, for the sake of alms, with their bowl; also on going to the out-of-door place for religious practices or study; or on wandering from village to village.

If a strong and widely spread rain pours down, they should take the same care of their alms-bowl as is prescribed for clothes (in the preceding Lecture, Lesson 2, § 1).

This is the whole duty, &c.

Thus I say. (5)

End of the Sixth Lecture, called Begging for a Bowl.
