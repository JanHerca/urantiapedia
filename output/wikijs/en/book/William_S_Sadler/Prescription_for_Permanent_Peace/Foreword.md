IT IS not strange that a physician who has practiced his profession for almost forty years, whose life has been devoted to searching for the causes of human ailments and to seeking to effect their cure, should come to look upon certain world problems and dilemmas, such as war, as chronic diseases. Thus conceiving war to be a disease, it is natural that the physician — more especially the psychiatrist — should attempt to formulate a prescription for peace, attempt to identify and propose those conditions which might justify the hope for _permanent peace_.

Since we conceive of health as the normal state for the individual man, we may be justified in regarding peace as the normal and healthy state for nations. This little book, then, is the attempt of a psychiatrist to portray his views of the causes of war, more especially of World War I and the present global struggle, and then, following this analysis of the causes, to present a plan, a prescription, designed to effect a cure of this war disease of mankind and ultimately to lead to the enjoyment of lasting peace.

I am not in agreement with those who contend that we should be concerned only with winning the war, that consideration of the peace should be relegated to the future. I sincerely believe that it is our duty to plan for peace and the future world order even while the war is being waged.

In passing, perhaps I should confess to being a disillusioned isolationist, since up to six or eight years ago the refusal of the United States to enter the League of Nations and participate actively in international relations had received my full approval ; but even before Hitler marched into Poland, my eyes had been opened to the necessity for America’s more active participation in world affairs.

This book attempts a diagnostic study of Germany and the other Axis powers, goes on to examine our traditional American attitudes respecting isolationism and internationalism, and then systematically points out the psychologic, sociologic, economic, and political problems attendant upon the attempt to arrive at a permanent peace through the establishment of an effective government of mankind.

In writing a book of this sort one naturally gives expression to many ideas which have been absorbed from many sources. I have not been able to read such books as Brickner’s _Is Germany Incurable_, Maciver’s _Towards an Abiding Peace_, Lippmann’s _United States Foreign Policy_, and Reves’ _A Democratic Manifesto_, without being so favorably impressed that the ideas of these various writers find more or less expression in these pages.

I regret that it is not possible for me to acknowledge the source of the many concepts presented here which I have gleaned from scores of authors, for not all of the ideas and sentiments herein contained were original with me. Far from it. These chapters embody my attempt during the past decade — more especially since Hitler invaded Poland — to “pick berries” off every available bush.

My long-time associate, Wilfred C. Kellogg, contributed many valuable suggestions in the preparation of this manuscript, and Linton J. Keith supplied many suggestions and contributed very materially to the final preparation of the manuscript for publication. His contributions have been very valuable, since they far exceed mere editorial suggestions.
