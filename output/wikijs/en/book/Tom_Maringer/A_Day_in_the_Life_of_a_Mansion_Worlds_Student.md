## THE PEARL OF WISDOM

<p style="text-align:center;">
<ins><em>Author's Notice:</em></ins><br>
</p>

The following story is fictitious. Any reference to humans, angels, or other specific personal beings, whether or not they exist, is purely coincidental. This story is loosely based on The Urantia Book, but the reader should understand that it is solely an interpretation of the author and should rely on his or her own understanding of The Urantia Book to determine for himself or herself the reality of any depiction of life in morontia.

## PROLOGUE

> “...Such conceptual expansion would hardly be desirable because it would deprive thinking mortals of the next thousand years of that stimulus to creative speculation which these partially revealed concepts provide. Man had better not have overrevelation; it stifles the imagination.” Quote from The Urantia Book, page 330. [UB 30:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/30#p0_2)

It is hoped that this work of fiction inspired by The Urantia Book may help stimulate the creative imaginations of others. A Day in the Life of... may perhaps become a catch-all title for the fictional works of many authors who present their speculative visions of what the mansion world experience might be like.
