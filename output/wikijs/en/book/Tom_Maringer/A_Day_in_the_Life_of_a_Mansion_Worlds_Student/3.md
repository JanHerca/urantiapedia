We entered one of the small vehicles and drove away from the magnificent structure, heading above the beautiful idyllic landscape toward another complex structure in the distance.

—It may take you some time to get used to life here, but don't worry, all your worries will be satisfied. We have ten days of complete freedom before we present a tentative program.

—A program? I don't understand.

—Bill, you should try to think of the universe as a gigantic and wonderful cosmic university to which you have won an all-paid scholarship.

“A university?” I said. “To learn what? What's all this about?”
Henri/Henta looked at me solemnly.

“You have to be a little patient; the ultimate purpose is hard to explain until you’ve learned how things work here. Look in your binder and you’ll find a course catalog describing the kinds of classes you’re expected to attend. Some of the first courses will be language courses; you need to start learning the language of the local universe. Eventually, you’ll learn the language of the superuniverse as well. You’ll also have some prescriptive courses on some problems left over from your planetary environment, things like Problem Avoidance 101 and Introduction to Ethics 102. Some of these classes will be more or less one-on-one instruction, and others will be extended classes you’ll take with others in your company—the same ones you met earlier in the resurrection room. You’ll also have time for a few electives of your own choosing—all sorts of interesting things that suit your temperament. What you can choose includes advanced study in music, art, physics, astronomy, engineering, botany, zoology, chemistry, history, and much more.” In the next ten days—and I should mention here that our “days” are equivalent to three Earth days—we will spend much time discussing anything you may have of a personal nature that is troubling or interesting to you. You will spend some time alone or with a fellow morontia member seeking out friends or relatives who may have preceded you. You may choose to go as far as the Musicians' Circle and check out what is going on there, which is usually several things at any given time. There are many magnificent instruments there, more than any you have seen before, and whichever one you choose, you will find it interesting to try. You might want to begin reading $The$ Urantia Book that Laminefta has given you. You may have noticed that it has an appendix in the back that Earth people do not have in their books; it deals with certain subjects that have not been revealed to the mortal inhabitants of Urantia because the permission given to the revelatory commission did not include them. The revelators worked within the limitations of sixteen exclusions, universe truths and scientific facts that an evolving world must discover for itself. You could even make use of a parental leave you have, which entitles you to seraphic transport to the Father's world.

Henri/Henta paused and I thought for a few seconds about what they had said.

—The Father's world? A parental leave? What does that mean? Why does it entitle me to seraphic transport?

—Look, Bill, the powers of the universe are motivated primarily by love and mercy. They do everything they can to ensure that all beings have an equal opportunity to express themselves.

In matters of the survival of mortal beings to life in morontia, children who die before the moral age of election are considered to remain united with their parents. They are rematerialized in the probationary nursery on the Father's world when either of their parents arrives. There is now a ward there who acquired potential identity as a child when conceived between you and your wife, but who was lost through spontaneous abortion; you will no doubt remember the event.

“What? You mean the baby isn't lost? That she's alive? Oh God, that's wonderful! Thank you, thank you. It was so sad to lose that baby. Oh yes, I want to see her!” Joy flooded through me, and my confusion dissipated. “You don't know how much that means to me!”

—Okay, Bill, you don't have to explain.

The fused dual being Henri/Henta separated into his self-complements, a truly strange thing to see.

“I think that completes the formalities,” Henta said after a while. “We can continue to be three of us the rest of the time.”

“I hope you don't mind my question,” I said, “but what's up with you two? This fusion of yours is quite strange, and how can you talk together while Henta watches and smiles?”

They smiled again.

—You know, we angels always work in pairs; it's the way we were created. When we work alone, we are very limited in function and ability. Although we are always referred to as “they,” for we are Daughters of God, we are also of two kinds, commonly called 'active' and 'withdrawn.' That makes for a good combination. I am the one who speaks, and Henta is the one who listens. Whenever we need to carry out an important official function, we merge our complements of being and thus act as a single being that combines our talents.

“I see,” I said, not quite seeing it.
They laughed.

—Oh! You'll get used to it. Hey, if you think THIS is weird... —But just then we reached the landing platform of another structure and the conversation broke off.

—Well, we're here. I'm afraid you won't be able to use these cars alone for a while, but there are moving sidewalks and other forms of public transportation you can use to explore the surroundings of your new home. Temporarily, actually, but you'll be here for a while.

We landed in front of a beautifully crafted arched vault adorned with enormous, perfect crystals of several recognizable minerals—garnet, tourmaline, amethyst, beryllium, and topaz, among others—as well as a few others completely unknown to me. We passed through the archway into an immense open-air esplanade crowded with people of all classes. As with the other structures, I had already seen that this one was entirely devoid of a roof or ceiling of any kind. The buildings seemed to consist primarily of walls of various heights, intricately and beautifully crafted. The sky was a brilliant blue, cloudless, its light having approximately the intensity of the full sun on a spring morning but seeming to come from the entire sky at once. Passing through the esplanade, we made our way to a series of booths containing the type of glowing globes of light I had seen Laminefta use earlier in the Melchizedek sector.

“What are those things?” I asked. “Some kind of computer terminal or something?”

“Actually, yes,” Henri replied, “they allow access to the central archives and information storage banks. Let me show you... stand right here, in front of the globe, and state your name and your home world number. That identifies you; then ask any question you want. For example, how to find your living quarters, or how to send messages to your friends or relatives who may have preceded you, or how to find your way to the classes or recreational activities you're going to attend.”

Using some moving sidewalks, we soon arrived at the residential area and found my apartment. My mind had received so much new information that it was refreshing to be able to focus on some routine material concern. By the standards of a “home” in my world, the apartment was generously spacious; the open roof gave it an indescribably elegant appearance. Its layout was very simple: a single large room, naturally, a living area with seating for five or six people, a couple of comfortable sofas, a couple of small tables with what appeared to be magazines, and a large sliding door that opened onto a small but beautiful garden shared by several apartments. A few ascendants could be seen there, conversing or meditating. There was a small bathroom that caught my attention.

—Hey! What's up with the bathroom? There's a sink and a shower, but no toilet.

—Okay, Bill, your new body no longer needs to eliminate urine or feces. Remember, you now have a MORONCIA body, and although externally it closely resembles your material form, internally it is structured very differently. You will take food here, but your body will utilize it completely.


—Food? Hey, what kind of food do you have around here? Pizza?

—I'm so sorry, Bill, all this force can use are fruits and vegetables from the morontia. I can assure you they're very good for you and I understand they're also very tasty, but I'm afraid all that pizza and beer binge you used to enjoy isn't going down too well around here.

—Ah, well, but I guess I still have the memories, right?

—Yes. You still have your memories, and that's a very good attitude; in fact, if you ever really miss any particular aspect of your mortal life, we can reinforce some of your memories to compensate for the lack.

I went back to the bathroom and looked at myself in the full-length mirror.

“Will I have any other clothes?” I said, remembering that while many of the ascendants we'd seen were wearing white robes, others were dressed in a wide variety of clothing that seemed typical of some place. And that brought the matter of money to my mind. “And by the way, what do people do around here for money?”

Henri and Henta looked at each other again.

—We are pleased to announce that you no longer need to worry about money.

They looked at me compassionately, as if I were someone who seemed to have been reminded of truly bad times.

—If you need new clothes, Bill, no problem! We'll go to the manufacturing sector, where that sort of thing is made. You'll choose what you want and sign a document stipulating that you'll work the number of hours required to produce it. They'll probably put you on the same sewing room, making your own clothes; simple as that.

“But I don't know how to sew!” I said, “and besides, all of this seems pretty complicated. I have to sign a document to work the required time for what I'm asking for, but what about the materials and the overhead? And doesn't the factory owner make a profit?”

—That's precisely the point, Bill. You must try to understand that this entire world, and many others besides, are part of a gigantic school dedicated to the training of billions of mortal creatures who acquire their spiritual identity there, and who pour through here in ever-increasing numbers year after year. This isn't a “for-profit” enterprise in the economic sense, although in the spiritual sense, I suppose it could be considered that.


“So if I want new clothes, I have to learn how to make them myself?” They looked at me and nodded. “Well, suddenly, it doesn't seem so important. I suppose it'll work out just fine.” They laughed again. “But what you just said brings up another question: WHAT are we being trained to do, if I may ask?”

—Of course you can, Bill. That is one of the great questions facing us in the creation of space-time, one that occupies the attention of our great thinkers and philosophers. I cannot give you absolute answers, but I can tell you that at least our conjectures on the matter point toward a truly glorious adventure for all who undertake the task of completing the program. The ultimate goal in space-time is to transcend time itself and enter the spiritual realms of the central universe, and ultimately Paradise to meet face to face with the Father Himself. Beyond that, we have no definitive knowledge, but the trends would point toward an eternal race of struggle and advancement in the administration of billions of developing galaxy systems in the realms of outer space. These fields of action are not inhabited at this time by any kind of willed creatures. Our conjecture, neither confirmed nor denied by our superiors, is that you will be charged with overseeing their development as centers of spiritual struggle in space-time, just as the beings of the perfect central universe of Havona were once summoned to do so in this galaxy of Orvonton.

—Wow! That sounds really fascinating. I'd always dreamed of exploring the stars and galaxies in outer space, but the idea seemed so impractical, so impossible, that I discarded it.

—Truly, they weren't idle dreams, Bill, they were a foretaste of destiny. Rest assured that you will have the opportunity to explore the vast expanses of time and space, and moreover, you will eventually explore the even vaster cosmos of the mind, the spirit, and ultimately, of personality itself in the eternal quest to find and recognize God.

“I think I'm starting to get the urge to do it. It still sounds very strange, but also exciting. I seem to feel something warm and sweet inside, and my mind seems clearer and less foggy than it's ever been in my life. I don't really understand much of what you're saying, but try as I might, it doesn't cause me any real anxiety, and as strange as it is, it doesn't scare me, and it feels like a new experience I have to have.”

—It's quite natural, Bill. You're beginning to get used to the new mechanism of your mind. Your inner self, your soul and spirit, remain the same; the only thing that's changed is the mechanism of the brain itself. You'll find it's much more reliable than the electrochemical device of your previous state. Is there anything else about your mind that's pressing and that you'd like to discuss with us?

—Yes, indeed. Could you tell me something about my death? Why don't I remember it, and how I got here? You mentioned once that we're a couple of dozen light-years from Earth, and yet I have no awareness of the passage of time; it's as if I just kissed my wife goodbye this morning.

“Well, it was a traffic accident, Bill, you know. You were on your way to work; you were climbing a hill on Twisted Lake Road when you encountered another vehicle in your lane as you were coming out of a curve. You swerved to avoid the other car, successfully, I can tell you, but you ended up going over the guardrail and striking the rock behind it. At times like this, we seraphim have the ability to alter our subjective time sense so that we can analyze the situation down to the millisecond or even the microsecond. When the car flew over the barrier, we carefully reviewed all possible outcomes of the collision and concluded that your death was inevitable; we mobilized to retrieve your soul from morontia at the very moment of your material destruction. At that moment, your Thought Adjuster, your spirit self, also took leave of your body and returned temporarily to Divinington, where it waited for us to summon it.” We, the seraphim, with our fully fused self-complements, enfolded your infant soul and transported it here to the resurrection hall, where we met with the returned Thought Adjuster. With the aid of the archangel of resurrection and numerous other beings, your spirit and soul were reunited in this morontia counterpart of your material body. The journey from Urantia to here took about three days, but you were completely unconscious and unaware of the passage of time.

“I see,” I replied, “but I still have trouble with the idea of a morontia body, and you've also mentioned that the soul was a morontia soul but that I had it during my life on Earth. Also, you've talked about traveling faster than light, which is impossible according to Einstein's theory of relativity.”

—Look, Bill, morontia materials are an alternate phase of materialization of the same kind as the energy of the universe, which is what ordinary matter is made of. The difference has to do mainly with the most basic units of material construction, the ultimatons, which are grouped together by 100s to form electrons, and in other quantities to form all the other subatomic particles. Ultimatons have several variable properties, one of which is spin. Those that spin so fast that their surface speed exceeds that of light cannot be detected in Einsteinian space of subluminal mechanics. Einstein was right when he predicted that ordinary matter could not exceed the speed of light, but he was wrong in some of his later work when he made a number of assumptions based on philosophical rather than scientific grounds. There is an entire realm of physics and mechanics beyond the light-speed threshold, and the materials of morontia, which are constructed in familiar ways from particles that are themselves of the trans-light realm, are capable of moving at speeds three times greater than the speed of light. The time-dilation effect that becomes evident in material objects as they approach the light-speed threshold is reversed at higher velocities. In the larger universe of things and beings, only three Urantia days elapsed on our journey here from your home world, but to Henta and me, the voyage seemed to last almost eight years.

—Ah, I see. So Einstein was only partly right, but how can I have a morontia soul while still in a material body?

—The soul is a kind of larval stage of your present morontia self. Its origin is in the combination of cosmic forces resulting from the existence of a fragment of the spirit of God, the Thought Adjuster, within the mind of the material creature. Such spirit energies applied to material particles result in the formation of morontia materials, the birth of the soul. In a material sense, it is very small, having a mass of only a few grams in most cases. You can think of it as a sort of egg-shaped object, very soft and pliable, occupying your center of gravity in the abdominal region. It has its most notable influence over the mind and emotions, and it grows larger and stronger with each spiritual decision and each new spiritual understanding you experience in mortal life. Here on the mansion worlds, we manage to alter your physical form as you progress in your learning, to make it more useful to you and to allow your senses to expand to gather information of an ever greater quantity and of a more subtle nature.

I looked at my hands and explored my flesh as I thought about these words; the skin, softer and smoother, was a more chocolate-colored color, with no hair except on my head, which seemed to have a thicker and more solid appearance than normal hair.

Henri continued speaking.

“On that table, you will find a pamphlet describing the details of the immediate surroundings and containing a map. Until you become accustomed to the infoglobes, the map will be very useful. The other magazines describe some social activities taking place in this area. You have *The Urantia Book*, which I suggest you begin as soon as possible; you will find you can absorb information much more quickly and easily than ever before. Your new body does not require sleep, but you will need to rest from time to time. The light will be dimmed for a few hours; I suggest you relax on one of the couches and simply rest during the time of darkness. We will now go and return in the “morning” to discuss further matters you may wish to discuss. Until then, we will meet again in the eternity of the Father’s grace.” Then the seraphim gestured to me in farewell, and I nodded back.

“Until we meet again in the eternity of the Father's grace.” It seemed a particularly fitting and poignant way to say goodbye.

During my ten days of free time, I wandered around a lot, stopping by the Musicians' Circle at the nearby Celestial Artisans' headquarters. It was wonderful to participate in some of the performances, with other people from different worlds and with strangely different instruments, and yet still be able to play music together. Henri says that all minds are basically the same, so it's not so unusual for disparate beings to think alike.

The days passed in a veritable whirlwind of bliss and contentment, strangely amplified by the company of other newly arrived souls from the worlds of space who seemed somewhat more disoriented. In particular, I had the opportunity to help a woman from Synoptia, planet 615, who was currently in the Planetary Prince stage of development. She was having a lot of trouble because she believed she deserved the gift of life after death and because she had planetary traditions that depicted a stern God of righteous anger. Even her seraphim had trouble convincing her of God's mercy and love. I'm still not sure what I said to her to help her, but she listened to the history of Urantia and finally expressed the opinion that if God could forgive one Urantian, He could forgive almost anyone else. She went away happy, and in some ways, it made me feel good, too.

The lack of sexual organs seemed quite strange to me at first, and I wasn't entirely sure I'd ever get used to it, but on the other hand, it turned out to be very stimulating. When I was a man on Earth, I was always careful not to get too close to any woman other than my wife, so many people, even in my group of acquaintances, were excluded from the possibility of becoming close friends. Sex was always a hindrance in some way. But here, there's no room for ulterior motives; you can really talk about intimate things with a woman without either of us worrying about where the conversation is going. It's great!

I used my parental leave to visit the Father's world probationary nursery and saw my little Adele. She had been rematerialized exactly as she was before, except for the lack of sexual organs. She was still in the incubator, and her guardians explained to me that although I was of morontia, she was still material and would remain so until she reached the age at which she could make the final decision for or against the eternal career. So while I could see her, she could not see me except with the help of certain beings. She would be under the direct supervision of the probationary guardians, but I would have some control over the circumstances of her upbringing.

I asked Henri again about Saint Peter and the “difficult cases” he'd mentioned, and how they were coping. We took an aerial car tour deep into the countryside. Henri asked me to look at a certain spot. Below me, I could see a long, narrow valley green with waving grass. Herds of bison, clusters of tents with cooking fires, and scattered copses could be seen. There seemed to be no elderly people or children; all the people in sight seemed to be healthy, young adults. Henri asked me if I recognized the scene.

“Yes! Why?” I replied. “It's the 'joyful game meadows' exactly as they were described in the book *Black Elk Speaks*.”

“That’s right,” Henri said. “I knew you’d remember the passage, as it made a strong impression on you when you read it. Black Elk had a true vision for this place. It was created specifically to fulfill the most cherished expectations of one ethnic group. By allowing new ascendants to awaken here, we “cushion the blow,” so to speak, and give them a chance to get used to the idea of having died before having them go through the general process. Saint Peter oversees the upkeep of this and similar places used for the same purpose.”

—And what about Christian fundamentalists? Back on Earth, they were always talking about heaven and hell and all that. What do you do with them?

Henri is angry.

—Well, you'll see it someday. Peter puts on that big white beard and stands with his big book, looks at them sternly, and writes their names just as they expected him to. Of course, at first they're surprised that almost everyone they expected to “burn” also appears here, but then we go over the parable of the prodigal son with them a couple of times, and they soon come around.

After my ten days of free time, I was enrolled in some morontia classes, but Henri said I only needed a few remedial courses and then I would be transferred to the next world where I would resume my studies more seriously. The classes basically dealt with my tendency toward laziness and avoiding problems. It was rather jarring to attend a class full of people and have everyone's life examined in its most intimate details, but we soon realized that we all shared the same flaws, and that we could work on them together.

After sixty days of attending classes and participating in the social and recreational activities of the first mansion world, Henri told me it was time to move on. We went to a transference chamber very similar to the one I had woken up in, and I simply fell asleep for the first time since my arrival on the mansion world.

Waking up on Mansonia Number 2 was much like my first experience, except that I already had a pretty good idea of what to expect and was therefore not nearly as confused. My body seemed slightly modified from its previous form; I could see and hear much better, my sense of smell was greatly improved, and I seemed to have another sense that would be difficult to explain—a sort of sensing of my surroundings that occurred even with my eyes closed. It was as if I could visualize a sphere about 100 meters in radius with me at the center and all the objects and people within this range represented on a sort of map.

I began taking classes on more serious subjects. One that had a profound effect on me was called Cosmic Purpose 206. I attended these classes with many others from the company I had been repersonalized with, and Henri and Henta often joined me. The course was taught by a Melchizedek professor emeritus who had personally gone on numerous emergency missions to the worlds of space and returned to share his experience. He was talking about the universe as a school...

—... Look, we generally visualize the master universe as having seven perceptible dimensions. There may be others known only to God, but if so, they have not been revealed to us, and we can ignore them in this discussion. The basic process of universe advancement is the integration of dimensional levels into creature experience.

—The seven levels of the master universe with their levels of integration are named as follows:

_(Read from bottom to top)_

$$
\left.
\begin{array}{l}
\text{7. Totality} \\
\text{6. Personality} \\
\left.
\begin{array}{l}
\text{5. Spirit} \\
\text{4. Mind} \\
\left.
\begin{array}{l}
\text{3. Depth} \\
\text{2. Height} \\
\text{1. Width}
\end{array}
\right\}
\begin{array}{l}
\text{Material,} \\
\text{1st integration}
\end{array}
\end{array}
\right\}
\begin{array}{l}
\text{Fusion,} \\
\text{2nd integration}
\end{array}
\end{array}
\right\}
\begin{array}{l}
\text{Purpose,} \\
\text{3rd integration}
\end{array}
$$

—The dimensional levels integrate into the experiential levels in groups of three. The three spatial dimensions were integrated long ago into the space-time-material level of experience. This integration took place far back in your ancestral memory with the initial appearance of the primitive mind in the earliest animal organisms. The third integration is far in your future and will be achieved on Paradise when you come to recognize the Universal Father. By attending this school, you seek the second integration, which will culminate in fusion with the thought adjuster. You are attempting to integrate the material level of experience with the next two dimensional levels, which are mind and spirit.


_The second cosmic integration_

$$
\left.
\begin{array}{l}
\text{SPIRITUAL} \\
\text{MENTAL} \\
\text{MATERIAL} \\
\end{array}
\right\}
\text{FUSION WITH THE ADJUSTER}
$$

—Progress toward this integration is measured by what we call the seven psychic circles.


—Circles are a way of measuring the degree of closeness to the threshold of fusion with the adjuster. You can visualize the personality integration matrix as a three-dimensional cube in space whose X, Y, and Z coordinates represent the material, intellectual, and spiritual components of the personality, respectively. Each person begins their search at the origin of the coordinates and tries to reach the diametrically opposite vertex of the cubic space, which represents the integration point of the three components.

<br>

</figure>

<br style="clear:both;"/>

—The seven psychic circles are visualized in this case as spheres centered on the point of fusion. The volume of space between the spheres represents the cosmic circles; for example, the volume between the fifth and sixth spheres represents the area of the sixth psychic circle. Any person or being below the status of fusion with the adjuster can, at any given moment in time, be represented as a point on this matrix, indicating their present status in the quest for integration. You will have noticed that the volume of space is quite large, and that two people on the sixth psychic circle can actually have very different positions on the matrix. You see that as you move toward the apex of the cube, toward the second and first circles, the volumes of space at each level become increasingly smaller. By the time you reach the first psychic circle, the relative dominance of the three components is virtually equal. There is still a short way to go before complete and final integration is achieved, resulting in immediate and eternal fusion with the indwelling thought adjuster. Thus, the life experience of a mortal fused with an adjuster can be accurately represented by a curved line running through the matrix, beginning at the origin and ending at the opposite vertex. The shape and curvature of the line graphically describe the progression of the mortal's journey through the matrix. Periods of life dominated by material, intellectual, or spiritual concerns will appear as deviations from the line.

—Some of you may have noticed that adjuster-fused beings who reside here often wear a beautiful cube-shaped morontia crystal around their necks, held at one corner. A thin gold thread within the cube represents their personal journey toward fusion. Once you become accustomed to this representation, a quick glance at that personal crystal will tell you much about that person's experience.

—The most common form of personality integration line you'll see in crystals is a spiral that first veers toward the material in early childhood, curves toward the intellectual in late adolescence, and finally turns toward spiritual concerns in adulthood.

—A straight line drawn between the opposite vertices of the cube can be considered “the straight and narrow,” the shortest distance to the goal. Few, in fact, have life paths that follow this line, although many cross it at different points in their careers. People who are in periods of life where their personality status as an individual brings them very close to this straight line may feel that their lives are in balance, that all is well with the universe. Conversely, to those whose status places them far from this path, life will seem unbalanced, unfair, cruel, and boring.

<br style="clear:both;"/>

The effect of the presentation was profound for me; it seemed to expand my mind like a balloon and left me with a concept of the universe several times broader than I had previously had. Henri and Henta then reviewed my own life with me and traced my journey through it; this showed me that I was currently occupying the fourth psychic circle and was very close to breaking into the third.

A few days after this conference, at the end of my tenth year here, I received word that I had finished my work on Mansonia Number Two and that I was to be transferred the next day to the Third Mansion World.

Once again, my awakening at number three was similar to those I had experienced previously; now, too, the capabilities of my physical form had increased. When I resumed classes, it became clear to me that the focus of my work was bringing the status of my personality integration to the threshold of the third psychic circle. Henri and Henta marked my position within the integration matrix and showed me graphically that my material component was completely adequate and my spiritual component entirely sufficient, but that I
I lacked intellectual development. So, I started taking some fairly advanced technical classes on cosmology and moroncy physics. Fascinating subjects!

It was at this point in my stay at Mansonia III that I saw that one day, my personal training program indicated only “personal instruction.”

This brought the stream of my memories back to the present, and I again noticed the presence in my mind of the “three” beings, Henri/Henta, Lamont/Lamar, and Samotad. I had gained a certain sense of the totality of my experience through this replay of my memories, a sense of the essential oneness that exists among all beings in a local universe. The extension of the concept implies the brotherhood of all personalities wherever they may be. They seemed to approve of the way I had structured my memories of the experiences on the early mansion worlds and gestured for me to continue with the lesson and activate the pearl of wisdom.
