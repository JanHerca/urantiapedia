Should either party, following the recital of the specifically revealed verse and the payment of the dowry, take a dislike to the other before the marriage is consummated, the period of waiting is not necessary prior to a divorce. The taking back of the dowry, however, is not permitted.
        * l. The husband must fix for his wife the time of his return when intending to travel. If, for a legitimate reason, he is prevented from returning at the appointed time, he must inform her and strive to return to her. If he fails to fulfil either condition, she must wait 9 months, after which she may remarry, though it is preferable for her to wait longer. If news of his death or murder reaches her, and the news is confirmed by general report or by 2 reliable witnesses, she may remarry after the lapse of 9 months.
        * m. If the husband departs without informing his wife of the date of his return, and is aware of the law prescribed in the Kitab-i-Aqdas, the wife may remarry after waiting a full year. If the husband is unaware of this law, the wife must wait until news of her husband reaches her.
        * n. Should the husband, after the payment of the dowry, discover that the wife is not a virgin, the refund of the dowry and of the expenses incurred may be demanded.
        * o. If the marriage has been conditioned on virginity the refund of the dowry and of the expenses incurred may be demanded and the marriage invalidated. To conceal the matter, however, is highly meritorious in the sight of God.
      2. Divorce:
        * a. Divorce is strongly condemned.
        * b. If antipathy or resentment develop on the part of either the husband or the wife, divorce is permissible, only after the lapse of one full year. The beginning and end of the year of waiting must be testified by two or more witnesses. The act of divorce should be registered by the judicial officer representing the House of Justice. Intercourse during this period of waiting is forbidden, and whoever breaks this law must repent and pay the House of Justice 19 mithqals of gold.
        * c. A further period of waiting after divorce has taken place is not required.
        * d. The wife who is to be divorced as a result of her unfaithfulness forfeits the payment of the expenses during the waiting period.
        * e. Remarrying the wife whom one has divorced is permissible, provided she has not married another person. If she has, she must be divorced before her former husband can remarry her.
        * f. If at any time during the waiting period affection should recur, the marriage tie is valid. If this reconciliation is followed by estrangement and divorce is again desired, a new year of waiting will have to be commenced.
        * g. Should differences arise between husband and wife while travelling, he is required to send her home, or entrust her to a dependable person, who will escort her there, paying her journey and her full year’s expenses.
        * h. Should a wife insist on divorcing her husband rather than migrate to another country, the year of waiting is to be counted from the time they separate, either while he is preparing to leave, or upon his departure.
        * i. The Islamic law regarding remarriage with the wife whom one has previously divorced is abrogated.
      3. Inheritance:
        * a. Inheritance falls into the following categories:
          1. children 1,080 out of 2,520 shares
          2. husband or wife 390 “ 2,520 ”
          3. father 330 “ 2,520 ”
          4. mother 270 “ 2,520 ”
          5. brother 210 “ 2,520 ”
          6. sister 150 “ 2,520 ”
          7. teacher 90 “ 2,520 ”
        * b. The share of the children, as allotted by the Bab, is doubled by Baha’u’llah. The method of dividing the estate is to be applied in cases of intestacy. See item o. in this section and an equal portion correspondingly reduced from each of the remaining beneficiaries.
        * c.
          * i. In cases where there is no issue the share of the children reverts to the House of Justice to be expended on orphans and widows and for whatever will profit mankind.
          * ii. If the son of the deceased be dead and leave issue, these will inherit the share of their father. If the daughter of the deceased be dead and leave issue, her share will have to be divided into the seven categories specified in the Most Holy Book.
        * d. Should one leave offspring but either part or all of the other categories of inheritors be nonexistent, two thirds of their shares reverts to the offspring and one third to the House of Justice.
        * e. Should none of the specified beneficiaries exist, two thirds of the inheritance reverts to the nephews and nieces of the deceased. If these do not exist, the same share reverts to the aunts and uncles; lacking these, to their sons and daughters. In any case the remaining third reverts to the House of Justice.
        * f. Should one leave none of the aforementioned heirs, the entire inheritance reverts to the House of Justice.
        * g. The residence and the personal clothing of the deceased father pass to the male not to the female offspring. If there be several residences the principal and most important one passes to the male offspring. The remaining residences will together with the other possessions of the deceased have to be divided among the heirs. If there be no male offspring two thirds of the principal residence and the personal clothing of the deceased father will revert to the female issue and one third to the House of Justice. In the case of the deceased mother all her used clothing is to be equally divided amongst her daughters. Her unworn clothing, jewels and property must be divided among her heirs, as well as her used clothing if she leaves no daughter.
        * h. Should the children of the deceased be minors their share should either be entrusted to a reliable person or to a company for purposes of investment, until they attain the age of maturity. A share of the interest accrued should be assigned to the trustee.
        * i. The inheritance should not be divided until after the payment of the Huququ’llah (The Right of God), of any debts contracted by the deceased and of any expenses incurred for a befitting funeral and burial.
        * j. If the brother of the deceased is from the same father he will inherit his full allotted share. If he is from another father he will inherit only two thirds of his share, the remaining one third reverting to the House of Justice. The same law is applicable to the sister of the deceased.
        * k. In case there are full brothers or full sisters, brothers and sisters from the mother’s side do not inherit.
        * l. A non-Baha’i teacher does not inherit. If there should be more than one teacher, the share allotted to the teacher is to be equally divided among them.
        * m. Non-Baha’i heirs do not inherit.
        * n. Aside from the wife’s used clothing and gifts of jewellery or otherwise which have been proven to have been given her by her husband, whatever the husband has purchased for his wife are to be considered as the husband’s possessions to be divided among his heirs.
