## THE BENEDICTION OF ABBAS EFFENDI, THE PROPHET OF THE BAHAI RELIGION, TO THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK:

“_O God, bring this Servant of thine near to the Divine Threshold; give him life through the breath of the Holy Spirit. Open his eyes, loosen his tongue, and cause him to walk in the path of the Kingdom. Confirm him in Thy service. Grant him eloquent speech and a fluent pen. Make him beloved in both worlds. If Thou wilt grant him such bounties, he will be acceptable to the people of knowledge and will become world-renowned. Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty_.”
