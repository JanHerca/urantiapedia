Treatise on the Symbolism of the Hexagrams, and of the duke of <i>K</i>âu's Explanations of the several Lines [^189]

## SECTION I

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^190]. Heaven, in its motion, (gives the idea of) strength. The superior man, in accordance with this, nerves himself to ceaseless activity.

1\. ‘The dragon lies hid in the deep;—it is not the time for active doing:’—(this appears from) the strong and undivided line's being in the lowest place.

2\. ‘The dragon appears in the field:’—the diffusion of virtuous influence has been wide.

3\. ‘Active and vigilant all the day:’—(this refers to) the treading of the (proper) path over and over again.

4\. ‘He seems to be leaping up, but is still in the deep:’—if he advance, there will be no error.

5\. ‘The dragon is on the wing in the sky:’—the great man rouses himself to his work.

6\. ‘The dragon exceeds the proper limits;—there will be occasion for repentance:’—a state of fulness, that is, should not be indulged in long.

7\. ‘The same NINE (undivided) is used’ (in all the places of this hexagram), but the attribute of heaven (thereby denoted) should not (always) take the foremost place.

<span id="p268"><sup><small>[ p. 268 ]</small></sup></span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^191]. The (capacity and sustaining) power of the earth is what is denoted by Khwăn. The superior man, in accordance with this, with his large virtue supports (men and) things.

1\. ‘He is treading on hoarfrost;—the strong ice will come (by and by):’—the cold (air) has begun to take form. Allow it to go on quietly according to its nature, and (the hoarfrost) will come to strong ice.

2\. The movement indicated by the second six, (divided),is ‘from the straight (line) to the square.’ ‘(Its operation), without repeated effort, in every way advantageous,’ shows the brilliant result of the way of earth.

3\. ‘He keeps his excellence tinder restraint, but firmly maintains it:’—at the proper time he will manifest it. 'He may have occasion to engage in the king's service:—great is the glory of his wisdom. <span id="p269"><sup><small>[ p. 269 ]</small></sup></span> 4\. ‘A sack tied up;—there will be no error:’—this shows how, through carefulness, no injury will be received.

S. ‘The Yellow lower-garment;—there will be great good fortune:’—this follows from that ornamental (colour's) being in the right and central place.

6\. 'The dragons fight in the wild:—the (onward) course (indicated by Khwăn) is pursued to extremity.

7\. '(The lines are all weak and divided, as appears from) the use of the number SIX:—but (those who are thus represented) becoming perpetually correct and firm, there will thereby be a great consummation.

<span id="p270"><sup><small>[ p. 270 ]</small></sup></span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^192]. (The trigram representing) clouds and (that representing) thunder form <i>K</i>un. The superior man, in accordance with this, (adjusts his measures of government) as in sorting the threads of the warp and woof.

1\. Although ‘there is a difficulty in advancing,’ the mind (of the subject of the line) is set on doing what is correct. While noble, he humbles himself to the mean, and grandly gains the people.

2\. The difficulty (to the subject of) the second six, (divided), arises from, its place over the undivided line below it. ‘The union and children after ten years’ shows things resuming their regular course.

3\. ‘One pursues the deer without the (guidance of the) forester:’—(he does so) in (his eagerness to) follow the game. ‘The superior man gives up the chase, (knowing that) if he go forward he will regret it:’—he would be reduced to extremity.

4\. ‘Going forward after such a search (for a helper)’ shows intelligence.

5\. ‘Difficulty is experienced (by the subject of the fifth line) in bestowing his rich favours:’—the extent to which they reach will not yet be conspicuous.

6\. ‘He weeps tears of blood in streams:’—how can the state (thus emblemed) continue long?

<span id="p271"><sup><small>[ p. 271 ]</small></sup></span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^193]. (The trigram representing) a mountain, and beneath it that for a spring issuing forth form Măng. The superior man, in accordance with this, strives to be resolute in his conduct and nourishes his virtue.

1\. ‘It will be advantageous to use punishment:’—the object being to bring under the influence of correcting law.

2\. ‘A son able to (sustain the burden of) his family:’—as appears from the reciprocation between this strong line and the weak (fifth line).

3\. ‘A woman (such as is here represented) should not be taken in marriage:’—her conduct is not agreeable to what is right.

4\. ‘The regret arising from ignorance bound in chains’ is due to the special distance of (the subject of this line) from the solidity (shown in lines 2 and 6).

5\. ‘The good fortune belonging to the simple lad without experience’ comes from his docility going on to humility. <span id="p272"><sup><small>[ p. 272 ]</small></sup></span> 6\. ‘Advantage will come from warding off injury:’—(the subject of this line) above and (the ignorant) below, all do and are done to in accordance with their nature.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^194]. (The trigram for) clouds ascending over that <span id="p273"><sup><small>[ p. 273 ]</small></sup></span> for the sky forms Hsü. The superior man, in accordance with this, eats and drinks, feasts and enjoys himself (as if there were nothing else to employ him).

1\. ‘He is waiting in the (distant) border:’—he makes no movement to encounter rashly the difficulties (of the situation). ‘It will be advantageous for him constantly to maintain (the purpose thus shown), in which case there will be no error:’—he will not fail to pursue that regular course.

2\. ‘He is waiting on the sand:’—he occupies his position in the centre with a generous forbearance. Though ‘he suffer the small injury of being spoken (against),’ he will bring things to a good issue.

3\. ‘He is waiting in the mud:’—calamity is (close at hand, and as it were) in the outer (trigram). ‘He himself invites the approach of injury:’—if he be reverent and careful, he will not be worsted.

4\. ‘He is waiting in (the place of) blood:’—he accommodates himself (to the circumstances of the time), and hearkens to (its requirements).

5\. ‘The appliances of a feast, and the good fortune through being firm and correct,’ are indicated by (the position in) the central and correct place.

6\. ‘Guests come unurged (to give their help), and if (the subject of the line) receive them respectfully, there will be good fortune in the end:’—though the occupant and the place are not suited to each other, there has been no great failure (in what has been done).

<span id="p274"><sup><small>[ p. 274 ]</small></sup></span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^195]. (The trigram representing) heaven and (that representing) water, moving away from each other, form Sung. The superior man, in accordance with this, in the transaction of affairs takes good counsel about his first steps.

1\. ‘He does not perpetuate the matter about which (the contention is):’—contention should not be prolonged. Although ‘he may suffer the small (injury) of being spoken against,’ his argument is clear.

2\. ‘He is unequal to the contention; he retires and keeps concealed, stealthily withdrawing from it:’—for him from his lower place to contend with (the stronger one) above, would be to (invite) calamity, as if he brought it with his hand to himself.

3\. ‘He confines himself to the support assigned <span id="p275"><sup><small>[ p. 275 ]</small></sup></span> to him of old:’—(thus) following those above him, he will have good fortune.

4\. 'He returns to (the study of Heaven's) ordinances, changes (his wish to contend), and rests in being firm and correct:'—he does not fail (in doing what is right).

5\. 'He contends;—and 'with great fortune:—this is shown by his holding the due mean and being in the correct place.

6\. ‘He receives the robe through his contention:’—but still be is not deserving of respect.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^196]. (The trigram representing) the earth and in the midst of it that representing water, form Sze. The superior man, in accordance with this, nourishes and educates the people, and collects (from among them) the multitudes (of the hosts).

1\. ‘The host goes forth according to the rules (for) such a movement:’—if those rules be not observed, there will be evil. <span id="p276"><sup><small>[ p. 276 ]</small></sup></span> 2\. ‘He is in the midst of the host, and there will be good fortune:’—he has received the favour of Heaven. ‘The king has thrice conveyed to him the orders (of) his favour:’—(the king) cherishes the myriad regions in his heart.

3\. ‘The host with the possibility of its having many idle leaders:’—great will be its want of success.

4\. ‘The host is in retreat; but there is no error:’—there has been no failure in the regular course.

5\. ‘The oldest son leads the host:’—its movements are directed by him in accordance with his position in the centre. ‘Younger men idly occupy their positions:’—the employment of such men is improper.

6\. ‘The great ruler delivers his charges:’—thereby he rightly apportions merit. ‘Small men should not be employed:’—they are sure to throw the states into confusion.

<span id="p277"><sup><small>[ p. 277 ]</small></sup></span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^197]. (The trigram representing) the earth, and over it (that representing) water, form Pî. The ancient kings, in accordance with this, established the various states and maintained an affectionate relation to their princes.

1\. From ‘the seeking union with its object’ shown in the first SIX, (divided),there will be other advantages.

2\. ‘The movement towards union and attachment proceeds from the inward (mind):’—(the party concerned) does not fail in what is proper to himself

3\. ‘Union is sought with such as ought not to be associated with:’—but will not injury be the result?

4\. ‘Union is sought (by the party intended here) with one beyond himself, and (in this case) with a worthy object:’—he is following (the ruler) above him.

5\. ‘The good fortune belonging to the most illustrious instance of seeking union and attachment’ appears in the correct and central position (of the fifth line, undivided).

(The king's) neglecting (the animals) confronting him (and then fleeing), and (only) taking those who present themselves as it were obediently, is seen in <span id="p278"><sup><small>[ p. 278 ]</small></sup></span> ‘his allowing the escape of those in front of him.’ ‘That the people of his towns do not warn one another (to prevent such escape),’ shows how he, in his high eminence, has made them pursue the due course.

6\. ‘He seeks union and attachment without taking the first (step to such an end):’—there is no possibility of a (good) issue.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^198]. (The trigram representing) the sky, and that representing wind moving above it, form Hsiâo <i>Kh</i>û The superior man, in accordance with this, adorns the outward manifestation of his virtue.

1\. ‘He returns and pursues his own path:’—it is right that there should be good fortune.

2\. ‘By the attraction (of the subject of the former line) he returns (to its own course),’ and is in the central place:—neither will he err in what is due from him.

3\. ‘Husband and wife look on each other with averted eyes:’—(the subject of line three is like a <span id="p279"><sup><small>[ p. 279 ]</small></sup></span> husband who) cannot maintain correctly his relations with his wife.

4\. ‘He is possessed of sincerity; his (ground for) apprehension is dismissed:’—(the subjects of the lines) above agree in aim with him.

5\. ‘He is possessed of sincerity, and draws others to unite with him:’—he does not use only his own rich resources.

6\. ‘The rain has fallen and (the onward progress) is stayed:’—the power (denoted in the figure) has accumulated to the full. ‘If the superior man prosecute his measures, there will be evil:’—he will find himself obstructed.

<span id="p280"><sup><small>[ p. 280 ]</small></sup></span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^199]. (The trigram representing) the sky above, and below it (that representing the waters of) a marsh, form Lî. The superior man, in accordance with this, discriminates between high and low, and gives settlement to the aims of the people.

1\. ‘He treads his accustomed path and goes forward:’—singly and exclusively he carries out his (long-cherished) wishes.

2\. ‘A quiet and solitary man, to whom, being firm and correct, there will be good fortune:’—holding the due mean, he will not allow himself to be thrown into disorder.

3\. ‘A one-eyed man (who thinks that he) can see:’—he is not fit to see clearly. ‘A lame man (who thinks that he can) tread well:’—one cannot walk along with him. ‘The ill fortune of being bitten’ arises from the place not being the proper one for him. ‘A (mere) bravo acting the part of a great ruler:’—this is owing to his aims being (too) violent.

4\. ‘He becomes full of apprehensive caution, and in the end there will be good fortune:’—his aim takes effect.

5\. ‘He treads resolutely; and though he be firm and correct, there is peril:’—this is due to his being in the position that is correct and appropriate to him. <span id="p281"><sup><small>[ p. 281 ]</small></sup></span> 6\. ‘There will be great good fortune,’ and that in the occupancy of the topmost line:—this is great matter for congratulation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^200]. (The trigrams for) heaven and earth in communication together form Thâi. The (sage) sovereign, in harmony with this, fashions and completes (his regulations) after the courses of heaven and earth, and assists the application of the adaptations furnished by them,—in order to benefit the people.

1\. ‘The good fortune of advance, (as suggested by the emblem of) the grass pulled up,’ arises from the will (of the party intended) being set on what is external to himself.

2\. ‘He bears with the uncultivated, and proves himself acting in accordance with the due mean:’—for (his intelligence is) bright and (his capacity is) great.

3\. ‘There is no going away so that there shall not be a return’ refers to this as the point where the interaction of heaven and earth takes place.

4\. ‘He comes fluttering (down), not relying on <span id="p282"><sup><small>[ p. 282 ]</small></sup></span> his own rich resources:’—both he and his neighbours are out of their real (place where they are). ‘They have not received warning, but (come) in the sincerity (of their hearts):’—this is what they have desired in the core of their hearts.

5\. ‘By such a course there is happiness, and there will be great good fortune:’—(the subject of the line) employs the virtue proper to his central position to carry his wishes into effect.

There is no opportunity of conferring on him the glory of emolument. <span id="p283"><sup><small>[ p. 283 ]</small></sup></span> 1\. ‘The good fortune through firm goodness, (suggested by) the pulling up of the grass,’ arises from the will (of the parties intended) being bent on (serving) the ruler.

2\. 'The great man, comporting himself as the distress and obstruction require, will have success:—'he does not allow himself to be disordered by the herd (of small men).

2\. ‘(The representative of) the union of men appears in relation with his kindred:’—that is the path to regret.

3\. ‘A feudal prince presents his offerings to the son of Heaven:’—a small man (in such a position) does (himself) harm.

4\. ‘He keeps his great resources under restraint:’—his wisdom discriminates clearly (what he ought to do).

4\. ‘From him the harmony and satisfaction come; great is the success which he obtains:’—his aims take effect on a grand scale.

5\. ‘(The subject of) the fifth six has a chronic complaint:’—this is shown by his being mounted on the strong (line). ‘He still lives on without dying:’—he is in the central position, (and its memories of the past) have not yet perished.

## Footnotes

[^189]: 267:1 Like the Text under each hexagram, what is said under each in this treatise on its symbolism is divided into two portions. The p. 267 first is called ‘the Great Symbolism,’ and is occupied with the trigrammatic composition of the hexagram, to the statement of which is always subjoined an exhibition of the use which should be, or has been, made of the lesson suggested by the meaning of the whole figure in the administration of affairs, or in self-government. If the treatise be rightly ascribed to Confucius, this practical application of the teaching of the symbols is eminently characteristic of his method in inculcating truth and duty; though we often find it difficult to trace the connexion between his premiss and conclusion. This portion of the treatise will be separated by a double space from what follows,—‘the Lesser Symbolism,’ in the explanations of the several lines.

[^190]: 268:I <i>Kh</i>ien is formed by redoubling the trigram of the same name. In the case of other hexagrams of similar formation, the repetition of the trigram is pointed out. That is not done here, according to <i>K</i>û Hsî, ‘because there is but one heaven.’ But the motion of heaven is a complete revolution every day, resumed again the next; so moves ‘the unwearied sun from day to day,’ making it a good symbol of renewed, untiring effort.

[^191]: 269:II Khwăn is formed by redoubling the trigram of the same name and having ‘the earth for its symbol.’ As in the former hexagram, the repetition is emphatic, not otherwise affecting the meaning of the hexagram. ‘As there is but one heaven,’ says <i>K</i>û Hsî, ‘so there is but one earth.’ The first part of ‘the Great Symbolism’ appears in Canon McClatchie's version as—‘Khwăn is the generative part of earth.’ By ‘generative part’ he probably means ‘the productive or prolific faculty.’ If he mean anything else, there comes out a conclusion antagonistic to his own view of the ‘mythology’ of the Yî. The character Shî, which he translates by ‘generative part,’ is defined in Dr. Williams' dictionary as ‘the virility of males.’ Such is the special significance of it. If it were so used here, the earth would be masculine.
  It is difficult to say exactly what the writer meant by—‘The superior man, in accordance with this, and with his large nature, supports (men and) things.’ Lin Hsî-yüan (Ming dynasty) says:—‘The superior man, in his single person, sustains the burden of all under the sky. The common people depend on him for their rest and enjoyment. Birds and beasts and creeping things, and the tribes of the vegetable kingdom, depend on him for the fulfilment or their destined being. If he be of a narrow mind and cold virtue, how can he help them? Their hope in him would be in vain.’
  ‘The Smaller Symbolism’ is sufficiently dealt with in the notes on the Text.

[^192]: 270:III Khan represents water, especially in the form of rain. Here its symbol is a cloud. The whole hexagram seems to place us in the atmosphere of a thunderous sky overhung with thick and gloomy clouds, when we feel oppressed and distressed. This is not a bad emblem of the political state in the mind of the writer. When the thunder has pealed, and the clouds have discharged their p. 271 burden of rain, the atmosphere is cleared, and there is a feeling of relief. But I fail again to discern clearly the connexion between the symbolism and the lesson about the superior man's administration of affairs.
  The subject of the first line of the Smaller Symbolism is represented by the undivided line, and therefore is firm and correct. He is noble, but his place is below the divided lines, symbols of the weak and mean (see Appendix IV, i, 1).
  Line 2. ‘Things resume their regular course:’—the subject is now at liberty to seek a union with the subject of line 5, according to the rules of the symbolism. Lines 1 and 4, 2 and 5, 3 and 6, the corresponding lilies of the trigrams, are correlates.
  The subject of line 4 naturally recurs to the correlate in line 1. He is the natural helper in the case, and he has the ability.

[^193]: 272:IV ‘The spring here issuing forth’ is different from the defile with a stream in it, in the explanation of the Thwan; different moreover from ‘rain,’ mentioned also as the phenomenon which is the natural symbol of Khan. The presence of water, however, is common to the three. But the water of the spring, or of the stream, would flow away from the hill, and not be stopped by it; as an emblem therefore of the ignorance and inexperience denoted by Măng it is not suitable. <i>K</i>û Hsî says that ‘the water of a spring is sure to move on and gradually advance.’ This may serve as a symbol of the general process and progress of education, though it gives no account of the symbolism of the hill. It serves also to explain in part the transition of the writer to the subject of the superior man, and his dealing apparently with himself.
  Does line 1 set forth the use of punishment as the dernier resort, undesirable, but possibly unavoidable, to bring men in subjection to law?
  The force of line 2 comes out fully in the Thwan.
  That a woman such as is represented in line 3 should not be taken in marriage is clear enough; but I do not see the bearing of the illustration on the proper lesson in the hexagram.
  Line 3 separates 4 from 2, and 5 separates it from 6. Weak in itself, it is farther removed than any other from the two strong lines in the hexagram, and is represented as ‘cribbed’ in its ignorance.
  The fifth is the most honourable place in the figure, and here is occupied by a weak line. This looks, however, to the occupant of line 2, less honourable than itself, and is marked by the two attributes that are named. Compare what is said on line 2.
  A strong line in the topmost place must represent, according to the scheme of the hexagram, one who uses force in the cause of education; but the force is put forth not on the ignorant, but on those who would keep them ignorant, or increase their ignorance. The subject of this line, therefore, acts according to his nature, and the subjects of all the weak lines below are cared for as is best for them.

[^194]: 273:V ‘The cloud,’ it is said, ‘that has risen to the top of the sky, has nothing more to do till it is called on, in the harmony of heaven p. 274 and earth, to discharge its store of rain.’ This gives to the writer the idea of waiting; and the superior man is supposed to be taught by this symbolism to enjoy his idle time, while he is waiting for the approach of danger and occasion for action.
  ‘The regular course’ of the subject of line 1 seems to be the determination to wait, at a distance from danger, the proper time to act.
  The subject of line 2, which is undivided and in the centre, is thereby shown to be possessed of a large and generous forbearance.
  The recognition of the circumstances of the time, and hearkening to its requirements, explain, in paragraph 4, ‘the retreat from the cavern,’ which is not here repeated from the Text. The line being weak and divided, its subject knows his own incompetency, and takes this prudent step.
  <i>K</i>û says that he does not understand what is said under line 6,—that the occupant and the place are not suited to each other, for the yin line being in the sixth, an even place, seems to be where it ought to be. We are only surprised that cases of inconsistency in these explanations are not more numerous.

[^195]: 275:VI The symbolism here is different from that in the Text of the Thwan. We have the visible sky ascending and water or rain descending, which indicate, one hardly sees how, opposition and contention. The lesson as to the course of the superior man is a good one, but might with equal propriety be deduced from many other hexagrams.
  Hsiang An-shih (Sung dynasty) says that the first part of paragraph 2 is all to be taken as the language of the duke of <i>K</i>âu, the characters being varied; the rest is the remark of the writer of this treatise.
  It is observed that the returning to (the study of Heaven's) ordinances, and changing the wish to contend, in paragraph 4, are not two things, but only one; ‘the ordinances (ming) meaning what is right in principle.’ The wish to contend was wrong in principle, and is now abandoned.
  ‘The robe’ takes the place of ‘the leathern sash’ in paragraph 6; but the sash was merely an appendage of the robe.

[^196]: 276:VII ‘The Great Symbolism’ here is not more satisfactory than in other paragraphs of it which have already come before us. <i>K</i>û Hsî says:—‘As the water is not outside the earth, so soldiers are not outside the people. Therefore if (a ruler) be able to nourish the people, he can get the multitudes (of his hosts).’ Is the meaning this,—that originally the people and soldiers are one body; that a portion of the people are taken out from among the mass, as occasion requires, to do the duty of soldiers; and that the nourishment and education of the people is the best way to have good soldiers ready for use on any emergency? Compare the saying of Confucius in Analects XIII, xxx.
  What is said on the second line, that the general ‘has received the favour of Heaven,’ refers of course to the entire confidence reposed in him by the ruler or king, the subject of line 5. In this way Thien here is equal to Thien wang, so frequent in the ‘Spring and Autumn,’ and meaning—‘King by the grace of p. 277 Heaven.’ But the great powers given to the general are from the king's wish through him to promote the good of all the nation.
  In military operations there must be one ruling will and mind. A divided authority is sure to be a failure. But ‘a retreat’ is no evidence of failure in a campaign. When advance would lead to disaster, retreat is the regular course to pursue.
  Other ways can be found to reward small men. They ought not to be placed in situations where the condition of others will depend on them.

[^197]: 278:VIII ‘Water upon the face of the earth’ is supposed to be an emblem of close union. Of the mere fact of close union this may be accepted as a fair illustration, and of its completeness. Some other symbolism might set forth better the tendency of parties to union, and their seeking it. What is said about the ancient kings is more pertinent to the meaning of the hexagram than in many other applications in ‘the Great Symbolism.’ The king appears in it not only as the centre, but as the cause, of union.
  ‘The other advantages’ under line 1 refer to all the benefits that will result from sincerity and union, which are in themselves good.
  It is hardly possible to make what is said under line 5, on the royal huntings, agree with the account of them given on the same line in the duke of <i>K</i>âu's text. I suspect that there is some corruption of the text. The two verbs ‘neglecting’ and ‘taking’ seem to be used, the one for the other.

[^198]: 279:IX The suitability of the symbolism here is made all to turn on the wind. ‘Wind,’ says <i>K</i>û, ‘is simply the air, without solid substance; it can restrain, but not for long.’ The wind moves in the sky for a time, and then ceases. The process of thought from the symbol to the lesson is not easily traced. Is it meant to say that virtue manifesting itself outwardly—in the carriage and speech—is, however good, but a small matter, admirable in an officer, or even a feudal lord, but that we look for more in a king, the Head of a nation?
  <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze calls attention to the addition to the duke of Kâu's explanation in the notice on line 2, that ‘it is in the central place,’ adding that this explains how the subject of the line restrains himself, and does not go beyond what is due from him.
  Only half of the symbolism in the Text of line 3 is taken up here. Line 1, it is said, is far from line 4, the mauvais sujet of the hexagram, and little affected by it; line 2 is nearer, but, being in the centre, suffers little; line 3 is close on it, and, not being in the centre, comes under its evil influence; while line 6 gives no help.
  Line 4 is weak, and in an even place, appropriate to it; and hence its subject is said to ‘have sincerity.’ Being the first line, moreover, of Sun, the two others take their character from it.
  Line 5, being undivided, and occupying the most important place in the figure, according to the value usually attached to the lines, is p. 280 said ‘to be rich,’ or ‘to have rich resources.’ With these he unites with the ‘subjects’ of line 4 to effect their common object.
  Under line 6 we are told that the restraint is at its height, and the restrained should keep still for a time. The paragraph is metrical. The paragraphs to lines 1, 2, 3, all rhyme together. So do those to 4, 5; and now under 6, we have a couplet:—
    Lo! rain, lo! rest, the power is full!
  Good man! hold hard. Obstructions rule.’

[^199]: 281:X ‘The sky above and a marsh lying below it is true,’ says <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze, ‘in nature and reason; and so should be the rules of propriety on which men tread.’ This symbolism is far-fetched; and so is the application of it, if in any way drawn from it. But it is true that the members of a community or nation must keep their several places and duties in order to its being in a state of good order.
  For lines 1, 2, 3, and 4, see notes on the Text.
  If we might translate the conclusion of what is said on line 5, by—‘in the position that is correctly appropriate to him,’ the meaning would he more clear, though still the assumption which I have pointed out on the Text would underlie the statement; and as evidently as there, what is said under line 6 is but a truism.

[^200]: 282:XI It is difficult to translate the application of ‘the Great Symbolism’ here, so that it shall be intelligible to a reader. <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze says:—‘A ruler should frame his laws; and regulations so that the people may avail themselves of the seasons of heaven, and of the advantages afforded by the earth, assisting their transforming and nourishing services, and completing their abundant and admirable benefits. Thus the breath of spring, calling forth all vegetable life, gives the law for sowing and planting; the breath of autumn, completing and solidifying all things, gives the law for ingathering and storing,’ &c.
  The subject of line 1 has ‘his will on what is external to himself:’—he is bent on going forward.
  <i>K</i>û Hsî explains what is said on paragraph 4, that the upper lines ‘are out of their real place where they are,’ or, literally, ‘have lost their substantiality,’ by the remark that ‘their proper place, as being weak lines, is below.’ The editors of the imperial edition prefer another explanation, on which I need not enter.

[^201]: 283:XII ‘The Great Symbolism’ here is sufficiently explained in the first Appendix. The application, however, is here again difficult, though we may try to find in it a particular instance of the interruption of communication,—in great merit not meeting with its reward.
  The subject of the first line is one of the cluster of small men who are able to change their mind, and set their hearts to love their ruler.
  The subject of the second line is a ‘great man,’ and occupies the place in the centre.
  The subject of the third line is weak, and does not occupy his correct position;—hence the symbolism.
  The fourth line is near the fifth, the ruler's place. It is a strong line in an even place; but acting according to the will of Heaven or of the ruler, its subject gets his purpose carried out.
  The subject of the fifth line is the great man, the ruler in his right place. Hence he is successful, and in the last line, we see p. 284 how the distress and obstruction are come to an end. It was in the order of change that they should do so.

[^202]: 284:XIII The style of ‘heaven and fire form Thung <i>Z</i>ăn’ is such as to suggest the appearance of fire ascending up, blazing to the sky, and uniting with it. The application of the symbolism is again perplexing.
  In line 1, the party just issuing from his gate has all the world p. 285 before him, with which to unite. Selfish thoughts disposing to union have no place in him.
  In line 2, union (only) with kindred implies narrowness of mind. For line 3, see note on the Text.
  In line 4, stress should be laid on ‘yielding to the right.’
  For line 5, see note on the Text.
  The Khang-hsî editors append the following note to the last paragraph: —‘Under line 1 it is said that “union in the open country indicates progress and success,” while here it is only said that “with union in the suburbs there is no cause for repentance.” Beyond the suburbs was the open country, and till the union reached so far, the object of the hexagram was not attained. We may truly say that Confucius was a skilful reader of the duke of <i>K</i>âu.’ Of course the editors did not doubt Confucius' authorship of all the Appendixes.

[^203]: 286:XIV ‘Fire above the sky’ will shine far; and this is supposed to symbolise the vastness of the territory or of the wealth implied in the possession of what is great. The superior man, in governing men, especially in a time of prosperity and wealth, must set himself to develope what is good in them, and repress what is evil. And this will be in accordance with the will of Heaven, which has given to all men a nature fitted for goodness.
  All the comment that is necessary on the symbolism of the several lines may be gathered from the comments on the Text.

[^204]: 287:XV The earth is low, and in the midst of it is a high mountain; but I fail to see how this can symbolise humility. Nor does Regis' representation of it much improve the case:—‘Monte’ (ait glossa) ‘nihil est altius in terra, quae est summe abjecta. At cum is declivis sit, imago esse potest humilis modestiae.’ I find the following note on the paragraph in my copy of the ‘Daily Lessons’(see Preface):—'The five yin lines above and below symbolise the earth; the one yang line in the centre is “the mountain in the midst of the earth.” The many yin lines represent men's desires; the one yang line, heavenly principle. The superior man, looking at this symbolism, diminishes the multitude of human desires within him, and increases the single shoot of heavenly principle; so does he become grandly just, and can deal with all things evenly according to the nature of each. In whatever circumstances or place he is, he will do what is right.' This is certainly very ingenious, but one shrinks from accepting a view that is not based on the component trigrams.
  Under line 1, ‘nourishes his (virtue)’ is, literally, ‘pastures himself.’ He is all humility. That makes him what he is.
  Under line 4, ‘the (proper) rule’ is the rule proper for the subject of the line in his circumstances so near the place of the ruler.
  Under line 5, ‘the refusal to submit’ makes an appeal to force necessary. Even the best and humblest ruler bears the sword, and must not bear it in vain.
  <i>K</i>û Hsî bases all that is said under line 6 on its being a weak line; so that the humble ruler is unable even at the close of the action described in the figure to accomplish all his objects, and must limit his field even in appealing to arms.

[^205]: 288:XVI ‘The Great Symbolism’ here is more obscure than usual. A thunderstorm clears the air and removes the feeling of oppression, of which one is conscious before its occurrence. Is this all that is meant by making the trigrams of the earth and thunder form Yü, the hexagram of harmony and satisfaction? What is meant, moreover, by making the thunder ‘issue,’ as the Chinese text says, from the earth? Then as to the application of this symbolism, I can trace the author's idea but imperfectly. To say that the thunder crash suggested the use of music, as some critics do, is p. 289 absurd. The use of music at sacrifices, however, as assisting the union produced by those services between God and his worshippers, and the present and past generations, agrees with the general idea of the figure. I must suppose that the writer had in mind the sacrifices instituted by the duke of <i>K</i>âu, as related in the Hsiâo King, chap. ix.
  Pleasure has operated injuriously on the subject of line 1. He calls attention to himself.
  Only a part of the symbolism of line 2 is referred to here. Such an omission is not uncommon;—as in lines 3 and 4 also.
  With ‘the memories of the past not perishing’ compare Mencius, II, Section i, chap. 1. 6-13.
  In line 6 the action of the hexagram is over. If one puts off changing his evil way any longer, there remains no more hope for him.

[^206]: 290:XVII An explosion of thunder amidst the waters of a marsh would be succeeded by a tremulous agitation of those waters; so far there would be a following of the movement of the lower trigram by the upper. Then in the application of the symbolism we have an illustration of action following the time, that is, according to the time; which is a common use of the Chinese character Sui. Neither the symbolism, however, nor its application adds much to our understanding of the text.
  Paragraph 1 consists of two lines that rhyme; and paragraphs 4 (two lines), 5, and 6 do the same. According to Kû Yen-wû, paragraphs 2 and 3 also rhyme; but this appears to me doubtful. The symbolism of these paragraphs is sufficiently explained in the notes on the Text. Some peculiarities in their style (in Chinese) are owing to the bonds of the rhyme.

[^207]: 291:XVIII ‘When the wind,’ says <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze, ‘encounters the mountain, it is driven back, and the things about are all scattered in disorder; such is the emblem of the state denoted by Kû.’
  ‘The nourishing of virtue’ appears especially in line 6; all the other lines belong to the ‘helping of the people.’
  The subject of line 1 has entered into the work of his father, and brings it about that his father is looked on as blameless. The ‘due mean’ of line 2 is according to the caution in the Text. The Khang-hsî editors interpret the explanation of line 5 as = ‘he takes up (the course of his father) with all his virtue.’ I think they are wrong.

[^208]: 292:XIX ‘The earth descending or approaching the marsh’ is, according to <i>K</i>û Hsî, symbolical of the approach of superiors to the inferior people, and then the two predicates about the superior man are descriptive of him in that approach, the instruction being symbolised by Tui, and the supporting by Khwăn. The Khang-hsî editors, wishing to defend the explanation of lin by ‘great,’ in Appendix VI, which they ascribe to Confucius, say:—‘Lin means “great.” The earth above the waters of the marsh shows how full those waters are, rising to the level of the earth, and thus expressing the idea of greatness.’ This representation is lame and impotent.
  <i>K</i>û Hsî says he does not understand what is said on line 2. The interpretation in my version is the ordinary one, but I am not satisfied with it. The Khang-hsî editors try to solve the difficulty; but I am not able to follow them.
  The same editors compare the conclusion of paragraph 6 in the symbolism of hexagram 11. ‘What is external’ there, and ‘what is internal here,’ have, they say, the same reference,—the state, namely, of the whole kingdom, the expressions differing according to the different standpoints from which they are made. The view in the translation is that of <i>K</i>û Hsî. It is difficult to hold the balance between them. The newer view, perhaps, is the preferable.

[^209]: 293:XX Wind moving above the earth has the widest sweep, and nothing escapes its influence; it penetrates everywhere. This symbolism is more appropriate to the subject in hand than that of many other hexagrams. Personal influence in a ruler effects much; but the ancient kings wished to add to that the power of published instructions, specially adapted to the character and circumstances of the people. Sun, representing the wind, is well adapted to denote this influence;—see the Analects, XII, xix.
  The looking in line 1 is superficial, and does not reach far.
  Line 3. ‘He will not err in the path to be pursued;’—advancing or receding as is best.
  Line 4. ‘The glory of the kingdom’ is the virtue of the sovereign and the character of his administration. With the sentiment compare Mencius, VII, i, chap. 21. 2.

[^210]: 294:XXI <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze says that thunder and lightning are always found together, and hence their trigrams go together to give the idea of union intended in Shih Ho. The one trigram symbolising majesty and the other brightness or intelligence, the application of the hexagram here is easier and more natural than in many other cases.
  1\. ‘There is no walking:’—that is, the subject of the line will not dare to offend any more.
  2\. ‘“Being mounted on the strong first line” means,’ says <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze, ‘punishing a strong and vehement man, when severity is required, as is denoted by the central position of the line.’
  4\. ‘His light has not been sufficiently displayed;’ that is, there is still something for him to do:—he has to realise the difficulty of his position and be firm.

[^211]: 295:XXII ‘A mountain,’ says <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze, ‘is a place where we find grass, trees, and a hundred other things. A fire burning below it throws up its light, and brings them all Out in beauty; and this gives the idea of ornament, or being ornamented. The various processes of government are small matters, and elegance and ornament help their course; but great matters of judgment demand the simple, unornamented truth.’
  The subject of line 1 does not care for and does not need ornament. He will walk in the way of righteousness without it.
  Paragraph 3 tells us that it is not ornament, but correct firmness, which secures the respect of others.
  In the fourth place, and cut off from line 1 by 2 and 3, we might doubt how far the subject of 4 would continue loyal to the subject of it. But he does continue loyal, through the character and object of the subject of 3.
  The Khang-hsî editors say:—'Line 5 occupies the place of honour, and yet prefers simplicity and exalts economy; its subject p. 296 might change and transform manners and customs;—it is a small matter to say of him that he affords occasion for joy.
  The subject of line 6 has more of the spirit of the hexagram than in most hexagrams. His being clothed in simple white crowns the lesson that ornament must be kept in a secondary place.

[^212]: 296:XXIII A mountain, The application might be deduced from either view.
  It is hard to tell whether ‘the lowest’ in paragraph 1 should be supplemented as I have done. If not, then the explanation is a mere truism.
  <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze is precise and decisive in supplementing the explanation of paragraph 2 as in the translation.
  See on the Text of lines 3 and 4.
  On paragraph 5, the Khang-hsî editors say admirably:—‘The fifth line is weak, and yet occupies the most honourable place in the figure,—emblematic of a queen; and as its subject leads on the subjects of the other lines to obtain the favours given to the inmates of the palace, she, it is plain, has neither jealousy nor any other injurious temper that might incur blame for tending to overthrow the ruler.’
  Paragraph 6 shows the ruler restored to the favour of the people, and the restoration of concord in the state. The small men have done their worst, and there is an end of their attempts for a time.

[^213]: 298:XXIV ‘Thunder in the midst of the earth’ is thunder shut up and silent, just able to make its presence felt. So is it with the first genial stirrings of life after the winter solstice; so is it with the first returning steps of the wanderer to virtue. As the spring of life has to be nursed in quietness, so also has the purpose of good. The ancient statutes here referred to must have been like the present cessation from public and private business at the time of the new year, when all the Chinese people are for a time dissolved in festivity and joy.
  Canon McClatchie translates here:—‘The ancient kings on this culminating day (i. e. the seventh) closed their gates,’ &c. ‘Culminating day’ does not give us the meaning so well as ‘the day of the solstice;’ but where does the translator find the explanatory ‘the seventh,’ which he puts in parentheses? In my own ‘salad’ days of Chinese knowledge I fancied there might be in paragraph 1 of the Text some allusion to a primitive sabbath; but there is no ground for introducing ‘seven days,’ or ‘the seventh day,’ into this paragraph of the Great Symbolism.
  The virtuous subject of the first line' is in paragraph 2 called <i>z</i>ăn, ‘the benevolent’ or loving.' It is the only case in all the symbolism of the Yî where we find that term used as an adjective. It is emphatic here for ‘humanity,’ man in his ideal.
  The other paragraphs present nothing for remark beyond what has been said on the Text of the duke of <i>K</i>âu.

[^214]: 299:XXV The composition of the hexagram is given here in a manner different from what we have met with in the account of any of the preceding figures; and as the text is not called in question, I have made the best I could in the translation of the two commencing clauses. The application of the symbolism to what the ancient kings did is also hard to comprehend.
  The paragraph on line 1 is another way of saying that in the course of things real goodness may be expected to be fortunate,—‘by the appointment of Heaven.’
  Paragraph 2. ‘The thought of getting rich had not risen in his mind:’—he did what he did, because it was right, not because of the gain it would bring him.
  On paragraph 3, it is said, ‘The superior man seeks simply to be free from insincerity, and leaves the questions of happiness and calamity to Heaven.’
  Paragraph 5. Sickness ought not to happen to one who p. 300 is perfectly sincere. If it do happen, he must refer it to some inexplicable will of Heaven. As that has afflicted, so it will cure.’
  Paragraph 6. ‘When a thing is over and done, submission and acquiescence are what are required, and not renewed attempts at action.’

[^215]: 300:XXVI I have quoted, in the Introduction, [p. 37](Introduction_3#p37), <i>K</i>û Hsî's remark on the Great Symbolism here. <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze says:—‘Heaven is the greatest of all things, and its being in the midst of a mountain gives us the idea of a very large accumulation. And so great p. 301 is the labour of the superior man in learning, acquiring, and remembering, to accumulate his virtue.’
  Paragraph 1. The ‘calamity’ is that of opposition from, or repression by, the subject of line 4.
  Paragraph 3. When the action of the hexagram has reached line 6, its work is done. The subject of 6 will no longer exercise repression, but join with that of 3, assisting him to advance.
  Paragraph 4. The subject of line 4 has indeed occasion for joy. Without the use of punishment for crimes committed, by precaution anticipating them, without any trouble he has repressed evil. The ‘joy’ gives place in paragraph 5 to ‘congratulation,’ the people being all interested in the action of the ruler.

[^216]: 302:XXVII I do not think that the Great Symbolism here is anything but that of a thunderstorm, dispersing the oppression that bangs over nature, and followed by genial airs, and the reviving of all vegetation. But there is nothing analogous to the thunder in the application. ‘Words,’ it is said, ‘nourish virtue; food and drink nourish the body.’
  Paragraph 1. As Mencius said, ‘He that nourishes the little belonging to him is a little man.’
  Paragraph 2. Neither the subject of line 1, nor of line 6, is the proper associate of 2.
  The other paragraphs are sufficiently illustrated in the notes on the Text.

[^217]: 303:XXVIII <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze says on the Great Symbolism:—‘The waters of a marsh moisten and nourish the trees. When here it is said that they destroy and extinguish the trees, their action is very extraordinary.’ This explanation is very far-fetched; and so is what the same scholar says on the application of it. I need not give it here, nor have I found, or myself made out, any other more easy and natural.
  Paragraph 2. ‘Such an association is extraordinary:’—the characters also imply, perhaps, that it is successful.
  Paragraph 3. The beam being broken, any attempt to sustain it will have no effect in supporting the roof.
  Paragraph 5. The shoots produced in line 2 will grow into a new and vigorous tree. The flowers here will soon decay, and the withered trunk continue the same. For what will a young man marry an old woman? There will be no children;—it can only be from some mercenary object.

[^218]: 304:XXIX The application of the Great Symbolism is here more perplexing even than usual. What is said of the superior man is good, but there is no reference in it to the subject of danger.
  The subject of line 3 goes and comes, moves up and down, backwards and forwards; making no advance. This can be of no use in extricating him from the danger.
  Those represented in line 4 by the strong and weak lines are the ruler and his minister.

[^219]: 305:XXX In the Great Symbolism Lî is used in the sense of brightness. There was no occasion to refer to its other meaning. ‘The great man’ rather confirms the interpretation of the ‘double brightness’ in the treatise on the Thwan as indicating the ruler.
  Paragraph 2. As yellow is a ‘correct’ colour, so is the due mean the correct course.
  Paragraph 3. ‘The declining sun,’ say the Khang-hsî editors, ‘is an emblem of the obscuration coming over the virtue of the mind.’
  Paragraph 4. ‘None can bear with him’ refers to the second part of the symbolism of the line, which is not given here.

[^220]: 306:XXXI In various ways the waters of a marsh, placed high above the adjacent land, will descend to water and fertilise them. This symbolism agrees sufficiently well with the idea of influence passing between a superior and inferior party in relation with each other. There is nothing in the representation, however, to suggest particularly the relation between husband and wife; and the more I think of it, the more doubtful it becomes to me that king Wan intended by the trigrams of this figure to give the idea of man and wife. The application of the symbolism is sufficiently appropriate. The commentators see in it especially the lesson of humility—emptiness of self, or poverty of spirit—in order that the influences to which we are subjected may have free course.
  Paragraph 1. What is beyond one's self is represented by line 4, a proper correlate of 1. There is the desire to influence; but it is ineffectively exhibited.
  Paragraph 2. ‘Compliance (with the circumstances of his condition and place)’ is merely another way of ‘being firm and correct.’
  Paragraph 3. The language, ‘What he holds in his grasp is low,’ makes <i>K</i>û Hsî and the older commentators generally understand low of lines 1 and 2, and their weak subjects. But ‘following’ leads the mind to the lines above, as the Khang-hsî editors point out. ‘Low’ is to be understood in the sense of ‘mean.’
  Paragraph 4. The ‘being firm and correct’ appears here as equivalent to the want of ‘a selfish wish to influence.’
  Paragraph 5. The triviality of the aim explains the ineffectiveness of the movement, but not its giving no occasion for repentance. That the mei which are moved are behind and above the region of the heart seems too mechanical and trivial an explanation.

[^221]: 307:XXXII How the interaction of wind and thunder symbolises the lesson of the hexagram, and especially the application in this paragraph of that symbolism, is a question I have not been able to solve.
  Paragraph 1. The stress of what is said under line 1 is here made to lie on its being the first line of the figure.
  Paragraph 2. Line 2 is in the centre of its trigram, and that position, here as often elsewhere, symbolises the course of its subject.
  Paragraph 3. The Khang-hsî editors make the application here = ‘nowhere can he bear (to remain).’ <span id="p308"><sup><small>[ p. 308 ]</small></sup></span>
  From paragraph 5 it appears that what is right will vary in different cases. The lesson of the hexagram is perseverance in what is right in each particular case.

[^222]: 308:XXXIII <i>K</i>û Hsî says:—‘The sky is illimitable; a mountain is high, but has its limits; the union of these is an emblem of retiring.’ I do not understand such embleming. <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze says:—‘Below the sky is a mountain. The mountain rises up below the sky, and its height is arrested, while the sky goes up higher and higher, till they come to be apart from each other. In this we have an emblem of retiring and avoiding.’ We feel somewhat as p. 309 if there were a meaning in this; but, as in many other cases, both the symbolism and its application are but dimly apprehended.
  The symbolism of the various lines is sufficiently explained on the Text. Paragraph 5 is but a repetition of the Text without additional explanation.

[^223]: 309:XXXIV In illustration of the symbolism of the trigrams here, <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze says well:—‘Thunder rolling above in the sky and making all things shake is the emblem of great power.’ In passing on to its application he starts with a beautiful saying of antiquity, that ‘the strong man is he who overcomes himself.’ That this thought was in the mind of the writer of the paragraph on the Great Symbolism I can well believe; but the analogy between the natural and the moral and spiritual worlds in passing from the phenomenon of thunder to this truth is a thing to be felt, and that can hardly be described. <span id="p310"><sup><small>[ p. 310 ]</small></sup></span>
  Paragraph 1. ‘This will lead to exhaustion;’ and from that will follow distress and other evils.
  The central position and the due moral mean in paragraph 2 is another instance of the felt analogy referred to above.
  In paragraph 3 nothing is added to the Text; and on the symbolism nothing is said.
  Paragraph 5. ‘He is not in his appropriate place:’ this is said simply because an odd place ought to be filled by a strong line.

[^224]: 310:XXXV The sun rising above the earth, and then travelling up to his meridian height, readily suggests the idea of advancing. On p. 311 the application of this symbolism, Hû Ping-wăn (Yüan dynasty) says:—‘Of strong things there is none so strong as heaven; and hence the superior man after its pattern makes himself strong; of bright things there is none so bright as the sun, and after its pattern he makes himself bright.’
  If the subject of line 1 had received an official charge, then when unrecognised by his sovereign, and obstructed in his progress, his correct course would have been to cease to advance, and retire from the office in which he was not allowed to carry out his principles.
  There is nothing said on line 2 to explain particularly the symbolism of ‘the grandmother’ in the Text.
  ‘The course of procedure’ in paragraph 6 has still an element of force in it, which is more than ‘the firm correctness’ that was to king Wăn the ideal character of a feudal lord, and therefore his light is not yet that of the full-orbed sun.

[^225]: 312:XXXVI The application of the Great Symbolism here is in itself sufficiently natural; but this meaning of the hexagram hardly appears in the text, till we come to the sixth line.
  Paragraph 1. ‘He thinks it right not to eat;’—he does not purposely fast; but when he has nothing to eat, he does not complain. He thinks it right that it should be so in the case.
  Paragraph 2. ‘The proper fashion of acting’ is suggested by the weak line's being in the central place.
  Paragraph 3. ‘The great achievement is accomplished;’ but such achievement was not what prompted to action.
  Paragraph 4. ‘The idea in his inner mind’ is the idea of withdrawing from the position and escaping; but the meaning is obscure. See on the Text.

[^226]: 313:XXXVII The Symbolism here is certainly far-fetched. ‘As wind,’ it is said,‘ comes first from fire, so does transforming influence emanate from the family.’ But the subject of the hexagram is the regulation and not the influence of the family. Then the application is good for the superior man's cultivation of himself; but this again is only connected indirectly with the regulation of the family.
  The sooner preventive measures are presented to the youthful mind the better; but does not prohibition imply that a change in the good will has taken place?
  In paragraph 2 ‘docility’ is suggested by the weak line. ‘The humility’ comes out of Sun, the upper trigram, whose attribute is pliant flexibility.
  Yü Yen (Yüan dynasty) ingeniously observes on paragraph 4 that the riches of a family are not to be sought in its wealth, but in the affection and harmony of its members. Where these prevail, the family is not likely to be poor, and whatever it has will be well preserved.
  The mention ‘of mutual love’ is unusual in Chinese writings, and must be considered remarkable here. ‘The. husband,’ says <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze, ‘loves his helpmate in the house; the wife loves him who is the pattern for the family.’ But however admirable the sentiment is, it comes from the mind of the writer, and is not drawn from the Text.
  Paragraph 6. It is said on this, that the majesty is not designedly assumed or put on; but the effect of the character remoulded and perfected. The words of Mencius are aptly quoted in illustration of the lesson:—‘If a man himself do not walk in the (right) path, it will not be walked in (even) by his wife and children.’

[^227]: 314:XXXVIII The application here of the Symbolism is correct, but neither of them comes up to the idea of disunion which is in Khwei.
  The various paragraphs seem to need no illustration beyond what may be found in the notes on the Text.

[^228]: 315:XXXIX The Symbolism is described here a little differently from the form of it in Appendix I. <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze brings the same meaning out of it, however, in the following way:—‘We have here a steep and difficult mountain, and again on the top of that there p. 316 is water; each of the two trigrams is an emblem of perilousness. There is peril, both above and below, in the figure; and hence it represents the difficulties of the state.’ The application of the symbolism is illustrated by the words of Mencius, ‘When we do not, by what we do, realise (what we desire), we must turn inwards and examine ourselves in every point.’
  From the lesson in paragraph 2 we saw that the moral value of conduct is independent of failure or success. It is said, ‘Though the difficulties be too great for him to overcome, the sage accepts his desire, in order to stimulate others to loyal devotedness.’
  On paragraph 3, Khung Ying-tâ says:—'Of the three lines of the lower trigram only the third is yang, above the two others which are of the yin nature. They cling to it, and are represented as if rejoicing in it.
  The view given of paragraph 4 is that of the Khang-hsî editors.
  ‘The friends’ in paragraph 5 are the subjects of the second line, the correlate of 5, and also of the two other lines of the lower trigram.
  Sû Shih (A. D. 1036-1101) remarks on paragraph 6 that by ‘the inside,’ and ‘the noble,’ we are to understand the subject of line 5.

[^229]: 317:XL It is a common saying that thunder and rain clear the atmosphere, and a feeling of oppression is relieved. The last paragraph of Appendix I, however, leads us to understand the Symbolism of the phenomena of spring. The application seems to refer to the gentle policy of a conqueror forward to forgive the opposition of those who offer no more resistance.
  The subject of line 2 is a minister or officer; and the Khang-hsî editors say that while straightforwardness, symbolised by the arrow, is the first duty of an officer, if he do not temper that quality by pursuing the due medium, which is symbolised by the yellow colour of the arrow, but proceed by main force, and that only, to remove what is evil, he will provoke indignation and rebellion. The ‘three foxes’ are not alluded to in this second paragraph.
  On paragraph 4 the same editors say:—‘The subject of this line is not in the central nor in an odd place; he has for his correlate the subject of line 1 and for his close associate that of line 3, both of which lines are weak in strong places. Hence it is said, that they are all in places inappropriate to them.’
  What paragraph 5 says, that ‘the small men retire,’ means that believing in the sincerity of the ruler's determination to remove all evil men, they retire of themselves, or strive to conform to his wishes.

[^230]: 318:XLI ‘The waters of a marsh are continually rising up in vapour to bedew the hill above it, and thus increase its verdure; what is taken from the marsh gives increase to the hill.’ This is very far-fetched. In the application again the superior man acts only on himself, and for himself;—which has nothing to do with those of low degree giving to those above them. This application, however, agrees with what, as we have seen on the Text, was <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze's view of the meaning of the hexagram.
  The explanation appended to paragraph 1 seems to be to account for the subject of line 1 hurrying away to the help of line 4.
  ‘His aim’ is to abide where he is, and help the subject of 5 by the exhibition of ‘firm correctness.’
  The Khang-hsî editors observe that paragraph 3 is true indeed of three men; and not of three men only, but of many repetitions of thought or action.
  The same editors say on paragraph 5 that 'the blessing from above is explained, by many, of the oracles obtained through divining with the tortoise-shell; but that looking at the text on line 2 of the next hexagram, and that Tî (spoken of there) is the lord of all spirits, the term “above” here is most naturally explained of Heaven's mind, whose acceptance cannot be gainsaid by men or spirits.’
  <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze says on paragraph 6, though I do not see the relevancy p. 319 of his remarks:—‘Dwelling on high, and taking nothing from those below him, but on the contrary giving more to them, the superior man accomplishes his aim on a grand scale. The aim of the superior man is simply to be increasing what others have;—that and nothing else.’

[^231]: 319:XLII The Symbolism here is different from what we gather from the former Appendix. Sun no longer symbolises wood, but, as p. 320 it more commonly does, wind. Thunder and wind, it is supposed, increase each the other; and their combination gives the idea of increase. Then the application, good in itself, must be treated very nicely, as it is by the Khang-hsî editors, in order to make out any connexion between it and the Symbolism.
  Paragraph 1. ‘One in a low position should not move in great affairs;’—not a son, it is said, while his father is alive; nor a minister, while his ruler governs; nor a member of an official department, while its head directs its affairs. If such a one do initiate such an affair, only great success will excuse his rashness.
  Paragraph 2. Line 5 is the proper correlate of 2; and its subject will be among the contributing parties. But others ‘beyond’ will be won to take part with him.
  Paragraph 3. There is a soul of good even in men who seem only evil; and adversity may quicken it.
  Paragraph 6. As in line 2 the attractive power of benevolence is shown, so in line 6 we have the repulsive power of selfishness exhibited. Mark the ‘from beyond’ in both paragraphs.

[^232]: 321:XLIII We can only understand the mounting of the waters of a marsh up into the sky of the phenomenon of evaporation; and certainly the waters so formed into clouds will be condensed, and come down again as rain. This may be taken as an image of dispersion, but not of displacement in the sense of the Text of the hexagram.
  The first clause of the application follows naturally enough from the above interpretation of the Symbolism. <i>K</i>û Hsî says he does not understand the second clause. Many critics adopt the view of it which appears in the translation.
  Paragraph 2 does not mention the precautionary measures taken in the Text by the subject of the line, from which the conclusion would follow quite as naturally as from his central position. The Khang-hsî editors, however, say that the not having recourse lightly to force is itself the due course.
  Line 3 responding, and alone of all the strong lines responding to 6, may appear at first irresolute, and not prepared for decided measures; but 1 in the end' its subject does what is required of him.
  The contiguity of line 5 to the divided 6, is supposed to have some bad effect on its subject, so that while he does what his central position requires, it is not without an effort. ‘If a man,’ says <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze, ‘cherish a single illicit desire in his mind, he has left the right way. The admonition here conveyed is deep.’

[^233]: 322:XLIV Wind, blowing all-under the sky, penetrates everywhere, and produces its natural effect; and it is a good application of this phenomenon that follows; but it has nothing to do with the meaning of Kâu and the interpretation of the hexagram, as taught in the Text. The Khang-hsî editors perceive this, and deal with the Symbolism after a method of their own, on which it is unnecessary to enter.
  Paragraph 1. My supplement, ‘This describes the arrest of,’ is a conclusion from the whole of the Text on the line. All the commentaries have it.
  In the ‘Daily Lecture’ it is said that the lesson of paragraph 2 is that ‘the subject of the line should make the repression of 1 his own exclusive work, and not allow it to pass on to the subject of any of the other lines.’ That view is rather different from the one indicated in my supplement.
  ‘His steps have not been drawn into the course of the first p. 323 line:’—we have to supply, land therefore there will be no great error.’
  Paragraph 4. See what is said on the Text. But that the subject of the line stands alone is owing, it is here implied, to his own impatience. If he could exercise forbearance, he would find a proper opportunity to check the advance of the subject of line 1.
  The subject of line 5, while mindful of his task in the hexagram,—to repress the advance symbolised by 1,—yet keeps his wise plans concealed till the period of carrying them into execution, determined by the ordinances of Heaven, has arrived. Then comes the successful stroke of his policy as if it were directly from Heaven. The subject of line 6 really accomplishes nothing to repress the advance of the unworthy; but he keeps himself from evil communication with them. He is not to be charged with blameable error, though more and better might have been expected of him.

[^234]: 324:XLV What has this Great Symbolism to do with the idea and preservation of union? The question is answered in this way:—A marsh whose waters are high up above the earth must be kept in by banks and dykes, to keep them together, to preserve them from being dispersed. So the union of a people must be preserved by precautions against what would disturb and destroy it. Of such precautions the chief is to be prepared to resist attack from without, and to put down internal sedition.
  Paragraph 3. The topmost line is the last in Tui, whose attribute is complacent satisfaction, appearing in flexibility or docility.
  Paragraph 5. ‘His mind and aim have not yet been brilliantly displayed:’—this is in explanation of the case that some may even still not have confidence in him.
  Paragraph 6. The topmost position is that of the trigram; the subject of the line might bid farewell to all the work of the hexagram; but he cannot bear to do so.

[^235]: 325:XLVI See what has been said on the Great Symbolism in Appendix I. The application which is made of it here may be accepted, though it has nothing to do with the teaching of the Text about the gradual rise of a good officer to high social distinction and influence.
  Paragraph x. Instead of finding in this the three lines of Khwăn and their subjects, <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze makes ‘the upper’ denote only line 2.
  Paragraph 2. The subject of line 2 in his loyal devotion to 5 will do much good and benefit many; hence we have the words, affords occasion for joy.’
  Paragraph 3. ‘He has no doubt or hesitation:’—but this is presuming rather on his strength.
  Paragraph 4. The Khang-hsî editors say:—‘Such an employment of men of worth to do service to spiritual Beings is serving them according to their mind.’
  Paragraph 6. When one has reached the greatest height, he should think of retiring. Ambition otherwise may overleap itself.

[^236]: 326:XLVII The first sentence of the Great Symbolism is constructed differently from any which has presented itself in the previous 46 hexagrams. Literally translated, it would be ‘a marsh with no water is Khwăn;’ and this might certainly suggest to us a condition of distress. But how does this come out of the trigrams? The upper one is Tui, representing a marsh; and the lower is Khân, representing water in a defile. The collocation of the two suggests the running of the water from the marsh or lake into the stream, which will soon empty the other. Such is the view which occurred to myself; and it is the same as that given by <i>K</i>û Hsî:—‘The water descending and leaking away, the marsh above will become dry.’ The application is good in itself, but the concatenation between it and the Symbolism is hardly discernible. <span id="p327"><sup><small>[ p. 327 ]</small></sup></span>
  So stupid is the subject of line 1 that by his own act he increases his distress.
  The Khang-hsî editors say that the ‘ground for congratulation in paragraph 2 is the banqueting and sacrificing.’ I rather think it is the measure of help, which it is intimated the subject will give in removing the straitness and distress of the time.
  See the extract from the Khang-hsî editors on the symbolism of the third line of the Text.
  The difficulties attending the symbolism of the Text of lines 4, 5, and 6 are not lightened by what we find in this Appendix.

[^237]: 328:XLVIII The Great Symbolism here may well enough represent a well, it being understood that the water which is above the wood is that raised by it for irrigation and other uses. What is said, moreover, in the application is more akin to the idea of the hexagram than in most of the other cases. It is certainly one way in which the ruler should nourish the people.

Ii is said on paragraph 1:—‘Those who have a mind to do something in the world, when they look at this line, and its symbolism, will learn how they ought to exert themselves.’
  Rather in opposition to what I have said on the Text of line 4, the ‘Daily Lecture’ observes here:—'The cultivation of one's self, which is represented here, is fundamental to the government of others.’

[^238]: 329:XLIX Wise men, occupying themselves with the determination of the seasons and questions of time, have in all ages based their judgments on the observation of the heavenly bodies. We find this insisted on in the first book of the Shû, by the ancient Yâo. But how this application of the Great Symbolism really flows from it, I must confess myself unable to discover. Once, however, when I was conversing about the Yî with a high Chinese dignitary, who was a well-read scholar also so far as his own literature was concerned, he referred to this paragraph as proving that all our western science had been known to Fû-hsî and Confucius!
  What is said on the several lines is sufficiently illustrated in the notes on the Text.

[^239]: 330:L The Great Symbolism here has come before us in the treatise on the Thwan. Of the application of that symbolism I can only say that, as has been seen in many other hexagrams, while good enough in itself, it is far-fetched.
  The same remark may be made on the explanation of the Text of the first line. I can myself do little more than guess at its meaning. The Khang-hsî editors observe that nothing is said about the case of the ‘concubine’ in the Text; but that it is covered by the following the more noble,' ‘so condensed and complete are the words of the sage!’
  The same editors find a pregnant sense in the conclusion of paragraph 2:—‘There will be no fault in me to which my enemy can point, and his disposition to find fault will be diminished.’
  ‘What was required of the caldron in the third line was that that line and line 5, instead of 6, should be correlates;’ but there is little meaning in such a statement.
  The subject of line 4 cannot be trusted again. He has failed in doing what was his proper work.

[^240]: 331:LI The account of the Great Symbolism here calls for no remark. Nor does the application of it; but may it not be too late to fear, and order anew one's thoughts and actions when the retributions in providence are taking place? Commentators are haunted by the shadow of this question; but they are unable rightly to meet it.
  Paragraph 1 is the same as 2 in Appendix I.
  Paragraph 4. Compare paragraph 4 of hexagram 21, Appendix II.

[^241]: 332:LII According to the view of the Khang-hsî editors, the application should be translated:—‘The superior man, in accordance with this, thinks anxiously how he shall not go beyond the duties of his position.’ It is difficult to decide between this shade of the meaning, and the more common one which I have followed.
  The toes play a great part in walking; but they are here kept at rest, and so do not lose the correct idea of Kăn.
  There is no correlation between lines 2 and 3, and thence the subject of 3 will hold on its upward way without condescending to 2.
  <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze finds an unsatisfactory auspice in paragraph 4. Line 4 represents a great minister who should be able to guide all to rest where they ought to be; but he can only keep himself from agitation.
  Yü Păn (Ming dynasty) says on paragraph 5:—‘Words should not be uttered rashly. Then, when uttered, they will be found p. 333 accordant with principle. But it is only the master of the virtue belonging to the due mean who can attain to this.’

[^242]: 333:LIII The Khang-hsî editors, to bring out the suitability of the Great Symbolism and its application, say:—‘A tree springing up on the ground is a tree as it begins to grow. A tree on a hill is high and large. Every tree when it begins to grow, shows its p. 334 branches and twigs gradually becoming long. Every morning and every evening show some difference; and when the tree is high and great, whether it be of an ordinary or extraordinary size, it has taken years to reach its dimensions. This illustrates the difference between the advance in Shăng (46) and that in <i>K</i>ien. Then the maintenance of extraordinary virtue in the application and the improvement of manners is a gradual process. The improvement of the manners, moreover, flows from the maintenance of the extraordinary virtue; which implies also a gradual operation and progress.’
  Paragraph 1. The danger is the result of circumstances; the small officer has not brought it on himself.
  Paragraph 2. Only the geese appear in this paragraph; but the writer is thinking of the advancing officer. I cannot but think that in the language and sentiment also there is an echo of the Shih King, 1, ix, ode 6.
  The ‘separation from his comrades’ has respect to line 3 not finding its correlate in 6. 'The wife's failing in her proper course' has respect to the line being undivided and not in the centre.
  <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze says, on paragraph 4, that humility and right-doing will find rest and peace in all places and circumstances.
  Paragraph 5. ‘The natural issue cannot be prevented:’—the wife will have a child minister and ruler will meet happily.
  Paragraph 6. See on the Text. But it is difficult to see the aptness of the symbolism.

[^243]: 335:LIV Thunder rolling above is supposed to produce movement in the waters of the marsh below. The combination of this symbolism in Kwei Mei is recognised as an evil omen in the case which the name denotes. The application of it is not inappropriate.
  Paragraph 1. ‘It is the constant practice (for such a case)’ seems to mean that an ancillary wife has no right to the disposition of herself, but must do what she is told. Thus it is that the mean position of the younger sister does not interfere with the service she can render.
  The addition to the Text of 1 the purpose' in paragraph 4 is to show that the putting marriage off is on the part of the lady and not on the other side.

[^244]: 336:LV Lightning appears here as the natural phenomenon of which Lî is the symbol. The virtues attributed to the two trigrams are certainly required in the application of them which is subjoined; but that application has little or nothing to do with the explanation of the hexagram supplied by the Text.
  I hardly understand the conclusion of paragraph 1. My translation of it is according to the view of <i>K</i>û Hsî, if I rightly understand that.
  Paragraph 2. It is by such sincerity that the mind is affected,—that is, the mind of the ruler occupying line 5. <span id="p337"><sup><small>[ p. 337 ]</small></sup></span>
  Line 3 has a correlate in 6, which is weak, and as it were out of the game. The light in 3 moreover is hidden. Hence the symbolism; and through the blindness of its subject his hurt, which unfits him to be employed.
  The line undivided like 4 is 1; perhaps we might translate—‘He meets with the subject of the parallel line.’
  No one but himself has any confidence in the subject of line 6. He holds himself aloof from others, and they leave him to himself.

[^245]: 338:LVI Different attempts are made to bring the idea of a travelling stranger out of the trigrams Kăn and Lî; but none of them is satisfactory. Let Khung Ying-tâ's view serve as a specimen of them:—‘A fire on a mountain lays hold of the grass, and runs with it over the whole space, not stopping anywhere long, and soon disappearing;—such is the emblem of the traveller.’ The application may be derived well enough from the attributes of the trigrams; but does not fit in with the lessons of the Thwan and Hsiang.
  The meanness of the subject of line 1 does not arise from the nature of his occupation; but from his mind and aim being emptied of all that is good and ennobling.
  Strong and trusty servants are the most important condition for the comfort and progress of the traveller; and therefore it alone is resumed and expanded.
  The subject of line 3 treats those below him with violence and arrogance, which of course alienates them from him.
  ‘He has not got into his proper position’ seems to say no more than that 4 is a strong line in an even place.
  It is difficult to say what ‘he has reached a high place’ means. The fifth line is not in this hexagram the ruler's seat; but by his qualities and gifts the subject of it attracts the attention and regard of his friends and of his ruler.
  The spirit that possesses the subject of line 6 is one of haughty arrogance, with which the humility that ought to characterise him cannot co-exist. His careless self-sufficiency has shut his mind against all lessons of wisdom.

[^246]: 339:LVII I have said on the Thwan that some commentators make the upper trigram symbolical of the ordinances of the ruler and the lower symbolical of the obedience of the people. E. g., <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze says:—‘Superiors, in harmony with the duty of inferiors, issue their commands; inferiors, in harmony with the wishes of their superiors, follow them. Above and below there are that harmony and deference; and this is the significance of the redoubled Sun. When governmental commands and business are in accordance with what is right, they agree with the tendencies of the minds of the people who follow them.’
  Paragraph 2 seems to say that the sincerity of purpose indicated by the central position of the second line conducts its subject to the right course, despite the many considerations that might distract him.
  ‘The will is exhausted’ in paragraph 3 intimates that ‘the repeated efforts’ made by its subject have exhausted him. He can now only regret his failures. <span id="p340"><sup><small>[ p. 340 ]</small></sup></span>
  What is said in paragraph 6 proceeds on a different view of the Text from that which I have followed.

[^247]: 340:LVIII The application of the Great Symbolism here will recall to many readers the Hebrew maxims in Proverbs xxvii. 17, 19. The sentiment of it, however, does not readily fit in to the teaching of the hexagram as set forth in the Text.
  There is nothing in the conduct of the subject of line 1 to awaken suspicion. He has as yet taken no action; but it was not necessary to say anything like this about the subject of line 2, his central position being an assurance that he would never do anything of a doubtful character. <span id="p314"><sup><small>[ p. 314 ]</small></sup></span>
  Line 3 should be strong, and the desire of pleasure which is the idea of the hexagram leads its weak subject to the course which is so emphatically condemned.
  Paragraph 5 is incomplete. Does the correctness and appropriateness of the position of the subject of the line afford any explanation of his trusting the subject of the weak line above, who would only injure him? It ought to keep him on the contrary from doing so. The commentators have seen this, and say that the paragraph is intended by way of caution.
  The action of the hexagram should culminate and end in line 5. But the subject of it has not made brilliant attainment in the firmness and correctness by which the love of pleasure should be controlled.

[^248]: 341:LIX The ‘in accordance with this’ must be equivalent to—‘to remedy the state of things thus symbolised.’ What follows certainly p. 342 amounts to this, that the ancient kings considered the services of religion, sincerely and earnestly attended to, as calculated to counteract the tendency to mutual alienation and selfishness in the minds of men. How they operated to have this beneficial effect we are not told. Nor is it easy to account, for the extension of what is said in the Text about the establishment of the ancestral temple to the presentation also of offerings to God. Probably the writer had the same idea in his mind as in the Great Symbolism of hexagram 16, q. v.
  ‘The natural course’ pursued by the subject of line 1 is, probably, that required by the time.
  ‘What the subject of line 2 desired’ would be his success in counteracting the prevailing tendency to disunion.
  The view given of paragraph 5 is that propounded by <i>K</i>û Hsî.
  For paragraph 6 see the note on line 6 under the Text.

[^249]: 343:LX Various explanations of the Great Symbolism have been attempted. E. g., <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze says:—‘The water which a lake or marsh will contain is limited to a certain quantity. If the water flowing in exceed that, it overflows. This gives us the idea of <i>K</i>ieh.’ What is found on the application of it is to my mind equally unsatisfactory.
  The subject of line 1 knows when he might have free course and when he is obstructed, and acts accordingly. He is regulated by a consideration of the time.
  The subject of line 1 ought not to act, and he is still. The subject of line 2 ought to act, and he also is still. The error and the effect of it are great.
  The subject of line 3 shows by his lamentation how he blames himself.
  The other three paragraphs are sufficiently explained in what is said on the Text.

[^250]: 344:LXI Dissatisfied with previous attempts to explain the Great Symbolism, the Khang-hsî editors say:—‘The wind penetrates things. The grass and trees of the level ground are shaken and tossed by it; the rocky valleys and caverns in their sides have it blowing round about them; and it acts also on the depths of the collected waters, the cold of which disappears and the ice is melted before it. This is what makes it the emblem of that perfect sincerity which penetrates everywhere. The litigations of the people are like the deep and dark places of the earth. The kings examine with discrimination into all secret matters connected with them.. even those which are here mentioned, till there is nothing that is not penetrated by their perfect sincerity.’ But all this is greatly strained. The symbolism of the eight trigrams gets pretty well played out in the course of the 64 hexagrams.
  1\. ‘No change has come over the purpose:’—the sincerity, that is, perfect in itself and of itself, continues.
  2\. One bond of loving regard unites the mother bird and her young; so answers the heart of man to man.

[^251]: 345:LXII The Khang-hsî editors endeavour to show the appropriateness of the Great Symbolism in this way:—‘When thunder issues from the earth, the sound of it comes with a rush and is loud; but when it reaches the top of a hill it has begun to die away and is small.’ There is nothing in the Chinese about the hills being high; and readers will only smile at the attempted explanation. The application of the symbolism, or rather of the idea of the hexagram, is good, and in entire accordance with what I have stated that idea to be.
  Nothing can be done to avoid the issue mentioned in paragraph 1, for the subject of the line brings it on himself.
  Paragraph 2 deals only with the symbolism in the conclusion of what is stated under line 2. The writer takes the view which I have given on the Text.
  For paragraphs 3 and 4 see the notes on the Text.
  In line 5 the yin line is too high. If the line were yang, the auspice would be different.

[^252]: 346:LXIII Water and fire coming together as here, fire under the water, each element occupies its proper place, and their interaction will be beneficial. Such is the common explanation of the Great Symbolism; but the connexion between it and the application of it, which also is good in itself, is by no means clear.
  The notes on the different lines present nothing that has not been dealt with in the notes on the Text.

[^253]: 347:LXIV In this last hexagram we have water below and fire above, so that the two cannot act on each other, and the Symbolism may represent the unregulated condition of general affairs, the different classes of society not harmonising nor acting together. The application follows naturally.
  <i>K</i>û Hsî and others suspect an error in the text of paragraph 1; yet a tolerable meaning comes from it as it stands.
  The Khang-hsî editors observe on paragraph 2 that an undivided line in the second place, and a divided line in the fifth place, are both incorrect, and yet it is often said of them that with firm correctness in their subjects there will be good fortune;—such is the virtue of the central position. This principle is at last clearly enunciated in this paragraph.
  <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze says:—‘The subject of line 4 has the ability which the time requires, and possesses also a firm solidity. He can carry out therefore his purpose. There will be good fortune, and all cause for repentance will disappear. The smiting of the demon region was the highest example of firm correctness.’
  Both the symbols in paragraph 6 indicate a want of caution, and an unwillingness to submit one's impulses to the regulation of reason and prudence.
