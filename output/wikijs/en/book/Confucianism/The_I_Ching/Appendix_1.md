Treatise on the Thwan [^124], or king Wăn's Explanations of the entire Hexagrams

## SECTION I

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^125]. 1. Vast is the ‘great and originating (power)’ indicated by <i>Kh</i>ien! All things owe to it their beginning:—it contains all the meaning belonging to (the name) heaven.

2\. The clouds move and the rain is distributed; the various things appear in their developed forms.

3\. (The sages) grandly understand (the connexion between) the end and the beginning, and how (the indications of) the six lines (in the hexagram) are accomplished, (each) in its season. (Accordingly) they mount (the carriage) drawn by those six dragons at the proper times, and drive through the sky.

4\. The method of <i>Kh</i>ien is to change and transform, so that everything obtains its correct nature as appointed (by the mind of Heaven); and (thereafter the conditions of) great harmony are preserved in union. The result is 'what is advantageous, and correct and firm.

5\. (The sage) appears aloft, high above all things, and the myriad states all enjoy repose.

<span id="p214">[<sup><small>p. 214</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^126]. 1. Complete is the ‘great and originating (capacity)’ indicated by Khwăn! All things owe to it their birth;—it receives obediently the influences of Heaven.

2\. Khwăn, in its largeness, supports and contains all things. Its excellent capacity matches the unlimited power (of <i>Kh</i>ien). Its comprehension is wide, and its brightness great. The various things obtain (by it) their full development.

3\. The mare is a creature of earthly kind. Its (power of) moving on the earth is without limit; it is mild and docile, advantageous and firm:—such is the course of the superior man. <span id="p215">[<sup><small>p. 215</small></sup>]</span> 4\. ‘If he take the initiative, he goes astray:’—he misses, that is, his proper course. ‘If he follow,’ he is docile, and gets into his regular (course). ‘In the south-west he will get friends:’—he will be walking with those of his own class. ‘In the north-east he will lose friends:’—but in the end there will be ground for congratulation.

5\. ‘The good fortune arising from resting in firmness’ corresponds to the unlimited capacity of the earth.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^127]. 1. In Kun we have the strong (<i>Kh</i>ien) and the weak (Khwăn) commencing their intercourse, and difficulties arising.

2\. Movement in the midst of peril gives rise to ‘great progress and success, (through) firm correctness.’

3\. By the action of the thunder and rain, (which <span id="p216">[<sup><small>p. 216</small></sup>]</span> are symbols of <i>K</i>ăn and Khan), all (between heaven and earth) is filled up. But the condition of the time is full of irregularity and obscurity. Feudal princes should be established, but the feeling that rest and peace have been secured should not be indulged (even then).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^128]. 1. In Măng we have (the trigram for) a mountain, and below it that of a rugged defile with a stream in it. The conditions of peril and arrest <span id="p217">[<sup><small>p. 217</small></sup>]</span> of progress (suggested by these) give (the idea in) Măng.

2\. ‘Măng indicates that there will be progress and success:’—for there is development at work in it, and its time of action is exactly what is right. ‘I do not seek the youthful and inexperienced; he seeks me:’—so does will respond to will. ‘When he shows (the sincerity that marks) the first recourse to divination, I instruct him:’—for possessing the qualities of the undivided line and being in the central place, (the subject of the second line thus speaks). ‘A second and third application create annoyance, and I do not instruct so as to create annoyance:’—annoyance (he means) to the ignorant.

(The method of dealing with) the young and ignorant is to nourish the correct (nature belonging to them);—this accomplishes the service of the sage.

<span id="p218">[<sup><small>p. 218</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^129]. 1. Hsü denotes waiting. (The figure) shows peril in front; but notwithstanding the firmness and strength (indicated by the inner trigram), its subject does not allow himself to be involved (in the dangerous defile);—it is right he should not be straitened or reduced to extremity.

2\. When it is said that, ‘with the sincerity declared in Hsü, there will be brilliant success, and with firmness there will be good fortune,’ this is shown by the position (of the fifth line) in the place assigned by Heaven, and its being the correct position for it, and in the centre. ‘It will be advantageous to go through the great stream;’—that is, going forward will be followed by meritorious achievement.

<span id="p219">[<sup><small>p. 219</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^130]. 1. The upper portion of Sung is (the trigram representing) strength, and the lower (that representing) peril. (The coming together of) strength and peril gives (the idea in) Sung.

2\. 'Sung intimates how, though there is sincerity in one's contention, he will yet meet with opposition and obstruction; but if he cherish an apprehensive caution, there will be good fortune:'—a strong (line) has come and got the central place (in the lower trigram).

‘If he must prosecute the contention to the (bitter) end, there will be evil:’—contention is not a thing to be carried on to extremity.

‘It will be advantageous to meet with the great man:’—what he sets a value on is the due mean, and the correct place.

‘It will not be advantageous to cross the great stream:’—one (attempting to do so) would find himself in an abyss.

<span id="p220">[<sup><small>p. 220</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^131]. 1. (The name) Sze describes the multitude (of the host). The ‘firmness and correctness’ (which the hexagram indicates) refer to (moral) correctness (of aim). When (the mover) is able to use the multitude with such correctness, he may attain to the royal sway.

2\. There is (the symbol of) strength in the centre (of the trigram below), and it is responded to (by its proper correlate above). The action gives rise to perils, but is in accordance (with the best sentiments of men). (Its mover) may by such action distress all the country, but the people will follow him;—there will be good fortune, and what error should there be?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^132]. 1. ‘Pî indicates that there is good fortune:’—(the name) Pî denotes help; (and we see in the figure) inferiors docilely following (their superior). <span id="p221">[<sup><small>p. 221</small></sup>]</span> 2\. 'Let (the principal party intended in it) reexamine himself, (as if) by divination, whether his virtue be great, unintermitting, and firm;—if it be so, there will be no error:—all this follows from the position of the strong line in the centre (of the upper trigram). ‘Those who have not rest will come to him:’—high and low will respond to its subject. ‘With those who are (too) late in coming it will be ill:’—(for them) the way (of good fortune here indicated) has been exhausted.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^133]. 1. In Hsiâo <i>Kh</i>û the weak line occupies its (proper) position, and (the lines) above and below respond to it. Hence comes the name of Hsiâo <i>Kh</i>û (Small Restraint).

2\. (It presents the symbols of) strength and flexibility. Strong lines are in the central places, and the will (of their subjects) will have free course. Thus it indicates that there will be progress and success.

3\. ‘Dense clouds but no rain’ indicate the movement (of the strong lines) still going forward. The

<span id="p222">[<sup><small>p. 222</small></sup>]</span>

‘Commencing at our western border’ indicates that the (beneficial) influence has not yet been widely displayed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^134]. 1. In Lî we have (the symbol of) weakness treading on (that of) strength.

2\. (The lower trigram) indicates pleasure and satisfaction, and responds to (the upper) indicating strength. Hence (it is said), ‘He treads on the tail of a tiger, which does not bite him; there will be progress and success.’

3\. (The fifth line is) strong, in the centre, and in <span id="p223">[<sup><small>p. 223</small></sup>]</span> its correct place. (Its subject) occupies the God-(given) position, and falls into no distress or failure;—(his) action will be brilliant.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^135]. ‘The little come and the great gone in Thâi, and its indication that there will be good fortune with progress and success’ show to us heaven and earth in communication with each other, and all things in consequence having free course, and (also) the high and the low, (superiors and inferiors), in communication with one another, and possessed by the same aim. The inner (trigram) is made up of the strong and undivided lines, and the outer of the weak and divided; the inner is (the symbol of) strength, and the outer of docility; the inner (represents) the superior man, and the outer the small man. (Thus) the way of <span id="p224">[<sup><small>p. 224</small></sup>]</span> the superior man appears increasing, and that of the small man decreasing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^136]. ‘The want of good understanding between the (different classes of) men in Phî, and its indication as unfavourable to the firm and correct course of the superior man; with the intimation that the great are gone and the little come:’—all this springs from the fact that in it heaven and earth are not in communication with each other, and all things in consequence do not have free course; and that the high and the low (superiors and inferiors) are not in communication with one another, and there are no (well-regulated) states under the sky. The inner (trigram) is made up of the weak and divided lines, and the outer of the strong and undivided: the inner is (the symbol of) weakness, and the outer of strength; the inner (represents) the small man, and the outer the superior man. Thus the way of the small man appears increasing, and that of the superior man decreasing.

<span id="p225">[<sup><small>p. 225</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^137]. 1. In Thung <i>Z</i>ăn the weak (line) has the place (of influence), the central place, and responds to (the corresponding line in) <i>Kh</i>ien (above); hence comes its name of Thung <i>Z</i>ăn (or ‘Union of men’).

2\. Thung <i>Z</i>ăn says:—

3\. The language, ‘Thung <i>Z</i>ăn appears here (as we find it) in (the remote districts of) the country, indicating progress and success, and that it will be advantageous to cross the great stream,’ is moulded by its containing the strength (symbolled) in <i>Kh</i>ien. (Then) we have (the trigram indicating) elegance and intelligence, supported by (that indicating) strength; with the line in the central, and its correct, position, and responding (to the corresponding line above):—(all representing) the correct course of the superior man. It is only the superior man who can comprehend and affect the minds of all under the sky.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^138]. 1. In Tâ Yû the weak (line) has the place of honour, is grandly central, and (the strong lines) above and below respond to it. Hence comes its name of Tâ Yû (Having what is Great). <span id="p226">[<sup><small>p. 226</small></sup>]</span> 2\. The attributes (of its component trigrams) are strength and vigour with elegance and brightness. (The ruling line in it) responds to (the ruling line in the symbol of) heaven, and (consequently) its action is (all) at the proper times. In this way (it is said to) indicate great progress and success.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^139]. 1. <i>Kh</i>ien indicates progress and success. It is the way of heaven to send down its beneficial influences below, where they are brilliantly displayed. It is the way of earth, lying low, to send its influences upwards and (there) to act.

2\. It is the way of heaven to diminish the full and augment the humble. It is the way of earth to overthrow the full and replenish the humble. Spiritual Beings inflict calamity on the full and bless the humble. It is the way of men to hate the full and love the humble. Humility in a position of honour makes that still more brilliant; and in a low position men will not (seek to) pass beyond it. Thus it is that ‘the superior man will have a (good) issue (to his undertakings).’

<span id="p227">[<sup><small>p. 227</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^140]. 1. In Yü we see the strong (line) responded to by all the others, and the will (of him whom it represents) being carried out; and (also) docile obedience employing movement (for its purposes). (From these things comes) Yü (the Condition of harmony and satisfaction).

2\. In this condition we have docile obedience employing movement (for its purposes), and therefore it is so as between heaven and earth;—how much more will it be so (among men) in ‘the setting up of feudal princes and putting the hosts in motion!’

3\. Heaven and earth show that docile obedience in connexion with movement, and hence the sun and moon make no error (in time), and the four seasons do not deviate (from their order). The sages show such docile obedience in connexion with their movements, and hence their punishments and penalties are entirely just, and the people acknowledge it by their submission. Great indeed are the time and significance indicated in Yü!

<span id="p228">[<sup><small>p. 228</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^141]. 1. In Sui we see the strong (trigram) come and place itself under the weak; we see (in the two) the attributes of movement and pleasure:—this gives (the idea of) Sui.

2\. ‘There will be great progress and success; and through firm correctness no error:’—all under heaven will be found following at such a time.

3\. Great indeed are the time and significance indicated in Sui.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^142]. 1. In Kû we have the strong (trigram) above, and the weak one below; we have (below) pliancy, and (above) stopping:—these give the idea of Kû (a Troublous Condition of affairs verging to ruin).

2\. ‘Kû indicates great progress and success:’—(through the course shown in it), all under heaven, there will be good order. ‘There will be advantage in crossing the great stream:’—he who advances will encounter the business to be done. ‘(He should <span id="p229">[<sup><small>p. 229</small></sup>]</span> weigh well, however, the events of) three days before (the turning-point), and those (to be done) three days after it:’—the end (of confusion) is the beginning (of order); such is the procedure of Heaven.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^143]. 1. In Lin (we see) the strong (lines) gradually increasing and advancing.

2\. (The lower trigram is the symbol of) being pleased, and (the upper of) being compliant. The strong (line) is in the central position, and is properly responded to.

3\. ‘There is great progress and success, along with firm correctness:’—this is the way of Heaven.

4\. ‘In the eighth month there will be evil:’—(the advancing power) will decay after no long time.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^144]. 1. The great Manifester occupies an upper place (in the figure), which consists of (the trigrams <span id="p230">[<sup><small>p. 230</small></sup>]</span> whose attributes are) docility and flexibility. He is in the central position and his correct place, and thus exhibits (his lessons) to all under heaven.

2\. ‘Kwan shows its subject like a worshipper who has washed his hands, but not (yet) presented his offerings;—with sincerity and an appearance of dignity (commanding reverent regard):’—(all) beneath look to him and are transformed.

3\. When we contemplate the spirit-like way of Heaven, we see how the four seasons proceed without error. The sages, in accordance with (this) spirit-like way, laid down their instructions, and all under heaven yield submission to them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^145]. 1. The existence of something between the jaws gives rise to the name Shih Ho (Union by means of biting through the intervening article).

2\. The Union by means of biting through the intervening article indicates ‘the successful progress (denoted by the hexagram).’

The strong and weak (lines) are equally divided (in the figure). Movement is denoted (by the lower trigram), and bright intelligence (by the upper); thunder and lightning uniting in them, and having brilliant manifestation. The weak (fifth) line is in <span id="p231">[<sup><small>p. 231</small></sup>]</span> the centre, and acts in its high position. Although it is not in its proper position, this is advantageous for the use of legal constraints.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^146]. 1. (When it is said that) Pî indicates that there should be free course (in what it denotes):—

2\. (We see) the weak line coming and ornamenting the strong lines (of the lower trigram), and hence (it is said that ornament) ‘should have free course.’ On the other hand, the strong line above ornaments the weak ones (of the upper trigram), and hence (it is said) that ‘there will be little advantage, if (ornament) be allowed to advance (and take the lead).’ (This is illustrated in the) appearances that ornament the sky.

3\. Elegance and intelligence (denoted by the lower trigram) regulated by the arrest (denoted by the upper) suggest the observances that adorn human (society).

4\. We look at the ornamental figures of the sky, and thereby ascertain the changes of the seasons. We look at the ornamental observances of society, and understand how the processes of transformation are accomplished all under heaven.

<span id="p232">[<sup><small>p. 232</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^147]. 1. Po denotes overthrowing or being overthrown. We see (in the figure) the weak lines (threatening to) change the (last) strong line (into one of themselves).

2\. That ‘it will not be advantageous to make a movement in any direction whatever’ appears from the fact that the small men are (now) growing and increasing. The superior man acts according to (the exigency of the time), and stops all forward movement, looking at the (significance of the) symbolic figures (in the hexagram). He values the processes of decrease and increase, of fulness and decadence, (as seen) in the movements of the heavenly bodies.

<span id="p233">[<sup><small>p. 233</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^148]. 1. ‘Fû indicates the free course and progress (of what it denotes):’—it is the coming back of what is intended by the undivided line.

2\. (Its subject's) actions show movement directed by accordance with natural order. Hence ‘he finds no one to distress him in his exits and entrances,’ and ‘friends come to him, and no error is committed.’

3\. ‘He will return and repeat his proper course; in seven days comes his return:’—such is the movement of the heavenly (revolution).

4\. 'There will be advantage in whatever direction movement is made:—the strong lines are growing and increasing.

5\. Do we not see in Fû the mind of heaven and earth?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^149]. In Wû Wang we have the strong (first) line come from the outer (trigram), and become in the inner trigram lord (of the whole figure); we have (the attributes of) motive power and strength; we have the strong line (of the fifth place) in the <span id="p234">[<sup><small>p. 234</small></sup>]</span> central position, and responded to (by the weak second):—there will be 'great progress proceeding from correctness; such is the appointment of Heaven.

‘If (its subject and his action) be not correct, he will fall into errors, and it will not be advantageous for him to move in any direction:’—whither can he (who thinks he is) free from all insincerity, (and yet is as here described) proceed? Can anything be done (advantageously) by him whom the (will and) appointment of Heaven do not help?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^150]. 1. In (the trigrams composing) Tâ <i>Kh</i>û we have (the attributes) of the greatest strength and of substantial solidity, which emit a brilliant light; and indicate a daily renewal of his virtue (by the subject of it).

2\. The strong line is in the highest place, and suggests the value set on talents and virtue; there is power (in the upper trigram) to keep the strongest in restraint:—all this shows ‘the great correctness’ (required in the hexagram).

3\. 'The good fortune attached to the subject's not seeking to enjoy his revenues in his own family' shows how talents and virtue are nourished. <span id="p235">[<sup><small>p. 235</small></sup>]</span> 4\. ‘It will be advantageous to cross the great stream:’—(the fifth line, representing the ruler,) is responded to by (the second, the central line of <i>Kh</i>ien, representing) Heaven.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^151]. 1. ‘Î indicates that with firm correctness there will be good fortune:’—when the nourishing is correct, there will be good fortune. ‘We must look at what we are seeking to nourish:’—we must look at those whom we wish to nourish. ‘We must by the exercise of our thoughts seek the proper aliment:’—we must look to our own nourishing of ourselves.

2\. Heaven and earth nourish all things. The sages nourish men of talents and virtue, by them to reach to the myriads of the people. Great is (the work intended by this) nourishing in its time!

<span id="p236">[<sup><small>p. 236</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^152]. 1. Tâ Kwo shows the great ones (= the undivided lines) in excess.

2\. In ‘the beam that is weak’ we see weakness both in the lowest and the topmost (lines).

3\. The strong lines are in excess, but (two of them) are in the central positions. The action (of the hexagram is represented by the symbols of) flexibility and satisfaction. (Hence it is said), ‘There will be advantage in moving in any direction whatever; yea, there will be success. ’

4\. Great indeed is (the work to be done in) this very extraordinary time.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^153]. 1. Khan repeated shows us one defile succeeding another.

2\. This is the nature of water;—it flows on, without accumulating its volume (so as to overflow); it pursues its way through a dangerous defile, without losing its true (nature).

3\. That ‘the mind is penetrating’ is indicated by the strong (line) in the centre. That ‘action (in accordance with this) will be of high value’ tells us that advance will be followed by achievement.

4\. The dangerous (height) of heaven cannot be ascended; the difficult places of the earth are mountains, <span id="p237">[<sup><small>p. 237</small></sup>]</span> rivers, hills, and mounds. Kings and princes arrange by means of such strengths, to maintain their territories. Great indeed is the use of (what is here) taught about seasons of peril.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^154]. Lî means being attached to. The sun and moon have their place in the sky. All the grains, grass, and trees have their place on the earth. The double brightness (of the two trigrams) adheres to what is correct, and the result is the transforming and perfecting all under the sky.

2\. The weak (second line) occupies the middle and correct position, and gives the indication of ‘a free and successful course;’ and, moreover, ‘nourishing (docility like that of) the cow’ will lead to good fortune.




<span id="p238">[<sup><small>p. 238</small></sup>]</span>

## SECTION II

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^155]. 1. Hsien is here used in the sense of Kan, meaning (mutually) influencing.

2\. The weak (trigram) above, and the strong one below; their two influences moving and responding to each other, and thereby forming a union; the repression (of the one) and the satisfaction (of the other); (with their relative position), where the male is placed below the female:—all these things convey the notion of ‘a free and successful course (on the fulfilment of the conditions), while the advantage will depend on being firm and correct, as in marrying a young lady, and there will be good fortune.’

3\. Heaven and earth exert their influences, and there ensue the transformation and production of all things. The sages influence the minds of men, and the result is harmony and peace all under the sky. If we look at (the method and issues) of those influences, the true character of heaven and earth and of all things can be seen.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^156]. 1. Hăng denotes long continuance. The strong (trigram) is above, and the weak one below; (they are the symbols of) thunder and wind, <span id="p239">[<sup><small>p. 239</small></sup>]</span> which are in mutual communication; (they have the qualities of) docility and motive force; their strong and weak (lines) all respond, each to the other:—these things are all found in Hăng.

2\. (When it is said that) ‘Hăng indicates successful progress and no error (in what it denotes); but the advantage will come from being firm and correct,’ this indicates that there must be long continuance in its way of operation. The way of heaven and earth is to be long continued in their operation without stopping.

3\. (When it is said that) ‘Movement in any direction whatever will be advantageous,’ this implies that when (the moving power) is spent, it will begin again.

4\. The sun and moon, realising in themselves (the course of Heaven), can perpetuate their shining. The four seasons, by their changing and transforming, can perpetuate their production (of things). The sages persevere long in their course, and all under the sky are transformed and perfect. When we look at what they continue doing long, the natural tendencies of heaven, earth, and all things can be seen.

<span id="p240">[<sup><small>p. 240</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^157]. 1. ‘Thun indicates successful progress:’—that is, in the very retiring which Thun denotes there is such progress. The strong (line) is in the ruling place, (the fifth), and is properly responded to (by the second line). The action takes place according to (the requirement of) the time.

2\. ‘To a small extent it will (still) be advantageous to be firm and correct:’—(the small men) are gradually encroaching and advancing.

3\. Great indeed is the significance of (what is required to be done in) the time that necessitates retiring.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^158]. 1. In Tâ <i>K</i>wang we see that which is great becoming strong. We have the (trigram) denoting strength directing that which denotes movement, and hence (the whole) is expressive of vigour.

2\. ‘Tâ <i>K</i>wang indicates that it will be advantageous to be firm and correct:’—that which is great (should be) correct. Given correctness and greatness (in their highest degree), and the character and tendencies of heaven and earth can be seen.

<span id="p241">[<sup><small>p. 241</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^159]. 1. Žin denotes advancing.

2\. (In Žin we have) the bright (sun) appearing above the earth; (the symbol of) docile submission cleaving to that of the Great brightness; and the weak line advanced and moving above:—all these things give us the idea of ‘a prince who secures the tranquillity (of the people), presented on that account with numerous horses (by the king), and three times in a day received at interviews.’

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^160]. 1. (The symbol of) the Earth and that of Brightness entering into the midst of it give the idea of Ming Î (Brightness wounded or obscured).

2\. The inner (trigram) denotes being accomplished and bright; the outer, being pliant and submissive. The case of king Wăn was that of one <span id="p242">[<sup><small>p. 242</small></sup>]</span> who with these qualities was yet involved in great difficulties.

3\. 'It will be advantageous to realise the difficulty (of the position), and maintain firm correctness:—that is, (the individual concerned) should obscure his brightness. The case of the count of <i>K</i>î was that of one who, amidst the difficulties of his House, was able (thus) to maintain his aim and mind correct.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^161]. I. In <i>K</i>iâ <i>Z</i>ăn the wife has her correct place in the inner (trigram), and the man his correct place in the outer. That man and woman occupy their correct places is the great righteousness shown (in the relation and positions of) heaven and earth.

2\. In <i>K</i>iâ <i>Z</i>ăn we have the idea of an authoritative ruler;—that, namely, represented by the parental authority.

3\. Let the father be indeed father, and the son son; let the elder brother be indeed elder brother, and the younger brother younger brother, let the husband be indeed husband, and the wife wife:—then will the family be in its normal state. Bring the family to that state, and all under heaven will be established.

<span id="p243">[<sup><small>p. 243</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^162]. 1. In Khwei we have (the symbol of) Fire, which, when moved, tends upwards, and that of a Marsh, whose waters, when moved, tend downwards. We have (also the symbols of) two sisters living together, but whose wills do not move in the same direction.

2\. (We see how the inner trigram expressive of) harmonious satisfaction is attached to (the outer expressive of) bright intelligence; (we see) the weak line advanced and acting above, and how it occupies the central place, and is responded to by the strong (line below). These indications show that ‘in small matters there will (still) be good fortune.’

3\. Heaven and earth are separate and apart, but the work which they do is the same. Male and female are separate and apart, but with a common will they seek the same object. There is diversity between the myriad classes of beings, but there is an analogy between their several operations. Great indeed are the phenomena and the results of this condition of disunion and separation.

<span id="p244">[<sup><small>p. 244</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^163]. 1. <i>K</i>ien denotes difficulty. There is (the trigram expressive of) perilousness in front. When one, seeing the peril, can arrest his steps (in accordance with the significance of the lower tri. gram), is he not wise?

2\. (The language of) <i>K</i>ien, that ‘advantage will be found in the south-west,’ refers to the (strong fifth line) advanced and in the central place. That ‘there will be no advantage in the north-east,’ intimates that the way (of dealing with the <i>K</i>ien state) is exhausted. That ‘it will be advantageous to see the great man,’ intimates that advance will lead to achievement. That the places (of the different lines after the first) are those appropriate to them indicates firm correctness and good fortune, with which the regions (of the kingdom) are brought to their normal state. Great indeed is the work to be done in the time of <i>K</i>ien!

<span id="p245">[<sup><small>p. 245</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^164]. 1. In <i>K</i>ieh we have (the trigram expressive of) peril going on to that expressive of movement. By movement there is an escape from the peril:—(this is the meaning of) <i>K</i>ieh.

2\. ‘In (the state indicated by) <i>K</i>ieh, advantage will be found in the south-west:’—the movement (thus) intimated will win all. That ‘there will be good fortune in coming back (to the old conditions)’ shows that such action is that of the due medium. That ‘if some operations be necessary, there will be good fortune in the early conducting of them’ shows that such operations will be successful.

3\. When heaven and earth are freed (from the grasp of winter), we have thunder and rain. When these come, the buds of the plants and trees that produce the various fruits begin to burst. Great indeed are the phenomena in the time intimated by <i>K</i>ieh.

<span id="p246">[<sup><small>p. 246</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^165]. 1. In Sun (we see) the lower (trigram) diminished, and the upper added to. (But) the method (of action) implied in this operates also above (or, mounts upwards (also) and operates).

2\. ‘If there be sincerity in this method of diminution, there will be great good fortune; freedom from error; firmness and correctness that can be maintained; and advantage in every movement that shall be made. In what shall this (sincerity in the exercise of Sun) be employed? (Even) in sacrifice, two baskets of grain, (though there be nothing else), may be presented:’—for these two baskets there ought to be the fitting time. There is a time when the strong should be diminished, and the weak should be strengthened. Diminution and increase, overflowing and emptiness: -these take place in harmony with the conditions of the time.

<span id="p247">[<sup><small>p. 247</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^166]. 1. In Yî we see the upper (trigram) diminished, and the lower added to. The satisfaction of the people (in consequence of this) is without limit. What descends from above reaches to all below, so great and brilliant is the course (of its operation).

2\. That ‘there will be advantage in every movement which shall be undertaken’ appears from the central and correct (positions of the second and fifth lines), and the (general) blessing (the dispensing of which they imply).

That ‘it will be advantageous (even) to cross the great stream’ appears from the action of wood (shown in the figure).

3\. Yî is made up of (the trigrams expressive of) movement and docility, (through which) there is daily advancement to an unlimited extent. We have (also) in it heaven dispensing and earth producing, leading to an increase without restriction <span id="p248">[<sup><small>p. 248</small></sup>]</span> of place. Everything in the method of this increase proceeds according to the requirements of the time.

the first lines in each changing places. It was the author of this Appendix, probably, who first introduced that absurd notion in connexion with the formation of Sun and Yî.

One rhyme runs through and connects these three paragraphs thus:—

‘Yî spoils the high, gives to the low;
The people feel intense delight.
Down from above to all below,
The blessing goes, so large and bright.
Success will every movement mark,
Central its source, its course aright.
The great stream even may be crossed,
When planks of wood their strength unite.
Yî movement shows and docile feet,
Which progress day by day invite.
Heaven gives; productive earth responds;
Increase crowns every vale and height;
And ceaselessly it hastens on,
Each season's gifts quick to requite.’

<span id="p249">[<sup><small>p. 249</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^167]. 1. Kwâi is the symbol of displacing or removing. We see (in the figure) the strong (lines) displacing the weak. (We have in it the attributes of) strength and complacency. There is displacement, but harmony (continues).

2\. 'The exhibition (of the criminal's guilt) in the royal courtyard' is suggested by the (one) weak (line) mounted on the five strong lines.

There ‘is an earnest and sincere appeal (for sympathy and support), and a consciousness of the peril (involved in the undertaking):’—it is the realisation of this danger, which makes the method (of compassing the object) brilliant.

‘He should make an announcement in his own city, and show that it will not be well to have recourse at once to arms:’—(if he have recourse to arms), what he prefers will (soon) be exhausted.

‘There will be advantage in whatever he shall go forward to:’—when the growth of the strong (lines) has been completed, there will be an end (of the displacement).

<span id="p250">[<sup><small>p. 250</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^168]. 1. Kâu has the significance of unexpectedly coming on. (We see in it) the weak (line) coming unexpectedly on the strong ones.

2\. ‘It will not be good to marry (such) a female:’—one (so symbolised) should not be long associated with.

3\. Heaven and earth meeting together (as here represented), all the variety of natural things become fully displayed.

4\. When a strong (line) finds itself in the central and correct position, (good government) will greatly prevail all under the sky.

5\. Great indeed is the significance of what has to be done at the time indicated by Kâu!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^169]. 1. Žhui indicates (the condition of union, or) being collected. We have in it (the symbol of) docile obedience going on to (what is expressed by that of) satisfaction. There is the strong line in the central place, and rightly responded to. Hence comes the (idea of) union.

2\. ‘The king will repair to his ancestral temple:’— <span id="p251">[<sup><small>p. 251</small></sup>]</span> with the utmost filial piety he presents his offerings (to the spirits of his ancestors).

‘It will be advantageous to meet the great man, and there will then be prosperity and success:’—the union effected by him will be on and through what is correct.

‘The, use of great victims will conduce to good fortune; and in whatsoever direction movement is made, it will be advantageous:’—all is done in accordance with the ordinances of Heaven.

3\. When we look at the way in which the gatherings (here shown) take place, the natural tendencies (in the outward action) of heaven and earth and of all things can be seen..

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^170]. 1. (We find) the weak (line), as it finds the opportunity, ascending upwards.

2\. We have (the attribute) of flexibility and that of obedience; we have the strong line (below) and its proper correlate above:—these things indicate that there will be ‘great progress and success.’ <span id="p252">[<sup><small>p. 252</small></sup>]</span> 3\. ‘Seeking (by the qualities implied in Shăng) to meet with the great man, its subject need have no anxiety:’—there will be ground for congratulation.

‘Advance to the south will be fortunate:’—his aim will be carried out.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^171]. 1. In Khwăn (we see) the strong (lines) covered and obscured (by the weak).

2\. We have in it (the attribute of) perilousness going on to that of satisfaction. Who is it but the superior man that, though straitened, still does not fail in making progress to his proper end?

‘For the firm and correct, the (really) great man, there will be good fortune:’—this is shown by the central positions of the strong (lines).

‘If he make speeches, his words cannot be made good:’—to be fond of arguing or pleading is the way to be reduced to extremity.

<span id="p253">[<sup><small>p. 253</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^172]. 1. (We have the symbol of) wood in the water and the raising of the water; which (gives us the idea of) a well. A well supplies nourishment and is not (itself) exhausted.

2\. ‘The site of a town may be changed, while the fashion of its wells undergoes no change:’—this is indicated by the central position of the strong lines (in the second and fifth places).

‘The drawing is nearly accomplished, but the rope has not yet reached the water of the well:’—its service has not yet been accomplished.

‘The bucket is broken:’—it is this that occasions evil.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^173]. 1. In Ko (we see) water and fire extinguishing each other; (we see also) two daughters dwelling together, but with their minds directed to <span id="p254">[<sup><small>p. 254</small></sup>]</span> different objects:—(on account of these things) it is called (the hexagram of) Change.

2\. ‘It is believed in (only) after it has been accomplished:’—when the change has been made, faith is accorded to it.

(We have) cultivated intelligence (as the basis of) pleased satisfaction, (suggesting) ‘great progress and success,’ coming from what is correct.

When change thus takes place in the proper way, ‘occasion for repentance disappears.’

3\. Heaven and earth undergo their changes, and the four seasons complete their functions. Thang changed the appointment (of the line of Hsiâ to the throne), and Wû (that of the line of Shang), in accordance with (the will of) Heaven, and in response to (the wishes of) men. Great indeed is what takes place in a time of change.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^174]. 1. In Ting we have (symbolically) the figure of a caldron. (We see) the (symbol of) wood entering into that of fire, which suggests the idea of cooking. <span id="p255">[<sup><small>p. 255</small></sup>]</span> The sages cooked their offerings in order to present them to God, and made great feasts to nourish their wise and able (ministers).

2\. We have the symbol of) flexible obedience, and that (which denotes) ears quick of hearing and eyes clear-sighted. (We have also) the weak (line) advanced and acting above, in the central place, and responded to by the strong (line below). All these things give the idea of ‘great progress and success.’

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^175]. 1. <i>K</i>ăn (gives the intimation of) ease and development.

2\. ‘When the (time of) movement (which it indicates) comes, (its subject) will be found looking out with apprehension:’—that feeling of dread leads to happiness. ‘And yet smiling and talking cheerfully:’—the issue (of his dread) is that he adopts (proper) laws (for his course).

‘The movement (like a crash of thunder) terrifies <span id="p256">[<sup><small>p. 256</small></sup>]</span> all within a hundred lî:’—it startles the distant and frightens the near.

‘**He will be like the sincere worshipper, who is not startled into letting go his ladle and cup of sacrificial spirits**:’—he makes his appearance, and maintains his ancestral temple and the altars of the spirits of the land and grain, as presiding at all sacrifices.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^176]. 1. <i>K</i>ăn denotes stopping or resting;—resting when it is the time to rest, and acting when it is the time to act. When one's movements and restings all take place at the proper time for them, his way (of proceeding) is brilliant and intelligent.

2\. Resting in one's resting-point is resting in one's proper place. The upper and lower (lines of the hexagram) exactly correspond to each other, but are without any interaction; hence it is said that ‘(the subject of the hexagram) has no consciousness of self; that when he walks in his courtyard, he does not see (any of) the persons in it; and that there will be no error.’

<span id="p257">[<sup><small>p. 257</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^177]. 1. The advance indicated by <i>K</i>ien is (like) the marrying of a young lady which is attended by good fortune.

2\. (The lines) as they advance get into their correct places:—this indicates the achievements of a successful progress.

The advance is made according to correctness:—(the subject of the hexagram) might rectify his country.

3\. Among the places (of the hexagram) we see the strong undivided line in the centre.

4\. 'In (the attributes of) restfulness and flexible penetration we have (the assurance of) an (onward) movement that is inexhaustible.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^178]. 1. By Kwei Mei (the marrying away of a younger sister) the great and righteous relation between heaven and earth (is suggested to us). If heaven and earth were to have no intercommunication, things would not grow and flourish as they do. The marriage of a younger sister is the end (of her maidenhood) and the beginning (of her motherhood).

2\. We have (in the hexagram the desire of) <span id="p258">[<sup><small>p. 258</small></sup>]</span> pleasure and, on the ground of that, movement following. The marrying away is of a younger sister.

3\. ‘Any action will be evil:’—the places (of the lines) are not those appropriate to them.

‘It will be in no wise advantageous:’—the weak (third and fifth lines) are mounted on strong lines.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^179]. 1. Făng has the signification of being great. It is made up of the trigrams (representing) <span id="p259">[<sup><small>p. 259</small></sup>]</span> intelligence and movement directed by that intelligence. It is thus that it has that signification.

2\. ‘The king has reached the condition (denoted by Făng):’—he has still to make it greater.

‘There is no occasion to be anxious. Let him be as the sun at noon:’—it is for him to cause his light to shine on all under the sky.

3\. When the sun has reached the meridian height, it begins to decline. When the moon has become full, it begins to wane. The (interaction of) heaven and earth is now vigorous and abundant, now dull and scanty, growing and diminishing according to the seasons. How much more must it be so with (the operations of) men! How much more also with the spiritual agency!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^180]. 1. ‘Lü indicates that there may be some small attainment and progress:’—the weak (line) occupies the central place in the outer (trigram), and is obedient to the strong (lines on either side of it). (We have also the attributes of quiet) resting closely attached to intelligence (in the component <span id="p260">[<sup><small>p. 260</small></sup>]</span> trigrams). Hence it is said, ‘There may be some small attainment and progress. If the stranger or traveller be firm and correct as he ought to be, there will be good fortune.’

2\. Great is the time and great is the right course to be taken as intimated in Lü!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^181]. 1. The double Sun shows how, in accordance with it, (governmental) orders are reiterated.

2\. (We see that) the strong (fifth line) has penetrated into the central and correct place, and the will (of its subject) is being carried into effect; (we see also) the weak (first and fourth lines) both obedient to the strong lines (above them). It is hence said, ‘There will be some little attainment and progress. There will be advantage in movement onward in whatever direction. It will be advantageous also to see the great man.’

<span id="p261">[<sup><small>p. 261</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^182]. 1. Tui has the meaning of pleased satisfaction.

2\. (We have) the strong (lines) in the centre, and the weak (lines) on the outer edge (of the two trigrams), (indicating that) in pleasure what is most advantageous is the maintenance of firm correctness. Through this there will be found an accordance with (the will of) heaven, and a correspondence with (the feelings of) men. When (such) pleasure goes before the people, (and leads them on), they forget their toils; when it animates them in encountering difficulties, they forget (the risk of) death. How great is (the power of) this pleased satisfaction, stimulating in such a way the people!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^183]. 1. ‘Hwan intimates that there will be progress and success:’—(we see) the strong line (in the second place) of the lower trigram, and not suffering any extinction there; and (also) the weak line occupying its place in the outer trigram, and uniting (its action) with that of the line above.

2\. ‘The king goes to his ancestral temple:’—the king's (mind) is without any deflection.

3\. ‘It will be advantageous to cross the great stream:’—(the subject of the hexagram) rides in

<span id="p262">[<sup><small>p. 262</small></sup>]</span>

(a vessel of) wood (over water), and will do so with success.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^184]. 1. ‘<i>K</i>ieh intimates progress and attainment:’—the strong and weak (lines) are equally divided, and the strong lines occupy the central places.

2\. ‘If the regulations (which <i>K</i>ieh prescribes) be severe and difficult, they cannot be permanent:’—its course (of action) will in that case come to an end.

3\. (We have the feeling of) pleasure and satisfaction directing the course amidst peril. (We have) all regulations controlled (by authority) in its proper place. (We have) free action proceeding from the central and correct position.

4\. Heaven and earth observe their regular terms, and we have the four seasons complete. (If rulers) frame their measures according to (the due) regulations, the resources (of the state) suffer no injury, and the people receive no hurt.

<span id="p263">[<sup><small>p. 263</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^185]. 1. In <i>K</i>ung Fû we have the (two) weak lines in the innermost part (of the figure), and strong lines occupying the central places (in the trigrams). (We have the attributes) of pleased satisfaction and flexible penetration. Sincerity (thus symbolled) will transform a country.

2\. ‘Pigs and fish (are moved), and there will be good fortune:’—sincerity reaches to (and affects even) pigs and fishes.

‘There will be advantage in crossing the great stream:’—(we see in the figure) one riding on (the emblem of) wood, which forms an empty boat.

3\. In (the exercise of the virtue denoted by) <i>K</i>ung Fû, (it is said that) ‘there will be advantage in being firm and correct:’—in that virtue indeed we have the response (of man) to Heaven.

<span id="p264">[<sup><small>p. 264</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^186]. 1. In Hsiâo Kwo (we see) the small (lines) exceeding the others, and (giving the intimation of) progress and attainment.

2\. Such ‘exceeding, in order to its being advantageous, must be associated with firmness and correctness:’—that is, it must take place (only) according to (the requirements of) the time.

3\. The weak (lines) are in the central places, and hence (it is said that what the name denotes) may be done in small affairs, and there will be good fortune.

4\. Of the strong (lines one) is not in its proper place, and (the other) is not central, hence it is said that (what the name denotes) ‘should not be done in great affairs.’

5\. (In the hexagram) we have ‘the symbol of a bird on the wing, and of the notes that come down from such a bird, for which it is better to descend than to ascend, thereby leading to great good fortune:’—to ascend is contrary to what is reasonable in the case, while to descend is natural and right.

<span id="p265">[<sup><small>p. 265</small></sup>]</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^187]. 1. ‘<i>K</i>î Žî intimates progress and success:’—in small matters, that is, there will be that progress and success.

2\. ‘There will be advantage in being firm and correct:’—the strong and weak (lines) are correctly arranged, each in its appropriate place.

3\. 'There has been good fortune in the beginning:—the weak (second line) is in the centre.

4\. ‘In the end’ there is a cessation (of effort), and ‘disorder arises:’—the course (that led to rule and order) is (now) exhausted.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[^188]. 1. ‘Wei Žî intimates progress and success (in the circumstances which it implies):’—the weak (fifth) line is in the centre.

2\. ‘The young fox has nearly crossed the stream:’—but he has not yet escaped from the midst (of the danger and calamity).

<span id="p266">[<sup><small>p. 266</small></sup>]</span>

‘Its tail gets immersed. There will be no advantage in any way:’—there is not at the end a continuance (of the purpose) at the beginning. Although the places (of the different lines) are not those appropriate to them, yet a strong (line) and a weak (line always) respond to each other.

## Footnotes


[^124]: 213:1 The name Thwan, and the meaning of the character so-called, are sufficiently established. The Thwan are king Wăn's explanations of the entire hexagrams. It seems impossible now to p. 214 ascertain how the character arose, and how it was named Thwan. The treatise on the Thwan is ascribed to Confucius; and I have considered in the Introduction, [p. 30](Introduction_3#p30), whether the tradition to this effect may to any extent be admitted.

[^125]: 214:I The hexagram <i>Kh</i>ien is made up of six undivided lines, or of the trigram <i>Kh</i>ien, Fû-hsî's symbol for heaven, repeated. The Thwan does not dwell upon this, but starts, in its exposition, from the word ‘heaven,’ supposing that the hexagram represented all the meaning which had ever been intended by that term. In paragraphs 1, 2, 4 the four attributes in Wăn's Text (2 being occupied with the second, though it is not expressly named) are illustrated by the phenomena taking place in the physical world.
  In paragraphs 3 and 5, the subject is the sage. He is not named indeed; and Khung Ying-tâ (A. D. 574-648) does not introduce him till paragraph 5, when the meaning necessitates the presence of a human agent, who rules in the world of men as heaven does in that of nature. The ‘connexion between the end and the beginning,’ which he sees, is that of cause and effect in the operations of nature and the course of human affairs. The various steps in that course are symbolised by the lines of the hexagram; and the ideal sage, conducting his ideal government, taking his measures accordingly, is represented as driving through the sky in a carriage drawn by six dragons. <i>K</i>û Hsî extravagantly says that ‘the sage is Heaven, and Heaven is the sage;’ but there is nothing like this in the text.

[^126]: 215:II As the writer in expounding the Thwan of hexagram 1 starts from the word ‘heaven,’ so here he does so from the symbolic meaning attached to ‘earth.’ What I have said on the Text about the difference with which the same attributes are ascribed to <i>Kh</i>ien and Khwăn, appears clearly in paragraph 1. It is the difference expressed by the words that I have supplied,—‘power’ and ‘capacity.’ <i>Kh</i>ien originates; Khwăn produces, or gives birth to what has been originated.
  The ‘penetrating,’ or developing ability of Khwăn, as displayed in the processes of growth, is the subject of paragraph 2. ‘The brightness’ refers to the beauty that shines forth in the vegetable and animal worlds.
  Paragraph 3 treats of the symbol of the ‘mare,’ to lead the mind to the course of ‘the superior man,’ the good and faithful minister and servant.
  See the note, corresponding to paragraph 4, on the Text. ‘Resting in firmness’ is the normal course of Khwăn. Where it is pursued, the good effect will be great, great as the unlimited capacity of the earth.

[^127]: 216:III <i>K</i>un is made up of the trigrams <i>K</i>ăn and Khan; but according to the views on king Wăn's arrangement of the trigrams, as set forth especially in Appendix V, chap. 14, the six others come from <i>Kh</i>ien and Khwăn, and are said to be their children. On the first application of Khwăn to <i>Kh</i>ien, there results <i>K</i>ăn, the first line of <i>Kh</i>ien taking the place of the last of Khwăn; and on the second application, there results Khan, the middle line of <i>Kh</i>ien taking the place of that of Khwăn. McClatchie renders here:—‘The Thun (<i>K</i>un) diagram represents the hard and the soft (air) beginning to have sexual intercourse, and bringing forth with suffering!’ But there is nothing in the Yî, from the beginning to the end, to justify such an interpretation. Nor do I see how, from any account of the genesis by the component trigrams, the idea of the result as signifying a state of difficulty and distress can be readily made out.
  In paragraph 2 there is an attempt from the virtues or attributes assigned to the trigrams to make out the result indicated in the Thwan. To move and excite is the quality of <i>K</i>ăn; perilousness is the quality of Khan. The power to move is likely to produce great effects; to do this in perilous and difficult circumstances requires firmness and correctness. But neither is this explanation very satisfactory.
  The first part of paragraph 3 depicts a condition of trouble and disorder in the natural world occasioned by the phenomena that are symbols of the significance of <i>K</i>ăn and Khan; but this is symbolical again of the disorder and distress, political and social, characteristic of the time. Good princes throughout the nation would help to remedy that; but the supreme authority should not resign itself to indifference, trusting to them.

[^128]: 217:IV The trigram Kăn has for its symbol in the natural world a mountain, which stands up frowningly, and stops or arrests the progress of the traveller. Stoppage, understood sometimes actively, and sometimes passive\]y, is called the virtue or attribute indicated by it. Khan, as I said on [p. 32](Introduction_3#p32), has water for its symbol, and especially in the form of rain. Here, however, the water appears as a stream in a difficult defile, such as ordinarily appears on an approach to a mountain, and suggesting perilousness as the attribute of such a position. From the combination of these symbols and their attributes the writer thinks that he gets the idea of the character (not the entire hexagram) Măng, as symbolical of ignorance and inexperience. See on ‘the Great Symbolism’ below.
  Down to the last sentence of paragraph 2, all that is said is intended to show how it is that the figure indicates progress and success. The whole representation is grounded on the undivided line's being in the central place. It is the symbol of active effort for the teaching of the ignorant in the proper place and time; this being responded to by the divided fifth line, representing the ignorance to be taught as docile, ‘will responds to will.’ But the p. 218 subject of line 2 requires sincerity in the applicant for instruction, and feels that he must make his own teaching acceptable, and agreeable. All this serves to bring out the idea of progress and success.
  Then finally in the young and ignorant there is ‘a correct nature,’ a moral state made for goodness. The efficient teacher directing his efforts to bring out and nourish that, the progress and success will be ‘great;’ the service done will be worthy of ‘a sage.’

[^129]: 218:V Hsü is composed of <i>Kh</i>ien, having the quality of strength, and of Khan, having the quality of perilousness. Thc strong one might readily dare the peril, but he restrains himself and waits. This is the lesson of the hexagram,—the benefit of action well considered, of plans well matured.
  The fifth line, as we have observed more than once already, is the place of honour, that due to the ruler or king. It is here called 'the Heavenly or Heaven-given seat, 'the meaning of which expression is clear from its occurrence in the Shih, III, i, ode 2. 1. Five is an odd number, and the fifth is therefore the ‘correct’ place for an undivided line; it is also the central place of the trigram, indicating. how its occupant is sure to walk in the due mean. See further the notes on the Text, [p. 68](Section_1#p68).

[^130]: 219:VI Paragraph 1 here is much to the same effect as the first sentence in the notes on the Thwan of the Text. It is said, ‘Strength without peril would not produce contention; peril without strength would not be able to contend.’
  2\. ‘A strong line has come and got the central place:’—this sentence has given rise to a doctrine about the changes of trigrams and hexagrams, which has obscured more than anything else the interpretation of the Yî. Where has the strong second line come from? From a hundred critics we receive the answer,—‘From Tun ( ![](image/book/Confucianism/The_I_Ching/hex111000.jpg)).’ The reader will see that if the second and third lines of the lower trigram there be made to change places, there results ![](image/book/Confucianism/The_I_Ching/hex111010.jpg) or Sung. The doctrine of changing the figures by the manipulation of the stalks did spring up between the time of Wăn and his son and that of the composition of the Appendixes; but there is no trace of it in the real Text of the Yî; and it renders any scheme for the interpretation of the figures impossible. The p. 220 editors of the imperial Yî allow this, and on the present passage discard the doctrine entirely, referring to the language of the Thwan on hexagrams 11 and 12 as fatal to it. See the notes there, and the Introduction, pp. 11-16. ‘A strong line has come’ is to be taken as equivalent simply to a strong line is there.’
  What ‘the great man sets a value on being the due mean and the correct place,’ his decision in any matter of contention is sure to be right.

[^131]: 220:VII That ‘multitude’ is given here as if it were the meaning of the name Sze arose, probably, from there being but one undivided line in the figure. That is the symbol of the general, all the other lines, divided, suggest the idea of a multitude obedient to his orders. The general's place in the centre of the lower trigram, with the proper correlate in line 5, suggests the idea of firmness and correctness that dominates in the hexagram. But in the last sentence it is the ruler, and not the general of the host, who is the subject. Compare what is said of him with Mencius, I, i, chap. 3; ii, chap. 5, &c. <span id="p221">[<sup><small>p. 221</small></sup>]</span>
  ‘Perilousness’ is the attribute of Khan, the lower trigram, and ‘docility,’ or ‘accordance with others,’ that of Khwăn, the upper. War is like ‘poison’ to a country, injurious, and threatening ruin to it, and yet the people will endure and encounter it in behalf of the sovereign whom they esteem and love.

[^132]: 221:VIII There is some error in the text here,—as all the critics acknowledge. I have adopted the decision of <i>K</i>û Hsî, which by a very small change makes the whole read consistently, and in harmony with other explanations of the Thwan. ‘The inferiors’ are the subjects of all the other lines gathering round their superior, represented in the fifth line.
  ‘The way has been exhausted:’—they do not seek to promote and enjoy union till it is too late. The sentiment is the same as that in the lines of Shakespeare about the tide in the affairs of men.

[^133]: 222:IX The weak line' is said to occupy ‘its proper position,’ because it is in the fourth,—an even place. The ‘responding’ on the part of all the other lines above and below is their submitting to be restrained by it; and this arises simply from the meaning which king Wăn chose to attach to the hexagram.
  But the restraint can only be small. The attributes of the two parts of the figure do not indicate anything else. The undivided line represents vigour and activity, and such a line is in the middle of each trigram. There cannot but be progress and success.
  It is not easy to explain the symbolism of the last paragraph in harmony with the appended explanations. What <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze, Wang Făng, and other scholars say is to this effect:—Dense clouds ought to give rain. That they exist without doing so, shows the restraining influence of the hexagram to be still at work. But the other and active influence is, according to the general idea of the figure, continuing in operation;—there will be rain ere long. And this was taking place in the western regions subject to the House of <i>K</i>âu, which still was only a fief of Shang. It was not for the inferior House to rule the superior. <i>K</i>âu was for a time restrained by Shang. Let their positions be reversed by <i>K</i>âu superseding Shang, and the rain of beneficent government would descend on all the kingdom. This seems to be the meaning of the paragraph. This is the answer to the riddle of it. Confucius, in his treatise on the Thwan, hints at it, but no Chinese critic has the boldness to declare it fully.

[^134]: 223:X ‘(The symbol of) weakness’ in paragraph 1, according to Wang Shăn-žze (Yüan dynasty), is line 3, urged by the two strong lines below, and having to encounter the three strong lines above. Hû Ping-wan (also of the Yüan dynasty) says that the whole of the lower trigram, Tui, partaking of the yin nature, is the symbol of weakness, and the whole of <i>Kh</i>ien that of strength. The <i>K</i>eh-<i>K</i>ung editors say that, to get the full meaning, we must hold both views.
  Paragraph 2 has been sufficiently explained on the Thwan itself.
  Paragraph 3 has also been explained; but there remains something to be said on the Chinese text for ‘occupies the God-given position,’ or, literally, ‘treads on the seat of Tî.’ Canon McClatchie has—‘The imperial throne is now occupied.’ I think that ‘the seat of Tî’ is synonymous with ‘the seat of Heaven,’ in paragraph 2 of this treatise on hexagram 5. If Confucius, or whoever was the writer, had before him the phrase as it occurs in the Shû, I, 12, the force of Tî will depend on the meaning assigned to it in that part of the Shû. That the fifth line occupies the place of authority is here the only important point.

[^135]: 224:XI There is nothing to be said on the explanation of the Thwan here beyond what has been noticed on the different paragraphs of the Text. Canon McClatchie translates:—‘The Thwan means that Heaven and Earth have now conjugal intercourse with each other .... and the upper and lower (classes) unite together.’ But in both clauses the Chinese characters are the same. Why did he not go on to say—‘the upper and lower classes have conjugal intercourse together;’ or rather, why did he not dismiss, the idea of such intercourse from his mind altogether? Why make the Yî appear to be gross, when there is not the shadow of grossness in it? The paragraph here well illustrates how the ruling idea in all the antinomies of the Yî is that of authority and strength on the one side, and of inferiority and weakness on the other.

[^136]: 224:XII All the symbolism here springs from the trigram Khwăn occupying in the figure the inner or lower place, and <i>Kh</i>ien the outer or upper. It is for the inner trigram to take the initiative; p. 225 but how can earth (symbolised by Khwăn) take the place of heaven (symbolised by <i>Kh</i>ien)? As in nature it is heaven that originates and not earth, so in a state the upper classes must take the initiative, and not the lower.

[^137]: 225:XIII To understand the various points in this commentary, it is only necessary to refer to the Text of the hexagram. The proper correlate of line 2 is line 5, and I have said therefore that it ‘responds to (the corresponding line in) <i>Kh</i>ien.’ The editors of the Khang-hsî edition, however, would make the correlate to it all the lines of <i>Kh</i>ien, as being more agreeable to the idea of union.
  I do not think that a second paragraph has been lost. The p. 226 ‘Thung <i>Z</i>ăn says’ is merely a careless repetition of the three concluding characters of paragraph 1.

[^138]: 226:XIV The position in the fifth place indicates the dignity, and its being central, in the centre of the upper trigram, indicates the virtue, of the lord of the figure.
  The strength of the lord, moreover, is directed by intelligence and his actions are always at the proper time, like the seasons of heaven.

[^139]: 226:XV The Thwan on this hexagram was so brief, that the writer here deals generally with the subject of humility, showing how it is valued by heaven and earth, by spirits and by men. The descent of the heavenly influences, and the low position of the earth in paragraph 1, are both emblematic of humility. The heavenly influences have their ‘display’ in the beauty and fertility of the earth.
  The way of heaven is seen, e.g. in the daily declining of the sun, and the waning of the moon after it is full; the way of earth in the fall of the year. On the meaning of ‘Spiritual Beings (Kwei Shăn),’ see the Introduction, pp. [34](Introduction_3#p34), [35](Introduction_3#p35). It is difficult to say what idea the writer attached to the name. What he says of man's appreciation of humility is striking, and, I believe, correct.

[^140]: 227:XVI What is said in paragraph 1 about the lines has been pointed out in the notes on the Text. ‘Obedience’ is the attribute of Khwăn, the lower trigram, which takes the initiative in the action of the figure; and here makes use of the movement, which is the attribute of <i>K</i>ăn, the upper trigram.
  I can hardly trace the connexion between the different parts of Paragraph 2. Does it not proceed on the harmony produced by the thunderous explosion between heaven and earth, as declared p. 227 in Appendix II? Then the analogy between natural phenomena and human and social experiences comes into play.
  Paragraph 3 is also tantalising. Why does the writer introduce the subject of punishments and penalties? Are they a consequence of putting the hosts in motion?

[^141]: 228:XVII The trigrams <i>K</i>ăn and Tui are distinguished as strong and weak, <i>K</i>ăn representing, on king Wăn's scheme, ‘the eldest son,’ and Tui, ‘the youngest daughter.’ But ‘the strong’ here may mean the strong line, the lowest in the hexagram. As Wang Žung-<i>kw</i>an (Sung dynasty) says:—‘The yang and strong line should not be below a yin and weak line, as we find it here. That is, in Sui the high places himself below the low, and the noble below the mean:’—esteeming others higher than himself, and giving the idea of following. Then <i>K</i>ân denotes the production or excitement of motion, and Tui denotes pleasure; and the union of these things suggests the same idea.

[^142]: 229:XVIII The symbolism here is the opposite of that in Sui. The upper trigram <i>K</i>ăn is strong, denoting, according to king Wăn, ‘the youngest son;’ and the lower, Sun, is weak, denoting ‘the eldest daughter.’ For the eldest daughter to be below the youngest son is eminently correct, and helps to indicate the auspice of great success. The attribute of Sun is pliancy, and that of <i>K</i>ăn stoppage or arrest. The feeble pliancy confronted by the arresting mountain gives an idea of the evil state implied in Kû.
  ‘Three days before and after the turning-point’ is, literally, three days before and after <i>k</i>iâ,' <i>k</i>iâ being the name of the first of the ‘earthly stems’ among the cyclical characters. Hence it has the meaning of ‘beginning,’ and here denotes the turning-point, at which disorder gives place to order. According to ‘the procedure of Heaven,’ history is a narrative of change, one condition of affairs constantly giving place to another and opposite. ‘A kingdom that cannot be moved’ does not enter into the circle of Chinese ideas.

[^143]: 229:XIX See what has been said on the fourth paragraph in pp. [98](Section_1#p98), [99](Section_1#p99) on the Text. The other paragraphs need no explanation beyond what appears in the supplemented translation.

[^144]: 230:XX ‘The great Manifester’ is the ruler, the principal subject of the hexagram, and represented by line 5, near the top of the figure. In that figure the lower trigram. is <i>Kh</i>wăn, representing the earth, with the attribute of docility, and the upper is Sun, representing wind, with the attributes of flexibility and penetration. As is the place of line 5, so are the virtues of the ruler.
  ‘The spirit-like way of Heaven’ is the invisible and unfathomable agency ever operating by general laws, and with invariable regularity, in what we call nature. Compare with this paragraph, the definition of Shăn or Spirit in Appendix III, i, 32; and the doctrine of the agency of God, taught in Appendix VI, 8, 9.

[^145]: 231:XXI The ‘equal division of the strong and weak lines’ is seen by taking them in pairs, though the order in the first pair is different from that in the two others. This is supposed to indicate the intelligence of the judgments in the action of the hexagram. <i>K</i>ăn, the lower trigram, symbolises movement; Lî, the upper, intelligence. The fifth line's acting in its high position does not intimate the formation of the figure from Yî, the 42nd hexagram, but calls attention to the fact that a weak line is here ‘lord of judgment.’ This does not seem natural, but the effect is good;—judgment is tempered by leniency.

[^146]: 231:XXII The first paragraph is either superfluous or incomplete.
  The language of paragraph 2 has naturally been pressed into the p. 232 service of the doctrine of changing the figures by divining manipulation; see [p. 219](#p219), on paragraph 2 of the Thwan of hexagram 6. But as the Khang-hsî editors point out, ‘the weak line coming and ornamenting the two strong ones’ simply indicates how substantiality should have the help of ornament, and ‘the strong line above (or ascending) and ornamenting the two weak lines’ indicates that ornament should be restrained by substantiality. Ornament has its use, but it must be kept in check.—The closing sentence has no connexion with what precedes. Some characters are wanting, to show how the writer passes on to speak of ‘the ornamental figures of the sky.’ The whole should then be joined on to paragraph 3. The ‘figures of the sky’ are all the heavenly bodies in their relative positions and various movements, producing day and night, heat and cold, &c. The observances of society are the ceremonies and performances which regulate and beautify the intercourse of men, and constitute the transforming lessons of sagely wisdom.

[^147]: 232:XXIII ‘The symbolic figures in the hexagram’ are Khwăn, below, the representative of docility, acting as circumstances require; and Kăn, the representative of a mountain, which arrests the progress of the traveller. The superior man of the topmost line thus interprets them, and acts accordingly. Yet he is not left without hope. Winter is followed by spring; night is p. 233 succeeded by day; the moon wanes, and then begins to wax again. So will it be in political life. As we read in the Hebrew prophet Isaiah, ‘In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength.’

[^148]: 233:XXIV ‘The movement of the heavenly revolution’ in paragraph 3 has reference to the regular alternations of darkness and light, and of cold and heat, as seen in the different months of the year. Hâu Hsing-kwo (of the Thang dynasty) refers to the expressions in the Shih, I, xv, ode 1, ‘the days of (our) first (month), second (month),’ &c., as illustrating the use of day for month, as we have it here; but that is to explain what is obscure by what is more so; though I believe, as stated on the Text, that seven days' is here equivalent to ‘seven months.’
  ‘The mind of heaven and earth’ is the love of life and of all goodness that rules in the course of nature and providence.

[^149]: 234:XXV The advocates of one trigram's changing into another, which ought not to be admitted, we have seen, into the interpretation of the Yî, make Wû Wang to be derived from Sung (No. 6), the second line there being manipulated into the first of this; but this representation is contrary to the words of the text, which make the strong first line come from the outer trigram, i. e. from <i>Kh</i>ien. And so it does, as related, not very intelligibly, in Appendix V, 10, <i>K</i>ăn, the lower trigram here, being the eldest son,' resulting from the first application of Khwăn to <i>Kh</i>ien. The three peculiarities in the structure of the figure afford the auspice of progress and success; and very striking is the brief and emphatic declaration, that such progress is ‘the appointment of Heaven.’

[^150]: 235:XXVI In paragraph 1, Tâ <i>Kh</i>û evidently means the ‘grand accumulation’ of virtue, indicated by the attributes of its component trigrams. ‘Substantial solidity’ may very well be given as the attribute of mountains.
  ‘The strong line in the highest place’ of paragraph 2 is line 6, whose subject is thus above the ruler represented by 5, and has the open firmament for his range in doing his work. This, and his ability to repress the strongest opposition, show how he is supported by all that is correct and right.
  In a kingdom where the object of the government is the accumulation of virtue, good and able men will not be left in obscurity.
  What will not a high and good purpose, supported by the greatest strength, be able to do?

[^151]: 235:XXVII Many of the critics, in illustration of paragraph 1, refer appropriately to Mencius, VI, i, chap. 14.
  In illustration of paragraph 2 they refer to the times and court of Yâo and Shun, sage rulers, from whose cherishing and nourishing came Yü to assuage the waters of the deluge, Žî to teach the people agriculture, Hsieh as minister of instruction, Kâo Yâo as minister of crime, and others;—all to do the work of nourishing the people.

[^152]: 236:XXVIII Paragraph 3. In the Great Symbolism ‘wood’ appears as the natural object symbolised by Sun, and not ‘wind,’ which we find more commonly. The attribute of ‘flexibility,’ however, is the quality of Sun, whether used of wind or of wood.
  Paragraph 4. Such a time, it is said, was that of Yâo and Shun, of Thang the Successful, and of king Wû. What these heroes did, however, was all called for by the exigency of their times, and not by whim or principle of their own, which they wished to make prominent.

[^153]: 237:XXIX On paragraph 2 Liang Yin says:—‘Water stops at the proper time, and moves at the proper time. Is not this an emblem of the course of the superior man in dealing with danger?’
  On paragraph 4 the Khang-hsî editors say that to exercise one's self in meeting difficulty and peril is the way to establish and strengthen the character, and that the use of such experience is seen in all measures for self-defence, there being no helmet and mail like leal-heartedness and good faith, and no shield and tower like propriety and righteousness.

[^154]: 237:XXX ‘The double brightness’ in paragraph 1 has been much discussed. Some say that it means ‘the ruler,’ becoming brighter and brighter. Others say that it means both the ruler and his ministers, combining their brightness. The former view seems to me the better. The analogy between the natural objects and a transforming and perfecting rule is far fetched.
  The central and correct position' in paragraph 2 can be said only of the second line, and not of the fifth, where an undivided line would be more correct. The ‘and moreover’ of the translation is ‘therefore’ in the original; but I cannot make out the force and suitability of that conjunction.

[^155]: 238:XXXI Paragraph 2. Tui, the upper trigram, is weak and yin; and Kăn, the lower, is strong and yang; see Appendixes III, ii, 4, and V, 10. Kăn is below Tui; whereas the subject of the lower trigram should always take the initiative in these figures.

[^156]: 239:XXXII All the conditions in paragraph 1 must be understood as leading to the indication of progress and success, which is explained in paragraph 2, and illustrated by the analogy of the course of heaven and earth.
  ‘Movement in any direction,’ as explained in paragraph 3, indicates the ever-occurring new modes and spheres of activity, to which he who is firm and correct is called.
  Paragraph 4, and especially its concluding sentence, are of a meditative and reflective character not uncommon in the treatise on the Thwan.

[^157]: 240:XXXIII ‘The superior man,’ it is said, ‘advances or withdraws according to the character of the time. The strength and correct position of the fifth line show that he is able to maintain himself; and as it is responded to by the weak second line, no opposition to what is correct in him would come from any others. He might therefore keep his place; but looking at the two weak lines, 1 and 2, he recognises in them the advance and irrepressible progress of small men, and that for a time it is better for him to give way and withdraw from the field. Thus there is successful progress even in his retiring.’

[^158]: 240:XXXIV Paragraph 1. ‘That which is great’ denotes, in the first place, the group of four strong lines which strikes us on p. 241 looking at the figure, and then the superior man, or the strong men in positions of power, of whom these are the representatives. <i>Kh</i>ien is the trigram of strength, and <i>K</i>ăn that of movement.
  Paragraph 2. That which is great (should be) correct:—that the ‘should be’ must be supplied in the translation appears from this, that the paragraph is intended to illustrate the text that ‘it will be advantageous to be firm and correct.’ The power of man becomes then a reflexion of the great power which we see working in nature, ‘impartially,’ ‘unselfishly.’

[^159]: 241:XXXV To those who advocate the view that the hexagrams of the Yî have been formed by changes of the lines in manipulating with the divining stalks, the words of paragraph 2, that we have in the figure ‘the weak line advanced and moving above,’ suggest the derivation of Žin from Kwan, whose 4th and 5th lines are made to change places ( ![](image/book/Confucianism/The_I_Ching/hex110000.jpg)). But we have seen that that view is inadmissible in the interpretation of the Yî. And a simple explanation of the language at once presents itself. As Hsiang An-shih (Sung dynasty) says, ‘Of the three “daughter” trigrams it is only Lî which has its divided line occupying the central place of honour, when it is the upper trigram in a hexagram.’

[^160]: 242:XXXVI The sun disappearing, as we say, ‘below the earth,’ or, as the Chinese writer conceives it, I into the midst of, or within the earth,' sufficiently indicates the obscuration or wounding of brightness,—the repression and resistance of the good and bright.
  King Wăn was not of the line of Shang. Though opposed and persecuted by its sovereign, he could pursue his own course, till his line came in the end to supersede the other. It could not be so with the count of <i>K</i>î, who was a member of the House of Shang. He could do nothing that would help on its downfall.

[^161]: 242:XXXVII Paragraph 1 first explains the statement of the p. 243 Thwan, about the wife, represented by line 2; and then proceeds to the husband, represented by line 5. The two trigrams become representative of the family circle, and the wide world without it. In the reference to heaven and earth it is not supposed that they are really husband and wife; but in their relation and positions they symbolise that social relation and the individuals in it.
  Paragraph 2, more closely rendered, would be—‘That in <i>K</i>îa <i>Z</i>ăn there is an authoritative ruler is a way of naming father and mother.’ Does the writer mean to say that while the assertion of authority was indispensable in a family, that authority must have combined in it both force and gentleness?

[^162]: 243:XXXVIII In paragraph 1 we have first an explanation of the meaning of Khwei from the symbolism of Fû-hsî. Then follows p. 244 an explanation from that ascribed to king Wăn, where Tui represents the youngest daughter and Lî the second. The Khang-hsî editors observe that in many hexagrams we have two daughters dwelling together, but that only in this and 49 is attention called to it. The reason, they say, is that in those two diagrams the sisters are the second and third daughters, while in the others one of them is the eldest, whose place and superiority are fixed, so that between her and either of the others there can be no division or collision.
  About what is said, in paragraph 2, on the weak line, as advanced and acting above, see the note on hexagram 35.
  The lesson of paragraph 3 is not unity in diversity, but union with diversity.

[^163]: 244:XXXIX The upper or front trigram is Khân, the attribute of which is perilousness; the lower is Kăn, of which the arresting, actively or passively, of movement or advance is the attribute. We can understand how the union of these attributes gives the ideas of difficulty and prudent caution.
  The explanations in paragraph 2 of the phraseology of the Thwan p. 245 are not all easily followed. It is said that the advantageousness of the south-west is due to the central line in 5; but if we are to look for the meaning of south-west in Khwăn, as in the diagram of king Wăn's trigrams, there is no strong central line in it. May Khân, as a yang trigram, be used for Khwăn?

[^164]: 245:XL 1. The meaning of the hexagram is brought out sufficiently well in paragraph 1 by means of the attributes of the constituent trigrams.
  2\. How it is that the movement indicated in the first condition will, win' all does not immediately appear. The Khang-hsî editors say that ‘moving to the south and west’ is the same as ‘returning back to the old conditions,’ and that ‘winning all’ and acting ‘according to the due medium’ are descriptive of the effect and method without reference to the symbolism. Another explanation might be devised; but I prefer to leave the matter in doubt.
  3\. Paragraph 3 shows the analogy of what takes place in nature to the beneficent social and political changes described in the text, as is done very frequently in this Appendix.

[^165]: 246:XLI 1. All that we see is two undivided lines in the lower trigram, and then a divided one, and exactly the opposite in the upper. But the whole figure could not but have this form from the process of its formation, whether by the gradual addition of the two primitive lines, or by the imposition of the whole trigrams on one another. To say that the upper lines of <i>Kh</i>ien and Khwăn changed places to express the idea of subjects contributing in taxes to the maintenance of their ruler is absurd; and if that thought were in the mind of king Wăn (which I very much doubt), it would only show how he projected his own idea, formed independently of the figure, into its lines.
  On the second sentence, the Khang-hsî editors say:—‘When a minister devotes his life in the service of his lord, or the people undertake their various labours in behalf of their government, these are instances of the ministering of those below to increase those above. But in this way the intercourse of the two becomes close and their aims become the same;—does not the method of action of those below communicate itself to those above?’
  In paragraph 2 the subject of contribution, such as the payment of p. 247 taxes, passes into the background. The Khang-hsî editors say: ‘What is meant by diminishing in this hexagram is the regulation of expenditure or contribution according to the time. This would vary in a family according to its poverty or wealth; and in a state according to the abundance or scantiness of its resources. When it is said that there must be sincerity along with a diminution, it means that though such a diminution cannot be helped, yet what is given should be given sincerely. A small sacrifice sincerely offered is accepted. In the language, “There is a time when the strong should be diminished and the weak be strengthened,” we are not to find the two baskets in the diminution of the strong. “The strong” is what is essential,—in this case sincerity; “The weak” is what is unimportant,—the amount and manner of the offering. If one supplement the insufficiency of his offering with the abundance of his sincerity, the insignificance of his two baskets will not be despised.’

[^166]: 248:XLII 1. The process of the formation of the trigrams here is the reverse of that in the preceding hexagram; and is open to the remarks I have made on that. Of course the people are full of complacency and pleasure in the labours of their ruler for their good.
  2\. The mention of ‘the action of wood’ has reference to the upper trigram Sun, which is the symbol both of wind and wood. From wood boats and ships are made, on which the great stream may be crossed. In three hexagrams, this, 59, and 61, of which Sun is a part, we find mention made of crossing the great stream. It is generally said that the lower trigram <i>K</i>ăn also symbolises wood; but that is obtained by a roundabout process. <i>K</i>ăn occupies the place of the east in Wan's arrangement of the trigrams; but the east symbolises spring, when the growth of vegetation begins; and therefore <i>K</i>ăn may symbolise wood! It was stated on [p. 33](Introduction_3#p33), that the doctrine of ‘the five elements’ does not appear in the Yî. <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze takes wood ( ![](image/book/Confucianism/The_I_Ching/24800.jpg) mû), ‘as a misprint for increase ( ![](image/book/Confucianism/The_I_Ching/24801.jpg) yî).’
  3\. The words ‘heaven dispensing and earth producing’ are based on the fancied genesis of the figure from <i>Kh</i>ien and Khwăn

[^167]: 249:XLIII 1. The last clause of paragraph 1 is good in itself, showing that the strong and worthy statesman in removing a bad man from the state is not actuated by arty private feelings. The sentiment, however, as it is expressed, can hardly be said to follow from the symbolism.
  Paragraph 2. The same may be said of all the notes appended to the different clauses of this second paragraph. Hû Ping-wăn (Yüan dynasty) says:—‘If but a single small man be left, he is sufficient to make the superior man anxious; if but a single inordinate desire be left in the mind, that is sufficient to disturb the harmony of heavenly principles. The eradication in both oases must be complete, before the labour is ended.’

[^168]: 250:XLIV On paragraph 1 the Khang-hsî editors say:—'“The weak line meets with (or comes unexpectedly on) the strong ones;”—the weak line, that is, plays the principal part. The case is like that of the minister who assumes the power of deciding for himself on all measures, or of a hen's announcing the morning;—is not the name of (shameless) boldness rightly applied to it? Hence nothing more is said about the symbol of the bold female; but attention is called to the second part of the Thwan.’
  Paragraph 2 needs no remark. Paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 all speak of the importance of powers and parties meeting together,—in the world of nature, and in the sphere of human affairs. But I do not see how this sentiment is a natural sequel to that in i and 2, nor that it has any connexion with the teaching of the Thwan and Symbolism.

[^169]: 251:XLV The lower trigram in Žhui is Khwăn, whose attribute is docile obedience; and the upper is Tui, whose attribute is pleased satisfaction. Then we have the strong line in 5, and its proper correlate in 2. These things may give the idea of union. They might also give the idea of other good things.
  The Khang-hsî editors say that though all is done in accordance with the ordinances of Heaven' follows the concluding clauses of the Thwan, yet the sentiment of the words must be extended to the other clauses as well. <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze says that ‘the ordinances of Heaven’ are simply the natural and practical outcome of ‘heavenly principle;’—in this case what should and may be done according to the conditions and requirements of the time. So do the critics of China try to shirk the idea of personality in ‘Heaven.’
  With paragraph 3, compare the concluding paragraphs of the Thwan <i>K</i>wan on hexagrams 31, 32.

[^170]: 252:XLVI The explanation of the first paragraph has given occasion to much difference of opinion. Some will have ‘the weak (line)’ to be 4; some 5; and some the whole of Khwăn, the upper trigram. The advocates of 4, make it come from hexagram 40, the weak 3 of which ascends to the strong 4, displaces it, and takes its place; but we have seen repeatedly the folly of the doctrine of changing lines and figures. The great symbolism of Appendix II suggests the proper explanation. The lower trigram, Sun, represents here not wind but wood. The first line, weak, is the root of a tree planted beneath the earth. Its gradual growth symbolises the advance upwards of the subject of the hexagram, fostered, that is, by the circumstances of the time.

[^171]: 252:XLVII 1. One sees the relative position of the strong and weak lines in the figure; but to deduce from that the idea expressed by Khwăn requires a painful straining of the imagination. That idea was in the mind, and then the lines were interpreted accordingly.
  2\. ‘Perilousness’ is the attribute of the lower trigram, and ‘satisfaction’ that of the upper. The superior man, however straitened, p. 253 remains master of himself, and pursues the proper end of principle settled in his mind.
  Why should the subject of Khwăn make speeches, be fond of arguing or pleading,—as the characters say, if we could translate them literally, ‘setting a value on the mouth?’ The reply to this is found in the trigram denoting ‘satisfaction,’ or ‘being pleased.’ The party in the extremity of Khwăn yet wishes and tries to make men pleased with him.

[^172]: 253:XLVIII <i>K</i>ăng Khang-<i>Kh</i>ăng says:—‘Khân, the upper trigram, represents water, and Sun, the lower, wood. This wood denotes the water-wheel or pulley with its bucket, which descends into the mouth of the spring, and brings the water up to the top.’ This may be a correct explanation of the figure, though the reading of it from bottom to top seems at first to be strange.
  Paragraph 2. That the fashion of the well does not undergo any (great) change is dwelt upon as illustrating the unchangeableness of the great principles of human nature and of government. But that this truth may be learned from the strong and central lines only produces a smile. So do the remarks on the other two sentences of the Thwan.

[^173]: 254:XLIX Paragraph 1. Lî, the lower trigram, represents fire, and Tui, the upper, represents water. Water will extinguish fire, and fire again will dry up water. Each, to all appearance, produces a change in the other. Again, according to king Wăn's scheme of the trigrams, as shown on [p. 33](Introduction_3#p33), and in Figure 1, Plate III, Lî is the second, and Tui the youngest daughter. Their wills are likely to differ in love and other things; but this symbolism does not so readily suggest the idea of change.
  2\. The first sentence suggests how the dislike to change on the part of people generally is overcome.
  The second suggests how change proceeding from intelligence and giving general satisfaction will be successful.
  Paragraph 3 tells us how the greatest natural and the greatest political changes are equally successful and admirable when conducted aright.

[^174]: 255:L 1. See the notes on the Text of the Thwan about the figure of a caldron in Ting. Its component trigrams are Sun representing wood, and Lî representing fire; which may very well suggest the idea of cooking. The last sentence of the paragraph is entirely after the style of ‘the Great Symbolism.’ The Khang-hsî editors say that the distinction between Žing and Ting appears here very clearly, the former relating to the nourishment of the people, and the latter to the nourishing men of worth. They add that the reality of the offerings to God is such nourishing. ‘God’ is here Shang Tî, which Canon McClatchie translates ‘the First Emperor,’ adding in a note, ‘The Chinese Jupiter, the Emperor of gods and men!’
  2\. The first sentence deduces the sentiment of the Thwan from the attributes or virtues of the trigrams with considerable amplification of the virtue of Lî. The second line of Lî, as being divided, calls forth in other hexagrams the same notice as here. It is the most important line in the figure, and being responded to by the strong 2, gives an indication of the ‘great progress and success.’

[^175]: 256:LI Paragraph 1. See what is said on the Text.
  2\. The explanations of the. Thwan here are good; but in no way deduced from the figure.
  3\. The portion of the text printed in a different type is supposed to have dropt out of the Chinese copies. The explanation of it that follows is based on Wăn's view of <i>K</i>ăn as representing the oldest son. See on the Text.

[^176]: 256:LII 1. The Khang-hsî editors give their opinion that what is said in the first sentence of this paragraph, after the explanation of the name, illustrates the first sentence of the Thwan, and that the other sentence illustrates the: rest of the Thwan. It may be so, but the whole of the Thwan appears in paragraph 2.
  2\. The hexagram being made up of Kăn repeated, lines 1, 2, 3 are of course the same as 4, 5, and 6. But it will be seen that there is not a proper correlation among them all. I do not see, p. 257 however, that this furnishes any ground for the entire obliviousness of self, which the Th wan makes out to be in the figure.

[^177]: 257:LIII The first sentence of paragraph 2 describes the lines from 2 to 5 all getting into their proper places, as has been pointed out on the Text, and that sentence is symbolical of what is said in the second. ‘The rectification of the country’ is the reality of ‘the successful progress.’
  ‘The strong undivided line’ in paragraph 3 is the fifth of the figure.
  Out of rest comes movement to go on for an indefinite time, and be succeeded by rest again;—as says paragraph 4.

[^178]: 258:LIV 1. Kwei Mei in this Appendix has the meaning simply of marriage, and for Mei we might substitute Nü ,‘daughter’ or ‘young lady.’ This appears from the writer's going on to point out, as elsewhere, the analogy between the growth of things in nature from the interaction of heaven and earth and the increase of mankind through marriage. He does this with a delicate touch. There is no grossness in the original any more than there is in the translation.
  But how are we to reconcile this reference to the action of heaven and earth with the bad auspice of the Thwan? The Khang-hsî editors felt the pressure of this difficulty, and they adduce a similar inconsistency in the account of hexagram 44 in this treatise, adding, ‘From this we may say that the interaction of the yin and yang cannot be dispensed with, but that we ought to be careful about it in the beginning in order to prevent mischief in the end. This is the doctrine of the Yî.’ This is very well, but it is no solution of the difficulty. The editors could not admit that the author of the Appendix did not understand or did not deal fairly with the Text; for that author, they thought, was Confucius.
  2\. The same editors say that paragraph 2 implies both that the desire for the marriage originated with the lady, and that she was aware that the gentleman was older than herself.
  3\. The position of a divided line above an undivided is always represented as an evil omen; it is difficult to understand why. There is less of an appearance of reason about it than in some other things which are said about the lines. The lines are where they cannot but be from the way in which the figures were formed.

[^179]: 259:LV The Khang-hsî editors remark that paragraph 1 is not so much explaining the meaning of the name Făng, as; accounting for the hexagram, composed of Lî and <i>K</i>ăn, having such a meaning.
  Paragraph 3 seems rather contrary to the lesson of the hexagram. According to it, prosperity cannot be maintained, any more than we can have the other seasons without winter or perpetual day without night; but the object of the essay is to exhort to the maintenance of prosperity. Is it the case that the rise of every commonwealth and cause must be followed by its decay and fall? The mind refuses to admit the changes of the seasons, &c., as a true analogy for all moral and intellectual movements. See an important remark on the concluding sentence in the Introduction, pp. [34](Introduction_3#p34), [35](Introduction_3#p35).

[^180]: 260:LVI What is said in paragraph 1 is intended to explain the Thwan, and not to account for the meaning of the name Lü. It is assumed that Lü means a stranger; and the writer from the position of the fifth line, and from the attributes of the component trigrams, derives the ideas of humility, docility, a quiet restfulness, and intelligence as the characteristics proper to a stranger, and which are likely to lead to his attaining what he desires, and then advancing.

[^181]: 260:LVII 1. The language of this paragraph has often occurred to me in reading commands and addresses issued by the emperors of China, such as the essays on the precepts in what is called the Sacred Edict, the reiteration employed in many of which is remarkable.
  Paragraph 2. The ‘obedience of the weak lines to the strong ones’ grows, in a way not very perceptible, from the idea of the hexagram, and the quality of the trigram as denoting penetration and flexibility.

[^182]: 261:LVIII The feeling of pleasure going before the people and leading them on to endure toil and encounter death must be supposed to be produced in them by the example and lessons of their ruler. La Fad-hsien paraphrases this portion of the text thus:—‘When the sage with this precedes them, he can make them endure toil without any wish to decline it, and go with him into difficulty and danger without their having any fear.’ I think this was intended to be the teaching of the hexagram, but the positive expression of it is hardly discernible.

[^183]: 262:LIX 1. This paragraph has been partially anticipated in the notes on the Thwan. The second line is said to suffer ‘no extinction,’ because the lower trigram is that of peril. The Khang-hsî editors say that the former part of this paragraph shows how the root of the work of the hexagram is strengthened, and the latter part how the execution of that work is secured.
  The conclusion of paragraph 2 is, literally, ‘The king indeed is in the middle.’ This does not mean, as some say, that the king is in the middle of the temple, but that his mind or heart is exactly set on the central truth of what is right and good.
  The upper trigram Sun represents both wind and wood. To explain the meaning of Hwan, the significance of wind is taken; the writer here seizes on that of wood, as furnishing materials for a boat in which the great stream can be crossed.

[^184]: 262:LX Paragraph 1. See what is said on the Text of the Thwan.
    <span id="p263">[<sup><small>p. 263</small></sup>]</span>
  ‘Its course will come to an end’ is the opposite of the intimation in <i>K</i>ieh of progress and attainment.
  In paragraph 3 the writer re-turns to this intimation of the figure:—by the attributes of the trigrams; by the appropriate positions of lines 4 and 5; and boy the central and correct place of 5.
  Paragraph 4 illustrates the importance of doing things according to rule by reference to the operations of nature and the enactments and institutions of sage rulers.

[^185]: 263:LXI 1. The structure of the lineal figure which is here insisted on has been pointed out in explaining the Thwan. On what is further said as to the attributes of the trigrams and their effect, <i>Kh</i>ăng-žze observes:—‘We have in the sincerity shown in the upper trigram superiors condescending to those below them in accordance with their peculiarities, and we have in that of the lower those below delighted to follow their superiors. The combination of these two things leads to the transformation of the country and state.’
  Paragraph 2. The two divided lines in the middle of the figure are supposed to give the semblance of an empty boat, and an p. 264 empty boat, it is said (with doubtful truth), is not liable to be upset. The trigram Sun symbolises both wind and wood.
  A good commentary on paragraph 3 is supplied in many passages of ‘the Doctrine of the Mean,’ e. g. chap. 20. 18:—‘Sincerity is the way of Heaven. The attainment of sincerity is the way of men.’

[^186]: 264:LXII Paragraph 1. That the small lines exceed the others appears at a glance. The intimation of progress and attainment is less clear. Compare the first paragraph of Appendix I to hexagram 33.
  ‘The requirements of the time’ in paragraph 2 cannot make p. 265 right wrong or wrong right; but they may modify the conventional course to be taken in any particular case.
  It is easy to explain paragraphs 3 and 4, but what is said in them carries no conviction to the mind.
  The sentiment of paragraph 5 is good, apart from the symbolism, which is only perplexing.

[^187]: 265:LXIII For paragraphs 1 and 2, see the note on the Text of the Thwan.
  It is difficult to see the concatenation in paragraph 3 between the sentiment of the Thwan and the nature of the second line. The Khang-hsî editors compare this hexagram and the next with 11 and 12, observing that the goodness of Thâi (11) is concentrated, as here, in the second line.
  The sentiment of paragraph 4 is that which we have often met with,—that things move on with a constant process of change. Disorder succeeds to order, and again order to disorder.

[^188]: 266:LXIV Paragraph 1. The indication is derived from the fifth line, divided, which is in the ruler's place. It occupies a strong place, has for its correlate the strong 2, and is itself in the centre of the yin trigram Lî.
  Paragraph 2. Line 2 represents ‘the young fox.’ A strong line in the midst of the trigram of peril, its subject will be restless; and responding to the ruler in 5, he will be forward and incautious in taking action. The issue will be evil, and the latter end different from the beginning. What is said in the last sentence shows further how Wei Žî indicates progress.
