Treatise on the Hexagrams taken promiscuously, according to the opposition or diversity of their meaning.

This last of the Appendixes is touched on very briefly in the concluding paragraph of the Introduction, [p. 55](Introduction_3#p55). It is stated there to be in rhyme, and I have endeavoured to give a similar form to the following version of it. The rhymes and length of the lines in the original, however, are very irregular, and I found it impossible to reproduce that irregularity in English.

1, 2. Strength in _Kh_ien, weakness in Khwăn we find.

8, 7. Pî shows us joy, and Sze the anxious mind.

19, 20. Lin gives, Kwân seeks;—such are the several themes

Their different figures were to teach designed.

3\. _K_un manifests itself, yet keeps its place;

4\. 'Mid darkness still, to light Măng sets its face.

51, 52. _K_ăn starts; Kăn stops. In Sun and Yî are seen

41, 42. How fulness and decay their course begin.

26\. Tâ _Kh_û keeps still, and waits the proper time.

25\. Wû Wang sets forth how evil springs from crime. <span id="p442">[<sup><small>p. 442</small></sup>]</span> 45, 46. Good men in Žhui collect; in Shang they rise:

15, 16. _Kh_ien itself, Yü others doth despise.

21, 22. Shih Ho takes eating for its theme; and Pî

Takes what is plain, from ornament quite free.

58, 57. Tui shows its scope, but Sun's we do not see.

17, 18. Sui quits the old; Kû makes a new decree.

23\. We see in Po its subject worn away;

24\. And Fû shows its recovering from decay.

35\. Above in Žin the sun shines clear and bright;

36\. But in Ming Î 'tis hidden from the sight.

48,47. Progress in Žing in Khwăn encounters blight.

31\. Effect quick answering cause in Hsien appears;

32\. While Hăng denotes continuance for years.

59,60. Hwân scatters; but Žieh its code of rules uprears.

40\. Relief and ease with _K_ieh are sure to come;

41\. Hard toil and danger have in _K_ien their home.

38\. Khwei looks on others as beyond its care;

37\. Kiâ _Z_ăn all includes within its sphere. <span id="p443">[<sup><small>p. 443</small></sup>]</span> 12, 11. While Phî and Thâi their different scopes prefer,

34, 33. Tâ _K_wang stops here as right; withdraws Thun there.

14\. Tâ Yû adhering multitudes can show;

13\. Thung _Z_ăn reflects their warm affection's glow.

50, 51. Ting takes what's new; the old is left by Ko.

61, 62. Sincere is _K_ung Fû; but exceeds, Hsiâo Kwo.

55, 56. Făng tells of trouble; Lü can boast few friends.

30, 29. Fire mounts in Lî; water in Khân descends.

9\. Hsiâo _Kh_û with few 'gainst many foes contends.

10\. Movement in Lî, unresting, never ends.

5\. Hsü shows its subject making no advance:

6\. In Sung we seek in vain a friendly glance;

28\. And Tâ Kwo's overthrown with sad mischance.

44\. Kâu shows a meeting, where the many strong

Are met by one that's weak, yet struggles long.

53\. In _K_ien we see a bride who will delay

To move until the bridegroom takes his way.

27\. Body and mind are nourished right in Î;

63\. All things are well established in Kî Žî. <span id="p444">[<sup><small>p. 444</small></sup>]</span> 54\. Kwei Mei reveals how ends the virgin life;

64\. Wei Žî how fails the youth (to get a wife).

43\. The strong disperse the weak; Kwâi teaches so.

Prospers the good man's way; to grief all small men go.
