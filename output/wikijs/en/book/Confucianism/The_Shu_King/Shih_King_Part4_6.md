KING Wăn, it has been seen, had for his capital the city of Făng, from which his son, king Wû, moved the seat of government to Hâo. In the time of king <i>Kh</i>ăng, a city was built by the duke <span id="p439"><sup><small>[ p. 439 ]</small></sup></span> of Kâu, near the present Lo-yang, and called ‘the eastern capital.’ Meetings of the princes of the states assembled there; but the court continued to be held at Hâo till the accession of king Phing in B.C. 770. From that time, the kings of <i>K</i>âu sank nearly to the level of the princes of the states, and the poems collected in their domain were classed among the ‘Lessons of Manners from the States,’ though still distinguished by the epithet ‘royal’ prefixed to them.

### ODE 1, STANZA 1. THE SHÛ-LÎ.

AN OFFICER DESCRIBES HIS MELANCHOLY AND REFLECTIONS ON SEEING THE DESOLATION OF THE OLD CAPITAL OF <i>K</i>ÂU, MAKING HIS MOAN TO HEAVEN BECAUSE OF IT.

There is no specific mention of the old. capital of <i>K</i>âu in the piece, but the schools of Mâo and <i>K</i>û are agreed in this interpretation, which is much more likely than any of the others that have been proposed.

There was the millet with its drooping heads; There was the sacrificial millet coming into blade [^613]. Slowly I moved about, In my heart all-agitated. Those who knew me said I was sad at heart. Those who did not know me, Said I was seeking for something. O thou distant and azure Heaven [^614]! By what man was this (brought about) [^615]?

### ODE 9, STANZAS 1 AND 3. THE TÂ KÜ.

A LADY EXCUSES HERSELF FOR NOT FLYING TO HER LOVER BY HER FEAR OF A SEVERE AND VIRTUOUS MAGISTRATE, AND SWEARS TO HIS THAT SHE IS SINCERE IN HER ATTACHMENT TO HIM.

His great carriage rolls along, And his robes of rank glitter like the young sedge. Do I not think of you? But I am afraid of this officer, and dare not (fly to you).

While living we may have to occupy different apartments; But, when dead, we shall share the same grave. If you say that I am not sincere, By the bright sun I swear that I am [^616].

## Footnotes

[^633]: 439:1 That is, there where the ancestral temple and other grand buildings of Hâo had once stood.

[^634]: 439:2 ‘He cried out to Heaven,’ says Yen _Ȝh_an, ‘and told (his distress), but he calls it distant in its azure brightness, lamenting that his complaint was not heard.’ This is, probably, the correct explanation of the language. The speaker would by it express his grief that the dynasty of <i>K</i>âu and its people were abandoned and uncared for by Heaven.

[^635]: 439:3 Referring to king Yû, whose reckless course had led to the destruction of Hâo by the _Z_ung, and in a minor degree to his son, king Phing, who had subsequently removed to the eastern capital.

[^636]: 440:1 In the ‘Complete Digest’ this oath is expanded in the following way:—‘These words are from my heart. If you think that they are not sincere, there is (a Power) above, like the bright sun, observing me;—how should my words not be sincere?’
