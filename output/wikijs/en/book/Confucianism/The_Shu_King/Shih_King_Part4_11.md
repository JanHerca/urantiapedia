THE state of <i>Kh</i>in took its name from its earliest principal city, in the present district of <i>Kh</i>ing-shui, in <i>Kh</i>in <i>K</i>âu, Kan-sû. Its chiefs claimed to be descended from Yî, who appears in the Shû as the forester of Shun, and the assistant of the great Yü in his labours on the flood of Yâo. The history of his descendants is very imperfectly related till we come to a Fei-ȝze, who had charge of the herds of horses belonging to king Hsiâo (B.C. 90989.5), and in consequence of his good services. was invested with <span id="p443"><sup><small>[ p. 443 ]</small></sup></span> the small territory of <i>Kh</i>in, as an attached state. A descendant of his, known as duke Hsiang, in consequence of his loyal services, when the capital was moved to the east in B.C. 770, was raised to the dignity of an earl, and took his place among the great feudal princes of the kingdom, receiving also a large portion of territory, which included the ancient capital of the House of <i>K</i>âu. In course of time <i>Kh</i>in, as is well known, superseded the dynasty of <i>K</i>âu, having gradually moved its capital more and more to the east. The people of <i>Kh</i>in were, no doubt, mainly composed of the wild tribes of the west.

### ODE 6, STANZA 1. THE HWANG NIÂO.

LAMENT FOR THREE WORTHIES OF <i>KH</i>IN, WHO WERE BURIED IN THE SAME GRAVE WITH DUKE MÛ.

There is no difficulty or difference in the interpretation of this piece; and it brings us down to B.C. 621. Then died duke Mû, after playing an important part in the north-west of China for thirty-nine years. The Ȝo <i>K</i>wan, under the sixth year of duke Wan, makes mention of Mû's requiring that the three brothers here celebrated should be buried with him, and of the composition of this piece in consequence. Sze-mâ <i>Kh</i>ien says that this barbarous practice began with Mû's predecessor, with whom sixty-six persons were buried alive, and that one hundred and seventy-seven in all were buried with Mû. The death of the last distinguished man of the House of <i>Kh</i>in, the emperor I, was subsequently celebrated by the entombment with him of all the inmates of his harem.

They flit about, the yellow birds, And rest upon the jujube trees [^621]. Who followed duke Mû in the grave? Ȝze-_k_ü Yen-hsî. And this Yen-hsî Was a man above a hundred. When he came to the <span id="p444"><sup><small>[ p. 444 ]</small></sup></span> grave, He looked terrified and trembled. Thou azure Heaven there! Could he have been redeemed, We would have given a hundred (ordinary) men for him [^622].

## Footnotes

[^641]: 443:1 It is difficult to see the relation between these two allusive lines and the rest of the stanza. Some say that it is this,—that the people loved the three victims as they liked the birds; others that the birds among the trees were in their proper place,—very different from the brothers in the grave of duke Mû.

[^642]: 444:1 This appeal to Heaven is like what we met with in the first of the Odes of the Royal Domain, and the eighth of those of Thang.
