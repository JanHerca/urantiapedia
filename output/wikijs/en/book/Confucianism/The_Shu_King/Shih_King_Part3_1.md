## III. THE MAJOR ODES OF THE KINGDOM.

PIECES AND STANZAS ILLUSTRATING THE RELIGIOUS VIEWS AND PRACTICES OF THE WRITERS AND THEIR TIMES.

## The First Decade, or that of Wăn Wang.

<a id="o1"></a>

### ODE 1. THE WĂN WANG.

CELEBRATING KING WĂN, DEAD AND ALIVE, AS THE FOUNDER OF THE DYNASTY OF <i>K</i>ÂU, SHOWING HOW HIS VIRTUES DREW TO HIM THE FAVOURING REGARD OF HEAVEN OR GOD, AND MADE HIM A BRIGHT PATTERN TO HIS DESCENDANTS AND THEIR MINISTERS.

The composition of this and the other pieces of this decade is attributed to the duke of <i>K</i>âu, king Wăn's son, and was intended by him for the benefit of his nephew, the young king <i>Kh</i>ăng. Wăn, it must be borne in mind, was never actually king of China. He laid the foundations of the kingly power, which was established by his son king Wû, and consolidated by the duke of <i>K</i>âu. The title of king was given to him and to others by the duke, according to the view of filial piety, that has been referred to on p. 299.

King Wăn is on high. Oh! bright is he in heaven. Although <i>K</i>âu was an old country, The (favouring) appointment lighted on it recently [^472]. Illustrious was the House of <i>K</i>âu, And the <span id="p378">[<sup><small>p. 378</small></sup>]</span> appointment of God came at the proper season. King Wăn ascends and descends On the left and the right of God [^473].

Full of earnest activity was king Wăn, And his fame is without end. The gifts (of God) to <i>K</i>âu Extend to the descendants of king Wăn, In the direct line and the collateral branches for a hundred generations [^474]. All the officers of <i>K</i>âu Shall (also) be illustrious from age to age.

They shall be illustrious from age to age, Zealously and reverently pursuing their plans. Admirable are the many officers, Born in this royal kingdom. The royal kingdom is able to produce them, The supporters of (the House of) <i>K</i>âu. Numerous is the array of officers, And by them king Wăn enjoys his repose.

Profound was king Wăn; Oh! continuous and bright was his feeling of reverence. Great is the appointment of Heaven! There were the descendants of (the sovereigns of) Shang [^475]\—The descendants of the sovereigns of Shang Were in number more <span id="p379">[<sup><small>p. 379</small></sup>]</span> than hundreds of thousands. But when God gave the command, They became subject to <i>K</i>âu.

They became subject to <i>K</i>âu, (For) the appointment of Heaven is not unchangeable. The officers of Yin, admirable and alert, Assist at the libations in our capital [^476]. They assist at those libations, Always wearing the hatchet-figures on their lower garments and their peculiar cap [^477]. O ye loyal ministers of the king, Ever think of your ancestor!

Ever think of your ancestor, Cultivating your virtue, Always seeking to accord with the will (of Heaven):—So shall you be seeking for much happiness, Before Yin lost the multitudes, (Its kings) were the correlates of God [^478]. Look to Yin as a beacon; The great appointment is not easily preserved.

The appointment is not easily (preserved):—Do not cause your own extinction. Display and make bright your righteousness and fame, And look at (the fate of) Yin in the light of Heaven. The doings of high Heaven Have neither sound nor <span id="p380">[<sup><small>p. 380</small></sup>]</span> smell [^479]. Take your pattern from king Wăn, And the myriad regions will repose confidence in you.

<a id="o2"></a>

### ODE 2. THE TÂ MING.

HOW THE APPOINTMENT OF HEAVEN OR GOD CAME FROM HIS FATHER TO KING WĂN, AND DESCENDED TO HIS SON, KING WÛ, WHO OVERTHREW THE DYNASTY OF SHANG BY HIS VICTORY AT MÛ; CELEBRATING ALSO THE MOTHER AND WIFE OF KING WĂN.

The illustration of illustrious (virtue) is required below, And the dread majesty is or, high [^480]. Heaven is not readily to be relied on; It is not easy to be king. Yin's rightful heir to the heavenly seat Was not permitted to possess the kingdom.

_Z_ăn, the second of the princesses of <i>K</i>ih [^481], From (the domain of) Yin-shang, Came to be married to (the prince of) <i>K</i>âu, And became his wife in his <span id="p381">[<sup><small>p. 381</small></sup>]</span> capital. Both she and king <i>K</i>î Were entirely virtuous. (Then) Thâi-_z_ăn became pregnant, And gave birth to our king Wăn.

This king Wăn, Watchfully and reverently, With entire intelligence served God, And so secured the great blessing. His virtue was without deflection; And in consequence he received (the allegiance of) the states from all quarters.

Heaven surveyed this lower world; And its appointment lighted (on king Wăn). In his early years, It made for him a mate [^482];—On the north of the Hsiâ, On the banks of the Wei. When king Wăn would marry, There was the lady in a large state [^483].

In a large state was the lady, Like a fair denizen of heaven. The ceremonies determined the auspiciousness (of the union) [^484], And in person he met her on the Wei. Over it he made a bridge of boats; The glory (of the occasion) was illustrious.

The favouring appointment was from Heaven, Giving the throne to our kin Wăn, In the capital of <i>K</i>âu. The lady-successor was from Hsin, Its eldest daughter, who came to marry him. She was blessed to give birth to king Wû, Who was preserved, and helped, and received (also) the. appointment, <span id="p382">[<sup><small>p. 382</small></sup>]</span> And in accordance with it smote the great Shang.

The troops of Yin-shang Were collected like a forest, And marshalled in the wilderness of Mû. We rose (to the crisis); ‘God is with you,’ (said Shang-fû to the king), ‘Have no doubts in your heart [^485].’

The wilderness of Mû spread out extensive; Bright shone the chariots of sandal; The teams of bays, black-maned and white-bellied, galloped along; The Grand-Master Shang-fû. Was like an eagle on the wing, Assisting king Wû, Who at one onset smote the great Shang. That morning's encounter was followed by a clear, bright (day).

<a id="o3"></a>

### ODE 3. THE MIEN.

SMALL BEGINNINGS AND SUBSEQUENT GROWTH OF THE HOUSE OF <i>K</i>ÂU IN <i>K</i>ÂU. ITS REMOVAL FROM PIN UNDER THAN-FÛ, WITH ITS FIRST SETTLEMENT IN <i>K</i>ÂU, WITH THE PLACE THEN GIVEN TO THE BUILDING OF THE ANCESTRAL TEMPLE, AND THE ALTAR TO THE SPIRITS OF THE LAND. CONSOLIDATION OF ITS FORTUNES BY KING WĂN.

‘The ancient duke Than-fû’ was the grandfather of king Wăn, and was canonized by the duke of <i>K</i>âu as ‘king Thâi.’ As mentioned in a note on [p. 316](Shih_King_Part1_2#p316), he was the first of his family to settle in Kâu, removing there from Pin. the site of their earlier settlement, ‘the country about the <i>Kh</i>ü and the <i>Kh</i>î.’

In long trains ever increasing grow the gourds [^486]. When (our) people first sprang, From the country about the <i>Kh</i>ü and the <i>Kh</i>î [^487], The ancient duke <span id="p383">[<sup><small>p. 383</small></sup>]</span> Than-fû Made for them kiln-like huts and caves, Ere they had yet any houses [^488].

The ancient duke Than-fû Came in the morning, galloping his horses, Along the banks of the western rivers, To the foot of mount <i>Kh</i>î [^489]; And there he and the lady <i>K</i>iang [^490] Came and together looked out for a site.

The plain of <i>K</i>âu looked beautiful and rich, With its violets, and sowthistles (sweet) as dumplings. There he began by consulting (with his followers); There he singed the tortoise-shell, (and divined). The responses were there to stay and then; And they proceeded there to build [^491].

He encouraged the people, and settled them; Here on the left, there on the right. He divided the ground, and subdivided it; If he dug the ditches; he defined the acres. From the east to the west, There was nothing which he did not take in hand [^492].

<span id="p384">[<sup><small>p. 384</small></sup>]</span>

He called his Superintendent of Works; He called his Minister of Instruction; And charged them with the rearing of the houses. With the line they made everything straight; They bound the frame-boards tight, so that they should rise regularly uprose the ancestral temple in its solemn grandeur [^493].

Crowds brought the earth in baskets; They threw it with shouts into the frames; They beat it with responsive blows. They pared the walls repeatedly, till they sounded strong. Five thousand cubits of them arose together, So that the roll of the great drums did not overpower (the noise of the builders) [^494].

They reared the outer gate (of the palace), Which rose in lofty state. They set up the gate of audience, Which rose severe and exact. They reared the great altar to the spirits of the land, From which all great movements should proceed [^495].

<span id="p385">[<sup><small>p. 385</small></sup>]</span>

Thus though he could not prevent the rage of his foes [^496], He did not let fall his own fame. The oaks and the buckthorns were (gradually) thinned, And roads for travellers were opened. The hordes of the Khwăn disappeared, Startled and panting.

(The chiefs of) Yü and _Z_ui [^497] were brought to an agreement By king Wăn's stimulating their natural virtue. Then, I may say, some came to him, previously not knowing him; Some, drawn the last by the first; Some, drawn by his rapid successes; And some by his defence (of the weak) from insult.

<span id="p386">[<sup><small>p. 386</small></sup>]</span>

<a id="o4"></a>

### ODE 4, STANZAS 1 AND 2. THE YÎ PHO.

IN PRAISE OF KING WĂN, CELEBRATING HIS INFLUENCE, DIGNITY IN THE TEMPLE SERVICES, ACTIVITY, AND CAPACITY TO RULE.

Abundant is the growth of the buckthorn and shrubby trees, Supplying firewood; yea, stores of it [^498]. Elegant and dignified was our prince and king; On the left and the right they hastened to him.

Elegant and dignified was our prince and king; On his left and his right they bore their half-mace (libation-cups) [^499]:—They bore them with solemn gravity, As beseemed such eminent officers.

<a id="o5"></a>

### ODE 5. THE HAN LÛ.

IN PRAISE OF THE VIRTUE OF KING WĂN, BLESSED BY HIS ANCESTORS, AND RAISED TO THE HIGHEST DIGNITY WITHOUT' SEEKING OF HIS OWN.

Look at the foot of the Han [^500], How abundantly grow the hazel and arrow-thorn [^501]. Easy and self-possessed was our prince, In his pursuit of dignity (still) easy and self-possessed.

Massive is that libation-cup of jade, With the <span id="p387">[<sup><small>p. 387</small></sup>]</span> yellow liquid sparkling in it [^502]. Easy and self-possessed was our prince, The fit recipient of blessing and dignity.

The hawk flies up to heaven, The fishes leap in the deep [^503]. Easy and self-possessed was our prince:—Did he not exert an influence on men?

His clear spirits were in the vessels; His red bull was ready [^504];—To offer, to sacrifice, To increase his bright happiness.

Thick grow the oaks and the buckthorn, Which the people use for fuel [^505]. Easy and self-possessed was our prince, Cheered and encouraged by the spirits [^505].

Luxuriant are the dolichos and other creepers, Clinging to the branches and stems. Easy and self-possessed was our prince, Seeking for happiness by no crooked ways.

<a id="o6"></a>

### ODE 6. THE SZE <i>K</i>ÂI.

THE VIRTUE OF WĂN, WITH HIS FILIAL PIETY AND CONSTANT REVERENCE, AND THEIR WONDERFUL EFFECTS. THE EXCELLENT CHARACTER OF HIS MOTHER AND WIFE.

Pure and reverent was Thâi _Z_ăn [^506], The mother of king Wăn. Loving was she to <i>K</i>âu <i>K</i>iang [^507];— <span id="p388">[<sup><small>p. 388</small></sup>]</span> A wife becoming the House of <i>K</i>âu. Thâi Sze [^508] inherited her excellent fame, And from her came a hundred sons [^509].

He conformed to the example of his ancestors, And their spirits had no occasion for complaint. Their spirits had no occasion for dissatisfaction; And his example acted on his wife, Extended to his brethren, And was felt by all the clans and states.

Full of harmony was he in his palace; Full of reverence in the ancestral temple. Unseen (by men), he still felt that he was under inspection [^510]: Unweariedly he maintained his virtue.

Though he could not prevent (some) great calamities, His brightness and magnanimity were without stain. Without previous instruction he did what was right; Without admonition he went on (in the path of goodness).

So, grown up men became virtuous (through him), And young men made (constant) attainments. (Our) ancient prince never felt weariness, And from him were the fame and eminence of his officers.

<span id="p389">[<sup><small>p. 389</small></sup>]</span>

<a id="o7"></a>

### ODE 7. THE HWANG Î.

SHOWING THE RISE OF THE HOUSE OF <i>K</i>ÂU TO THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE KINGDOM THROUGH THE FAVOUR OF GOD, THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF KINGS THÂI AND <i>K</i>Î, AND ESPECIALLY OF KING WĂN.

Great is God, Beholding this lower world in majesty. He surveyed the four quarters (of the kingdom), Seeking for some one to give establishment to the people. Those two earlier dynasties [^511] Had failed to satisfy him with their government; So, throughout the various states, He sought and considered For one on whom he might confer the rule. Hating all the great states, He turned his kind regards on the west, And there gave a settlement (to king Thâi).

(King Thâi) raised up and removed The dead trunks and the fallen trees. He dressed and regulated The bushy clumps and the (tangled) rows. He opened up and cleared The tamarisk trees and the stave trees. He hewed and thinned The mountain mulberry trees. God having brought about the removal thither of this intelligent ruler, The Kwan hordes fled away [^512]. Heaven had raised up a helpmeet for him, And the appointment he had received was made sure.

God surveyed the hills, Where the oaks and the buckthorn were thinned, And paths made through the firs and cypresses. God, who had raised the <span id="p390">[<sup><small>p. 390</small></sup>]</span> state, raised up a proper ruler [^513] for it,—From the time of Thâi-po and king <i>K</i>î (this was done) [^513]. Now this king <i>K</i>î In his heart was full of brotherly duty. Full of duty to his elder brother, He gave himself the more to promote the prosperity (of the country), And secured to him the glory (of his act) [^514]. He accepted his dignity and did not lose it, And (ere long his family) possessed the whole kingdom.

This king <i>K</i>î Was gifted by God with the power of judgment, So that the fame of his virtue silently grew. His virtue was highly intelligent,—Highly intelligent, and of rare discrimination; Able to lead, able to rule, To rule over this great country; Rendering a cordial submission, effecting a cordial union [^515]. When (the sway) came to king Wăn, His <span id="p391">[<sup><small>p. 391</small></sup>]</span> virtue left nothing to be dissatisfied with, He received the blessing of God, And it was extended to his descendants.

God said to king Wăn [^516], ‘Be not like those who reject this and cling to that; Be not like those who are ruled by their likings and desires;’ So he grandly ascended before others to the height (of virtue). The people of Mî [^517] were disobedient, Daring to oppose our great country, And invaded Yüan, marching to Kung [^518]. The king rose, majestic in his wrath; He marshalled his troops, To stop the invading foes; To consolidate the prosperity of <i>K</i>âu; To meet the expectations of all under heaven.

He remained quietly in the capital, But (his troops) went on from the borders of Yüan. They ascended our lofty ridges, And (the enemy) arrayed no forces on our hills, On our hills, small or large, Nor drank at our springs, Our springs or our pools. He then determined the finest of the plains, And settled on the south of <i>Kh</i>î [^519], On the banks of <span id="p392">[<sup><small>p. 392</small></sup>]</span> the Wei, The centre of all the states, The resort of the lower people.

God said to king Wăn, ‘I am pleased with your intelligent virtue, Not loudly proclaimed nor pourtrayed, Without extravagance or changeableness, Without consciousness of effort on your part, In accordance with the pattern of God.’ God said to king Wăn, ‘Take measures against the country of your foes. Along with your brethren, Get ready your scaling ladders, And your engines of onfall and assault, To attack the walls of <i>Kh</i>ung [^520].’

The engines of onfall and assault were (at first) gently plied, Against the walls of <i>Kh</i>ung high and great; Captives for the question were brought in, one after another; The left ears (of the slain) were taken leisurely [^521]. He had sacrificed to God and to the Father of War [^522], Thus seeking to induce <span id="p393">[<sup><small>p. 393</small></sup>]</span> submission, And throughout the region none had dared to insult him. The engines of onfall and assault were (then) vigorously plied, Against the walls of <i>Kh</i>ung very strong. He attacked it, and let loose all his forces; He extinguished (its sacrifices) [^523], and made an end of its existence; And throughout the kingdom none dared to oppose him.

<a id="o9"></a>

### ODE 9. THE HSIÂ WÛ.

IN PRAISE OF KING WÛ, WALKING IN THE WAYS OF HIS FOREFATHERS, AND BY HIS FILIAL PIETY SECURING THE THRONE TO HIMSELF AND HIS POSTERITY.

Successors tread in the steps (of their predecessors) in our <i>K</i>âu. For generations there had been wise kings; The three sovereigns were in heaven [^524]; And king (Wû) was their worthy successor in his capital [^525].

King (Wû) was their worthy successor in his capital, Rousing himself to seek for the hereditary virtue, Always striving to be in accordance with the <span id="p394">[<sup><small>p. 394</small></sup>]</span> will (of Heaven); And thus he secured the confidence due to a king.

He secured the confidence due to a king, And became the pattern of all below him. Ever thinking how to be filial, His filial mind was the model (which he supplied).

Men loved him, the One man, And responded (to his example) with a docile virtue. Ever thinking how to be filial, He brilliantly continued the doings (of his fathers).

Brilliantly! and his posterity, Continuing to walk in the steps of their forefathers, For myriads of years, Will receive the blessing of Heaven.

They will receive the blessing of Heaven, And from the four quarters (of the kingdom) will felicitations come to them. For myriads of years Will there not be their helpers?

<a id="o10"></a>

### ODE 10. THE WĂN WANG YÛ SHĂNG.

THE PRAISE OF KINGS WĂN AND WÛ:—HOW THE FORMER DISPLAYED HIS MILITARY PROWESS ONLY TO SECURE THE TRANQUILLITY OF THE PEOPLE; AND HOW THE LATTER, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RESULTS OF DIVINATION, ENTERED IN HIS NEW CAPITAL OF HÂO, INTO THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE KINGDOM WITH THE SINCERE GOOD WILL OF ALL THE PEOPLE.

King Wăn is famous; Yea, he is very famous. What he sought was the repose (of the people); What he saw was the completion (of his work). A sovereign true was king Wăn!

King Wăn received the appointment (from Heaven), And achieved his martial success. Having overthrown <i>Kh</i>ung [^526]. He fixed his (capital) city in Făng [^527]. A sovereign true was king Wăn!

<span id="p395">[<sup><small>p. 395</small></sup>]</span>

He repaired the walls along the (old) moat. His establishing himself in Făng was according to (the pattern of his forefathers), It was not that he was in haste to gratify his wishes;—It was to show the filial duty that had come down to him. A sovereign true was the royal prince!

His royal merit was brightly displayed By those walls of Făng. There were collected (the sympathies of the people of) the four quarters, Who regarded the royal prince as their protector. A sovereign true was the royal prince!

The Făng-water flowed on to the east (of the city), Through the meritorious labour of Yü. There were collected (the sympathies of the people of) the four quarters, Who would have the great king as their ruler. A sovereign true was the great king [^528]!’

In the capital of Hâo he built his hall with its circlet of water [^529]. From the west to the east, From the south to the north, There was not a thought but did him homage. A sovereign true was the great king!

He examined and divined, did the king, About settling in the capital of Hâo. The tortoise-shell decided the site [^530], And king Wû completed the city. A sovereign true was king Wû!

<span id="p396">[<sup><small>p. 396</small></sup>]</span>

By the Făng-water grows the white millet [^531];—Did not king Wû show wisdom in his employment of officers? He would leave his plans to his descendants, And secure comfort and support to his son. A sovereign true was king Wû!

## Footnotes

[^489]: 377:1 The family of <i>K</i>âu, according to its traditions, was very ancient, but it did not. occupy the territory of <i>K</i>âu, from which it subsequently took its name, till B.C. 1326; and it was not till the time of Wăn (B.C. 1231 to 1135) that the divine purpose concerning its supremacy in the kingdom was fully manifested.

[^490]: 378:1 According to <i>K</i>û Hsî, the first and last two lines of this stanza are to be taken of the spirit of Wăn in heaven. Attempts have been made to explain them otherwise, or rather to explain them away. But language could not more expressly intimate the existence of a supreme personal God, and the continued existence of the human spirit.

[^491]: 378:2 The text, literally, is, ‘The root and the branches:’ the root (and stem) denoting the eldest sons, by the recognised queen, succeeding to the throne; and the branches, the other sons by the queen and concubines. The former would grow up directly from the root; and the latter, the chief nobles of the kingdom, would constitute the branches of the great Kâu tree.

[^492]: 378:3 The Shang or Yin dynasty of kings superseded by <i>K</i>âu.

[^493]: 379:1 These officers of Yin would be the descendants of the Yin kings and of their principal nobles, scions likewise of the, Yin stock. They would assist, at the court of <i>K</i>âu, at the services in the ancestral temple, which began with a libation of fragrant spirits to bring down the spirits of the departed.

[^494]: 379:2 These, differing from the dress worn by the representatives of the ruling House, were still worn by the officers of Yin or Shang, by way of honour, and also by way of warning.

[^495]: 379:3 There was God in heaven hating none, desiring the good of all the people; there were the sovereigns on earth, God's vicegerents, maintained by him so long as they carried out in their government his purpose of good.

[^496]: 380:1 These two lines are quoted in the last paragraph of the Doctrine of the Mean, as representing the ideal of perfect virtue. They are indicative of Power, operating silently, and not to be perceived by the senses, but resistless in its operations.

[^497]: 380:2 ‘The first two lines,’ says the commentator Yen _Ȝh_an, ‘contain a general sentiment, expressing the principle that governs the relation between Heaven and men. According to line 1, the good or evil of a ruler cannot be concealed; according to 2, Heaven, in giving its favour or taking it away, acts with strict decision. When below there is the illustrious illustration (of virtue), that reaches up on high. When above there is the awful majesty, that exercises a survey below. The relation between Heaven and men ought to excite our awe.’

[^498]: 380:3 The state of <i>K</i>ih must have been somewhere in the royal domain of Yin. Its lords had the surname of _Z_ăn, and the second daughter of the House became the wife of <i>K</i>î of <i>K</i>âu. She is called in the eighth line Thâi-_z_ăn, by which name she is still famous in China. ‘She commenced,’ it is said, ‘the instruction of her child when he was still in her womb, looking on no improper sight, listening to no licentious sound, uttering no word of pride.’

[^499]: 381:1 Heaven is here represented as arranging for the fulfilment of its purposes beforehand.

[^500]: 381:2 The name of the state was Hsin, and it must have been near the Hsiâ and the Wei, somewhere in the south-east of the present Shen-hsî.

[^501]: 381:3 ‘The ceremonies’ would be various; first of all, divination by means of the tortoise-shell.

[^502]: 382:1 See the account of the battle of Mû in the third Book of the fifth Part of the Shû. Shang-fû was one of Wû's principal leaders and counsellors, his ‘Grand-Master Shang-fû’ in the next stanza.

[^503]: 382:2 As a gourd grows and extends, with a vast development of its tendrils and leaves, so had the House of <i>K</i>âu increased.

[^504]: 382:3 These were two rivers in the territory of Pin, which name still p. 383 remains in the small department of Pin <i>K</i>âu, in Shen-hsî. The <i>Kh</i>ü flows into the Lo, and the <i>Kh</i>î into the Wei.

[^505]: 383:1 According to this ode then, up to the time of Than-fû, the Kâu people had only had the dwellings here described; but this is not easily reconciled with other accounts, or even with other stanzas of this piece.

[^506]: 383:2 See a graphic account of the circumstances in which this migration took place, in the fifteenth chapter of the second Part of the first Book of Mencius, very much to the honour of the ancient duke.

[^507]: 383:3 This lady is known as Thâi-_k_iang, the worthy predecessor of Thâi-_z_ăn.

[^508]: 383:4 This stanza has reference to the choice—by council and divination—of a site for what should be the chief town of the new settlement.

[^509]: 383:5 This stanza describes the general arrangements for the occupancy and cultivation of the plain of <i>K</i>âu, and the distribution of the people over it.

[^510]: 384:1 This stanza describes the preparations and processes for erecting the buildings of the new city. The whole took place under the direction of two officers, in whom we have the germ probably of the Six Heads of the Boards or Departments, whose functions are described in the Shû and the Official Book of <i>K</i>âu. The materials of the buildings were earth and lime pounded together in frames, as is still to be seen in many parts of the country. The first great building taken in hand was the ancestral temple. Than-fû would make a home for the spirits of his fathers, before he made one for himself. However imperfectly directed, the religious feeling asserted the supremacy which it ought to possess.

[^511]: 384:2 The bustle and order of the building all over the city is here graphically set forth.

[^512]: 384:3 Than-fû was now at leisure to build the palace for himself, which appears to have been not a very large building, though the Chinese names of its gates are those belonging to the two which p. 385 were peculiar to the palaces of the kings of <i>K</i>âu in the subsequent times of the dynasty. Outside the palace were the altars appropriate to the spirits of the four quarters of the land, the ‘great’ or royal altar being peculiar to the kings, though the one built by Than-fû is here so named. All great undertakings, and such as required the co-operation of all the people, were preceded by a solemn sacrifice at this altar.

[^513]: 385:1 Referring to Than-fû's relations with the wild hordes, described by Mencius, and which obliged him to leave Pin. As the new settlement in <i>K</i>âu grew, they did not dare to trouble it.

[^514]: 385:2 The poet passes on here to the time of king Wăn. The story of the chiefs of Yü and _Z_ui (two states on the east of the Ho) is this:—They had a quarrel about a strip of territory, to which each of them laid claim. Going to lay their dispute before the lord of <i>K</i>âu, as soon as they entered his territory, they saw the ploughers readily yielding the furrow, and travellers yielding the path, while men and women avoided one another on the road, and old people had no burdens to carry. At his court, they beheld the officers of each inferior grade giving place to those above them. They became ashamed of their own quarrel, agreed to let the disputed ground be an open territory, and withdrew without presuming to appear before Wăn. When this affair was noised abroad, more than forty states, it is said, tendered their submission to <i>K</i>âu.

[^515]: 386:1 It is difficult to trace the connexion between-these allusive lines and the rest of the piece.

[^516]: 386:2 Here we have the lord of <i>K</i>âu in his ancestral temple, assisted by his ministers or great officers in pouring out the libations to the spirits of the departed. The libation-cup was fitted with a handle of jade, that used by the king having a complete kwei, the obelisk-like symbol of rank, while the cups used by a minister had for a handle only half a kwei.

[^517]: 386:3 Where mount Han was cannot now be determined.

[^518]: 386:4 As the foot of the hill was favourable to vegetable growth, so were king Wăn's natural qualities to his distinction and advancement.

[^519]: 387:1 As a cup of such quality was the proper receptacle for the yellow, herb-flavoured spirits, so was the character of Wăn such that all blessing must accrue to him.

[^520]: 387:2 It is the nature of the hawk to fly and of fishes to swim, and so there went out an influence from Wăn unconsciously to himself.

[^521]: 387:3 Red, we have seen, was the proper colour for victims in the ancestral temple of <i>K</i>âu.

[^523]: 387:4 As it was natural for the people to take the wood and use it, so it was natural for the spirits of his ancestors, and spiritual beings generally, to bless king Wăn.

[^524]: 387:5 Thâi _Z_ăn is celebrated, above, in the second ode.

[^525]: 387:6 <i>K</i>âu <i>K</i>iang is ‘the lady <i>K</i>iang’ of ode 3, the wife of Than-fû or p. 388 king Thâi, who came with him from Pin. She is here called Kâu, as having married the lord of <i>K</i>âu.

[^526]: 388:1 Thâi Sze, the wife of Wăn, we are told in ode 2, was from the state of Hsin. The surname Sze shows that its lords must have been descended from the Great Yü.

[^527]: 388:2 We are not to suppose that Thâi Sze had herself a hundred sons. She had ten, and her freedom from jealousy so encouraged the fruitfulness of the harem, that all the sons born in it are ascribed to her.

[^528]: 388:3 Where there was no human eye to observe him, Wan still felt that he was open to the observation of spiritual beings.

[^529]: 389:1 Those of Hsiâ and Shang.

[^530]: 389:2 The same as ‘the hordes of the Khwăn’ in ode 3. Mr. T. W. Kingsmill says that ‘Kwan’ here should be ‘Chun,’ and charges the transliteration Kwan with error (journal of the Royal Asiatic Society for April, 1878). He had not consulted his dictionary for the proper pronunciation of the Chinese character.

[^532]: 390:1 King Wăn is ‘the proper ruler’ intended here, and the next line intimates that this was determined before there was any likelihood of his becoming the ruler even of the territory of <i>K</i>âu;—another instance of the foreseeing providence ascribed to God. Thâi-po was the eldest son of king Thai, and king <i>K</i>î was, perhaps, only the third. The succession ought to have come to Thai-po; but he, seeing the sage virtues of <i>Kh</i>ang (afterwards king Wăn), the son of <i>K</i>î, and seeing also that king Thai was anxious that this boy should ultimately become ruler of <i>K</i>âu, voluntarily withdrew from <i>K</i>âu altogether, and left the state to <i>K</i>î and his son. See the remark of Confucius on Thâi-po's conduct, in the Analects, VIII, i.

[^533]: 390:2 _T_he lines from six to ten speak of king <i>K</i>î in his relation to his elder brother. He accepted Thâi-po's act without any failure of his own duty to him, and by his own improvement of it, made his brother more glorious through it. His feeling of brotherly duty was simply the natural instinct of his heart. Having accepted the act, it only made him the more anxious to promote the good of the state, and thus he made his brother more glorious by showing what advantages accrued from his resignation and withdrawal from <i>K</i>âu.

[^534]: 390:3 This line refers to Kî's maintenance of his own loyal duty p. 391 to the dynasty of Shang, and his making all the states under his presidency loyal also.

[^535]: 391:1 The statement that ‘God spake to king Wăn,’ repeated in stanza 7, vexes the Chinese critics, and they find in it simply an intimation that Wăn's conduct was ‘in accordance with the will of Heaven.’ I am not prepared to object to that view of the meaning; but it is plain that the writer, in giving such a form to his meaning, must have conceived of God as a personal Being, knowing men's hearts, and able to influence them.

[^536]: 391:2 Mî or Mî-hsü was a state in the present King-ning Kâu, of Phing-liang department, Kan-sû.

[^537]: 391:3 Yüan was a state adjacent to Mî,—the present <i>K</i>ing <i>K</i>âu, and Kung must have been a place or district in it.

[^538]: 391:4 Wăn, it appears, made now a small change in the site of his capital, but did not move to Făng, where he finally settled.

[^539]: 392:1 <i>Kh</i>ung was a state, in the present district of Hû, department Hsî-an, Shen-hsî. His conquest of <i>Kh</i>ung was an important event in the history of king Wăn. He moved his capital to it, advancing so much farther towards the east, nearer to the domain of-Shang. According to Sze-mâ <i>Kh</i>ien the marquis of <i>Kh</i>ung had slandered the lord of <i>K</i>âu, who was president of the states of the west, to <i>K</i>âu-hsin, the king of Shang, and our hero was put in prison. His friends succeeded in effecting his deliverance by means of various gifts to the tyrant, and he was reinstated In the west with more than his former power. Three years afterwards he attacked the marquis of <i>Kh</i>ung.

[^540]: 392:2 So far the siege was prosecuted slowly and, so to say, tenderly, Wan hoping that the enemy would be induced to surrender without great sacrifice of life.

[^541]: 392:3 The sacrifice to God had been offered in ,Kâu, at the commencement of the expedition; that to the Father of War, on the army's arriving at the borders of ,Khung. We can hardly tell who is intended by the Father of War. <i>K</i>û Hsî and others would require the plural ‘Fathers,’ saying the sacrifice was to Hwang Tî and <i>Kh</i>ih Yû, who are found engaged in hostilities far back in the p. 393 mythical period of Chinese history. But <i>Kh</i>ih Yû appears as a rebel, or opposed to the One man in all the country who was then fit to rule. It is difficult to imagine how they could be associated, and sacrificed to together.

[^542]: 393:1 The extinction of its sacrifices was the final act in the extinction of a state. Any members of its ruling House who might survive could no longer sacrifice to their ancestors as having been men of princely dignity. The family was reduced to the ranks of the people.

[^543]: 393:2 ‘The three sovereigns,’ or ‘wise kings,’ are to be understood of the three celebrated in ode 7,—Thâi, Kî, and Wan. We are thus obliged, with all Chinese scholars, to understand this ode of king Wû. The statement that ‘the three kings were in heaven’ is very express.

[^544]: 393:3 The capital here is Hâo, to which Wû removed in B.C. 1134, the year after his father's death. It was on the east of the river Făng, and only about eight miles from Wăn's capital of Făng.

[^545]: 394:1 As related in ode 7.

[^546]: 394:2 Făng had, probably, been the capital of <i>Kh</i>ung, and Wăn p. 395 removed to it, simply making the necessary repairs and alterations. This explains how we find nothing about the divinations which should have preceded so important a step as the founding of a new capital.

[^547]: 395:1 The writer has passed on to Wû, who did actually become king.

[^548]: 395:2 See on the third of the Praise Odes of Lû in Part IV.

[^549]: 395:3 Hâo was built by Wû, and hence we have the account of his divining About the site and the undertaking.

[^550]: 396:1 ‘The white millet,’ a valuable species, grown near the Făng, suggests to the writer the idea of all the men of ability whom Wû collected around him.
