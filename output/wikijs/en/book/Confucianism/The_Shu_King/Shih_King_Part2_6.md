## The Eighth Decade, or that of Po Hwâ.

<a id="o5"></a>

### ODE 5, STANZAS 1 AND 2. THE PO HWÂ.

THE QUEEN OF KING YÛ COMPLAINS OF BEING DEGRADED AND FORSAKEN.

The fibres from the white-flowered rush Are bound with the white grass [^469]. This man's sending me away makes me dwell solitary.

The light and brilliant clouds Bedew the rush and the grass [^470]. The way of Heaven is hard and difficult [^471];—This man does not conform (to good principle).

## Footnotes

[^486]: 376:1 The stalks of the rush were tied with the grass in bundles, in order to be steeped;—an operation which ladies in those days might be supposed to be familiar with. The two lines suggest the idea of the close connexion between the two plants, and the necessariness of the one to the other;—as it should be between husband and wife.

[^487]: 376:2 The clouds bestowed their dewy influence on the plants, while her husband neglected the speaker.

[^488]: 376:3 ‘The way of Heaven’ is equivalent to our ‘The course of Providence.’ The lady's words are, literally, ‘The steps of Heaven.’ She makes but a feeble wail; but in Chinese opinion discharges thereby, all the better, the duty of a wife.
