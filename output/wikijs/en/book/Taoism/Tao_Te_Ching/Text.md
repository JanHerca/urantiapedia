The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and<br>
unchanging Tao. The name that can be named is not the enduring and<br>
unchanging name.<br>
<br>
(Conceived of as) having no name, it is the Originator of heaven<br>
and earth; (conceived of as) having a name, it is the Mother of all<br>
things.<br>
<br>
Always without desire we must be found,<br>
If its deep mystery we would sound;<br>
But if desire always within us be,<br>
Its outer fringe is all that we shall see.<br>
<br>
Under these two aspects, it is really the same; but as development<br>
takes place, it receives the different names. Together we call them<br>
the Mystery. Where the Mystery is the deepest is the gate of all that<br>
is subtle and wonderful.<br>
</p>

<a id="c2"></a>

<p style="text-align:center;">
All in the world know the beauty of the beautiful, and in doing<br>
this they have (the idea of) what ugliness is; they all know the skill<br>
of the skilful, and in doing this they have (the idea of) what the<br>
want of skill is.<br>
<br>
So it is that existence and non-existence give birth the one to<br>
(the idea of) the other; that difficulty and ease produce the one (the<br>
idea of) the other; that length and shortness fashion out the one the<br>
figure of the other; that (the ideas of) height and lowness arise from<br>
the contrast of the one with the other; that the musical notes and<br>
tones become harmonious through the relation of one with another; and<br>
that being before and behind give the idea of one following another.<br>
<br>
Therefore the sage manages affairs without doing anything, and<br>
conveys his instructions without the use of speech.<br>
<br>
All things spring up, and there is not one which declines to show<br>
itself; they grow, and there is no claim made for their ownership;<br>
they go through their processes, and there is no expectation (of a<br>
reward for the results). The work is accomplished, and there is no<br>
resting in it (as an achievement).<br>
<br>
The work is done, but how no one can see;<br>
‘Tis this that makes the power not cease to be.<br>
</p>

<a id="c3"></a>

<p style="text-align:center;">
Not to value and employ men of superior ability is the way to<br>
keep the people from rivalry among themselves; not to prize articles<br>
which are difficult to procure is the way to keep them from becoming<br>
thieves; not to show them what is likely to excite their desires is<br>
the way to keep their minds from disorder.<br>
<br>
Therefore the sage, in the exercise of his government, empties<br>
their minds, fills their bellies, weakens their wills, and strengthens<br>
their bones.<br>
<br>
He constantly (tries to) keep them without knowledge and without<br>
desire, and where there are those who have knowledge, to keep them<br>
from presuming to act (on it). When there is this abstinence from<br>
action, good order is universal.<br>
</p>

<a id="c4"></a>

<p style="text-align:center;">
The Tao is (like) the emptiness of a vessel; and in our<br>
employment of it we must be on our guard against all fulness. How<br>
deep and unfathomable it is, as if it were the Honoured Ancestor of<br>
all things!<br>
<br>
We should blunt our sharp points, and unravel the complications of<br>
things; we should attemper our brightness, and bring ourselves into<br>
agreement with the obscurity of others. How pure and still the Tao<br>
is, as if it would ever so continue!<br>
<br>
I do not know whose son it is. It might appear to have been before<br>
God.<br>
</p>

<a id="c5"></a>

## 5

<p style="text-align:center;">
Heaven and earth do not act from (the impulse of) any wish to be<br>
benevolent; they deal with all things as the dogs of grass are dealt<br>
with. The sages do not act from (any wish to be) benevolent; they<br>
deal with the people as the dogs of grass are dealt with.<br>
<br>
May not the space between heaven and earth be compared to a<br>
bellows?<br>
<br>
‘Tis emptied, yet it loses not its power;<br>
‘Tis moved again, and sends forth air the more.<br>
Much speech to swift exhaustion lead we see;<br>
Your inner being guard, and keep it free.<br>
</p>

<a id="c6"></a>

<p style="text-align:center;">
The valley spirit dies not, aye the same;<br>
The female mystery thus do we name.<br>
Its gate, from which at first they issued forth,<br>
Is called the root from which grew heaven and earth.<br>
Long and unbroken does its power remain,<br>
Used gently, and without the touch of pain.<br>
</p>

<a id="c7"></a>

## 7

<p style="text-align:center;">
Heaven is long-enduring and earth continues long. The reason<br>
why heaven and earth are able to endure and continue thus long is<br>
because they do not live of, or for, themselves. This is how they are<br>
able to continue and endure.<br>
<br>
Therefore the sage puts his own person last, and yet it is found in<br>
the foremost place; he treats his person as if it were foreign to him,<br>
and yet that person is preserved. Is it not because he has no<br>
personal and private ends, that therefore such ends are realised?<br>
</p>

<a id="c8"></a>

<p style="text-align:center;">
The highest excellence is like (that of) water. The excellence<br>
of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying,<br>
without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men<br>
dislike. Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Tao.<br>
<br>
The excellence of a residence is in (the suitability of) the place;<br>
that of the mind is in abysmal stillness; that of associations is in<br>
their being with the virtuous; that of government is in its securing<br>
good order; that of (the conduct of) affairs is in its ability; and<br>
that of (the initiation of) any movement is in its timeliness.<br>
<br>
And when (one with the highest excellence) does not wrangle (about<br>
his low position), no one finds fault with him.<br>
</p>

<a id="c9"></a>

<p style="text-align:center;">
It is better to leave a vessel unfilled, than to attempt to<br>
carry it when it is full. If you keep feeling a point that has been<br>
sharpened, the point cannot long preserve its sharpness.<br>
<br>
When gold and jade fill the hall, their possessor cannot keep them<br>
safe. When wealth and honours lead to arrogancy, this brings its evil<br>
on itself. When the work is done, and one's name is becoming<br>
distinguished, to withdraw into obscurity is the way of Heaven.<br>
</p>

<a id="c10"></a>

## 10

<p style="text-align:center;">
When the intelligent and animal souls are held together in one<br>
embrace, they can be kept from separating. When one gives undivided<br>
attention to the (vital) breath, and brings it to the utmost degree of<br>
pliancy, he can become as a (tender) babe. When he has cleansed away<br>
the most mysterious sights (of his imagination), he can become without<br>
a flaw.<br>
<br>
In loving the people and ruling the state, cannot he proceed<br>
without any (purpose of) action? In the opening and shutting of his<br>
gates of heaven, cannot he do so as a female bird? While his<br>
intelligence reaches in every direction, cannot he (appear to) be<br>
without knowledge?<br>
<br>
(The Tao) produces (all things) and nourishes them; it produces<br>
them and does not claim them as its own; it does all, and yet does not<br>
boast of it; it presides over all, and yet does not control them.<br>
This is what is called ‘The mysterious Quality’ (of the Tao).<br>
</p>

<a id="c11"></a>

## 11

<p style="text-align:center;">
The thirty spokes unite in the one nave; but it is on the empty<br>
space (for the axle), that the use of the wheel depends. Clay is<br>
fashioned into vessels; but it is on their empty hollowness, that<br>
their use depends. The door and windows are cut out (from the walls)<br>
to form an apartment; but it is on the empty space (within), that its<br>
use depends. Therefore, what has a (positive) existence serves for<br>
profitable adaptation, and what has not that for (actual) usefulness.<br>
</p>

<a id="c12"></a>

## 12

<p style="text-align:center;">
Colour's five hues from th' eyes their sight will take;<br>
Music's five notes the ears as deaf can make;<br>
The flavours five deprive the mouth of taste;<br>
The chariot course, and the wild hunting waste<br>
Make mad the mind; and objects rare and strange,<br>
Sought for, men's conduct will to evil change.<br>
<br>
Therefore the sage seeks to satisfy (the craving of) the belly, and<br>
not the (insatiable longing of the) eyes. He puts from him the<br>
latter, and prefers to seek the former.<br>
</p>

<a id="c13"></a>

## 13

<p style="text-align:center;">
Favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared; honour and<br>
great calamity, to be regarded as personal conditions (of the same<br>
kind).<br>
<br>
What is meant by speaking thus of favour and disgrace? Disgrace is<br>
being in a low position (after the enjoyment of favour). The getting<br>
that (favour) leads to the apprehension (of losing it), and the losing<br>
it leads to the fear of (still greater calamity):—this is what is<br>
meant by saying that favour and disgrace would seem equally to be<br>
feared.<br>
<br>
And what is meant by saying that honour and great calamity are to be<br>
(similarly) regarded as personal conditions? What makes me liable to<br>
great calamity is my having the body (which I call myself); if I had<br>
not the body, what great calamity could come to me?<br>
<br>
Therefore he who would administer the kingdom, honouring it as he<br>
honours his own person, may be employed to govern it, and he who would<br>
administer it with the love which he bears to his own person may be<br>
entrusted with it.<br>
</p>

<a id="c14"></a>

## 14

<p style="text-align:center;">
We look at it, and we do not see it, and we name it 'the<br>
Equable.' We listen to it, and we do not hear it, and we name it 'the<br>
Inaudible.' We try to grasp it, and do not get hold of it, and we<br>
name it ‘the Subtle.’ With these three qualities, it cannot be made<br>
the subject of description; and hence we blend them together and<br>
obtain The One.<br>
<br>
Its upper part is not bright, and its lower part is not obscure.<br>
Ceaseless in its action, it yet cannot be named, and then it again<br>
returns and becomes nothing. This is called the Form of the Formless,<br>
and the Semblance of the Invisible; this is called the Fleeting and<br>
Indeterminable.<br>
<br>
We meet it and do not see its Front; we follow it, and do not see<br>
its Back. When we can lay hold of the Tao of old to direct the things<br>
of the present day, and are able to know it as it was of old in the<br>
beginning, this is called (unwinding) the clue of Tao.<br>
</p>

<a id="c15"></a>

## 15

<p style="text-align:center;">
The skilful masters (of the Tao) in old times, with a subtle<br>
and exquisite penetration, comprehended its mysteries, and were deep<br>
(also) so as to elude men's knowledge. As they were thus beyond men's<br>
knowledge, I will make an effort to describe of what sort they<br>
appeared to be.<br>
<br>
Shrinking looked they like those who wade through a stream in<br>
winter; irresolute like those who are afraid of all around them; grave<br>
like a guest (in awe of his host); evanescent like ice that is melting<br>
away; unpretentious like wood that has not been fashioned into<br>
anything; vacant like a valley, and dull like muddy water.<br>
<br>
Who can (make) the muddy water (clear)? Let it be still, and it<br>
will gradually become clear. Who can secure the condition of rest?<br>
Let movement go on, and the condition of rest will gradually arise.<br>
<br>
They who preserve this method of the Tao do not wish to be full (of<br>
themselves). It is through their not being full of themselves that<br>
they can afford to seem worn and not appear new and complete.<br>
</p>

<a id="c16"></a>

## 16

<p style="text-align:center;">
The (state of) vacancy should be brought to the utmost degree,<br>
and that of stillness guarded with unwearying vigour. All things<br>
alike go through their processes of activity, and (then) we see them<br>
return (to their original state). When things (in the vegetable<br>
world) have displayed their luxuriant growth, we see each of them<br>
return to its root. This returning to their root is what we call the<br>
state of stillness; and that stillness may be called a reporting that<br>
they have fulfilled their appointed end.<br>
<br>
The report of that fulfilment is the regular, unchanging rule. To<br>
know that unchanging rule is to be intelligent; not to know it leads<br>
to wild movements and evil issues. The knowledge of that unchanging<br>
rule produces a (grand) capacity and forbearance, and that capacity<br>
and forbearance lead to a community (of feeling with all things).<br>
From this community of feeling comes a kingliness of character; and he<br>
who is king-like goes on to be heaven-like. In that likeness to<br>
heaven he possesses the Tao. Possessed of the Tao, he endures long;<br>
and to the end of his bodily life, is exempt from all danger of decay.<br>
</p>

<a id="c17"></a>

## 17

<p style="text-align:center;">
In the highest antiquity, (the people) did not know that there<br>
were (their rulers). In the next age they loved them and praised<br>
them. In the next they feared them; in the next they despised them.<br>
Thus it was that when faith (in the Tao) was deficient (in the rulers)<br>
a want of faith in them ensued (in the people).<br>
<br>
How irresolute did those (earliest rulers) appear, showing (by<br>
their reticence) the importance which they set upon their words!<br>
Their work was done and their undertakings were successful, while the<br>
people all said, ‘We are as we are, of ourselves!’<br>
</p>

<a id="c18"></a>

## 18

<p style="text-align:center;">
When the Great Tao (Way or Method) ceased to be observed,<br>
benevolence and righteousness came into vogue. (Then) appeared wisdom<br>
and shrewdness, and there ensued great hypocrisy.<br>
<br>
When harmony no longer prevailed throughout the six kinships,<br>
filial sons found their manifestation; when the states and clans fell<br>
into disorder, loyal ministers appeared.<br>
</p>

<a id="c19"></a>

## 19

<p style="text-align:center;">
If we could renounce our sageness and discard our wisdom, it<br>
would be better for the people a hundredfold. If we could renounce<br>
our benevolence and discard our righteousness, the people would again<br>
become filial and kindly. If we could renounce our artful<br>
contrivances and discard our (scheming for) gain, there would be no<br>
thieves nor robbers.<br>
<br>
Those three methods (of government)<br>
Thought olden ways in elegance did fail<br>
And made these names their want of worth to veil;<br>
But simple views, and courses plain and true<br>
Would selfish ends and many lusts eschew.<br>
</p>

<a id="c20"></a>

## 20

<p style="text-align:center;">
When we renounce learning we have no troubles.<br>
The (ready) ‘yes,’ and (flattering) ‘yea;’—<br>
Small is the difference they display.<br>
But mark their issues, good and ill;—<br>
What space the gulf between shall fill?<br>
<br>
What all men fear is indeed to be feared; but how wide and without end<br>
is the range of questions (asking to be discussed)!<br>
<br>
The multitude of men look satisfied and pleased; as if enjoying a<br>
full banquet, as if mounted on a tower in spring. I alone seem<br>
listless and still, my desires having as yet given no indication of<br>
their presence. I am like an infant which has not yet smiled. I look<br>
dejected and forlorn, as if I had no home to go to. The multitude of<br>
men all have enough and to spare. I alone seem to have lost<br>
everything. My mind is that of a stupid man; I am in a state of<br>
chaos.<br>
<br>
Ordinary men look bright and intelligent, while I alone seem to be<br>
benighted. They look full of discrimination, while I alone am dull<br>
and confused. I seem to be carried about as on the sea, drifting as<br>
if I had nowhere to rest. All men have their spheres of action, while<br>
I alone seem dull and incapable, like a rude borderer. (Thus) I alone<br>
am different from other men, but I value the nursing-mother (the Tao).<br>
</p>

<a id="c21"></a>

## 21

<p style="text-align:center;">
The grandest forms of active force<br>
From Tao come, their only source.<br>
Who can of Tao the nature tell?<br>
Our sight it flies, our touch as well.<br>
Eluding sight, eluding touch,<br>
The forms of things all in it crouch;<br>
Eluding touch, eluding sight,<br>
There are their semblances, all right.<br>
Profound it is, dark and obscure;<br>
Things' essences all there endure.<br>
Those essences the truth enfold<br>
Of what, when seen, shall then be told.<br>
Now it is so; 'twas so of old.<br>
Its name—what passes not away;<br>
So, in their beautiful array,<br>
Things form and never know decay.<br>
<br>
How know I that it is so with all the beauties of existing things? By<br>
this (nature of the Tao).<br>
</p>

<a id="c22"></a>

## 22

<p style="text-align:center;">
The partial becomes complete; the crooked, straight; the empty,<br>
full; the worn out, new. He whose (desires) are few gets them; he<br>
whose (desires) are many goes astray.<br>
<br>
Therefore the sage holds in his embrace the one thing (of<br>
humility), and manifests it to all the world. He is free from self-<br>
display, and therefore he shines; from self-assertion, and therefore<br>
he is distinguished; from self-boasting, and therefore his merit is<br>
acknowledged; from self-complacency, and therefore he acquires<br>
superiority. It is because he is thus free from striving that<br>
therefore no one in the world is able to strive with him.<br>
<br>
That saying of the ancients that ‘the partial becomes complete’ was<br>
not vainly spoken:—all real completion is comprehended under it.<br>
</p>

<a id="c23"></a>

## 23

<p style="text-align:center;">
Abstaining from speech marks him who is obeying the spontaneity<br>
of his nature. A violent wind does not last for a whole morning; a<br>
sudden rain does not last for the whole day. To whom is it that these<br>
(two) things are owing? To Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth<br>
cannot make such (spasmodic) actings last long, how much less can man!<br>
<br>
Therefore when one is making the Tao his business, those who are<br>
also pursuing it, agree with him in it, and those who are making the<br>
manifestation of its course their object agree with him in that; while<br>
even those who are failing in both these things agree with him where<br>
they fail.<br>
<br>
Hence, those with whom he agrees as to the Tao have the happiness<br>
of attaining to it; those with whom he agrees as to its manifestation<br>
have the happiness of attaining to it; and those with whom he agrees<br>
in their failure have also the happiness of attaining (to the Tao).<br>
(But) when there is not faith sufficient (on his part), a want of<br>
faith (in him) ensues (on the part of the others).<br>
</p>

<a id="c24"></a>

## 24

<p style="text-align:center;">
He who stands on his tiptoes does not stand firm; he who stretches<br>
his legs does not walk (easily). (So), he who displays himself does<br>
not shine; he who asserts his own views is not distinguished; he who<br>
vaunts himself does not find his merit acknowledged; he who is self-<br>
conceited has no superiority allowed to him. Such conditions, viewed<br>
from the standpoint of the Tao, are like remnants of food, or a tumour<br>
on the body, which all dislike. Hence those who pursue (the course)<br>
of the Tao do not adopt and allow them.</p>

<a id="c25"></a>

## 25

<p style="text-align:center;">
There was something undefined and complete, coming into<br>
existence before Heaven and Earth. How still it was and formless,<br>
standing alone, and undergoing no change, reaching everywhere and in<br>
no danger (of being exhausted)! It may be regarded as the Mother of<br>
all things.<br>
<br>
I do not know its name, and I give it the designation of the Tao<br>
(the Way or Course). Making an effort (further) to give it a name I<br>
call it The Great.<br>
<br>
Great, it passes on (in constant flow). Passing on, it becomes<br>
remote. Having become remote, it returns. Therefore the Tao is<br>
great; Heaven is great; Earth is great; and the (sage) king is also<br>
great. In the universe there are four that are great, and the (sage)<br>
king is one of them.<br>
<br>
Man takes his law from the Earth; the Earth takes its law from<br>
Heaven; Heaven takes its law from the Tao. The law of the Tao is its<br>
being what it is.<br>
</p>

<a id="c26"></a>

## 26

<p style="text-align:center;">
Gravity is the root of lightness; stillness, the ruler of<br>
movement.<br>
<br>
Therefore a wise prince, marching the whole day, does not go far<br>
from his baggage waggons. Although he may have brilliant prospects to<br>
look at, he quietly remains (in his proper place), indifferent to<br>
them. How should the lord of a myriad chariots carry himself lightly<br>
before the kingdom? If he do act lightly, he has lost his root (of<br>
gravity); if he proceed to active movement, he will lose his throne.<br>
</p>

<a id="c27"></a>

## 27

<p style="text-align:center;">
The skilful traveller leaves no traces of his wheels or<br>
footsteps; the skilful speaker says nothing that can be found fault<br>
with or blamed; the skilful reckoner uses no tallies; the skilful<br>
closer needs no bolts or bars, while to open what he has shut will be<br>
impossible; the skilful binder uses no strings or knots, while to<br>
unloose what he has bound will be impossible. In the same way the<br>
sage is always skilful at saving men, and so he does not cast away any<br>
man; he is always skilful at saving things, and so he does not cast<br>
away anything. This is called ‘Hiding the light of his procedure.’<br>
<br>
Therefore the man of skill is a master (to be looked up to) by him<br>
who has not the skill; and he who has not the skill is the helper of<br>
(the reputation of) him who has the skill. If the one did not honour<br>
his master, and the other did not rejoice in his helper, an<br>
(observer), though intelligent, might greatly err about them. This is<br>
called ‘The utmost degree of mystery.’<br>
</p>

<a id="c28"></a>

## 28

<p style="text-align:center;">
Who knows his manhood's strength,<br>
Yet still his female feebleness maintains;<br>
As to one channel flow the many drains,<br>
All come to him, yea, all beneath the sky.<br>
Thus he the constant excellence retains;<br>
The simple child again, free from all stains.<br>
<br>
Who knows how white attracts,<br>
Yet always keeps himself within black's shade,<br>
The pattern of humility displayed,<br>
Displayed in view of all beneath the sky;<br>
He in the unchanging excellence arrayed,<br>
Endless return to man's first state has made.<br>
<br>
Who knows how glory shines,<br>
Yet loves disgrace, nor e'er for it is pale;<br>
Behold his presence in a spacious vale,<br>
To which men come from all beneath the sky.<br>
The unchanging excellence completes its tale;<br>
The simple infant man in him we hail.<br>
<br>
The unwrought material, when divided and distributed, forms<br>
vessels. The sage, when employed, becomes the Head of all the<br>
Officers (of government); and in his greatest regulations he employs<br>
no violent measures.<br>
</p>

<a id="c29"></a>

## 29

<p style="text-align:center;">
If any one should wish to get the kingdom for himself, and to<br>
effect this by what he does, I see that he will not succeed. The<br>
kingdom is a spirit-like thing, and cannot be got by active doing. He<br>
who would so win it destroys it; he who would hold it in his grasp<br>
loses it.<br>
<br>
The course and nature of things is such that<br>
What was in front is now behind;<br>
What warmed anon we freezing find.<br>
Strength is of weakness oft the spoil;<br>
The store in ruins mocks our toil.<br>
<br>
Hence the sage puts away excessive effort, extravagance, and easy<br>
indulgence.<br>
</p>

<a id="c30"></a>

## 30

<p style="text-align:center;">
He who would assist a lord of men in harmony with the Tao will<br>
not assert his mastery in the kingdom by force of arms. Such a course<br>
is sure to meet with its proper return.<br>
<br>
Wherever a host is stationed, briars and thorns spring up. In the<br>
sequence of great armies there are sure to be bad years.<br>
<br>
A skilful (commander) strikes a decisive blow, and stops. He does<br>
not dare (by continuing his operations) to assert and complete his<br>
mastery. He will strike the blow, but will be on his guard against<br>
being vain or boastful or arrogant in consequence of it. He strikes<br>
it as a matter of necessity; he strikes it, but not from a wish for<br>
mastery.<br>
<br>
When things have attained their strong maturity they become old.<br>
This may be said to be not in accordance with the Tao: and what is not<br>
in accordance with it soon comes to an end.<br>
</p>

<a id="c31"></a>

## 31

<p style="text-align:center;">
Now arms, however beautiful, are instruments of evil omen,<br>
hateful, it may be said, to all creatures. Therefore they who have<br>
the Tao do not like to employ them.<br>
<br>
The superior man ordinarily considers the left hand the most<br>
honourable place, but in time of war the right hand. Those sharp<br>
weapons are instruments of evil omen, and not the instruments of the<br>
superior man;—he uses them only on the compulsion of necessity. Calm<br>
and repose are what he prizes; victory (by force of arms) is to him<br>
undesirable. To consider this desirable would be to delight in the<br>
slaughter of men; and he who delights in the slaughter of men cannot<br>
get his will in the kingdom.<br>
<br>
On occasions of festivity to be on the left hand is the prized<br>
position; on occasions of mourning, the right hand. The second in<br>
command of the army has his place on the left; the general commanding<br>
in chief has his on the right;—his place, that is, is assigned to him<br>
as in the rites of mourning. He who has killed multitudes of men<br>
should weep for them with the bitterest grief; and the victor in<br>
battle has his place (rightly) according to those rites.<br>

The Tao, considered as unchanging, has no name.<br>
<br>
Though in its primordial simplicity it may be small, the whole<br>
world dares not deal with (one embodying) it as a minister. If a<br>
feudal prince or the king could guard and hold it, all would<br>
spontaneously submit themselves to him.<br>
<br>
Heaven and Earth (under its guidance) unite together and send down<br>
the sweet dew, which, without the directions of men, reaches equally<br>
everywhere as of its own accord.<br>
<br>
As soon as it proceeds to action, it has a name. When it once has<br>
that name, (men) can know to rest in it. When they know to rest in<br>
it, they can be free from all risk of failure and error.<br>
<br>
The relation of the Tao to all the world is like that of the great<br>
rivers and seas to the streams from the valleys.<br>

He who knows other men is discerning; he who knows himself is<br>
intelligent. He who overcomes others is strong; he who overcomes<br>
himself is mighty. He who is satisfied with his lot is rich; he who<br>
goes on acting with energy has a (firm) will.<br>
<br>
He who does not fail in the requirements of his position, continues<br>
long; he who dies and yet does not perish, has longevity.<br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
All-pervading is the Great Tao! It may be found on the left<br>
hand and on the right.<br>
<br>
All things depend on it for their production, which it gives to<br>
them, not one refusing obedience to it. When its work is<br>
accomplished, it does not claim the name of having done it. It<br>
clothes all things as with a garment, and makes no assumption of being<br>
their lord;—it may be named in the smallest things. All things<br>
return (to their root and disappear), and do not know that it is it<br>
which presides over their doing so;—it may be named in the greatest<br>
things.<br>
<br>
Hence the sage is able (in the same way) to accomplish his great<br>
achievements. It is through his not making himself great that he can<br>
accomplish them.<br>

To him who holds in his hands the Great Image (of the invisible<br>
Tao), the whole world repairs. Men resort to him, and receive no<br>
hurt, but (find) rest, peace, and the feeling of ease.<br>
<br>
Music and dainties will make the passing guest stop (for a time).<br>
But though the Tao as it comes from the mouth, seems insipid and has<br>
no flavour, though it seems not worth being looked at or listened to,<br>
the use of it is inexhaustible.<br>

When one is about to take an inspiration, he is sure to make a<br>

first strengthen him; when he is going to overthrow another, he will<br>
first have raised him up; when he is going to despoil another, he will<br>
first have made gifts to him:—this is called 'Hiding the light (of<br>
his procedure).’<br>

The soft overcomes the hard; and the weak the strong.<br>

The Tao in its regular course does nothing (for the sake of<br>
doing it), and so there is nothing which it does not do.<br>
<br>
If princes and kings were able to maintain it, all things would of<br>
themselves be transformed by them.<br>
<br>
If this transformation became to me an object of desire, I would<br>
express the desire by the nameless simplicity.<br>
<br>
Simplicity without a name<br>
Is free from all external aim.<br>
With no desire, at rest and still,<br>
All things go right as of their will.<br>

(Those who) possessed in highest degree the attributes (of the<br>
Tao) did not (seek) to show them, and therefore they possessed them<br>
(in fullest measure). (Those who) possessed in a lower degree those<br>
attributes (sought how) not to lose them, and therefore they did not<br>
possess them (in fullest measure).<br>
<br>
(Those who) possessed in the highest degree those attributes did<br>
nothing (with a purpose), and had no need to do anything. (Those who)<br>
possessed them in a lower degree were (always) doing, and had need to<br>
be so doing.<br>
<br>
(Those who) possessed the highest benevolence were (always seeking)<br>
to carry it out, and had no need to be doing so. (Those who)<br>
possessed the highest righteousness were (always seeking) to carry it<br>
out, and had need to be so doing.<br>
<br>
(Those who) possessed the highest (sense of) propriety were (always<br>
seeking) to show it, and when men did not respond to it, they bared<br>
the arm and marched up to them.<br>
<br>
Thus it was that when the Tao was lost, its attributes appeared;<br>
when its attributes were lost, benevolence appeared; when benevolence<br>
was lost, righteousness appeared; and when righteousness was lost, the<br>
proprieties appeared.<br>
<br>
Now propriety is the attenuated form of leal-heartedness and good<br>
faith, and is also the commencement of disorder; swift apprehension is<br>
(only) a flower of the Tao, and is the beginning of stupidity.<br>
<br>
Thus it is that the Great man abides by what is solid, and eschews<br>
what is flimsy; dwells with the fruit and not with the flower. It is<br>
thus that he puts away the one and makes choice of the other.<br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
The things which from of old have got the One (the Tao) are—<br>
<br>
Heaven which by it is bright and pure;<br>
Earth rendered thereby firm and sure;<br>
Spirits with powers by it supplied;<br>
Valleys kept full throughout their void<br>
All creatures which through it do live<br>
Princes and kings who from it get<br>
The model which to all they give.<br>
<br>
All these are the results of the One (Tao).<br>
<br>
If heaven were not thus pure, it soon would rend;<br>
If earth were not thus sure, 'twould break and bend;<br>
Without these powers, the spirits soon would fail;<br>
If not so filled, the drought would parch each vale;<br>
Without that life, creatures would pass away;<br>
Princes and kings, without that moral sway,<br>
However grand and high, would all decay.<br>
<br>
Thus it is that dignity finds its (firm) root in its (previous)<br>
meanness, and what is lofty finds its stability in the lowness (from<br>
which it rises). Hence princes and kings call themselves ‘Orphans,’<br>
‘Men of small virtue,’ and as ‘Carriages without a nave.’ Is not this<br>
an acknowledgment that in their considering themselves mean they see<br>
the foundation of their dignity? So it is that in the enumeration of<br>
the different parts of a carriage we do not come on what makes it<br>
answer the ends of a carriage. They do not wish to show themselves<br>
elegant-looking as jade, but (prefer) to be coarse-looking as an<br>
(ordinary) stone.<br>

The movement of the Tao<br>
By contraries proceeds;<br>

Scholars of the highest class, when they hear about the Tao,<br>
earnestly carry it into practice. Scholars of the middle class, when<br>
they have heard about it, seem now to keep it and now to lose it.<br>
Scholars of the lowest class, when they have heard about it, laugh<br>
greatly at it. If it were not (thus) laughed at, it would not be fit<br>
to be the Tao.<br>
<br>
Therefore the sentence-makers have thus expressed themselves:—<br>
<br>
‘The Tao, when brightest seen, seems light to lack;<br>
Who progress in it makes, seems drawing back;<br>
Its even way is like a rugged track.<br>
Its highest virtue from the vale doth rise;<br>
Its greatest beauty seems to offend the eyes;<br>
And he has most whose lot the least supplies.<br>
Its firmest virtue seems but poor and low;<br>
Its solid truth seems change to undergo;<br>
Its largest square doth yet no corner show<br>
A vessel great, it is the slowest made;<br>
Loud is its sound, but never word it said;<br>
A semblance great, the shadow of a shade.’<br>
<br>
The Tao is hidden, and has no name; but it is the Tao which is<br>
skilful at imparting (to all things what they need) and making them<br>
complete.<br>
</p>

<a id="c42"></a>

## 42

<p style="text-align:center;">
The Tao produced One; One produced Two; Two produced Three;<br>
Three produced All things. All things leave behind them the Obscurity<br>
(out of which they have come), and go forward to embrace the<br>
Brightness (into which they have emerged), while they are harmonised<br>
by the Breath of Vacancy.<br>
<br>
What men dislike is to be orphans, to have little virtue, to be as<br>
carriages without naves; and yet these are the designations which<br>
kings and princes use for themselves. So it is that some things are<br>
increased by being diminished, and others are diminished by being<br>
increased.<br>
<br>
What other men (thus) teach, I also teach. The violent and strong<br>
do not die their natural death. I will make this the basis of my<br>

<br>
Therefore the sages got their knowledge without travelling; gave<br>
their (right) names to things without seeing them; and accomplished<br>

nothing (on purpose). Having arrived at this point of non-action,<br>
there is nothing which he does not do.<br>

All things are produced by the Tao, and nourished by its<br>
outflowing operation. They receive their forms according to the<br>
nature of each, and are completed according to the circumstances of<br>
their condition. Therefore all things without exception honour the<br>
Tao, and exalt its outflowing operation.<br>
<br>
This honouring of the Tao and exalting of its operation is not the<br>
result of any ordination, but always a spontaneous tribute.<br>
<br>
Thus it is that the Tao produces (all things), nourishes them,<br>
brings them to their full growth, nurses them, completes them, matures<br>
them, maintains them, and overspreads them.<br>
<br>
It produces them and makes no claim to the possession of them; it<br>
carries them through their processes and does not vaunt its ability in<br>
doing so; it brings them to maturity and exercises no control over<br>
them;—this is called its mysterious operation.<br>

A state may be ruled by (measures of) correction; weapons of<br>
war may be used with crafty dexterity; (but) the kingdom is made one's<br>
own (only) by freedom from action and purpose.<br>
<br>
How do I know that it is so? By these facts:—In the kingdom the<br>
multiplication of prohibitive enactments increases the poverty of the<br>
people; the more implements to add to their profit that the people<br>
have, the greater disorder is there in the state and clan; the more<br>
acts of crafty dexterity that men possess, the more do strange<br>
contrivances appear; the more display there is of legislation, the<br>
more thieves and robbers there are.<br>
<br>
Therefore a sage has said, 'I will do nothing (of purpose), and the<br>
people will be transformed of themselves; I will be fond of keeping<br>
still, and the people will of themselves become correct. I will take<br>
no trouble about it, and the people will of themselves become rich; I<br>
will manifest no ambition, and the people will of themselves attain to<br>

Shall we then dispense with correction? The (method of) correction<br>
shall by a turn become distortion, and the good in it shall by a turn<br>

subsisted for a long time.<br>

Therefore the sage is (like) a square which cuts no one (with its<br>

For regulating the human (in our constitution) and rendering<br>
the (proper) service to the heavenly, there is nothing like<br>
moderation.<br>
<br>
It is only by this moderation that there is effected an early<br>
return (to man's normal state). That early return is what I call the<br>
repeated accumulation of the attributes (of the Tao). With that<br>
repeated accumulation of those attributes, there comes the subjugation<br>
(of every obstacle to such return). Of this subjugation we know not<br>
what shall be the limit; and when one knows not what the limit shall<br>
be, he may be the ruler of a state.<br>
<br>
He who possesses the mother of the state may continue long. His<br>

employed to hurt men. It is not that it could not hurt men, but<br>
neither does the ruling sage hurt them.<br>

What makes a great state is its being (like) a low-lying, down-<br>

states) under heaven.<br>
<br>
(To illustrate from) the case of all females:—the female always<br>
overcomes the male by her stillness. Stillness may be considered (a<br>
sort of) abasement.<br>
<br>
Thus it is that a great state, by condescending to small states,<br>
gains them for itself; and that small states, by abasing themselves to<br>
a great state, win it over to them. In the one case the abasement<br>
leads to gaining adherents, in the other case to procuring favour.<br>
<br>
The great state only wishes to unite men together and nourish them;<br>
a small state only wishes to be received by, and to serve, the other.<br>
Each gets what it desires, but the great state must learn to abase<br>
itself.<br>

the court-yard), such an offering would not be equal to (a lesson of)<br>
this Tao, which one might present on his knees.<br>
<br>
Why was it that the ancients prized this Tao so much? Was it not<br>
because it could be got by seeking for it, and the guilty could escape<br>
(from the stain of their guilt) by it? This is the reason why all<br>
under heaven consider it the most valuable thing.<br>

(It is the way of the Tao) to act without (thinking of) acting;<br>
to conduct affairs without (feeling the) trouble of them; to taste<br>
without discerning any flavour; to consider what is small as great,<br>
and a few as many; and to recompense injury with kindness.<br>
<br>
(The master of it) anticipates things that are difficult while they<br>
are easy, and does things that would become great while they are<br>
small. All difficult things in the world are sure to arise from a<br>
previous state in which they were easy, and all great things from one<br>
in which they were small. Therefore the sage, while he never does<br>
what is great, is able on that account to accomplish the greatest<br>
things.<br>
<br>
He who lightly promises is sure to keep but little faith; he who is<br>
continually thinking things easy is sure to find them difficult.<br>
Therefore the sage sees difficulty even in what seems easy, and so<br>
never has any difficulties.<br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
That which is at rest is easily kept hold of; before a thing<br>
has given indications of its presence, it is easy to take measures<br>
against it; that which is brittle is easily broken; that which is very<br>
small is easily dispersed. Action should be taken before a thing has<br>
made its appearance; order should be secured before disorder has<br>
begun.<br>
<br>
The tree which fills the arms grew from the tiniest sprout; the<br>
tower of nine storeys rose from a (small) heap of earth; the journey<br>
of a thousand li commenced with a single step.<br>
<br>
He who acts (with an ulterior purpose) does harm; he who takes hold<br>
of a thing (in the same way) loses his hold. The sage does not act<br>
(so), and therefore does no harm; he does not lay hold (so), and<br>
therefore does not lose his bold. (But) people in their conduct of<br>
affairs are constantly ruining them when they are on the eve of<br>
success. If they were careful at the end, as (they should be) at the<br>
beginning, they would not so ruin them.<br>
<br>
Therefore the sage desires what (other men) do not desire, and does<br>
not prize things difficult to get; he learns what (other men) do not<br>
learn, and turns back to what the multitude of men have passed by.<br>
Thus he helps the natural development of all things, and does not dare<br>
to act (with an ulterior purpose of his own).<br>

The ancients who showed their skill in practising the Tao did<br>
so, not to enlighten the people, but rather to make them simple and<br>
ignorant.<br>
<br>
The difficulty in governing the people arises from their having<br>
much knowledge. He who (tries to) govern a state by his wisdom is a<br>
scourge to it; while he who does not (try to) do so is a blessing.<br>
<br>
He who knows these two things finds in them also his model and<br>
rule. Ability to know this model and rule constitutes what we call<br>
the mysterious excellence (of a governor). Deep and far-reaching is<br>
such mysterious excellence, showing indeed its possessor as opposite<br>
to others, but leading them to a great conformity to him.<br>

That whereby the rivers and seas are able to receive the homage<br>
and tribute of all the valley streams, is their skill in being lower<br>
than they;—it is thus that they are the kings of them all. So it is<br>
that the sage (ruler), wishing to be above men, puts himself by his<br>
words below them, and, wishing to be before them, places his person<br>
behind them.<br>
<br>
In this way though he has his place above them, men do not feel his<br>
weight, nor though he has his place before them, do they feel it an<br>
injury to them.<br>
<br>
Therefore all in the world delight to exalt him and do not weary of<br>
him. Because he does not strive, no one finds it possible to strive<br>
with him.<br>

All the world says that, while my Tao is great, it yet appears<br>
to be inferior (to other systems of teaching). Now it is just its<br>
greatness that makes it seem to be inferior. If it were like any<br>
other (system), for long would its smallness have been known!<br>
<br>
But I have three precious things which I prize and hold fast. The<br>
first is gentleness; the second is economy; and the third is shrinking<br>
from taking precedence of others.<br>
<br>
With that gentleness I can be bold; with that economy I can be<br>
liberal; shrinking from taking precedence of others, I can become a<br>
vessel of the highest honour. Now-a-days they give up gentleness and<br>
are all for being bold; economy, and are all for being liberal; the<br>
hindmost place, and seek only to be foremost;—(of all which the end<br>
is) death.<br>
<br>
Gentleness is sure to be victorious even in battle, and firmly to<br>
maintain its ground. Heaven will save its possessor, by his (very)<br>
gentleness protecting him.<br>

Assumes no martial port;<br>

He whose hests men most fulfil<br>

A master of the art of war has said, 'I do not dare to be the<br>
host (to commence the war); I prefer to be the guest (to act on the<br>
defensive). I do not dare to advance an inch; I prefer to retire a<br>
foot.' This is called marshalling the ranks where there are no ranks;<br>
baring the arms (to fight) where there are no arms to bare; grasping<br>
the weapon where there is no weapon to grasp; advancing against the<br>
enemy where there is no enemy.<br>
<br>
There is no calamity greater than lightly engaging in war. To do<br>
that is near losing (the gentleness) which is so precious. Thus it is<br>
that when opposing weapons are (actually) crossed, he who deplores<br>
(the situation) conquers.<br>

My words are very easy to know, and very easy to practise; but<br>
there is no one in the world who is able to know and able to practise<br>
them.<br>
<br>
There is an originating and all-comprehending (principle) in my<br>
words, and an authoritative law for the things (which I enforce). It<br>
is because they do not know these, that men do not know me.<br>
<br>
They who know me are few, and I am on that account (the more) to be<br>
prized. It is thus that the sage wears (a poor garb of) hair cloth,<br>
while he carries his (signet of) jade in his bosom.<br>

To know and yet (think) we do not know is the highest<br>
(attainment); not to know (and yet think) we do know is a disease.<br>
<br>
It is simply by being pained at (the thought of) having this<br>
disease that we are preserved from it. The sage has not the disease.<br>
He knows the pain that would be inseparable from it, and therefore he<br>
does not have it.<br>

When the people do not fear what they ought to fear, that which<br>
is their great dread will come on them.<br>
<br>
Let them not thoughtlessly indulge themselves in their ordinary<br>
life; let them not act as if weary of what that life depends on.<br>
<br>
It is by avoiding such indulgence that such weariness does not<br>
arise.<br>
<br>
Therefore the sage knows (these things) of himself, but does not<br>
parade (his knowledge); loves, but does not (appear to set a) value<br>
on, himself. And thus he puts the latter alternative away and makes<br>
choice of the former.<br>

He whose boldness appears in his daring (to do wrong, in<br>
defiance of the laws) is put to death; he whose boldness appears in<br>
his not daring (to do so) lives on. Of these two cases the one<br>
appears to be advantageous, and the other to be injurious. But<br>
<br>
When Heaven's anger smites a man,<br>
Who the cause shall truly scan?<br>
<br>
On this account the sage feels a difficulty (as to what to do in the<br>
former case).<br>
<br>
It is the way of Heaven not to strive, and yet it skilfully<br>
overcomes; not to speak, and yet it is skilful in (obtaining a reply;<br>
does not call, and yet men come to it of themselves. Its<br>
demonstrations are quiet, and yet its plans are skilful and effective.<br>
The meshes of the net of Heaven are large; far apart, but letting<br>
nothing escape.<br>

The people do not fear death; to what purpose is it to (try to)<br>
frighten them with death? If the people were always in awe of death,<br>
and I could always seize those who do wrong, and put them to death,<br>
who would dare to do wrong?<br>
<br>
There is always One who presides over the infliction death. He who<br>
would inflict death in the room of him who so presides over it may be<br>
described as hewing wood instead of a great carpenter. Seldom is it<br>
that he who undertakes the hewing, instead of the great carpenter,<br>
does not cut his own hands!</p>

The people suffer from famine because of the multitude of taxes<br>
consumed by their superiors. It is through this that they suffer<br>
famine.<br>
<br>
The people are difficult to govern because of the (excessive)<br>
agency of their superiors (in governing them). It is through this<br>
that they are difficult to govern.<br>
<br>
The people make light of dying because of the greatness of their<br>
labours in seeking for the means of living. It is this which makes<br>
them think light of dying. Thus it is that to leave the subject of<br>
living altogether out of view is better than to set a high value on<br>
it.<br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
Man at his birth is supple and weak; at his death, firm and<br>
strong. (So it is with) all things. Trees and plants, in their early<br>
growth, are soft and brittle; at their death, dry and withered.<br>
<br>
Thus it is that firmness and strength are the concomitants of<br>
death; softness and weakness, the concomitants of life.<br>
<br>
Hence he who (relies on) the strength of his forces does not<br>
conquer; and a tree which is strong will fill the out-stretched arms,<br>
(and thereby invites the feller.)<br>
<br>
Therefore the place of what is firm and strong is below, and that<br>
of what is soft and weak is above.<br>

May not the Way (or Tao) of Heaven be compared to the (method<br>
<br>
of) bending a bow? The (part of the bow) which was high is brought<br>
low, and what was low is raised up. (So Heaven) diminishes where<br>
there is superabundance, and supplements where there is deficiency.<br>
<br>
It is the Way of Heaven to diminish superabundance, and to<br>
supplement deficiency. It is not so with the way of man. He takes<br>
away from those who have not enough to add to his own superabundance.<br>
<br>
Who can take his own superabundance and therewith serve all under<br>
heaven? Only he who is in possession of the Tao!<br>
<br>
Therefore the (ruling) sage acts without claiming the results as<br>
his; he achieves his merit and does not rest (arrogantly) in it:—he<br>
does not wish to display his superiority.<br>
</p>

<a id="c78"></a>

## 78

<p style="text-align:center;">
There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water,<br>
and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing<br>
that can take precedence of it;—for there is nothing (so effectual)<br>
for which it can be changed.<br>
<br>
Every one in the world knows that the soft overcomes the hard, and<br>
the weak the strong, but no one is able to carry it out in practice.<br>
<br>
Therefore a sage has said,<br>
‘He who accepts his state's reproach,<br>
Is hailed therefore its altars' lord;<br>
To him who bears men's direful woes<br>
They all the name of King accord.’<br>
<br>
Words that are strictly true seem to be paradoxical.<br>

When a reconciliation is effected (between two parties) after a<br>
great animosity, there is sure to be a grudge remaining (in the mind<br>
of the one who was wrong). And how can this be beneficial (to the<br>
other)?<br>
<br>
Therefore (to guard against this), the sage keeps the left-hand<br>
portion of the record of the engagement, and does not insist on the<br>
(speedy) fulfilment of it by the other party. (So), he who has the<br>
attributes (of the Tao) regards (only) the conditions of the<br>
engagement, while he who has not those attributes regards only the<br>
conditions favourable to himself.<br>
<br>
In the Way of Heaven, there is no partiality of love; it is always<br>
on the side of the good man.<br>

In a little state with a small population, I would so order it,<br>
that, though there were individuals with the abilities of ten or a<br>
hundred men, there should be no employment of them; I would make the<br>
people, while looking on death as a grievous thing, yet not remove<br>
elsewhere (to avoid it).<br>
<br>
Though they had boats and carriages, they should have no occasion<br>
to ride in them; though they had buff coats and sharp weapons, they<br>
should have no occasion to don or use them.<br>
<br>
I would make the people return to the use of knotted cords (instead<br>
of the written characters).<br>
<br>
They should think their (coarse) food sweet; their (plain) clothes<br>
beautiful; their (poor) dwellings places of rest; and their common<br>
(simple) ways sources of enjoyment.<br>
<br>
There should be a neighbouring state within sight, and the voices<br>
of the fowls and dogs should be heard all the way from it to us, but I<br>
would make the people to old age, even to death, not have any<br>
intercourse with it.<br>

Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere. Those<br>
who are skilled (in the Tao) do not dispute (about it); the<br>
disputatious are not skilled in it. Those who know (the Tao) are not<br>
extensively learned; the extensively learned do not know it.<br>
<br>
The sage does not accumulate (for himself). The more that he<br>
expends for others, the more does he possess of his own; the more that<br>
he gives to others, the more does he have himself.<br>
<br>
With all the sharpness of the Way of Heaven, it injures not; with<br>
all the doing in the way of the sage he does not strive.<br>
