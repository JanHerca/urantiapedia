The work blends Taoism with the art of statecraft, applying concepts such as 'doing without doing' to the battlefield. Traditionally written during the Spring and Autumn period (722-481 BCE), others date it, based on historical and internal evidence, to the Warring States Period (403-221 BCE). Sun Tzu is traditionally identified with an historical figure who lived from 544-496 BCE, a general of the King of Wu. Since it first came to the attention of Westerners in the 19th century, the Art of War has influenced leaders from Napoleon to Norman Schwarzkopf. Mao tse Tung attributed it as a source of his thinking on guerilla warfare. The work is considered a masterpiece of military theory.Production notes: This is the classic Giles translation of the work, scanned from a reprint of the first edition. The Chinese text of the book is displayed using image files. Other Chinese text in the work is indicated by a hash sign (#). The Chinese concordance is omitted, but all of the rest of the book is presented intact. John Bruno Hare, October 12, 2008.
