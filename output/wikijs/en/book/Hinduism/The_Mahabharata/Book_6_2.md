## SECTION XI
—————

(_Bhumi Parva_)

“Dhritarashtra said,—‘Thou hast, O Sanjaya, duly described Jamvukhanda to me. Tell me now its dimensions and extent truly. Tell me also, O Sanjaya, of the extent of the ocean of Sakadwipa, and Kusadwipa, of Salmalidwipa and Kraunchadwipa, truly and without leaving anything and tell me also, O son of Gavalgani, of _Rahu_ and _Soma_ and _Surya_.’

“Sanjaya said,—‘There are, O king, many islands, over which the Earth extended. I will describe to thee, however, only seven islands, and the moon, and the sun, and the planet (_Rahu_), also. The _Jamvu_ mountain, O king, extends over full eighteen thousand and six hundred _Yojanas_. The extent of the salt ocean is said to be twice this. That ocean is covered with many kingdoms, and is adorned with gems and corals. It is, besides, decked with many mountains that are variegated with metals of diverse kinds. Thickly peopled by _Siddhas_ and _Charanas_, the ocean is circular in form.

“I will now tell thee truly of Sakadwipa, O Bharata. Listen to me, O son of Kuru's race, as I describe it to thee duly. That island, O ruler of men, is of twice the extent of Jamvudwipa. And the ocean also, O great king, is of twice the extent of that island. Indeed, O best of the Bharatas, Sakadwipa is surrounded on all sides by the ocean. The kingdoms there are full of righteousness, and the men there never die. How can famine take place there? The people are all endued with forgiveness and great energy. I have now, O bull of Bharata's race, given thee duly a brief description of Sakadwipa. What else, O king, dost thou wish to hear?'” [^65]

<span id="p25"><sup><small>[ p. 25 ]</small></sup></span>

“Dhritarashtra said,—‘Thou hast given me, O Sanjaya, a description of Sakadwipa in brief. O thou that art possessed of great wisdom, tell me now everything in detail truly.’

“Sanjaya said,—‘In that island, O king, there are seven mountains that are decked with jewels and that are mines of gems, precious stones. There are many rivers also in that island. Listen to me as I recount their names. Everything there, O king, is excellent and delightful, The first of these mountains is called Meru. It is the abode of the gods, _Rishis_, and _Gandharvas_. The next mountain, O king, is called Malaya stretching towards the east. It is there that the clouds are generated and it is thence that they disperse on all sides. The next, O thou of Kuru's race, is the large mountain called Jaladhara. [^66] Thence Indra daily taketh water of the best quality. It is from that water that we get showers in the season of rains, O ruler of men. Next cometh the high mountain called Raivataka, over which, in the firmament, hath been permanently placed the constellation called _Revati_. This arrangement hath been made by the Grandsire himself. On the north of this, O great king, is the large mountain called Syama. It hath the splendour of newly-risen clouds, is very high, beautiful and of bright body. And since the hue of those mountains is dark, the people residing there are all dark in complexion, O king.’

“Dhritarashtra said,—‘A great doubt ariseth in my mind, O Sanjaya, from what thou hast said. Why, O _Suta's_ son, would the people there be of dark complexion?’

“Sanjaya said,—‘O great king, in all islands, O son of Kuru's race, men may be found that are fair, and those that are dark, and those also that are produced by a union of the fair and the dark races. But because the people there are all dark, therefore is that mountain called the Dark Mountain. After this, O chief of the Kurus, is the large mountain called Durgasaila. And then cometh the mountain called Kesari. The breezes that blow from that mountain are all charged with (odoriferous) effluvia. The measure of each of these mountains is double that of the one mentioned immediately before. O thou of Kuru's race, it hath been said by the wise that there are seven _Varshas_ in that island. The _Varsha_ of Meru is called Mahakasa; that of the water-giving (Malaya) is called Kumudottara. The _Varsha_ of Jaladhara is called Sukumara: while that of Raivatak is called Kaumara; and of Syama, Manikanchana. The _Varsha_ of Kesara is called Mandaki, and that called after the next mountain is called Mahapuman. In the midst of that island is a large tree called _Saka_. In height and breadth the measure of that tree is equal to that of the _Jamvu_ tree in Jamvudwipa. And the people there always adore that tree. There in that island are, many delightful provinces where Siva is worshipped, and thither repair the _Siddhas_, the _Charanas_, and the celestials. The people there, O king, are virtuous, and all the four orders, O Bharata, are devoted to <span id="p26"><sup><small>[ p. 26 ]</small></sup></span> their respective occupation. No instance of theft can be seen there. Freed from decrepitude and death and gifted with long life, the people there, O king, grow like rivers during the season of rains. The rivers there are full of sacred water, and Ganga herself, distributed as she hath been into various currents, is there, Sukumari, and Kumari, and Seta, and Keveraka, and Mahanadi, O Kauravya, and the river Manijala, and Chakshus, and the river Vardhanika, O thou best of the Bharatas,—these and many other rivers by thousands and hundreds, all full of sacred water, are there, O perpetuator of Kuru's race, from which Vasava draweth water for showering it as rain. It is impossible to recount the names and lengths of rivers. All of them are foremost of rivers and sin-cleansing. As heard by all men there, in that island of Saka, are four sacred provinces. They are the Mrigas, the Masakas, the Manasas, and the Mandagas. The Mrigas for the most part are Brahmanas devoted to the occupations of their order. Amongst the Masakas are virtuous Kshatriyas granting (unto Brahmanas) every wish (entertained by them). The Manasas, O king, live by following the duties of the Vaisya order. Having every wish of theirs gratified, they are also brave and firmly devoted to virtue and profit. The Mandagas are all brave Sudras of virtuous behaviour. In these provinces, O monarch, there is no king, no punishment, no person that deserves to be punished. Conversant with the dictates of duty they are all engaged in the practice of their respective duties and protect one another. This much is capable of being said of the island called Saka. This much also should be listened to about that island endued with great energy.” [^67]



## SECTION XII

“Sanjaya said, ‘O Kauravya, that which is heard about the islands in the north, I will recount to thee, O Great king. Listen to me now. (Thither in the north) is the ocean whose waters are clarified butter. Then is the ocean whose waters are curds. Next cometh the ocean whose waters are wine, and then is another ocean of water. The islands, O king, are double in area of one another as they proceed further and further towards the north. And they are surrounded, O king, by these oceans. [^68] In the island that is in the middle, there is a large mountain called Goura made of red arsenic; on <span id="p27"><sup><small>[ p. 27 ]</small></sup></span> the western island, O king, is the mountain Krishna that is the favourite (abode) of Narayana. There Kesava guardeth celestial gems (in profusion), and thence, inclined to grace, he bestoweth happiness on creatures. Along with the kingdoms there, O king, the (celestial) clump of _Kusa_ grass in Kusadwipa, and the _Salmali_ tree in the island of Salmalika, are adored. In the Krauncha island also, the mountain called Maha-krauncha that is a mine of all kinds of gems is, O king, always adored by all the four orders of men. (There), O monarch, is the mountain called Gomanta that is huge and consists of all kinds of metals, and whereon always resideth, mingling with those that have been emancipated, the puissant Narayana, otherwise called Hari, graced with prosperity and possessed of eyes like lotus leaves. In Kusadwipa, O king of kings, there is another mountain variegated with corals and called after the name of that island itself. This mountain is inaccessible and made of gold. Possessed of great splendour, O Kauravya, there is a third mountain there that is called Sumida. The sixth is called Harigiri. These are the six principal mountains. The intervening spaces between one another of these six mountains increaseth in the ratio of one to two as they proceed further and further towards the north. The first _Varsha_ is called Audhido; the second is Venumandala; the third is called Suratha; the fourth is known by the name of Kamvala; the fifth _Varsha_ is called Dhritimat; and the sixth is named Prabhakara; the seventh _Varsha_ is called Kapila. These are the seven successive Varshas. In these, gods and _Gandharvas_, and other creatures of the universe, sport and take delight. In these _Varshas_ the inhabitants never die. There, O king, are no robbers, nor any tribes of _Mlecchas_. All the residents are almost white in complexion, and very delicate, O king.

“'As regards the rest of the islands, O ruler of men, I will recount all that hath been heard by me. Listen, O monarch, with an attentive mind. In the Krauncha island, O great king, there is a large mountain called Krauncha. Next to Krauncha is Vamanaka; and next to Vamanaka is Andhakara. And next to Andhakara, [^69] O king, is that excellent of mountains called Mainaka. After Mainaka, O monarch, is that best of mountains called Govinda; and after Govinda, O king, is the mountain called Nivida. O multiplier of thy race, the intervening spaces between one another of these mountains increaseth in the ratio of one to two. I will now tell thee the countries that lie there. Listen to me as I speak of them. The region near Krauncha is called Kusala; that near Vamanaka is Manonuga. The region next to Manonuga, O perpetuator of Kuru's race, is called Ushna. After Ushna is Pravaraka; and after Pravaraka is Andhakaraka. The country after Andhakaraka is named Munidesa. After Munidesa the region is called Dundubhiswana teeming with _Siddhas_ and _Charanas_. The people are almost white in complexion, O king. All these countries, O monarch, are the habitations of gods and Gandharvas. In <span id="p28"><sup><small>[ p. 28 ]</small></sup></span> (the island of) Pushkara is a mountain called Pushkara that abounds with jewels and gems. There always dwelleth the divine Prajapati himself. Him all the gods and great Rishis always adore with gratifying words and worship reverently, O king. Diverse gems from Jamvudwipa are used there. In all these islands, O king, Brahmacharyya, truth, and self-control of the dwellers, as also their health and periods of life, are in the ratio of one to two as the islands are more and more remote (northwards). O king, the land in those islands, O Bharata, comprises but one country, for that is said to be one country in which one religion is met with. The Supreme Prajapati himself, upraising the rod of chastisement, always dwelleth there, protecting those islands. He, O monarch, is the king. He is their source of bliss. He is the father, and he is the grand-father. He it is, O best of men, that protecteth all creatures there, mobile or immobile. Cooked food, O Kauravya, cometh there of itself and the creatures eat it daily. O mighty-armed one. After these regions is seen a habitation of the name of Sama. It is of a starry-shape having four corners, and it hath, O king, thirty-three mandalas. There dwell, O Kauravya, four princely elephants adored by all. [^70] They are, O best of the Bharatas, Vamana, and Airavata, and another, and also Supratika. [^71] O king, with rent cheeks and mouth, I do not venture to calculate the proportions of these four elephants. [^72] Their length, breadth and thickness have for ever remained unascertained. There in those regions, O king, winds blow irregularly from all directions. [^73] These are seized by those elephants with the tips of their trunks which are of the complexion of the lotus and endued with great splendour and capable of drawing up everything in their way. And soon enough after seizing them they then always let them out. The winds, O king, thus let out by those respiring elephants, come over the Earth and in consequence thereof creatures draw breath and live.’

“Dhritarashtra said,—‘Thou hast, O Sanjaya, told me everything about the first subject very elaborately. Thou hast also indicated the positions of the islands. ‘Tell now, O Sanjaya, about what remains.’

“Sanjaya said,—‘Indeed, O great king, the islands have all been described to thee. Listen now to what I truly say about the heavenly bodies and about Swarbhanu, O chief of the Kauravas, as regards its dimensions. It is heard, O king, that the planet Swarbhanu is globular. Its diameter is twelve thousand _Yojanas_, and its circumference, because <span id="p29"><sup><small>[ p. 29 ]</small></sup></span> it is very large, is forty-two thousand _Yojanas_, O sinless one, [^74] as said by the learned of olden times. The diameter of the moon, O king, is stated to be eleven thousand _Yojanas_. Its circumference, O chief of the Kurus, is stated to be thirty-eight thousand nine hundred _Yojanas_ of the illustrious planet of cool rays. It hath been heard that the diameter of the beneficent, fast going and light-giving Sun, O thou of Kuru's race, is ten thousand _Yojanas_, and his circumference, O king, is thirty-five thousand eight hundred miles, in consequence of his largeness, O sinless one. These are the dimensions reckoned here, O Bharata, of Arka. The planet Rahu, in consequence of his greater bulk, envelops both the Sun and the Moon in due times. I tell thee this in brief. With the eye of science, O great king, I have now told thee all that thou hadst asked. Let peace be thine. I have now told thee about the construction of the universe as indicated in the _Shastras_. Therefore, O Kauravya, pacify thy son Duryodhana. [^75]’

“Having listened to this charming _Bhumi Parva_, O chief of the Bharatas, a Kshatriya becometh endued with prosperity, obtaineth fruition of all his desires, and winneth the approbation of the righteous. [^76] The king who listeneth to this on days of the full-moon or the new-moon, carefully observing vows all the while, hath the period of his life, his fame and energy, all enhanced. His (deceased) sires and grandsires become gratified. Thou hast now heard of all the merits that flow from this _Varsha_ of Bharata where we now are!'”

## Footnotes

[^65]: 24:1 The Bombay text reads _Kimanyat Kathayami te_. The Bengal reading is _Kimanyat srotumicchasi_.

[^66]: 25:1 The Bombay text reads _Tatas parena_; the Bengal reading is _Tatas purvena_. I adopt the former.

[^67]: 26:1 Probably this mythical account of Sakadwipa embodies some vague tradition current in ancient India of some republic in Eastern Asia or Oceanic Asia (further east in the Pacific). Accustomed as the Hindus were to kingly form of government, a government without a king, would strike them exactly in the way described in the last two slokas.

[^68]: 26:2 The second line of the 3rd sloka is read variously. The Bombay edition incorrectly reads ‘_Parvataccha_’ etc. etc.,; the Bengal reading is _evameva_ etc. etc. The Bengal reading is better, although the true reading, I apprehend, is _Evametais_ &c., &c.

[^69]: 27:1 _Vamanaka_ and _Vamana_ are the same words the final _ka_ being a suffix causing no difference of meaning. So _Andhakaraka_ and _Andhakara_ are the same.

[^70]: 28:1 Dig-gaja, _i.e._ an elephant supporting the globe. There are four such in Hindu mythology or ten according to some accounts.

[^71]: 28:2 _i.e._, with the juice trickling down from their cheeks and mouth. In the season of rut, a peculiar kind of juice issues from several parts of an elephant's body. It is believed to be the temporal-juice. The stronger and fierce the elephant, the greater the quantity of the juice that issues out its body.

[^72]: 28:3 Tasya (singular of Tad) and sa (masculine singular of Tad) both refer to the four elephants, Gaja-chatushtaya in singular.

[^73]: 28:4 Asamyadha lit. “Unbound” or “unrestrained,” _i.e._ freely or irregularly.

[^74]: 29:1 It is a remarkable fact that the ratio between the diameter and the circumference of a circle was roughly known to the ancient Hindus. The circumference is nearly, as stated here, three times and a half of the diameter. The next ratio, of course, is slightly less, being three and one-seventh.

[^75]: 29:2 The first word of this sloka is variously read. ‘_Yathadishtam_’ is the Bengal reading, while the Bombay reading ‘_Yathoddishtam_.’ If the latter reading were adopted, the meaning would be as indicated (in the Sastras). The second line literally rendered, is “pacify thy son Duryodhana.” But how Dhritarashtra is to pacify his son having listened to the geographical digression, is not easy to see.

[^76]: 29:3 For _Sadhusattamas_ of the Bengal texts, the Bombay edition reads _Sadhusammatas_. I adopt the last.
